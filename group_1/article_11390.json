      "content": "Dampen the hair so that it’s easier to cut. Use a spray bottle to spray the hair so that it’s damp but not dripping. If you don’t have a spray bottle, wet your hair brush and brush through all of the hair so that the moisture is evenly distributed. [1] X Research source Use any sort of hair brush, though you may have to wet it several times to get all of the hair damp. If the hair is dripping, blot it with a towel so that it’s not as wet. You can also wash your hair beforehand and cut it while it's still wet."

      "content": "Part your hair how you normally part it. This is important for ensuring that you get an accurate cut that works with how you wear your hair. Whether you part your hair on the left, on the right, or down the middle, part it as you would whenever you're doing your hair with a comb or hair brush."

      "title": "Separate the hair into 3 sections.",
      "content": "Separate the hair into 3 sections. Use the end of a rat-tail comb to divide your hair into vertical thirds. To create the far left section, run the end of the comb vertically down your head starting at the back of the left ear. Divide the other two-thirds of the hair into two by running the end of the comb vertically down the head starting at the back of the right ear. [3] X Research source This creates a left side, back side, and right side. If the hair is parted on one side, the left or right side will have more hair than the other side, which is okay. Use hair clips to keep each section of hair in place."

      "title": "Part the back section of hair right down the middle.",
      "content": "Part the back section of hair right down the middle. Using the tip of a fine tooth comb, create a line right down the middle of the back section of hair. Use the comb to make the line distinguishable by combing the hair on the left of the line to the left and the hair to the right of the line to the right. [4] X Research source If the hair is long enough, pull the sections to the front of the shoulders so they’re not in the way. This line is just for creating a triangle-shaped section of hair."

      "content": "Take out a triangle-shaped section of hair at your neckline. Use the fine tooth comb to separate a portion of hair, roughly 2 in (5.1 cm) tall, at the base of the neckline in the shape of a triangle. Comb this section out and make sure that the other sections are pulled to the side. [5] X Research source Orient the triangle with a point facing directly upwards, as if the triangle is sitting flat on the ground. The triangle should be at the bottom (also known as the base) of your neck. The triangle section is important as it will be the guiding hair cut length used for the rest of the head."

      "content": "Make the first horizontal cut at least 1 in (2.5 cm) from the hairline. Pay attention to where the hair roots are, and decide where you’re going to cut the length. Use the comb to make sure you've gathered all the strands of hair, and use hair-cutting shears or sharp scissors to make a horizontal cut. Continue cutting a clean line across the entire triangle section. [6] X Research source Don't cut your hair so that it's shorter than your hairline at your neck. You're only cutting the triangle section at this point. Cut the hair in small sections, using the fine tooth comb so that you see the hair you’ve already cut that’s in a straight line, as well as the hair that’s longer and hasn’t been cut yet."

Use a comb to gather sections of hair from the back, including the line you created going down the middle for the triangle section. Hold the hair in between your fingers and pull each strand down and slightly away from the head. Cut the rest of the back section of hair using the cut hair as a guide to cut the new hair along the same line. [7] X Research source Remember to hold the hair roughly 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) away from the head (pulling it outwards and down) so that you create soft layers and an even cut with the hair-cutting shears. Holding the hair outwards like this is what creates the layers while you're cutting. You're only cutting the back section of the hair (both the left and right sections are still separated and waiting to be cut)."

If you're using a hair dryer, dry the bottom layer of your hair first, ending with the top layer for a fuller look.
