      "content": "Get a sharps container from a doctor or pharmacy for storing needles safely. Sharps containers have a solid plastic body so there isn’t a risk of them poking through the sides. Contact your local pharmacy or doctor’s office to see if they have sharps containers available. Some doctors may provide a sharps container for free while others will have them for sale. [1] X Research source Sharps containers usually cost around $10–15 USD."

      "content": "Put needles in an empty laundry detergent bottle or milk jug for a DIY sharps container. Choose a detergent bottle that’s opaque and has thick plastic so the needles don’t poke out from the sides. An empty plastic milk jug will also work. Place a piece of tape on the outside of the bottle and label it “Sharps” in large letters so other people don’t confuse it with actual detergent. Make sure the detergent bottle has a lid to make sure none of your insulin needles are exposed. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Don’t use a clear container for disposing sharps since children or drug users may try to open the bottle if they see syringes or needles. You can also use a metal or plastic coffee container for your needles."

      "content": "Place insulin needles in the container as soon as you use them. Don’t leave used needles lying around since they could hurt other people. Right after your injection, open the lid on the sharps container you’re using and drop the needle inside. Immediately seal the container so the needles can’t spill out. When you’re finished, put the container on a high shelf out of children’s reach. [3] X Research source You do not need to clip the needles before you put them in your sharps container."

      "title": "Tape the container closed once it’s ¾ full.",
      "content": "Tape the container closed once it’s ¾ full. Look inside your container every time you put another needle inside of it to check how full it is. Once the needles are ¾ to the top of the container, secure the lid with pieces of duct tape so it can’t come undone. Place the container in a safe place, such as a high shelf, until you’re able to throw it away properly. [4] X Research source Some sharps containers you purchase from pharmacies will automatically stay closed as soon as they’re full. If you have trouble how full your container is, draw a line on the outside of the container with a marker so you know where the maximum fill line is. Hold the container up to a light so you can see how many needles you have inside."

      "content": "Check with waste management to see if sharps containers can go in the trash. Contact your city’s waste management service and ask them if sharps are allowed in your normal trash disposal. If they are, place the sharps container in 1–2 plastic bags and tie them tightly so the container doesn’t spill out. Put the container in your trash can or a dumpster so waste management can dispose of it. Some locations do not allow you to mix sharps containers with your regular trash."
