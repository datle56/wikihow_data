      "content": "Think of key personality traits you consider important in a lifelong partner. You might be used to saying \"I want to find the woman of my dreams\" but you need to know what this means for you, such as what her personality is, what she likes/dislikes or even looks like. Some important qualities might be loyalty, generosity, fun-loving, outgoing, focused, and so forth. [1] X Research source Which of your own personality traits do you want matched? Think of the values you'd like this person to hold. Do you want her to have similar values to your own? Or, are you okay with her having quite different ones from you? Consider your faith or lack of it. Does your ideal woman need to be of the same faith? Also consider family values––what are yours and in what way must hers match those? What interests would you like this person to have? Does she have to have the same interests as you? Or would you prefer she had completely different interests, or a mixture of both? Is it enough that she's willing to learn about your interests? Be frank with yourself about appearance. How important a factor is this? Might it be holding you back from finding someone with an amazing personality? [2] X Research source Be a devil's advocate. What sort of things do you not want in your ideal partner? What would you be willing and not willing to compromise about? [3] X Research source"

      "content": "When you focus on a “dream” person, you're thinking of someone that may not exist. It is very hard for a person to measure up to an ideal or a creation of perfection in the mind. Having a dream notion of another human being can cause you to be blind to their faults initially, only to leave you extremely disappointed later when these become apparent because the dream is shattered. A realistic approach is to accept that no person is perfect and that it's important to recognize and understand the flawed sides of a person as much as seeing all the things you wish to see. [4] X Research source Realize that any person you date is a mixture of amazing traits and flaws. You are no different either. You'll never find a woman to date if you expect her to be 100 percent perfect. No such person exists. Learn to overlook imperfections that don't have a major impact on the relationship. If there are things that will have a major impact, don't be blind to them and realize early on that they could be deal breakers. Looking for perfection may mean that you are too picky and won't ever find the woman who meets your expectations. Realize that it takes time to get to know the real person underneath. If you have shallow ideals, you may never really get to know the amazing qualities of the woman unless you're prepared to take the time to get to know her."

[6] X Research source To attract a person, be attractive yourself. Most importantly, you need to understand yourself well, knowing your own identity and values. [7] X Research source If you don't know these things, you will have a hard time defining boundaries in your relationship and you may fail to connect well, be afraid of commitment or not notice when you over-rely on the other person to define you. What are your values and beliefs? Do you have these sorted out for yourself? Do you know what your life's goals are and what matters to you? Are you aware of your flaws? What are you doing to address them or manage around them? Do you have an issue with perfection? If you consider yourself to be perfect, another person will find it hard to meet that, ever. Be willing to compromise and to see your flaws. Are you truly ready for a long-term relationship yet? You need to know this in order to be serious about your pursuit. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source [v161898_b01]. 19 August 2021. If you're sporty and you're looking for a woman who is also sporty, spend time doing that sport and keeping your eyes open.

When you’re finding love, it's that lucky moment of crossing paths and realizing instantaneously that this is someone you'd like to get to know better that could happen at anytime.

It will take time to learn more about her, to get to know her personality and preferences, to find out just how compatible the two of you are. This means being realistic about setting aside the time to do this and not rushing the relationship or your judgment. Make time for each other. Do fun things together to ensure that you enjoy one another's company. [12] X Research source Talk about values, beliefs and things you both care about. These are important aspects for both of you."

[13] X Research source In turn, share your own likes and dislikes too. This can be an area of deal-breaking, so be aware of this at all times. If you start talking about things that bore her to tears or bother her, tuck this information away for later reflection. Is this a problem for you or is it something you can live with?"
