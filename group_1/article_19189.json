[1] X Trustworthy Source International DOI Foundation (IDF) Registry of published versions of academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. Go to source The easiest way to get over the anxiety produced from an embarrassing moment is thus to simply laugh at yourself and the situation that just occurred. This way, it's easier for others to laugh with you than at you. The fact that you even get embarrassed is a great way to connect you to other people, as it’s something almost everyone has likely experienced at some point in their life. [2] X Research source Stocks, E. L., Lishner, D. A., Waits, B. L., &amp; Downum, E. M. (2011). I’m Embarrassed for You: The Effect of Valuing and Perspective Taking on Empathic Embarrassment and Empathic Concern. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 41(1), 1–26. If you are willing to laugh at yourself, an embarrassing moment can serve as a great jumping off point to sparking interesting conversations or making new friends. You can also try making the situation funny. If you approach the situation with good humor, it will become less embarrassing and more like a light joke. For example, if you fall off your chair, say something like, \"I do all my own stunts!\""

      "content": "Admit you were embarrassed. When an embarrassing moment happens, it's best to accept it. You can't go back in time, so what's the point of being in total denial? Admit to yourself – and others if appropriate – that you had an embarrassing moment. [3] X Expert Source Samantha Fox, MS, LMFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 19 January 2021. This can be a great way to start conversations with others, as they will likely have embarrassing moments to share with you as well. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Explain why the moment occurred. There may be circumstances that cause your embarrassing moment which are understandable and explainable. For example, you may have called someone by the wrong name all day. But when you reflect on the incident, you realize that you’ve been thinking about another person quite a bit. [5] X Research source For example, you could say, “I’m sorry I’ve been calling you Shawn. I have been thinking about a good friend of mine who is going through a rough time, and I’m a little distracted.”"

      "content": "Ask others to help you. Perhaps you spilled coffee all over some important papers at a meeting, or you tripped and dropped a stack of books on your principal’s foot. Ask the other person to help you pick up your things. This will redirect the situation away from your embarrassment to the task at hand. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take deep breaths. After an embarrassing moment has happened anxiety will tend to spike in most people. Blood rushes to the face, heart rate and blood pressure increase, shortness of breath occurs, and higher levels of perspiration starts to collect throughout much of the body.

Go to source To calm yourself down, take some deep breaths and reassess the situation. This will help with the physiological response that you experience (blushing, for example). It will also help you avoid saying or doing anything else that could add to the embarrassment factor. Take a minute to calm down, and then proceed."

      "title": "Don't make a spectacle of yourself.",
      "content": "Don't make a spectacle of yourself. The worst thing to do when an embarrassing moment happens is to make a huge scene about it. When an embarrassing moment happens, try to avoid screaming, shouting, running away on the brink of tears, or flat-out crying in public. The bigger a scene you make out of the moment, the more the moment will be engraved into people's minds. Keep in mind that it is just another moment that will quickly pass. If your reaction is mild, people are more likely to forget that anything ever happened."

      "title": "Tell yourself that this moment wasn’t very embarrassing.",
      "content": "Tell yourself that this moment wasn’t very embarrassing. You have to face the fact that something bad has just happened to you. But, remember, it's only embarrassing if you tell yourself it is. If you get over it and tell yourself it isn't, you won't feel embarrassed. It’s likely the case that you are much more critical of yourself than anyone else. Psychologists have found that in cases of anxiety or embarrassment, people tend to become overly preoccupied with themselves to the extent that they greatly overestimate how much everyone else is actually paying attention to them. [8] X Trustworthy Source International DOI Foundation (IDF) Registry of published versions of academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications. Go to source With this in mind, if an embarrassing moment happened to you, it’s probably the case that anyone who was around you was paying more attention to themselves than to you."

      "content": "Take a lesson from the embarrassing moment. Okay, so you've been embarrassed, but take it as a lesson and learn from it. Did you trip and fall in front of your crush? Avoid wearing high heels. Did you pass out while giving a speech? Research how to calm your nerves before giving a presentation."

      "content": "Reflect on your emotions that stem from this moment. Keep in mind that you can learn about yourself by what you get embarrassed by. Think about the situation you were in. Ask yourself, “What was it about that situation that made me embarrassed?” It might not always simply be about the people you were actually around. [9] X Trustworthy Source International DOI Foundation (IDF) Registry of published versions of academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications.

      "content": "Consider whether or not you might have an anxiety disorder. While the title of this article is how to get over an embarrassing moment, certain people tend to have embarrassing moments quite a lot. It might even happen every day. If embarrassing moments seem to come up for you continuously, without your control, it could be the case that you have a social phobia. This is actually a type of anxiety disorder that has been shown to be highly correlated with persistent emotions of embarrassment. This makes it very difficult for you to simply get over embarrassing moments when they occur.

      "content": "Practice mindfulness meditation. If you can’t stop thinking about the embarrassing moment, try meditating. Remember, the embarrassing moment is in the past. Try to keep yourself in the present. Mindfulness meditation is a technique that helps you be aware and nonjudgmental about your thoughts and emotions. It can be helpful to keep your thoughts about the embarrassing moment from taking over. [11] X Research source Siegel, R. D. (2010). The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems (1 edition). New York: The Guilford Press. , [12] X Research source Sit quietly for 10-15 minutes, breathing deeply. Focus on your breath. Acknowledge each thought as it enters your mind. Identify the emotion that you're feeling. Say to yourself, \"I feel embarrassment.\" Accept the emotions that you're feeling, tell yourself, \"I can accept my embarrassment.\" Acknowledge that this is a temporary feeling. Say to yourself, \"I know this feeling is temporary. It will subside. What do I need for myself right now?\" Give yourself space and validation for your feelings, but recognize that your thoughts and responses may distort the reality of the situation. Bring your attention and awareness back to your breath. As further thoughts pass through your mind, repeat the process to acknowledge them and let them go. You can also search online for guided mindfulness meditation exercises."
