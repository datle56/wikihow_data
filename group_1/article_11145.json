      "content": "Use a mustache comb. Once the tips of your mustache are long enough, you can use a mustache comb to train your hair to grow across the top of your lips and out towards the sides of your face, rather than straight down over your lip. Brush daily, or several times a day if you can find the time. The longer the hair is allowed to grow, the more robust your curled tips will be. Look for a mustache comb that has smooth rounded teeth as this will ensure that you do not snag or pull out your mustache hairs. If you want to grow a long mustache, or you are hoping to achieve a large curl, you will probably need to allow several months for the hairs to grow. If you want to keep your mustache small and neat, go ahead and trim the ends when they start to get too long."

Whether you are aiming for a tight handlebar mustache, or just trying to curl your hairs in a more casual style, there is a wide range of wax products for you to choose from.

      "content": "Warm the wax up first. Scrape a small amount of wax out of the tin using the outside of your thumbnail; it will warm up fast on your hands and spread out so you really only need a small amount. Experiment a little to figure out the perfect amount for your hair type. Too much and your mustache will look and feel greasy. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Curl the tips around your finger. Start by rubbing the wax into your mustache above your lip and directly under your nose. [3] X Expert Source Tiffany Carnevale-Russo Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 14 September 2021. Then, massage the wax from the middle of your mustache out towards the tips, curling these around your finger and holding for a few seconds. Wax is also great for taming any wispy hairs and making your whole mustache look neat and tidy."

      "title": "Start with clean hair.",
      "content": "Start with clean hair. Don’t wax your mustache before applying a curling iron; if you’re going to wax, always do so afterward. If you're worried that waxing will affect the curl, you don't need to wax at all, but waxing afterward will simply help to tame any stray hairs."

      "title": "Use a low-temperature setting.",
      "content": "Use a low-temperature setting. Curling irons have adjustable heat settings. Start low, and increase the temperature until you find the best setting for your hair. Thicker, more wiry hair will need more heat. [4] X Research source It should only take about 1 minute for a good quality curling iron to heat up. Cheaper ones can take a few minutes longer, so be patient and wait till it has fully heated before using it. [5] X Research source When using a curling iron, touch it to some paper. If the paper starts to turn brown, then it's too hot for your mustache."

      "title": "Choose the right size bore.",
      "content": "Choose the right size bore. If you like tight curls, opt for a 1 ⁄ 4 inch (6.4 mm) bore curling iron, whereas if you’re going for a looser curl, you can use up to a 1 inch (25 mm) bore. [6] X Research source There's no specific moustache curling iron; a regular one will do, but use a smaller size curling iron than the curl you want because the curl will end up being two to three times the size of the iron.

      "content": "Clip the curling iron onto your mustache. You should pull your mustache hair gently outwards near the point where it attaches to your face. Use a mirror and pay careful attention to what you’re doing so you don’t burn yourself. Leave it there for about 10 seconds.

A useful trick is to slide a bit of card between the mustache and your face when doing it to avoid scolded cheeks."

      "title": "Rotate the curling iron.",
      "content": "Rotate the curling iron. Next, press the handle of your curling iron so that it opens a little way and rotate it so that the mustache tips curl upwards towards the ceiling. If your mustache is quite long or your hair is particularly thick, you may need to repeat the curl a second time. [9] X Research source You don't need to, but if you want to tame any wispy hairs you can apply a small amount of mustache wax to complete your look."
