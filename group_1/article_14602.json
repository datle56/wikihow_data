Receiving many messages at once and not being able to separate them shows that you have some spiritual alignment to work on. [4] X Research source You can delve deeper by lucid dreaming and interacting with your surroundings.

      "content": "A warning of what’s to come Dreams are commonly interpreted as warnings. In a nested dream, your mind could be telling you to pay more attention to something, usually the content of the second dream.

Since you are often unaware that the second dream is a dream, this can be symbolic of something that will catch you unprepared if you don’t have your guard up. Pay attention to your surroundings, both in the dream world and in waking life. Images and occurrences from the dream can be manifesting themselves around you to try and lead you in the right direction."

Although you’ve had the experience of waking up, you’re still in a dream. You may feel like a situation has run its course, but you’re still stuck in it. This can come from any number of other things, like being in a relationship you’re no longer happy with or working a job you don’t like. This is most common when there’s more than one dream that you wake into. If you take anything from this dream, it’s that you need to take control of your own life.
