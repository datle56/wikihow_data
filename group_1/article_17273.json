So, if you know two of the three measurements of the triangle, then you're only missing one piece of the puzzle. The first thing you can do is add up the angle measurements you know. In this example, the two angle measurements you know are 80° and 65°. Add them up (80° + 65°) to get 145°. [1] X Research source"

Sometimes, instead being lucky enough to know the measurements of two of the angles of a triangle, you'll only be given a few variables, or some variables and an angle measurement. Let's say you're working with this problem: Find the measurements of angle \"x\" of the triangle whose measurements are \"x,\" \"2x,\" and 24. First, just write it down. [4] X Research source"

The equal sides are marked by one hash mark on each of them, indicating that the angles across from each side are equal. If you know the angle measurement of one equal angle of an isosceles triangle, then you'll know the measurement of the other equal angle. Here's how to find it: [7] X Research source If one of the equal angles is 40°, then you'll know that the other angle is also 40°. You can find the third side, if needed, by subtracting 40° + 40° (which is 80°) from 180°. 180° - 80° = 100°, which is the measurement of the remaining angle."

If it's a right triangle, then you know that one of the angles measures exactly 90°. The same principles apply. All you have to do is add up the measurements of the sides you know (30° + 90° = 120°) and subtract that number from 180°. So, 180° - 120° = 60°. The measurement of that third angle is 60°.
