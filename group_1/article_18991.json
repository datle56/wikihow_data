For you, the spirit of the season may be about holiday parties at the office, finding a parking space at the mall, hustling and bustling to get the best deals, exchanging gifts with friends and loved ones, and best of all: the look of delight on your loved one's faces as they open the gift that's exactly what they wanted—even though they never said a word about it! [1] X Research source Maybe you've lost the spirit of Christmas, many others have, too. The over-commercialization of the holiday has sapped the pleasure from what should be a joyous time. It doesn't have to be that way."

Whatever your reason for the season, nothing can kill the holiday spirit quicker than being crushed against the front of a store by gun-wielding mobs of bargain-crazed shoppers. [2] X Research source Shop at the stores of local producers. Most of the things you can find in malls and big box stores are mass-produced, cheaply-produced junk anyway. Giving junk as gifts is almost as soul-sapping as being in shopping mob. There are many gifts that fall outside the world of Christmas: handmade jewelry; artisan meats, breads, and cheeses; charitable gifts that donate money to a cause, given in the recipient's name; even gifts of things that you make well yourself, whether that's a hand-knit sweater, a work of art, a delicious dinner, or more. Simply ask yourself what you do well, and offer a bit of that as a gift."

It might have been when Santa got you that bike as a kid, or maybe that Christmas Eve that he proposed to you. Ask yourself: why was that special, and what did it feel like? If it was simply that sense of wonder and how it felt like everybody was \"nicer\" somehow, then actively seek where that is happening. If it's the look of delight on children's faces, go find the best Santa in town, and soak in the total belief in a magic elf who delivers presents to children all over the world. Keep a smile on your face, and walk with your head up, making eye contact as much as you can. Greet everybody—young and old, even people you might instinctively dislike—with a hearty \"Merry Christmas.\" You may not even believe it yourself at first, but give it some time and effort."

Either way, get one a couple weeks before Christmas, turn on the Christmas music, put up the tree, and decorate it. Your home will smell like Christmas, and it's hard to be unmoved by that!

Most Christmas chores are like that, so take advantage of your spousal unit to lessen the load. If you have kids, they can do the cleaning—and you have the perfect leverage.

Put candles in the windows (electric ones are safer than flame candles)—these were used by Irish Catholics to signal it was safe for priests to come and give them their sacraments, back during the Reformation when being Catholic could result in an early and generally painful demise."

It's hard to stay outside the spirit of Christmas when the spirit is flowing through you with these celebratory songs of joy. To make them even more meaningful, gather some friends and family this year, and go Christmas caroling in your neighborhood.

As Tom Lehrer put it 50 years ago, \"Angels we have heard on high, tell us to go out...and buy .\" To get back to the most primal reason for this season's festivities, start by modifying what you normally watch or listen to. If you have cable TV, avoid the broadcast stations—the signal-to-noise ratio (noise being the Christmas marketing push) is very high. Instead, use your normal TV time to catch up on old movies you love, or the National Geographic channel or science channels for more celestial-type programming, or the History channel to learn how people celebrated the season before the rise of Christianity and later, Wall Street. Turn off the radio. You'll be pitched every 10 minutes, or subject to Christmas music, or be harangued by talkers for participating in a \"war on Christmas.\" Shun the internet newsgroups, especially regarding topics that touch on any reason for celebrating the season. Somebody will always be there to rain on the parade, and usually with the most abusive attitude. None of that will help you capture the spirit of the season as you see it."

A search in Google will give you a plethora of choices. If you live in a place where you're isolated, either by geography or by local culture, you can find like-minded people in Internet groups. Here are some things to look for: Saturnalia . The Romans celebrated the return of the light by mandating feasting, gambling, ribaldry, and general merriment. The reason? This would vanquish Old Man Saturn, who was often depicted as Father Time, or even Death (not unlike how we ring in the new year now!). Saturnalia is celebrated from December 17th through December 24th. If all that drinking, partying, and debauching is a bit much, December 25th—conveniently enough—is Juvenalia, a celebration of children. In old Roman times, children were entertained, given gifts, and feted. Mithra . Not to be confused with either Mothra or Mithrandir , Mithra was the Persian sun god. Like virtually all celebrations of the season, it celebrates the return of the light, and the promise of renewal. According to legend, Mithra appeared from a rock, armed with knife and torch. Shepherds saw this, and greeted him with gifts. Yule . Yule was the solstice festival of the Norse and Teutonic people of northern Europe. As part of the celebrations, a large green log was burned in the hearth. The festivities would last as long as the Yule log burned. The traditions of decorating the house with greenery—wreaths, trees, and boughs—originated with Yule. Like many other traditions, this was folded into the Christian celebrations of Christmas.

      "content": "Honor the darkness. As the winter solstice approaches, the days get much shorter. The further north you are, the shorter they get. Nature discards the old during this time, to make way for the spring. You can rage against the dying of the light, or recognize that this is a simple celestial phenomenon that will give way to long days of renewal. Set aside a half an hour every evening to meditate on that which you have lost during the year, and that which you wish to shed in the new year. Meditate also on what you wish the lengthening days to bring to your life. If you're too busy to do a half an hour's meditation, do a full hour. On the day of the solstice, spend the day in silence and reflection. Say a final goodbye to the losses, hurts, and regrets of the last year by writing them down on individual strips of paper, then burning them in the Yule fire."

Incorporate any of the old celebrations, and understand that it's intimately tied to the concepts of darkness and light, death and birth, decay and renewal. Have a feast! In most agrarian cultures, mid winter was a time of home and family and enjoying the bounty of the previous year. Create a feast for the season, with the kinds of food that would still be around from the autumn harvests. Cured meats, wildfowl, root vegetables, wine, hot drinks, fresh bread—all of it is fair game for your celebration harvest. Give your celebration a name. It can be as simple as something like \"Feast,\" or as complex as \"The Carpren's Annual Celebration of Rebirth and Renewal.\" Create invitation cards that are like Christmas cards, only with your own theme."

Give simple gifts. If you have to go to a mall, or if saving 25% is actually a significant amount of money, then don't buy it.
