Rest your hands on the floor on either side of your torso to help support your weight and avoid falling straight down onto your crotch. This is the position you'll land in when you do a full jazz split from standing. [1] X Research source Berenson recommends sitting for at least 3-5 minutes in a split position like this one to let your muscles get used to the stretch. Rest the side of your left knee on the floor when you bend your left leg back. Never come down in a jazz split directly on top of your kneecap. That's one of the ways you can injure yourself!

      "content": "Perform hip hinges to warm up your hamstrings. The hamstrings are 3 muscles on the back of each thigh. These help you extend your legs as well as bend your knees when you walk, squat, climb, and do other physical activities. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source They're also one of the most important muscle groups to warm up before doing a jazz split. Maurer recommends doing hip hinges to target this area. Here's how to do a hip hinge: [6] X Research source Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Make sure your spine is stacked and your core is engaged. While keeping your back straight, bend over (or hinge) at the hips at a 90-degree angle and relax your arms slightly so they dangle. Next, squeeze your glutes (the muscles in your buttocks) to help you rise back into a standing position. As you rise, bring your arms back into a neutral position on either side of your torso. Repeat this movement 10 times for up to 3 sets."

      "content": "Do lunges to warm up your hip flexors. Hip flexors are muscle groups that stretch across the front of your hip bones. They are responsible for helping you lift your legs and bend your knees. [7] X Research source Maurer recommends doing lunges to warm up your hip flexors before doing a split to become more flexible and protect yourself from straining. Here's how to perform a forward lunge and maximize your hip flexor stretch: Start in a standing position, then take a big step forward with your right leg. Lower your body until your left knee touches the floor and your right knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Pause in the downward position and raise your left hand above your head for a few seconds. This, according to Maurer, will help you get \"more of a stretch in the hip flexor areas.\" Lower your arm back down and then push yourself back up into a standing position with your right foot. Repeat the forward lunge on the opposite leg. If you're a beginner at lunges, limit yourself to 10-12 repetitions per leg for 2-3 sets. [8] X Research source"
