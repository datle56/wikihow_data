      "content": "Remove the laces from your shoes and prep your work area. Set them aside so they aren’t in the “splash zone” while you paint. [1] X Research source For extra protection, lay some newspaper sheets or paper towels over your work surface to catch any potential drips and spills. Plain white AF1s typically come with white laces. Feel free to have some brighter, more colorful laces on deck if you’d like to switch things up."

      "title": "Wipe down the outside of your shoes with acetone.",
      "content": "Wipe down the outside of your shoes with acetone . Dip a clean cotton ball in acetone and rub it all over the outer surface of your shoes. Focus especially on the parts that you plan to paint over. [2] X Research source All Air Force 1s have a clear layer of finish on the outside of the shoe leather. Any paint applied to this finish will eventually crack, which you definitely don’t want. Acetone helps remove this finish, giving you a better, more durable surface to work with. You can remove the dirt from the shoes first and use a small amount of mild laundry detergent to clean the shoes and shoelaces. [3] X Research source Carefully wash them with warm water to remove the dirty foam and dry them with a soft towel. [4] X Research source Leave them at room temperature to dry. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Tape over any parts of your shoes that you don’t want to paint. Tear off several strips of masking tape and stick them over the sections of your shoes that you’d like to protect. [6] X Research source Go around the tape with an X-ACTO knife to create clean, smooth edges. [7] X Research source You can also tape off any sections that you’d like to paint in a different color later on. Vinyl tape and electrical tape can also work for this. Be really careful and gentle when you’re working with the X-ACTO knife so you don’t scratch the shoe leather by mistake."

      "title": "Apply acrylic leather paint",
      "content": "Apply acrylic leather paint to the shoes in a thin layer. Dip a small paintbrush into the acrylic leather paint color of your choice. Then, apply the paint directly to the shoe using thin, even strokes. [8] X Research source It’s okay if the paint looks a little streaky at first; as you apply more layers, the color will look much more solid and consistent. Since AF1s are made with leather-like material, it’s best to use acrylic leather paint for them. Squeeze your paints into a plastic palette if you plan on using lots of different colors in your design. Opt for smaller and thinner paintbrushes—these are a lot easier to handle since you’re working on such a small surface."

[9] X Research source Tap the shoe very lightly with your finger to make sure the paint is dry before you continue. Grab a hair dryer if you’d like to speed things up. Turn it to a low heat setting and glide it back and forth above the surface of the shoe until the paint is dry to the touch. [10] X Research source"

Then, draw your design over the colored background with slow, careful strokes. [12] X Research source Polka dots, lines, checkers, and squiggly lines are all possible designs you could try. Outline your color blocks with black paint to give them a sharp look."

Dip a small paintbrush into a bottle of an acrylic finish and spread it all over the parts of the shoe you just painted. [14] X Research source Follow the instructions on the bottle to make sure that the finish sets and cures properly. You can buy sprayable acrylic finish , but a regular bottle and paintbrush give you more control over the application process. Acrylic finishes come in different sheens, with matte being the dullest and high gloss being the shiniest.

Paint markers only take a few minutes to dry, so you don’t have to wait very long between layers. Create a dynamic color scheme by coloring in different sections of your shoes with bold accents! You might color the eyestays a shade of light blue, the vamps (toe areas) a blue-green, and the Nike swooshes a navy blue."
