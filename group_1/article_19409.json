      "content": "Dry skin can be caused by cold weather, irritating facial products, or skin conditions. Having dry skin around your nose may be a recurring problem or something that happens during certain seasons. Before you start treating your dry skin, take into account your environment and skin type. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If the weather is cold and the air is dry, you may notice flakier skin around your nose than normal. If you’ve started using a new face wash, moisturizer, or makeup product, your nose may dry out because your skin’s not compatible with the product. If you have a skin condition like psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, dry skin around your nose may be a symptom."

      "content": "Wash your face with warm water and gentle skin cleanser. The first step in caring for dry skin under the nose is to clean the area to remove any dirt and loose, dead skin. Dry, scaly skin can easily lead to open wounds and cause bacterial infection, so keeping the area clean is important. Avoid using harsh soaps that can dry your skin even more. Instead, use cleansers with added moisturizers or mild soaps with added oils. Also avoid antibacterial detergents or cleansers with fragrance or alcohol as these may promote dryness."

If the dry skin under your nose is red, swollen, and/or painful (inflamed) apply an ice cube wrapped in a paper towel over the area for a few minutes to reduce inflammation and pain.

Instead, wrap it inside a clean paper towel or cloth. If the skin under your nose is just dry without any signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, pain), you can skip the icing and move to the next step."

      "title": "Moisturize the skin under the nose.",
      "content": "Moisturize the skin under the nose. Creams and ointments prevent water from escaping from the skin and help seal in your skin’s natural moisture. Apply a rich moisturizing cream under the nose. Use moisturizers that are thicker or hypoallergenic (such as over-the-counter Eucerin and Cetaphil). Most lotions are not thick or moisturizing enough for the really dry skin under your nose, although they can be used for larger areas of your body. Avoid using moisturizers that contain fragrances, alcohol, retinoids, or alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Do not use over-the-counter anti-inflammatory creams or lotions unless directed by your doctor. These products can contain chemicals that may irritate the skin more. If the cream you applied increases burning and itching, stop using it."

Thus, it is important you re-apply the moisturizer as needed to keep the skin under the nose well-moisturized throughout the day and night. For the night, you may want to try ointments that contain petroleum jelly, such as petroleum jelly or Aquaphor. You can also use these during the day but due to their greasiness, you may prefer to use these only before bedtime. If you have extremely dry skin, your dermatologists may recommend a nonprescription ointment (such as those that contain lactic acid and urea). Use these only as directed and do not exceed the recommended number of applications per day.

However, if the dry skin is caused by a more serious skin condition, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, your doctor may recommend a prescription ointment in addition to home care. These ointments typically include a topical corticosteroid or a topical antibiotic.
