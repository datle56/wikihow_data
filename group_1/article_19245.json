      "content": "A tax form dated within the past 12 months provides proof of residency. The tax reporting document issued by your employer (a W-2 or 1099 in the US) has your address on it, so you can use that to show where you live. If you haven't moved in the past year, your accepted tax return also works. If you pay property taxes, use your receipt for property taxes as proof of address—just make sure it's also dated within the past 12 months."

      "content": "Any residential contract can be used to prove where you live. This is the easiest document to get if you've recently moved. Even if you haven't received any mail yet, you still have (or can easily get) a copy of your lease or mortgage contract. Either of those will have your full legal name and address on them. [2] X Research source If you signed a lease online, you still have the option to print off a paper copy for your records. Pull it up through your online account with your landlord."

      "content": "Your bank statement has your full name and address on it. If you've recently moved, go ahead and change your address with your bank—they won't need proof if you have an existing account. Then, wait for your monthly statement to arrive in the mail and you'll have the proof of address you need. For some places, you can simply print off the statement from your online accounts. Others require you to take the printed statement to a local branch and get it stamped and verified, so ask about this ahead of time if you're not sure. Cover up your bank balance and any other information you don't want anyone to know. Your name and address at the top is the only part that's important."

      "title": "Any letter from a business or government agency proves your address.",
      "content": "Any letter from a business or government agency proves your address. Virtually any letter you get in the mail that's addressed to you and has your full address on it will work, as long as that address is typed on a computer-generated form (not handwritten). This includes everything from credit card bills to court papers or account confirmation letters. [3] X Research source Generally, the clerk reviewing your document is only going to be concerned about the address portion. But if there are things on the statement or letter you don't want them to see, black it out ahead of time. If you've moved recently and haven't gotten anything in the mail yet, try triggering a letter from a business. For example, if you've signed up for paperless billing, you might toggle that off—which typically generates a confirmation letter sent to your address."

      "title": "If your car is registered in your name, use that as proof of address.",
      "content": "If your car is registered in your name, use that as proof of address. Since a car title and registration is issued by a government agency, that document qualifies as proof of residency. Unfortunately, you typically need to provide proof of address to register or title a car, so this might not be a good option for you if you've recently moved. This also works if the car is registered in your spouse's name, provided you have a marriage certificate that shows you're married. Title or registration of other vehicles typically works. You could also use any other license or registration issued by a government agency that includes your full name and address, such as a gun license or hunting and fishing license."

This includes auto, home, renters, health, and life insurance—just as long as the policy has your full address on it. Since insurance companies don't typically require proof of residency, this is a really fast option if you've recently moved—just change your address with the insurance company online, then print the policy. An insurance card (the kind that goes in your wallet or your car's glovebox) typically won't work, though, because it usually doesn't have your address on it."

This service ensures that any mail sent to your old address will be forwarded to your new one—but you can also use it to generate a form for proof of address. When you fill out the change-of-address card with the postal service, they'll mail you a confirmation with your new address.

      "content": "Current, valid immigration documents qualify if they include your address. You usually use your immigration documents to prove your legal status in the country, but you can also use them for proof of address. Not all immigration documents include your full address, but work permits or residency papers usually do. Immigration documents typically aren't sufficient by themselves—you'll usually need at least one other document to put with them to prove your address. Passports, visas, and similar documents, on the other hand, generally won't work because they don't have your address on them."

A letter or statement in their name can also prove your address, provided you also have proof of your relationship to them. You still need documents to prove your identity, such as a passport or a birth certificate. If you live with your parents, use your birth certificate—it proves your identity and shows your relationship to them for purposes of your proof of address documents. If you're married, you could also use a document with your address and your spouse's name on it (instead of yours). Just bring along your marriage certificate so you can prove you're married."

If you've moved to a halfway house, rehabilitation center, shelter, or other facility, a letter on facility letterhead is typically sufficient to prove your residency. Staff in the facility office will likely be familiar with what needs to be included in this letter—just let them know you need one. [7] X Research source The letter must clearly state that the facility will accept mail on your behalf. If you've recently moved to accept a new job or work assignment, your employer or employment agency can write up a letter on your behalf.

      "content": "Fill out an official affidavit form and sign it in the presence of a notary. This might not work for private businesses, but government agencies typically have a form ready to go—just call the agency or search online for \"residency affidavit\" along with the name of the agency. Then, ask someone, such as a landlord or roommate, to vouch for your residency. Take the affidavit to a notary so the two of you can sign it. Bring along a government-issued photo ID because the notary will need to verify your identity. [8] X Research source Look for a notary at nearby bank branches, court buildings, postal or government offices, law offices, or check-cashing places. Search online to find the one closest to you. A notary is very different from a \"notario publico,\" a high-ranking legal official in Latin American countries. [9] X Research source In fact, the law in many US states forbids the literal translation of \"notary public\" because of the profound difference between the two titles. [10] X Research source In the US, notaries charge a small fee for their services, usually less than $10. The maximum amount they can charge is set by law."
