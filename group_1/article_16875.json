      "content": "Make friends with ravers to find out about events. A lot of underground raves are spread by word of mouth, meaning you’ll need to know people who know what’s going on. Try to connect with friends who also like to rave so you can get some insight on when and where the raves are happening. Talk to people on raving messaging boards or chat with people in person at the first rave you go to. [7] X Research source If you don’t know anyone who raves, that’s okay. You’ll be able to make rave friends once you go to your first one. A lot of long-time ravers know a ton about the culture and where the next rave is. If you can, try to make friends with some people who have been raving for a long time."

      "title": "Drink a lot of water beforehand.",
      "content": "Drink a lot of water beforehand. Most venues won’t let you bring your own water in, and they’ll probably overcharge you for water inside. Try to drink a bunch of water the day before the rave so you don’t get too dehydrated as you dance the night away. [11] X Research source If you do need to buy water, don’t worry about getting overcharged. It’s better to pay a little extra and not get dehydrated."

      "title": "Charge your phone so you can stay in contact with your friends.",
      "content": "Charge your phone so you can stay in contact with your friends. Before you leave for the rave, make sure your phone is charged up and that you have everyone’s number.

      "content": "Have a plan for getting home safely. You can have someone in your rave group drive, get picked up by a friend, use public transportation, or take a rideshare back home. Whatever you choose, make sure you have a solid plan on how you’re going to leave the venue safely once you’re done partying. [13] X Research source Raves usually end super late, which means busses and trains might not be running. Take a look at the schedules beforehand just in case."

      "title": "Take your drink with you, even to the bathroom.",
      "content": "Take your drink with you, even to the bathroom. Although raves are, for the most part, safe, there’s always a chance that there’s someone there with bad intentions. If you’re drinking something, take it with you, even if you have to use the restroom. That way, you can avoid someone putting drugs into your drink while you’re not looking. [14] X Research source You should also never accept a drink from a stranger unless you saw the bartender pouring it in front of you."

      "title": "Avoid taking illegal drugs.",
      "content": "Avoid taking illegal drugs. Historically, raves attract a lot of drug use in and around the venue. When you go to a rave, you may be offered drugs. You should never take illegal drugs, especially if you aren’t sure where they’re coming from. [15] X Research source You can still have plenty of fun at the rave! Illegal drugs can be laced with toxic or poisonous chemicals, which can give you an adverse or life-threatening reaction."
