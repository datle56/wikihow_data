    {
      "title": "Download the application Discord if you don't already have it.",
      "content": "Download the application Discord if you don't already have it. You will need to make an account if you don't already have one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the Discord application.",
      "content": "Open the Discord application. Create a new server. To do this, click on the plus icon on the bottom left of your screen. Upon clicking this, choose \"Create Server\", then edit out the details."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a creative name for the roleplay server, and create a nice cover for it.",
      "content": "Choose a creative name for the roleplay server, and create a nice cover for it. If you're going for a roleplay which is set in a universe which already exists (for example, Westeros from Game of Thrones), you may use their cover picture for your server. Otherwise, it is recommended that you create one yourself (a jpg or png image format is sufficient, but don't use a copyrighted one)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up the server.",
      "content": "Set up the server. Make the necessary channels for the server. First of all, you need a general or an out-of-character chat, where your player will be able to speak about anything they want and post about everything (except if you restrict NSFW, create a special NSFW channel). You then need a roleplay channel; start out with one, but if the player base reaches a nice amount, make more, as reading will become harder when the players create a mess of a text. Then, you also need roles. For example, are you creating a medieval server? Make a rank of a \"Knight\", so other players can easily see who the person wielding this role is. It is recommended that you make a character sheet channel, where people can post about their characters. You might also want to add a voice chat and a music channel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get members.",
      "content": "Get members. Roles and channels are done, the server's ready to launch except, no players. Use Reddit to post about your Discord server, or advertise on Discord servers you already are in. There are also some special servers made for roleplay advertising. You might want to create a small summary of your roleplay server so the players can know what to expect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure that there is peace and order for your server.",
      "content": "Ensure that there is peace and order for your server. Assuming that there are more than four players on your server, it might be hard to keep them under control. One-person moderation isn't a small job, it requires a lot of time and patience. Players will go on to question you about the server and make small requests. For this, it will be best to have administrators or moderators, or a developer team, or a group of people who can help you control and moderate the server. They'll handle jobs you can't handle while you're away and act on your behalf. Appoint people you trust to these roles, people you are certain can handle the job."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a friendly community.",
      "content": "Create a friendly community. Alright, the server's ready to be called official. You might have started roleplaying right now, but what you truly want is for those players to stay in your server. Yes, they might stay for a day or so, but once they're bored or get mad at something, they will leave. You want to establish a family-friendly community where everyone knows about each other and you can rely on one another. When a player asks for a small request, try your best to help them. Nothing's more important than the players! You should accept good ideas from them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for simplicity.",
      "content": "Go for simplicity. You probably have seen how organized the servers are in Discord roleplays. While it looks cool, how useful it is? It isn't, at all, most of the time. Instead, aim for simplicity and availability, allowing any player to start roleplaying without having to ask a thousand questions and read a thousand words' worth of rules. On that note, you might want to create the rules channel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for fun, above all.",
      "content": "Aim for fun, above all. You shouldn't care how other servers look or are. You are unique. Whatever strikes your fancy, do it. As long as the players are enjoying it, you are doing a great job."
