      "title": "Rinse with salt water.",
      "content": "Rinse with salt water. A quick way to reduce pain and kill bacteria is to prepare a salt water rinse. Salt is not a cure but can strip the mouth of bacteria and draw moisture out from an inflamed gum surrounding a pained tooth, thereby soothing it. Combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt with 8 ounces (250 ml) of warm water. Allow the salt to dissolve in the water before use. Rinse your mouth with this solution for 30 seconds before spitting it out. Repeat as needed. You will most likely want to rinse with fresh water after a salt preparation. With water from the tap, rinse again for 30 seconds."

      "title": "Take pain medication.",
      "content": "Take pain medication. Use a non-prescription, over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen/paracetamol or ibuprofen to lessen the pain until you can get to a dentist. Follow the instructions on the label to determine the correct dosage. For most pain relievers, you will take one or two pills every four to six hours. Exact dosages will vary by medication and brand, however. You should be able to buy these at any pharmacy or drug store, at a cost of under $20. Do not put aspirin or other painkillers directly on the gum tissue. Doing so can cause damage and will certainly irritate the nearby tissue. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a topical pain medication.",
      "content": "Use a topical pain medication. Over-the-counter topical ointments are another option. These work by numbing the area around your tooth or by application directly to the cavity. The active ingredient in such medications is benzocaine. Follow the label directions to determine the proper amount and application. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Topical ointment like Orajel should be available at most drugstores, costing about $10. Only use topical pain relievers approved for dental use. Other topical pain killers could be dangerous if ingested. Benzocaine in some cases causes a rare but dangerous condition called methemoglobinemia, which decreases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Children less than 2 should not be given medications with benzocaine, nor should you ever exceed the recommended dosage."

      "title": "Avoid using the tooth.",
      "content": "Avoid using the tooth. Until you can apply a remedy, take easy steps to control pain. Avoid chewing with that area of your mouth and with the tooth itself, for one. You might also try to use a temporary filler. If your tooth is cracked or otherwise damaged, it is possible to cover it for a time with softened chewing gum or dental wax until you can find a more permanent solution. [7] X Research source Many drug stores also sell temporary tooth filling kits. These are made from zinc oxide or a similar material, will reduce pressure, and can last up to two weeks. They should cost about $10. You can also put some wax in the cavity to seal it off and protect it further. To protect against sensitivity, put some cotton from a cotton roll onto your tooth when you eat."

      "title": "Try garlic or onion.",
      "content": "Try garlic or onion. Both of these common vegetables are traditional folk remedies for tooth pain and are thought to have antibacterial properties. They may give you bad breath, but they’ll help to kill harmful germs in the mouth and can offer temporary relief. Wedge a clove of garlic between your sore tooth or gum and cheek. Hold it there until the pain subsides. Alternately, cut a small piece of onion and place it on your affected tooth."

      "content": "Apply a wet tea bag to the painful area. Like bayberry root bark, black teas contain astringent tannins that can reduce inflammation. Herbal peppermint tea also has a mild numbing effect and, anecdotally, may relieve pain. Many of these are often used in toothache home remedies. To use tea as a remedy, microwave the teabag in a small dish of water for 30 seconds to warm it up. Then, squeeze out any excess water. Press the teabag to your sore tooth or gum ad bite down gently until the pain fades."

      "title": "Use high proof alcohol.",
      "content": "Use high proof alcohol. This is not about drinking to dull your pain. Rather, potent liquors like vodka, brandy, whiskey, or gin may have some ability to numb your tooth if applied directly. Soak a sterile cotton ball in liquor, like brandy or vodka, and hold it against the pained tooth. You might also take a sip of whiskey and hold the liquid in your cheek near the pained area. Any relief from this method will be temporary. Do not try this technique with rubbing alcohol, as well, as it is not safe to ingest."

      "title": "Get a filling.",
      "content": "Get a filling. A dentist may examine your tooth and decide that the pain is caused by tooth decay – that is to say, areas where bacterial acid has eaten away the enamel and exposed the tooth’s root. Alternately, you may be having an issue with an existing filling that has become loose. In both cases the tooth will need to be filled. After numbing your tooth and gums, the dentist will first drill out the decayed part of the tooth. He’ll then fill the cavity with a composite or amalgam filling. You might have some choice in the filling material. Composite fillings are usually made from a resin of plastic, glass, or porcelain and will largely match the color of your teeth. Amalgam fillings are usually made from silver and may be stronger, but will not match the tooth’s color. [13] X Research source They also release a small amount of toxic mercury. As fillings age, they may break down or become loose. Your dentist will remove the filling, drill away any new decay, and give you a new filling."

      "content": "Have a crown put on the tooth. A dental crown, also called a cap, is used when a tooth is damaged but not lost. It is essentially a hollow, artificial tooth that will restore shape and function, protecting the tooth from further damage. These may be needed in cases of severe tooth decay, pulpitis, abrasion, tooth fractures, or severe infections. [14] X Research source If tooth decay is too advanced, or in case of a root canal, a filling may not be sufficient treatment and the dentist will use a cap or crown. Generally the dentist will give you local anaesthetic. She will then file the tooth down and replace it with a crown made from a customized molding of your tooth. These crowns are made from the same restorative materials as normal fillings."

      "content": "Graft missing gum tissue. It may be that your pain is not being caused by a tooth at all but by your gums. Some people have receding gums. This means that the gums have fallen away from your teeth, exposing thin enamel and nerves, and often leads to overly sensitive teeth. [15] X Research source If your pain is due to gum recession, the dentist may prescribe preventative care. Sometimes receding gums are caused by inadequate dental hygiene. Your dentist may advise you to floss regularly, brush with soft-bristles, and use a toothpaste like Sensodyne. In bad cases, the dentist may send you to an oral surgeon or periodontist for grafting. This means that the surgeon will take tissue from the roof of your mouth and then graft it onto the damaged gums. The tissue should then heal and protect the teeth as it should. [16] X Research source This procedure will protect you from future root canals, but it is also an aesthetic procedure that makes patients more confident in their smiles."

      "content": "Extract the tooth. If your toothache is caused by a severely infected or damaged tooth or by an impacted wisdom tooth, you may need to have it removed by a dentist. This should be left as a last option. Once you extract the tooth, it’s gone for good. Wisdom teeth are usually removed because they can crowd the other teeth in your mouth. As the teeth become crowded, more pressure is applied, causing more pain or possible infection. This crowding can change your bite and be painful; it can also cause TMJ disorders, which can also cause headaches."

Try to carry a toothbrush in your purse or carryall, so that you are able to brush on the go. If you are unable to brush, at least rinse your mouth with water. When you brush your teeth, use a gentle circular motion, and brush for at least 2 minutes. If you brush too hard, it can wear away your enamel and lead to receding gums.

      "content": "Eat a good diet for oral health. What you eat determines how healthy your teeth are. Whenever you eat sugars, for example, they will react with bacteria to form acids that can eat away at tooth enamel. For better, stronger teeth, reduce your sugar intake. [20] X Research source Drink less soda, sugary fruit drinks, sweet tea, or sweetened coffee. Include more water in your diet. Eat less junk food, including candy and pastries. Avoid acidic foods and juices, as well, like grapefruit juice, cola, and wine. Choose an “alkaline” or non-acid treat instead, like yogurt, cheese, or milk."

      "content": "Use special toothbrushes and toothpaste. If your tooth pain is caused by dental sensitivity, consider using a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically designed for overly sensitive teeth. You should be able to find them at most drugstores. Sensitive teeth are often the result of receding gums. As gums shrink, the tooth dentin below the enamel surface is exposed. Sensitive toothpaste is designed to clean this part of your tooth using gentler ingredients. Switch to a soft bristled toothbrush. If your tooth pain is related to receding gums, a soft bristled toothbrush can be used to preserve more of your natural gum tissue. Hard and medium brushes are often effective at scrubbing away decay, but they can be too harsh on your teeth. Soft toothbrushes are a better option, especially if you struggle with gum-related pain or similar problems. [21] X Research source Tu Anh Vu, DMD. Dentist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020."
