Just like with web browsers on a computer, most phones and tablets automatically save login and passwords so people won't have so many passwords to remember. If you have access to a phone or tablet, you might be able to see all stored passwords in plain text—although, you'll usually need to enter the phone's PIN or biometric to view these passwords. iPhone/iPad: Try Siri first.

Some people store their passwords plain text files on their computers, which is definitely not a secure way to store passwords.

Whether you're looking for somebody else's password or your own, check the area near the computer for sticky notes containing login information, notebooks with password lists, or any scraps of paper that might have this information. Some people even buy \"password journals,\" which are entire notebooks geared toward listing your passwords in an easy-to-remember format.

      "content": "If you're trying to access a website or app, look for a \"Forgot Password\" link on the login screen. This option is typically somewhere near the username and password fields. Clicking this link will typically give you the option to receive a password reset link via email, text message (SMS), or by answering security questions. In most cases, you'll need to have access to the email account or phone number associated with the account. So, it's best to only use this method for your own accounts. If security questions are available, you may be able to answer them immediately to reset the password. But in most cases, the answering the security questions will typically send a password reset link to the email address on file to complete the password reset form."

      "content": "If you know the password requirements of the site or service you want to access, you might be able to guess the password. This can be a little risky, as too many guesses may lock you out of the account. Before you start guessing, figure out the minimum password requirements for the site or service, such as how many characters are required, and whether there needs to be a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. This can help you narrow down the options. Our handy guide to guessing passwords will be very helpful if you're not sure where to start! If you want to access a phone, like an iPhone or Android, the password or PIN will usually be easier to guess as it'll be fewer characters and (almost always) just numbers. People often use digits from their own phone numbers, social security numbers, birthdates, and other significant numbers as their phone PINs. People often use the names of their pets, partners, or other significant people in their lives in their passwords—you can try these names, along with any numbers you think are important to that person. For example, a pet's name followed by the year of birth."

These tools are for advanced users who have access to the hash or shadowed version of the password—you won't be able to use password crackers to try a bunch of logins on a website. [7] X Research source Cracking tools work by brute force (basically, trying all characters from a character set), dictionary attacks (using word lists), or a combination of multiple cracking methods. John the Ripper, one of the most famous password cracking tools, comes preinstalled in Kali Linux . If you want to use it on another platform, you can download it from https://www.openwall.com/john . Speaking of Kali Linux, Wfuzz is a cracking tool that uses brute force methods to crack web-based passwords. It comes pre-installed on Kali, but you can also download the source code for other flavors of Linux . Hashcat , known as \"The World's Fastest Password Cracker,\" is a command-line app that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. [8] X Research source To crack a Windows user password, you can use Hash Suite , which is a port of John the Ripper. Mimikatz is another Windows password-cracking tool that can extract plain text passwords, hashed passwords, PIN codes, and Kerberos tickets from memory. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Keyloggers are programs or devices that capture every keystroke a person types. When installed properly, most users won't know they're being recorded. [10] X Research source The thing is, it's not legal to install a keylogger on another person's computer or phone unless you have permission to do so—you should only do this on your own devices, or with permission. For example, it's legal for an IT department to install a keylogger on a user's computer to monitor workplace activity if the employee consented during the hiring process. It's also legal to install a keylogger on your own computer, which can be helpful if you're trying to find your child's passwords. Some keyloggers are hardware-based, but those are less common. Legitimate software-based keyloggers are usually marketed to businesses and parents—some popular options are WebWatcher, Kidlogger, Revealer, Spyrix, and StupidKeyLogger.
