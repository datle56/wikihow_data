      "content": "Go out with your friends and have some fun. After a breakup, it’s normal to want to curl up and cry. That's not only OK, it's healthy. A breakup is, in many ways, like a death, and grieving is normal. But if you're spending all your time alone in your room, it'll help to get out and see some supportive friends who can help you feel less isolated and get back to your regular life. Invite your friends to do a fun activity and live it up. Then, post photos of yourself having fun so everyone knows you’re living your best life. For example, go rollerskating, go bowling, play mini-golf, audition for community theater, host a game night, get drinks, or sing karaoke. Psychologist Dr. Julia Yacoob says that when it comes to recovering from a breakup, everyone has a different approach. Do what’s going to be the most healing thing for you. That may be spending time with friends, indulging in a new hobby, or spending time alone to mourn. [1] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021."

      "content": "Take a break from social media. It's tempting to scroll through your ex's social media and reminisce or wonder what they're up to now, but it may just make you feel worse. If you can’t stop looking at your ex’s social media after the breakup, get off the app. [2] X Research source This will give you the proper time and space that you need to process your feelings about the relationship. Your ex also won’t get the satisfaction of seeing you in their likes, comments, or story views. Set limits on your apps or delete them altogether if you are struggling with getting off of social media. To be safe, log out of your social media accounts on your computer, too. Not only will avoiding social media give you more time to heal from the breakup, but blocking or ghosting your ex and refusing to watch his stories will probably drive him crazy."

      "content": "Focus on your career. Diving into your career can help get revenge on your ex by showing them that you are driven with or without them. Set goals at work like networking with a certain number of people per week or focusing on different aspects of your job that you enjoy.

      "content": "Spend time with your loved ones. Your family and friends can help you process your feelings by talking about your relationship and breakup with you. By serving as a validating outlet, your family and friends can help you regain confidence. [4] X Research source Not only will this strengthen your self-confidence, but it will also let your ex know that you’re doing just fine without them. Your friends and family can provide a fresh set of eyes and help you see things that went wrong in your relationship."

      "title": "Use a diary or journal to vent about the relationship.",
      "content": "Use a diary or journal to vent about the relationship. A diary or journal gives you a private, nonjudgmental place to vent about your ex. By quietly venting about your feelings, you will make your ex feel like you aren’t thinking about them. Not only that, but you will also be able to see your emotional progress as you grieve the relationship, which can help you gain self-confidence. [5] X Research source Journaling also helps reduce stress and anxiety, as it serves as an outlet for negative feelings and emotions."

      "content": "Celebrate all the things that are going well in your life. Dealing with a breakup can make you feel really down, so it might be hard to think positively right now. To help you focus on the bright side, make a list of everything you’re grateful for in your life. Then, consider sharing your gratitude with others by telling your friends and posting about it online. [6] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source You might post online, “I’m so happy that I’m getting the chance to show my artwork at Good Beans Coffeehouse!” or “Feeling so grateful for my bestie, my pup, and a job I adore.”"

      "content": "Spend some time on your appearance so you feel your best. Put on your favorite outfit, style your hair, and put on makeup if you wear it. Consider pampering yourself with a manicure or new haircut. Then, snap some photos of yourself looking fabulous and post them online for everyone to see. Additionally, you might ask your friends to go with you as you pass by somewhere you know your ex will be. [7] X Research source Don’t worry about changing yourself or trying to improve your looks.

      "content": "Try something new so you’re growing as a person. While you’re going through a breakup, it can be hard to spend time alone when you’re used to being a couple. Seize this free time and use it to do something you’ve always wanted to try! Make a list of activities, hobbies, or interests you could try out. Then, start checking off items. [8] X Research source For example, try a new restaurant, start painting, learn to play the guitar, or join a recreational sports team. If you have a desire to help others and want to meet people with similar values, volunteer for a cause that means something to you. Help at a soup kitchen, volunteer at an animal shelter, or volunteer at a forest preserve. Hobbies have been proven to benefit your mental health by reducing stress and improving social connection.

      "content": "Consider going to therapy to help process the breakup. Therapy provides you with a safe, nonjudgmental space that lets you speak on your past relationship unfiltered. When talking to a therapist, they will let you feel your feelings and make sure to remain neutral. They will also help you work through any residual feelings so that you can come out of the other end stronger than you were in your previous relationship. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid talking about him so he’ll think you’re over him. Since this guy hurt you, you probably want to tell everyone what a jerk he is. However, this just shows him that you still care. Instead, don’t mention his name at all. That way everyone will think you’re over him. If you still need to vent about what happened, Dr. Yacoob suggests talking it out with either a friend or a spouse, or your therapist.

      "content": "Give yourself permission to feel your emotions. You’re probably in pain right now, and that’s okay. It’s also understandable that you’d want to get revenge. Tell yourself it’s okay to feel whatever emotions come up, then let them pass. [12] X Research source You might tell yourself, “I’m feeling really angry at Seth for breaking up with me so close to Valentine’s Day. I thought he really cared about me. I want him to hurt as much as I do.”"

      "title": "Visualize yourself getting your revenge and the aftermath of it.",
      "content": "Visualize yourself getting your revenge and the aftermath of it. Usually, thinking about revenge is much more satisfying than actually carrying it out. Picture yourself doing mean things to your ex, like spray painting a mean message on his lawn or burning his favorite shirts. Enjoy the satisfaction of watching him suffer. Then, imagine what might happen if you really did that. [13] X Research source Say your ex cheated on you. Picture yourself going to his house and spray painting “cheater” on his car. Then, imagine him having to drive around embarrassed. Then, think about the fallout of actually doing this. Like his mom getting really upset and trying to get you arrested or fined."

      "content": "Engage in a calming activity to help you relax and think clearly. You probably feel really upset right now, and you have every right to feel that way. Try not to make any decisions while you’re feeling really emotional. Instead, do something that helps you feel relaxed and in control.

      "content": "Try talking to your ex about your feelings if it might help. While you might not want to ever see him again, sometimes expressing your pain to your ex can help you feel better. If you think it could help, ask your ex to talk either in person or on the phone. Then, use “I” statements to tell him how his actions affected you. [15] X Research source “I” statements keep the focus on you without blaming the other person. For example, you’d say, “I feel like you don't respect me,” not “You don’t respect me.” You might say, “I feel like you broke my trust, and that really hurts.”"
