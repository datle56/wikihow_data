      "content": "Crack open and remove the shells when you’re eating peanuts. If your peanuts came with a shell on them, hold the shelled nut in your fingertips, and squeeze your fingers to put pressure on the shell until it cracks. Pull out the nut with your hands and discard the shell in a bowl. Most of the time the nut will fall right out when you crack the shell, but you may have to fish around to pull out the nut. Use the same cup, bowl, or bag (if on the go) to collect all of your shells and make cleanup easier. Technically you can eat the shell, but it’s not great for digestion and might be contaminated with pesticides. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try eating peanuts boiled, roasted, or raw. For boiled peanuts, remove the shells like normal peanuts (or pop them in your mouth and bite down to remove the shells), then suck the juice from the shell for an extra treat. Roasted peanuts tend to be more flavorful and make awesome snacks as well, as do raw peanuts. Raw peanuts are safe to eat, but to ensure the safety of the snack buy raw peanuts that were produced in the US, as some unmonitored raw peanuts may have carcinogenic properties.
