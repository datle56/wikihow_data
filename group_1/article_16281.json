      "title": "Square or untapered logo",
      "content": "Square or untapered logo The Lululemon logo is instantly recognizable, and most fakes come close to mimicking it. However, take a closer look. The real Lululemon logo will be slightly rounded at the top and have tapered edges. Fake Lululemon logos often look clunky, squashed, or untapered at the ends. [1] X Research source Lululemon leggings often have a small, printed logo on the waistband. Other garments might have an embroidered logo or a logo on the tag. If your Lululemon has a reflective logo on the outside, make sure it’s actually reflective. If it isn’t, it might be a fake."

    {
      "title": "Misplaced rip tag",
      "content": "Misplaced rip tag The rip tag is the tag inside of the Lululemon piece that gives you washing instructions. Normal rip tags are on the left side of the garment near the seam. If the rip tag is anywhere else, it’s likely that it’s a fake. [2] X Research source These tags are meant to be ripped off of the garment. If you’re buying second-hand Lululemon, your garment likely won’t have one of these."
    },
    {
      "title": "Errors or misspellings on the rip tag",
      "content": "Errors or misspellings on the rip tag Inspect the rip tag carefully. Do you see any spelling errors or oddly capitalized letters? If so, it’s likely a fake—real Lululemon rip tags use correct grammar and capitalization rules. [3] X Research source Look at the font, too, and make sure it’s consistent throughout. If the font switches halfway through the tag, the piece is probably not real. If there is a QR code, make sure it scans properly. If it doesn’t, it’s likely a fake. Look up the product code on the rip tag. If it doesn’t exist, the garment is probably a dup. Many fake Lululemon items will say “Lululemon athleticá,” with an accent over the “a.” This is a key indicator that the garment is fake, since real Lululemon says “Lululemon athletica.”"

      "title": "Cardboard tag attached to the rip tag",
      "content": "Cardboard tag attached to the rip tag If you’re buying a piece that’s new with tags, take a look at where the cardboard tag (or the hangtag) is. Real Lululemon will never put the cardboard tag on the rip tag—typically, it’s inserted into a seam so there are no marks left when you remove it. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Missing size dot",
      "content": "Missing size dot A size dot is a round, printed circle that tells you the numerical size of the garment. Size dots are common on Lululemon leggings. Check the inside of the small pocket on the back or the side of the legging’s waistband. If you can’t find a size dot or if the size dot has a sheet of plastic over it, it may be fake. [5] X Research source Not all Lululemon leggings have a size dot inside, but most do. Consider this one a red flag more than a glaringly obvious sign."

    {
      "title": "Low quality fabric or stitching",
      "content": "Low quality fabric or stitching Lululemon products are made with high quality fabric, which is why they tend to run on the higher end of the pricing scale. You can tell a Lululemon piece is fake if the fabric feels cheap or thin, or if the stitching looks hand sewn or like it’s coming apart. [6] X Research source Lululemon garments will always use thread that matches the color of the fabric. If you can see the thread and it’s a different color, it’s likely that your piece is fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Misaligned pattern",
      "content": "Misaligned pattern If your garment has a pattern, take a look at the seams or where it zips up. Real Lululemon will always pattern-match, meaning that the pattern will look seamless throughout the piece. If it seems misaligned or looks off in any way, it’s probably not real. [7] X Research source This is especially common with stripes. If the stripes don’t line up, the garment is not real Lululemon."

    {
      "title": "Unreleased print",
      "content": "Unreleased print Sometimes fake Lululemon garments don’t get it quite right: they use a print that hasn’t been sold. If you’re not sure, try posting in a Lululemon Facebook group or checking out the Lululemon website to see if you can find the print yourself. If you can’t, then it’s definitely a fake.

    {
      "title": "Pricing that’s too good to be true",
      "content": "Pricing that’s too good to be true Lululemon is high-quality athletic wear, so it tends to run on the more expensive side of things. If you find a Lululemon piece that’s super cheap, that’s a big red flag. Most Lululemon garments are around $100, with some variation depending on what you’re buying. [9] X Research source Not sure if the price is too good to be true? Take a look at the reviews on the website. If there are lots of complaints or 1-star reviews, it’s likely that they’re selling fakes."

These garments are usually cheaper, and they often run sales where you can get steep discounts. Find an outlet store in your area by visiting the Lululemon outlet store locator . Unfortunately, Lululemon warehouse sales are a thing of the past. However, the stock that used to be available in the warehouse sales now ends up at outlet stores, so you can still find it."
