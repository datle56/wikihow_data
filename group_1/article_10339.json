For most situations, face your palm toward you with the back of your hand facing outward. [2] X Research source However, if you’re signing a multiple-digit number or series of numbers, like a phone number, face your palm outwards. [3] X Research source 1 : Point upward with your index finger, keep the rest of your fingers in a fist or ASL “S”-shape. 2 : Point upward with your index and middle fingers. 3 : Same as signing the number 2, but with your thumb extended. 4 : Hold up all fingers except your thumb. 5 : Hold up all five fingers."

The order is pinkie to thumb (6), then ring finger (7), middle finger (8), index (9). If you forget which way this goes, it might be helpful to remember that for the smallest number (6) you touch your thumb to the smallest finger (pinkie).

Instead, stop about halfway through the turn, twist your hand back toward you, and repeat. [7] X Research source 16 : Touch your pinky to your thumb.
