      "title": "Pick up 1 of the short ends of the green screen.",
      "content": "Pick up 1 of the short ends of the green screen. This method works best for standard-sized green screens which are 5 by 7 feet (1.5 m Ã— 2.1 m). Once you're ready to put away the green screen, pick up 1 of the short ends and rest it against your hips. Leave the other end resting on the ground. [1] X Research source Don't leave the green screen propped against a wall or flat on the ground since the screen could warp or get stepped on."

      "title": "Grip the long sides of the screen with both hands and fold them up.",
      "content": "Grip the long sides of the screen with both hands and fold them up. Place each of your hands on the rounded corners of the short end that's resting against you. Hold them tightly and bring your hands up in front of your torso so the screen folds like a taco. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the sides of the screen to fold it.",
      "content": "Cross the sides of the screen to fold it. Bring your right hand over your left hand or your left hand over your right so the edges of the screen overlap. Push them down towards the ground so the screen collapses flat on itself. [3] X Research source At this point, you can pick up the circular folded green screen. Pinch the sides of the screen as you lift it so it doesn't unfold or pop open."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lay the extra-long screen in front of you and lift up a short end.",
      "content": "Lay the extra-long screen in front of you and lift up a short end. Position the green screen so a short end is facing you and the long sides extend away from you. You can lay the green screen on the ground to start. Then, pick up the short end that's close to you. [4] X Research source You can also use this method for a green screen with sweep. This means that the green screen has excess material that you drape where the wall meets the ground."

    {
      "title": "Fold the edges together like a book.",
      "content": "Fold the edges together like a book. Grasp the sides of the short edge with both of your hands and slowly bring them up towards each other. The fabric of the green screen should hang underneath the edges in a U-shape. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower the end of the screen to the ground.",
      "content": "Lower the end of the screen to the ground. Keep holding the screen in a U-shape and take a few steps forward so the entire screen curves like an arc. Then, lower the end that your holding until the edge touches the bottom of the screen that's already on the ground. [6] X Research source After you lower the end to the ground, position your hands on the sides of the screen so they're near the middle."

    {
      "title": "Fold the right side of the screen towards the middle.",
      "content": "Fold the right side of the screen towards the middle. At this point, each side of the screen forms a small loop and most of the green screen fabric is loose in the center. Keep your hands on each of the loops at your sides and fold the right loop down so it lays flat on the ground. [7] X Research source Squat towards the ground while you finish folding the green screen."

    {
      "title": "Overlap the other loop to finish folding the green screen.",
      "content": "Overlap the other loop to finish folding the green screen. Bring the other loop down so it lies flat on top of the other loop. If you're folding a green screen with sweep, tuck the fabric in between the 2 loops of the screen. [8] X Research source Remember to hold both sides of the folded green screen when you pick it up or they will pop open."
