      "content": "SafeAssign is an anti-plagiarism tool. It is developed by Blackboard and used by a wide variety of teachers and university instructors to detect plagiarism in the classroom. SafeAssign works by comparing submitted assignments to a large database of other academic papers, assignments, and other works to see if there is any overlap. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "ChatGPT is an artificially intelligent chatbot that produces human-like text. ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI. It uses a large body of text to analyze common patterns in writing. It then uses an algorithm to generate human-like text based on the patterns it detects. A user gives it a prompt and it replies using human-like text."

      "title": "ChatGPT can be a problem in educational settings.",
      "content": "ChatGPT can be a problem in educational settings. Because ChatGPT can produce a large amount of text in a short period of time that sounds very human-like, many students may see it as a shortcut to completing their assignments. The fact that the text can appear very human-like and natural makes it hard to detect."

      "title": "Yes, there are other tools that can detect AI-generated text.",
      "content": "Yes, there are other tools that can detect AI-generated text. A trained eye can spot AI-generated text without the use of such tools. However, none of these tools are perfect. In some instances, AI-generated text may fly under the radar. In other cases, they may produce false-positives. These tools should not be relied upon fully. They should be used in conjunction with other detection methods. The following are some tools that can detect AI-generated text: Copyleaks GPT Zero AI Detector AI Text Classifier"

      "title": "There are a variety of ways AI-generated text can be detected.",
      "content": "There are a variety of ways AI-generated text can be detected. The following are a few examples: [3] X Research source Repetitive writing: AI tends to use a lot of the same commonly used words and phrases as well as predictable sentence structures. Unnaturally perfect: If a student turns in an assignment that has unusually perfect spelling and grammar, it may be AI-generated. Unemotional or robotic tone: AI doesn't have opinions or feelings. If the text refuses to take a strong opinion, lacks a personal perspective, and sounds monotonous without use of informal language, it may be AI-generated. Incorrect facts: AI doesn't always get the facts right. Furthermore, the database it was trained on only goes up until 2021. If the text presents incorrect facts confidently, it may be AI-generated. Doesn't cite sources: Not only does AI have a tendency to get the facts wrong, it often doesn't cite its sources when it does make a factual claim. Irrelevant details: AI-generated text may often include details and descriptions that are unimportant or irrelevant. If the descriptions and details don't sound like they would be interesting to most readers, it may be AI-generated. It didn't do the assignment correctly: ChatGPT and other AI chatbots don't understand the assignment. If the writing doesn't follow the guidelines of the assignment, it may be AI-generated."

    {
      "title": "Probably not.",
      "content": "Probably not. Unless it's part of the assignment, you should probably avoid using ChatGPT in a classroom settings. Even though SafeAssign may not be able to detect ChatGPT, there are other tools that can. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that SafeAssign won't be updated to include AI detection in the future. If you use ChatGPT often enough, you are likely to get caught. Take your education seriously and complete your assignments the proper way."
