      "content": "Begin with some warm up exercises. It is always a good idea to begin your yoga session with some stretching. This will loosen up your muscles and prepare your body for the exercise that it is about to do. There are a number of positions to do as a warm up. Given that you are planning to do the frog pose, it is best to stretch your hips, groin and thighs. The 'reclining butterfly' pose is ideal for stretching these areas. [3] X Research source Begin by exhaling and lowering your back torso to the floor, leaning on your hands as you lower yourself. When you have reached the floor and are leaning on your forearms, use your hands to spread your pelvis. Use a blanket to support your head if necessary. With your hands on the top of your thighs, rotate your thighs externally and press your thighs away from your torso. Move your hands up your thighs and widen your knees away from your hips. Then push your hip points together. Finally rest your hands on the floor at a 45 degree angle away from your body. To start this pose should be done for one minute. It can be gradually extended to five or ten minutes."

      "content": "Get into position. To do the frog pose in yoga, you will first need to be in the table pose. This is a basic yoga pose that many floor based yoga positions begin from. The pose itself has its benefits, as it helps to lengthen and realign your spine. [4] X Research source Begin by going to the floor on your hands and knees. Your knees should be a few inches apart and your feet should be directly behind your knees. The palms of your hands should be directly under your shoulders. Your fingers should be pointed forward. Point your head downwards and focus on a point between your hands. Your back should be flat. Push your palms into the floor as you drop your shoulders away from your ears. Push your tailbone towards the back wall and the top of your head towards the front wall. This will lengthen and stretch the spine. Take deep breaths, and hold the position for 1-3 breaths."
