When you’re done using the Ouija board , be sure to end the session by moving the planchette to “Goodbye” and politely asking the spirits to return to the spirit world. This helps ensure that no spirits linger and that malevolent spirits cannot use the board as a portal to enter your home. [1] X Research source Most believe that as long as you end the session properly, there’s nothing to worry about and you shouldn’t have to dispose of the board entirely."

      "content": "Spiritually cleanse the Ouija board. Some believe it is important to cleanse the Ouija board before you get rid of it to prevent any negative energy or spirits from staying around. Choose any cleansing ritual you want; many prefer using sage , salt, or crystals to purify the board. If you use sage, simply wave the smoke over and around the board. Pour a circle of salt around the board, or place a purifying crystal (like clear quartz or black obsidian) on top of it. [2] X Research source It’s also a good idea to cleanse your home or the area in which you used the board. Note that white sage, specifically, is a part of a closed Native American practice, so if you aren’t of Native descent, use a different type of sage to cleanse."

      "content": "Break the board into 7 pieces (optional). 7 is a spiritual number that has many positive associations across cultures and religions, including Christianity. For this reason, many believe it is best to break the Ouija board into 7 pieces before disposing of it. Once you’ve broken the board, sprinkle each piece with Holy Water. [3] X Research source While many believe you must break the board in order to dispose of it properly, others believe doing so is a bad idea, as it will release evil spirits or energy into your life. It is up to you to decide which you believe."

      "content": "Bury the Ouija board. Whether you break the Ouija board or not, the next step is to bury it. [4] X Research source If possible, bury the Ouija board on consecrated ground (like in a cemetery or at a church), though any ground will do. Place the board in a hole deep enough that it can’t be easily dug back up. If you didn’t break it into pieces, many traditions suggest burying it facedown. Then, cover the board with dirt and leave the area. Some believe that you should cover the area with salt once the board has been buried. The idea is that the salt will soak into the ground when it rains and purify the board."

If the planchette starts moving on its own, most believe this is a sign that a malevolent spirit has taken over the board. This is especially true if it moves in a figure 8 or spells out things like “death” or “evil.” [7] X Research source It’s also a good idea to dispose of a board if it “admits” it’s Satanic, starts spelling out the names of demons, or points to numbers like 666. It’s also okay to get rid of a Ouija board if having it makes you uncomfortable or if you simply no longer want to have it in your possession."

If you’ve properly closed the connection and still feel like a spirit or demon has lingered, cleanse your Ouija board, yourself, and your house to remove any negative energy. Some common spiritual cleansing methods include using rosewater , incense , or the smoke of a purifying herb like sage . If you’re religious, saying a prayer and asking for the spirit to leave can also help. [10] X Research source In most cases, you’ll simply wave the smoke around the area or spritz it with the rosewater to cleanse the energy. If you choose a more complex ritual, be sure to follow the instructions exactly. If this doesn’t work, consider contacting a priest or spiritual healer for more help."

Take some time to consider your beliefs and decide whether it’s appropriate for you to use a Ouija board. While many people have had scary experiences with Ouija boards, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that they can summon ghosts or demons. They’re marketed as a toy."

The film showed the board as a tool for demonic possession, which transformed it from a harmless parlor game to a gateway for the devil to enter your home. [13] X Research source After this, many other horror movies used Ouija boards the same way, so these negative connotations don’t seem like they’ll be going away any time soon."
