The coefficients are the terms that are attached to the variable. When you're looking for the degree of a polynomial, you can either just actively ignore these terms or cross them off. For instance, the coefficient of the term 5x 2 would be 5. The degree is independent of the coefficients, so you don't need them. Working with the equation 5x 2 - 3x 4 - 5 + x, you would drop the constants and coefficients to get x 2 - x 4 + x."

The term with the highest exponent should be first, and the term with the lowest exponent should be last. This will help you see which term has the exponent with the largest value. In the previous example, you would be left with -x 4 + x 2 + x."

You can think of the constant term as being attached to a variable to the degree of 0, which is really 1. For example, if you have the constant 15, you can think of it as 15x 0 , which is really 15 x 1, or 15. This proves that the degree of a constant is 0. [5] X Research source"
