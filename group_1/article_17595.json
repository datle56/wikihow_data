      "title": "Install extra hinges if the door is too heavy.",
      "content": "Install extra hinges if the door is too heavy. Stop by your local hardware or home improvement store and pick up another set of hinges. Then, remove the cabinet door from the unit and lay it on a flat surface. Screw the new sets of hinges along the side, so the cabinet door gets plenty of support. Once all the hinges are in place, reattach the door to the cabinet and tighten all the screws into place. [6] X Research source Take a picture of your current hinges before heading to the store. This way, it’ll be easier to scope out a matching hinge. New hinges usually come with a template, which shows you where each hinge needs to go. Before reinstalling the door, reference the template and mark the cabinet where the new hinges will go. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill in any stripped screw holes with toothpicks. Remove the cabinet hinges from the physical cabinet, leaving them still attached to the cabinet door. Set the cabinet door aside, and grab a container of toothpicks. Dunk the ends of several toothpicks in wood glue, and stick them directly into the stripped screw hole. Once the opening is completely filled, break off the ends of the toothpicks so the screw hole is level and flush with the rest of the cabinet door. Wait for the glue to dry completely, and then re-screw the cabinet hinges into the repaired screw holes. [8] X Research source The toothpicks act like a new layer of wood. As you reinstall the cabinet hinges, the screw threads will get tightly embedded in the glued toothpicks."
