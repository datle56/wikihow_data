      "content": "A “Discord kitten” is someone in a sugar baby relationship on Discord. “Discord” refers to a downloadable social platform where users can join servers and chat with other users, while “kitten” represents young women on the platform. People have used the term both ironically and seriously since the mid-to-late 2010s, when the phrase first came to exist. “Discord Kitten” really earned its spot within internet vernacular when one netizen coined the joke “Daddy will be back on Discord soon, Kitten.” [1] X Research source A sugar baby is an individual who gets paid in some way to be in a relationship with someone else, sometimes to a sexual degree. Ultimately, the expectations of a sugar baby relationship depend on the individuals involved, so it’s important for both parties to be really clear about what they want. [2] X Research source While sugar baby relationships can be safe if both parties set clear boundaries, the partnership can easily become unhealthy and rooted in a sense of obligation. Selling one’s services as a sugar baby can also have long-term effects on a person’s sense of self-worth, and can cause them to be unfairly judged by people they know. [3] X Research source The term “Discord kitten” is often associated with underaged participants, according to online users. [4] X Research source Because these arrangements are essentially transactional relationships, it isn’t healthy or safe for an underaged individual to be a part of one. “E-kitten” is another word for “Discord kitten.” [5] X Research source The term Discord kitten is most associated with women, but anyone can theoretically be one."

      "content": "The term “Discord kitten” originated in 2016 but became well-known later. At the very end of 2016, user SlaytypeDA on Twitter/X tweeted “join the discord 😃 kitten,” which didn’t gain much traction at the time. In 2017 and 2018, the term gained a wider spread on Reddit from users both advertising themselves as “kittens” and those criticizing the use of the word in casual conversation. [6] X Research source Through various posts and memes on Twitter/X, the term “kitten” and “Discord kitten” continued to grow in terms of meme status."

      "content": "A Discord kitten relationship is like an online sugar baby relationship. Self-proclaimed “discord kittens” will advertise a little bit of information about themselves and their interests, and may offer to reach out to certain users who reply to their post. These relationships may operate like a standard sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship, where the sugar “daddy” gives the sugar “baby” gifts as a sort of payment for the time they spend together. Given how meme-centric the term “Discord kitten” is, it’s hard to say how serious/unserious an actual Discord kitten relationship would be. Some people claim (often in a joking way) that Discord kittens often get Nitro (Discord’s premium membership) from their sugar parent. Discord Nitro membership has two tiers (Nitro Basic and Nitro), both of which allow users to send larger files over the platform, use a wider range of emojis, and apply animated “Super Reactions” to messages.

      "content": "Create a kitten profile for yourself if you’re 18 or older. If you’re already on Discord, it might help to make an entirely new profile and persona for yourself that’s separate from your old account. Jazz up your profile with aesthetic templates , and feel free to use plenty of cute emojis and kaomojis to really make yourself stand out. Discord kitten relationships are conducted online, so your persona will be a big part of the relationship. Discord kittens are often associated with cutesy emojis like UwU (closed eyes with a cat mouth). Most people offering themselves as Discord daddies will likely be over 18, so it’s very important that you are 18 or older yourself before becoming a Discord kitten."

      "content": "Set boundaries in your relationship and stand by them. In any type of sugar baby relationship, it’s important to be crystal-clear about what is and isn’t expected within the relationship. [8] X Research source Don’t agree to any conditions that you aren’t completely comfortable with, and don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself if your Discord daddy tries to manipulate you into doing something out of your comfort zone. [9] X Research source As a general rule of thumb, never give out any personal information to people you don’t know well, even if they’re offering to give you gifts or buy you things. If you ever feel uncomfortable with an online interaction, don’t be afraid to cut ties—you should never feel forced into an unhappy (or even unsafe) situation for someone else’s enjoyment. Like any sugar baby relationship, the relationship between a Discord kitten and daddy doesn’t have to be unhealthy if clear boundaries are set and respected. However, these relationships can quickly get toxic if the Discord daddy tries to guilt the kitten into doing or sending things out of a financial obligation. [10] X Research source"
