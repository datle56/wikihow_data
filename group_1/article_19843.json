Though we've listed them in an order in this guide, you can complete them in any order: Gear up three buildings in your Home Village Upgrade any Builder Base troop to level 18 Upgrade any Builder Base defense to level 9 Upgrade your Builder Base heroes to a total level of 45"

How to gear up each building in your Home Village by doing the following: Cannon: To gear up a Cannon in the Home Village, it'll need to be at least Level 7, and your Double Cannon in the Builder Base needs to be at least Level 4. It costs 1.5 million gold. Archer Tower: To gear up an Archer Tower in the Home Village, it'll need to be at least Level 10, and your Archer Tower in the Builder Base needs to be at least Level 6. It costs 4 million gold. Mortar: To gear up a Mortar in the Home Village, it'll need to be at least Level 8, and your Multi-Mortar in the Builder Base needs to be at least Level 8.

The Baby Dragons are unlocked at an earlier level than the Power P.E.K.K.A., so they require more resources to upgrade. However, this unit is very popular in the Clash of Clans meta as you unlock them at Builder Hall level 4 and Builder Barracks level 6. [2] X Research source If you go for the Power P.E.K.K.A., you'll need Builder Barracks level 10 and Builder Hall level 8. However, the Power P.E.K.K.A. is unlocked at level 13, so you'll need less resources to upgrade it to level 18. [3] X Research source"

The best option is to upgrade your Multi-Mortar one more time to level 9, as you had to upgrade it to level 8 for the gear up requirement.

The most efficient way to reach the target of 45 combined levels is to level your Battle Machine to level 23 and your Battle Copter to level 22, but you can do any combination depending on what level your Battle Machine is currently at. This is the most time-consuming step in getting the sixth builder. It's not recommended to level either of your heroes past level 25 for this step, however, to maximize efficiency."
