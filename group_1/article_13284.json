      "title": "Divide your coneflowers in the spring or late fall.",
      "content": "Divide your coneflowers in the spring or late fall. Planting in the early spring is ideal because the plants have yet to bloom, while fall also works because the blossoms die down. Conducting division during these months is the least invasive and will minimize damage done to the plant. [3] X Research source Summer is not an ideal month for dividing coneflowers because they are in bloom. This means they are putting a lot of energy into flower production and less on roots, making them more vulnerable. If you absolutely have to divide in the summer, do it on a cloudy day and cut back flower heads to promote root development. [4] X Research source After division, keep your plants watered and screen them from the sun for 2 to 3 weeks using mesh netting or another kind of screen."

      "content": "Choose the planting location for your coneflower divisions. If you're planting the flowers in your garden, determine the general location for each before uprooting them. Coneflowers are adaptable to many soil types, but they grow best in soil with a pH between 6.0 to 7.0. [5] X Research source If you're dividing your coneflowers from a pot into your garden, make sure the new holes are around twice the pot's diameter. [6] X Research source"

Use a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) deep. [7] X Research source Adding sand can also help loosen the soil.

Throw down a 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) layer of organic plant matter to ensure your plants get the proper nutrients. [9] X Research source The plant matter should comprise about 25 percent of the soil's volume. [10] X Research source Compress a handful of soil into a ball and gently poke it. If it doesn't fall apart, it's too wet. [11] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source Adding another 20 to 25 percent of moisture retaining material like perlite, vermiculite, or peat helps if your soil is dry. [12] X Research source If it's too wet, mix in 20 to 25 percent horticulture sand, which will improve drainage. Mix in some bone meal to encourage new root growth."

Continue doing this around the circumference of the coneflower to loosen the roots and isolate the clump. Water the soil 2 to 3 days before uprooting to make the process much easier."

Be gentle and try not to damage any of the roots. If you find any soggy, slimy, or discolored roots, remove them from the rootball with your garden pruners."

      "content": "Gently pull apart the roots of your coneflower into separate sections with your hands. Once the roots of the coneflower are exposed, look for the least dense spots. The coneflower has a spreading root system, which means pulling it apart with your hands is possible. [15] X Research source Take care not to disrupt the roots unnecessarily."

      "content": "Use a sharp spade to divide the coneflower if it has a dense root system that can't be pulled apart by your hands or pitchforks. Lay the rootball on its side and position the spade in the center of its crown (the combination of its aboveground parts like stems, leaves, and reproductive structures). Split the crown in half with a quick jab from the spade. [17] X Research source Continue splitting until you get the amount of pieces you need. Sharp spades are much more effective for cutting roots than flat spades. Don't divide for the sake of dividing. Gaining 3 or 4 healthy plants is better than 5 or 6 dead ones. Optimal size is around a quarter the size of the original rootball, although you can make them smaller if you don't have enough space in your garden. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim back the coneflower's root mass to give it room to grow. After division, trim back about one-third of each of the divided plants' root mass. This will give the plant room to send out new, fresh roots. They will be stronger, more efficient, and better organized in their new location than the ones they're succeeding. If you like, you can trim the top of the flower off to promote root growth. In many cases, the top will end up dying following division."

If you don't have space in your garden and your coneflowers are small enough, you can divide them into containers or pots. Make sure they are big enough to accommodate their original depth. Fill the pot or container with firm soil around the roots to minimize air pockets [19] X Research source and water them well to prevent them from drying out. [20] X Research source Use deep, plastic or resin pots/containers that contain drainage holes. Make sure they are 2 to 3 gallons (7.6 to 11.4 L). [21] X Research source Line the bottom with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of crushed gravel for adequate drainage. [22] X Research source"

In terms of depth, it should be equal to the original plant's root size from the base to the crown. [23] X Research source To maximize your plant's survival, dig deeper by 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) and fill it back up with soil. Double digging loosens the soil below the rootball, promoting straight root growth. [24] X Research source Keep the rootball level with the soil surface. [25] X Research source"
