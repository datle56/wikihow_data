      "content": "Bend your knees and keep your shoulders still. Almost every movement in Tahitian dance requires bent knees and still shoulders. Though some moves require you to bend your knees deeper, remember that they should already be at least slightly bent. [1] X Research source This will help your hips move more freely."

      "content": "Snap your hips side to side while bending your opposite knees to practice Tamau. Start with your feet spaced slightly apart and turned out into a shallow V. Bend your knees so your knee caps are touching, and keep your back straight. Extend your arms to the side, as though mimicking the wings of a bird. Now, snap your hip to one side, bending the opposite leg deeper while lifting that heel. Then, snap your hip to the other side, bending the other leg and lifting the heel. [2] X Research source Once you’ve mastered the basic movement, you can speed it up. You'll probably need to practice this movement for a few minutes, playing around with different speeds. Don’t forget to lift your heels, as this helps the mobility of your hips. A more advanced version of this movement is to walk while doing the Tamau. Step forward, to the side, and back, all while snapping your hips in the Tamau movement."

      "content": "Master the Ami by circling your hips as you bend alternating knees. Start with your feet close together, and your knees slightly bent. Push your hips forward and bend your right knee. Then circle your hips around clock-wise as you straighten your bent right knee. By the time your hips are halfway through the circle (your back will be arched as your hips circle behind you), you will start to bend your left knee. Move your hips slowly to complete the circle as you straighten the left knee. [3] X Research source Continue practicing the Ami slowly until you have mastered the movement, then you can speed it up. Take care to keep your upper body and shoulders still. Keep your core engaged to protect your back. Once you’ve mastered the Ami in the clockwise direction, practice moving your hips counter-clockwise."

      "content": "Swing your hips in a figure eight motion to learn the Varu. Start by moving your weight over to the left leg and pushing out your left hip. Keep your right leg bent and slightly turned out, lifting the heel of your right leg. Then, switch to the other side by bending both knees deeply as you shift your weight to the right, snap out your right hip, and turn out your left leg while lifting the left heel. [4] X Research source Once you’ve mastered the leg movement, it is time to add the figure eight movement into your hips. Instead of just snapping your hip to each side, move your hips in the shape of the number 8 as you shift your weight from side to side."

      "title": "Move your hips in a quick circle to learn the Fa’arapu.",
      "content": "Move your hips in a quick circle to learn the Fa’arapu. Start with bent knees and a straight back. Make sure your shoulders are down and your feet are firmly planted into the floor. Straighten your pelvis, so your tailbone points to the ground. Make sure your hips are relaxed and able to move. Swing your hips around in a circle, just like with the Ami movement. [5] X Research source The Fa’arapu is done incredibly quickly, so work on speed as you practice. If you are struggling with this circular movement, start with isolated hip movements. With bent knees and a straight back, push your hips forward, then push them to the right, then the back, and finally, push them to the left. Now, repeat those isolated movements, but connect them into a circular motion."

      "content": "Sign up for a local Tahitian dance course in your area. The benefit of finding a local class is the personal instruction the class will provide. Tahitian dance classes generally consist of practicing key hip movements, routines that travel across the floor, and short choreography. Many of these classes also go into detail about the costumes, music and cultural significance of Tahitian dance. [7] X Research source Whether or not you will be able to find a local Tahitian dance course will depend on where you live. If you live in a city, you’ll have a good chance of finding one. You can also try looking for classes at your local community center, community college, or local fitness studios. Similar to a Zumba class, a Tahitian dance class is a wonderful form of exercise. Classes will provide stretches and isolations that tone your abs and thigh muscles, and the step combinations help to improve coordination."
