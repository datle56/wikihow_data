      "content": "Rinse the barley off under lukewarm water. Pour all of the barley into a strainer, then set the strainer in your sink. Use the water to wash off dust and other debris. If you notice any shells or other fragments among the barley, pick them out and throw them away."

      "content": "Combine 1 cup (225 g) of barley with 3 cups (710 mL) of water. Pour everything into a pot on your stove, stirring the grain until it is all submerged. You can cook more barley if you need to, but adjust the amount of water you use to compensate. Try to keep the ratio at 1 part barley to 3 parts water to ensure the barley has plenty of water to cook in. [1] X Research source For example, to make ½ cup (112.5 g) of barley, use only 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 mL) of water. For additional flavoring, cook the barley in chicken or vegetable stock instead of water."

    {
      "title": "Simmer the barley over medium-low heat for an hour.",
      "content": "Simmer the barley over medium-low heat for an hour. Bring the water to a boil before reducing the heat. Then, cover the pot to reduce the amount of time needed for the barley to boil. Set your timer, checking the pot on occasion to make sure the water continues to gently bubble. The required cooking time may vary depending on your stove’s settings. You can cook the barley without a lid. You may need to boil the barley for a little longer, but it will eventually cook through."

      "title": "Check for doneness or taste the barley for a soft, chewy texture.",
      "content": "Check for doneness or taste the barley for a soft, chewy texture. Barley expands as it cooks, so the finished product will look about 3 times bigger than what you put in the pot. If you’re still unsure that it is done, try the barley – if it's a soft and chewy, it's done! If you are familiar with other types of barley, pot barley is a little chewier than pearl barley but not as much as hulled barley. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add more water if the barley isn’t done cooking and the pot is dry.",
      "content": "Add more water if the barley isn’t done cooking and the pot is dry. Your barley may have absorbed all of the water in the pot, even if it isn't finished yet. Try adding about 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 cup (59 to 118 mL) of water and cooking until the barley reaches the consistency you desire. [3] X Research source If you still see water, you don’t need to add any more. Check the barley every 5 minutes or so to prevent it from overcooking and add more water as needed. Take it out of the pot when it reaches the consistency you desire."

      "title": "Drain any remaining water from the pot.",
      "content": "Drain any remaining water from the pot. Put on a pot-holder or use an oven mitt to avoid scorching your hands, then take the pot to the sink. The easiest way to drain excess water is by pouring the pot's contents into a strainer. You can also try tipping the pot to let out the excess water or moving the barley out of the pot with a slotted spoon. [4] X Research source If you don’t see a lot of water in the pot, you may be better off letting the barley absorb it. Cover the pot and let the barley rest for about 10 minutes.

      "content": "Store leftover barley in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Move the barley into an airtight plastic container within 2 hours of cooking it, then refrigerate it right away to avoid harmful bacterial growth. Dispose of any leftover barley when t gets too mushy or begins rotting. [7] X Research source You can also store the barley in a sealed bag or container in the freezer for up to 1 month."

    {
      "title": "Soak the barley for 4 hours if possible.",
      "content": "Soak the barley for 4 hours if possible. Soaking the barley saturates it, reducing the cooking time it needs to get soft and fluffy. If you have time to spare, fill a bowl with 4 times more lukewarm water than the amount of barley you plan on cooking. Add the barley and let it rest there for a few hours. [8] X Research source For example, if you plan on cooking 1 c (225 g) of barley, place it in 4 cups (950 mL) of water. If you can, soak the barley overnight for best results."

      "title": "Fill a pressure cooker with about 3 cups (710 mL) of water.",
      "content": "Fill a pressure cooker with about 3 cups (710 mL) of water. This is the standard amount of water to use for 1 cup (225 g) of barley. If you plan on cooking a different amount of barley, adjust the amount of water you use. No matter how much barley you make, keep the ratio around 3 parts water to 1 part pot barley in the pressure cooker. [9] X Research source If you didn’t soak the barley in advance, you may need more water. Add about 4 1 ⁄ 2 cups (1,100 mL) of water per 1 cup of barley. For additional flavoring, cook the barley in stock or broth. Alternatively, use it as part of a soup or stew you make in the pressure cooker."

      "title": "Cook the barley for 20 minutes on high heat.",
      "content": "Cook the barley for 20 minutes on high heat. Stir the barley into the water, making sure all of the grains are submerged before you close the lid. The barley will cook relatively quickly. When it’s done, vent the steam and taste the barley to make sure it is tender but slightly chewy. You can also simmer the barley by utilizing low heat, high pressure settings. Cooking barley this way is as slow as it is on the stove, but the grains may taste more tender when they’re done."

      "content": "Serve the barley and store the leftovers for up to 5 days. After using the barley, move any leftovers into a resealable container within 2 hours of cooking. Make sure the container is airtight. As long as it is properly covered, the barley should last a while, but throw it away if it tastes mushy or smells rancid. [10] X Research source The cooked barley can be stored in the freezer for up to a month, but make sure it is in a sealed, freezer-safe container or bag."

You may be able to use something like a skillet if it is large enough to hold all the ingredients. If you are uncertain how safe a dish is for oven use, avoid using it. [11] X Research source A 1 1 ⁄ 2 US quarts (1,400 mL) dish is the perfect size for the barley and liquid ingredients, but use a bigger dish or multiple dishes if you plan on making more."

      "content": "Add water, butter, and salt to the barley. Set a separate pot on your stove and boil about 2 cups (470 mL) of water. When it is done, pour it directly onto the barley. Then, immediately add 1 tbsp (225 g) of butter and 1 tsp (5.69 g) of salt, mixing them until they disperse in the water. Increase the amount of water you use if you plan on cooking larger batches of barley. Keep the ratio 2 parts water to 1 part barley. [12] X Research source You can also use stock or broth for more flavor. Vegetable stock is a good choice if you plan on cooking vegetables with the dish. If you like your barley to taste more buttery, add up to 3 tbsp (675 g) of butter. This can improve your dish if you add ingredients like mushrooms, peppers, or celery. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Add vegetables or seasonings to the dish if you desire. Baking the barley in water will give you a simple dish that is a lot like barley cooked on the stove. For more complex flavors, try incorporating herbs and vegetables into the dish. You can make the barley into a casserole that goes well as a side to a main course. [14] X Research source For example, brown some sliced mushrooms and garlic, then add them to the oven dish. You can also soften onions, celery, or peppers. For seasoning, pour some thyme into the dish."

[15] X Research source While barley can be cooked in an uncovered dish, it may take a little longer. Check the barley to make sure it expanded and softened.
