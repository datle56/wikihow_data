      "content": "Enjoy a neat pour using 2 fl oz (59 mL) of Bacardi Limon. Get a clean lowball glass and set it out on your counter. Use a jigger, or a measuring cup to measure out 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of Bacardi Limon. Slowly pour the Bacardi Limon into your glass to avoid spills. Then, enjoy your Bacardi Limon neat. [1] X Research source You can also measure the Bacardi by eye and simply fill the bottom 1/8 of your glass. Exact measurements aren’t as important when it comes to pouring neat pours since you aren’t mixing anything. The term “neat” is used in bartending to refer to a drink that is not mixed or poured over ice. A jigger is a bartending tool that looks like 2 cones connected to one another. The smaller cone-shaped cup is usually a 1 fl oz (30 mL) measurement, while the bigger cup is measures out 2 fl oz (59 mL). While a lowball glass is ideal for neat pours of spirits, you can use any kind of glass that you’d like. A lowball glass is also known as an Old Fashioned glass or tumbler. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour 2 fl oz (59 mL) of Bacardi Limon over ice to have it on the rocks. Fill a clean lowball glass with 3-4 ice cubes. Then, fill a jigger or measuring cup with 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of Bacardi Limon. Add the rum directly to the ice. Pour slowly to avoid splashing the rum off of the ice and out of your glass. Enjoy your Bacardi Limon on the rocks and garnish with a lemon or lime wedge if you’d like. [3] X Research source In bartending terms, “on the rocks” refers to a drink that is poured over ice. Do not used crushed ice for a neat pour. Crushed ice will dissolve too quickly and dilute your drink before you have a chance to enjoy it."
