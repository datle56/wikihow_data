All sorts of different fish live in public lakes, rivers, and ponds, so you can always find something good to catch. The fish come close to the shore in the spring and autumn as they prepare for winter. In the summer, they tend to be in deeper waters, so take a boat out from the shore. [1] X Research source P Secluded spots around ponds or levees outside of town are good bets. Make sure you’re not crossing private property or fishing in a place that doesn’t allow it. Also, be careful not to trample plants along the shore. If you live on the coast, consider ocean fishing. If you get a separate ocean fishing license and rods and bait for the specific fish you want to catch, it’s the same as freshwater fishing."

You could also ask around at angling shops, marinas, and camping supply stores for tips. [2] X Expert Source Kathy Sparrow, MA Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 1 April 2020. There are so many types of fish that getting started can feel a little overwhelming at first, so choose a type of fish to focus on. Bass, crappies, sunfish, bluegills, and catfish are a few varieties that are relatively easy for beginners to reel in. Catfish are common all over the U.S., for instance. Look for areas with deep water around large creeks and rivers. Head to them in spring and fall to get a fish that makes for a tasty meal fried and served at your table. [3] X Research source"

Take some time to read up about the kind of fish you want to catch, where they live, and what kind of bait you need to succeed. Fish populations change from area to area and from freshwater to saltwater. Sometimes you have to plan out a trip to get what you want, but it’s a chance to see something new! [4] X Research source Go to the Great Lakes region of the U.S. for a variety of freshwater fish, for instance. Walleyes and northern pikes are a few popular catches. Set up on the shore and cast your line. In the southern U.S., gar and bowfins live in swampy areas. Flounder and perch are a couple of common catches to aim for out there. The northwest part of the U.S. has a lot of rainbow trout for good eating or trophy photos to show your friends. Crappie, walleye, and bass are also pretty common and easy to catch there. If you’re unsure about what fish are in a body of water, throw in some food scraps and wait. See what fish come to the surface. Identifying the fish is tricky when you’re starting out since you don’t know how different fish behave, but it’s something you can learn by fishing often."

      "content": "Fish at places near deep water or moving currents. Most big fish spend the days in deeper water and come into shallow areas to feed. They don’t spend a lot of time swimming around these shallow areas. They also don’t like swimming against strong currents, so park yourself at the end of one. Keep an eye out for fish activity, such as bubbles, splashes, or even flocks of hungry birds. [5] X Research source Fish go where the food is. Look for spots with reeds, logs, and rocks, especially near sudden drop-offs. These places also provide plenty of cover for times when the fish feel threatened. If you see currents of water, look for spots where the faster and slower-moving currents meet. The fish usually sit out under these spots to catch food drifting on the currents."

Setting your alarm for 4:30 in the morning isn’t the most fun part of a trip, but it’s worth it when the fish start biting. Take advantage of the early morning hours, especially in the summer, to beat other fishers to your favorite spots. [6] X Research source If the thought of getting up before the crack of dawn makes you groan, make evening plans. Head out to the water around dusk. You can find plenty of fish in shallow waters in spring and fall."

Check with a state health department, natural resources department, or something similar. You could also call to talk to a park ranger if you fish at a park. If you’re not going to eat what you catch, you don’t have to worry about this as much. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source As a rule of thumb, bigger fish that eat other fish have more pollution. Big fish like tuna tend to have a high level of mercury than smaller fish that eat insects don’t have. It also depends on the quality of the water where you’re fishing. Remember any catch and release policies your local government may have. Some places require you to keep or put back certain fish."

Getting a license is easy since all you need to do is type in your personal information and pay a small fee. The license is then sent to your email that day to print out and take with you on your trip. [8] X Expert Source Kathy Sparrow, MA Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 1 April 2020. You could also call the department or visit them to pay for your license. Have them email the license to you or print it out at the office unless you don’t mind waiting 2 to 4 weeks for it to come in the mail. You need to get a license for every state or province you plan on visiting. A license from one area isn’t valid in another area. Most places offer various licenses that last from a single day up to 10 years. There are also licenses for kids, but sometimes kids under 16 don’t need a license to fish."

You might be in awe the first time you check out the rod selection at a sporting goods store, but you don’t need to break the bank. For beginners, stick with a 7 ft (2.1 m), medium-strength rod for something with a good balance of range and flexibility. Select one with a spinning reel, since it is easier to set up and cast than a baitcaster reel . Flexible rods are weaker but less likely to snap than stiffer ones. You won’t catch big game fish with your basic rod, but it will help you land a wide variety of common fish. If you’re unsure about what to get, ask store employees for advice."

A small fish isn’t going to go after a big, intimidating hook. For that reason, start with a 6 to 10 hook to catch plenty of fish. Upgrade to a hook anywhere from 2 to 3/0 to use larger bait for bigger fish. [10] X Research source The hook numbering scale is a little weird, but it’s not too confusing. The smallest hook is a 16, and a medium-sized hook is a 1. Larger hooks rank from 1/0 to 6/0. If you’re unsure what size of hook to get, discuss the sizing system with someone at your local tackle shop. If you fish often, have a variety of hook sizes so you can adapt to all sorts of environments."

Lures resemble actual bait and will fool fish. Keep in mind that live bait has to be kept in water in an insulated cooler to stay alive. Most fish eat insects and aquatic life, so bait shops offer a wide selection to choose from if you’re looking for a more authentic fishing experience. Try getting a wide variety of baits so you can change your setup according to what fish are active in the area. If you want to catch something without using your rod, try trapping your own bait. For example, catch some minnows to lure in fish that eat smaller fish, such as pike, bass, and walleye. If you’re angling for a specific type of fish, research its favorite bait. For instance, many saltwater fish like shrimp. Other fish eat food ranging from salmon eggs to bacon and cheese. Live bait such as worms, crickets, and minnows are some of the most popular options. However, artificial baits such as lures and baits are also commonly used."

The easiest way to do this is with a plastic bucket. Add some ice from the cooler along with the dead fish. Keep the fish well-chilled until you get a chance to move them into your freezer at home. [13] X Research source A fish cage is a great choice for keeping live fish trapped in the water. Many cages also serve as traps for smaller fish, such as minnows. You don’t have to kill anything while you’re fishing. Practice catch and release fishing to return fish to the water. You won’t need an ice chest unless you’re bringing along live bait."

Thread the line through the hook, then bring it back toward the reel, wrapping it around itself 4 to 6 times. Feed the end back through the loop and pull it tight. Now that you have a basic knot, cut any excess off the tail end of the line with scissors. [14] X Research source In fly fishing , tying the right knot is half of the sport.

If you’re taking on swift water, like in a river or stream, use a weight called a sinker so it reaches the fish. If you’re in still waters, a bobber is a small ball that helps you see when a fish grabs onto the hook. [15] X Research source Sinkers, metal weights, pull your line further into the water, down to where the fish are likely to be.

[16] X Research source Jamming a hook through a worm is a little gross, but you can’t catch a fish if the worm falls off.

Start by holding your rod with two hands, place your index finger around the rod's trigger, and take the line between your fingers. Pull back the rod and flick it forward while releasing the line with your fingers. Use the reel to adjust the line, leaving about 6 in (15 cm) of it hanging from the end of the rod. Then, pinch the line to the rod with your thumb and index finger. [17] X Expert Source Michael Reynolds Professional Fishing Instructor Expert Interview. 26 February 2021. To cast it, draw your arm back so the rod is vertical, then snap it forward again. Releasing the line depends somewhat on the type of reel you're using, but if you've got a closed push-button spinner reel, the job is pretty straightforward. Pushing the button releases the line and letting go stops it."

      "title": "Wait",
      "content": "Wait patiently for a fish to bite. Fishing is a waiting game, so be prepared to wait in silence for something to go for your bait. Some fishers reel in the line slowly, jerking the rod a little to give fish the impression that the bait is alive. If you’re not having any luck sitting back and waiting, try moving the line a little bit. [18] X Research source Fish are startled by loud noises and thrashing. While you can bring a radio and talk to anyone with you, keep the volume down, especially when other people are fishing too. Watch your line and bobber carefully. You can tell when something bites since you feel the line jerk forward. Wait to let any slack out of the line before reeling the fish in. Sometimes you may end up in spots where the fish aren’t biting. If you’re there for 15 minutes without a bite, try moving somewhere else. Finding a good spot can take a little bit of patience. Fishing is not a game of instant gratification. It requires patience and persistence. You have to keep trying and casting your line repeatedly, even if you don't get a fish at the first attempt. Remember that fishing is also about enjoying nature, so sit back and relax while waiting for a bite."

Quickly jerk the rod upward to set the hook and reel in the fish using a steady motion. Be sure to reel in the fish slowly, so it doesn't get off the hook. Expect the fish to fight back once you hook it. Be gentle when pulling it out of the water. If you no longer feel anything pulling on the line, that means the fish got off and may have swum off with the bait. [19] X Research source Sometimes determining if you have a bite is difficult.
