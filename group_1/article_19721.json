A dog or puppy with the above signs of infection should have a stool sample collected and examined under a microscope. Whipworms eggs are only shed (passed) about every three days so some veterinarians will probably request a three day stool sample collection. [2] X Research source Diagnostic Parasitology for Veterinary Technicians. Charles M. Hendrix and Ed Robinson. Elsevier Health Sciences Once the samples are collected they are processed in the veterinarian’s laboratory using special techniques. These include fecal floatation (using fluid to “float” the eggs to the surface) and/or centrifuging. The veterinarian or veterinary technician looks for the oval shaped and thick shelled eggs under the microscope after processing."

The scientific name of these whip worms in dogs are Trichuris vulpis and Trichuris campanula. [5] X Research source A whipworm infection is typically called Trichuriasis. They get their common name, whipworms, from their shape. The back end is thick like the handle of a whip while the front end is threadlike like a whip. [6] X Research source They live in the large intestine and cecum, a pouch like outcropping of the colon. Whipworms burrow their threadlike end into the lining of the large intestine and then they hatch. [7] X Research source This attachment irritates the colon, producing mucous and bleeding."
