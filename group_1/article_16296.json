Fake Yonex Black BG80 Power strings tend to feel smooth, similar to a fishing line or optic cables. So, if your strings are flimsy and smooth, they’re most likely fake. [1] X Research source"

The package housing real Yonex Black BG80 Power strings have a dedicated opening for the strings, while the package for fake Yonex Black BG80 Power strings does not.

      "content": "Color that isn't actually sold by Yonex. Many counterfeit BG80 Power strings are sold in colors that aren’t sold by Yonex. Check their website to make sure the color that you’re looking to get your hands on is actually available. If it’s not sold by them or a reputable retailer, the product may be fake. Some Yonex string colors are only available in certain regions. Asia has a larger selection of colors because there is a larger demand for strings in the region."

      "content": "Suspiciously low price. Yonex products tend to be on the more expensive end, so coming across a listing that has BG80 Power strings for $5 or $10 is a strong indicator that the product is counterfeit. Suspiciously low prices or prices that seem too good to be true are often counterfeit, especially on sites with third-party sellers. [2] X Research source"

Look for typos, misspellings, or improper labeling, as they’re all indicators of a fake product. If their products have poor reviews or the seller doesn’t have a history of selling products, be wary, as the BG80 Power that you’re looking at may be fake. [3] X Research source"

Check the Yonex website and make sure the price of the racket you’re looking to purchase has a price similar to that of authentic Yonex rackets. New Yonex rackets tend to go for anywhere from $200 to $300, so if you see a listing that advertises a new Yonex racket that’s going for $60, chances are it’s too good to be true."

The number on the shaft increases with every racket that’s manufactured. The number on the cone has the production date in DDMMYXCC format. Check that both numbers are there and laser engraved to verify the authenticity of your racket. Inauthentic serial numbers are typically bright white and look printed onto the racket rather than engraved.

They are both functional when it comes to delivering a birdie across the net, but fake rackets are quick to break and fall apart. Since you’re still learning the game, go with a lower-end name-brand racket rather than a fake racket to avoid risking quality. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "The BG80 Power adds more power to soft hits than the BG80 does. The BG80 Power is a bit softer than the BG80, providing more repulsion power, so softer hits are still powerful. The BG80 Power typically withstands higher tensions than the BG80, making it a bit more versatile in that regard. The BG80 Power tends to be more forgiving for players, assisting them through the repulsion power. [10] X Research source The BG80 Power is a 7 on the durability scale, while the BG80 is a 6."

The lack of repulsive string makes the BG80 easier to control than other rackets, which also makes it useful for people who play at a higher level. It is used by pros like Lin Dan, Viktor Axelsen, and Yugo Kobayashi. [11] X Research source If you string your BG80 over 6, it isn’t going to last very long."

How long your BG80 lasts depends on how often you use your racket, how hard your hits are, the string tension, and other factors. However, typically, the BG80 lasts for two to three months. While the durability of the BG80 is fair, it is lower than other Yonex models. [12] X Research source Playing with sliced strokes can cause your strings to break faster. Storing your racket in a cold or dry place can shorten the strings’ lifespan."

      "content": "Restring your racket every few months and avoid bending or throwing it. As you play badminton matches, your strings will become worn and lose tension. As your string loses tension, you will lose control and your hits will become less powerful. To maintain your strings, restring your racket once or twice a year if you’re a casual player, every 3-4 months if you play regularly, and every 1-2 months if you play competitively. Avoid being careless with your racket. Don’t bend or throw it, as that can damage the frame. [13] X Research source Stringing your racket to a high tension will cause it to degrade faster. If your string breaks, get it restrung immediately."

The first, located on the racket’s shaft, increases with each racket that’s produced. The second, located on the cone, displays the date, month, and year of production. If either of these numbers are off, that can indicate your racket is fake."
