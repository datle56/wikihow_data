      "content": "Watch for changes in behavior. Not all rabbits are friendly. But if your rabbit usually leaps around and greets, but suddenly ceases to do so, this is an indication that something might be wrong. Watch for signs that your rabbit is less mobile than usual, such as hunching over or limping. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Observe eating habits. If your rabbit is not eating normally, it might be ill. Watch for leftover food from the last feeding. Also, monitor its droppings. If there are no droppings in the litterbox this indicates that the rabbit is not eating. Be attentive to the size and shape of the droppings. Ideally, the droppings should be large and round. If they are small, irregular, or liquid, it is possible that your rabbit is sick. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen for tooth grinding. Your rabbit will often make a soft, grinding sound with its teeth when it is happy. However, if the sound is louder than normal it could be a bad sign. Often this is an indication that your rabbit is in pain. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Test for signs of illness.",
      "content": "Test for signs of illness. Begin by offering your rabbit its favorite treat. If it refuses to eat the treat, it might be sick. Move on to testing the rabbit’s temperature. If it is well, the temperature should be between 101⁰F-103⁰F. You should ask your veterinarian to demonstrate how to take your rabbit’s temperature. If you do this in advance of any signs of illness, you will be prepared in case of an emergency. To take your bunny’s temperature you will want to place it on its back, either on a padded surface or your lap. Hold your rabbit’s head and shoulder against your stomach, so that its back curls into a “C” shape. Secure the rabbit’s back legs so that it does not kick. Once it is calm insert a lubricated plastic thermometer no more than one inch into its rectum. Be sure that the rabbit is well restrained and is not able to move while you take its temperature. [5] X Research source Do your best to cool your rabbit off if it has a high fever by putting cold objects up against its ears until the temperature drops to less than 104 degrees.

      "title": "Recognize tooth disease.",
      "content": "Recognize tooth disease. Dental disease can be caused by a misalignment of the teeth or the wearing down of a tooth. This can be a dangerous situation. It can cause your bunny to stop eating, endangering its health. Signs of tooth disease include loss of appetite, hair loss on chin and neck, slobbering, and drooling. Your rabbit might still show signs that it has an appetite, but is unable to eat. Perhaps it will approach food, even pick it up, before backing off and dropping it. If you believe that your rabbit might have tooth disease rub its cheeks. Any evidence of discomfort would suggest that it has a dental problem. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Feed your rabbit soft food.",
      "content": "Feed your rabbit soft food. Until you can reach a veterinarian, try to force-feed your rabbit canned pumpkin, baby-food, or veggies. You can purchase a feeding syringe from a pet store. These can be used to insert fluid directly into the rabbit’s mouth. To prepare for syringe feeding, wrap your rabbit in a towel and secure its head with an index finger under the head, and the thumb on the opposite end of the head, under the base of the skull. Insert the syringe into the gap between the incisors and cheek teeth. Begin by inserting no more than .2 to .5 milliliters (0.02 fl oz) of food and never feed more than 1 milliliter (0.034 fl oz). Too much food at one time creates the risk that the rabbit will choke. Go slowly. Then repeat with 5 to 10 milliliters (0.17 to 0.34 fl oz) of water."

Your rabbit might also stretch out, as if it is pressing its belly against the floor. [8] X Research source Gastrointestinal problems are usually accompanied by a drastic, sometimes complete decrease in fecal production. Keep your rabbit comfortable and hydrated until you get to the vet. Gas pain will typically cause below average body temperature. If your rabbit’s temperature is below 101⁰F, it might suffer from gas pain."
