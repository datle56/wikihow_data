A leaking shower head can be caused by clogged holes, resulting from lime and other mineral deposits that build up in the holes over time. [1] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. If you’re unsure what could be causing your leaking shower head, start here. It’s a simple, cheap fix that doesn’t require you to take apart your entire shower fixture. Shut off your water supply before you get started. You can do this in one of two ways: locate and turn off the shutoff valve to the bathroom or turn off the main water line. [2] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. It will probably be easier on your household to turn off the water supply directly to the bathroom instead of cutting off the supply to the entire house. While not all homes have a shutoff valve to the bathroom, if there is one it can usually be found somewhere near the shower or in the basement."

      "content": "Remove the shower head faceplate or the entire shower head. Because you’ll have to soak and scrub the parts of the shower head that have the lime and mineral deposit buildup, you’ll have to remove it from the rest the shower fixture. Unscrew just the faceplate, if you can. If you can’t, then remove the entire shower head from the fixture. How you go about doing this depends on the make and model of your shower head. In a typical disassembly, look for screws surrounding the shower head faceplate or the shower head itself to undo. Once the screws are undone, twist counterclockwise or pull the faceplate or shower head to remove."

      "content": "Immerse the faceplate or shower head in white vinegar for 8 hours. Purchase or obtain a container large enough to hold the faceplate or shower head. If you have more than one bathroom that you and/or your family can utilize, you could otherwise use the bathroom sink, if it’s large enough. Fill your container or sink with white vinegar with some coarse salt. The amount of vinegar you use should be enough to fully cover the faceplate or shower head. Set a timer for 8 hours, or calculate 8 hours from the time you set the faceplate or shower head in the vinegar. While it’s soaking, the vinegar will work to dissolve the buildup and deposits."

      "content": "Manually remove leftover deposits. After 8 hours, the lime and other mineral deposits have dissolved. Now you’ll need to remove it. First find a toothpick or a nail small enough to fit in the shower head holes. Stick the toothpick or nail into each hole of the faceplate to remove the debris. Then scrub the faceplate clean with a stiff plastic brush. You can also use an air compressor to gently blow out debris."

      "content": "Check to see if the leaking shower head is fixed. To determine if unclogging the shower head holes has fixed your leaking shower head, attach the faceplate or shower head back in place. Turn back on the water supply to the shower head, and ensure the faucet is turned off. If you no longer notice a leak, then you’ve solved your problem. If your shower head is still leaking, then consider another possible reason for the leak."

Water seeps through those cracks, resulting in a leaking shower head. Replacing this washer will solve the problem. Shut off the water supply to your bathroom, which you can find either near your shower or in your basement, if you have one. O rings should be maintained by applying lubricant. If your shower faucet is a compression faucet, meaning it has two faucet handles to separately control the cold and hot water, you’ll need to feel the water leaking from your shower head to determine if the leak is coming from the cold-water valve or the hot-water valve. [3] X Research source This will let you know which faucet you’ll have to work on."

      "content": "Determine which rubber washer needs to be replaced. You can either replace the rubber washer in your shower head or in your shower faucet. The type of shower faucet you have will help to determine which rubber washer needs to be replaced. If you have a compression faucet, also referred to as a two-handle faucet, then you’ll likely need to replace the rubber washer that’s inside the faucet. If you have a single-handle faucet, then it’s likely the rubber washer located inside of the shower head is the one that needs to be replaced."

      "title": "Replace the rubber washer in your shower head.",
      "content": "Replace the rubber washer in your shower head. To replace the rubber washer in your shower head, start off by taking the shower head apart. While different brands of shower heads are built differently, there should be a collar nut attached to the shower arm. The collar nut looks like a regular metal nut, but it extends lengthwise. It has a neck, or rather a collar, that’s typically about 1.5 times it’s diameter. Protect the fixture with a rag and, using a wrench, loosen that collar nut to separate the shower head from the shower arm. Once removed, look beneath the shower head’s swivel ball to find the rubber washer. The swivel ball is a metal fixture that attaches directly to the shower head, and is what allows the shower head to move around. Look for a metal fixture that somewhat resembles a large nut with a metal ball on the end. If you can rotate it like you would a shower head, then you’ve found the swivel ball. When you locate the rubber washer, pull it off, and then replace it with a new rubber washer of similar size and style. To ensure that the new washer works properly, it should look practically identical to the old washer. Be careful to get a washer of the same thickness as this could lead to leaking over time."

      "content": "Replace the rubber washer in your faucet. Disassemble the appropriate faucet handle by unscrewing it. (The temperature of the leaking water should let you know whether you should be working on the hot or cold faucet handle.) Depending on the style of your faucet this screw may be in plain sight or hidden behind a cover cap. If your faucet is an older model, look for the screw to be exposed on either the front or side of your faucet. If it’s newer, use a tiny pocket knife to lift the cover cap to expose the screw. Once the screw is removed, pull the handle hard to pull it off of the faucet body. You may need a faucet puller to do this, if you’re unable to do it by hand. Once the handle is off, remove the trim and sleeve that covers the faucet stem. Then use a deep socket to unscrew the faucet stem. The faucet stem is held down by a hex nut, so you’ll need to use the deep socket to unscrew the hex nut. The hex nut is simply a nut with six sides. A shower valve socket wrench is made specifically for this. Now you can replace the rubber washer. If you’ve purchased the faucet washer kit, you can also replace the flat washer at the end of the stem and the seals."

If you changed the rubber washer in your shower head, connect the shower head back onto the shower arm, and turn back on your water supply to confirm whether the leak has been fixed or not. Be sure you just screw the shower head on snugly and do not over tighten. If you changed the rubber washer in the shower faucet, then begin putting your shower faucet back together starting with the faucet stem. Use a little bit of plumber’s grease on the threads where the stem will go, then screw the stem back on. Put the handle back in place, but don’t screw it on until you’ve confirmed the leaking shower head is fixed, which you can test by cutting your water supply back on."

Over time, this valve can weaken and become clogged by sediment buildup. A malfunctioning diverter valve will leak even when water should be flowing through the bathtub faucet. You can fix a diverter valve by cleaning it, but it is usually better to just replace it. Start by shutting off the water supply either through the valve to the bathroom or through your home’s main supply."

[4] X Research source Before you begin, shut off the water supply to your shower, either by shutting off the valve supplying water to your bathroom directly or by turning off the main supply of water throughout your house."

If you don’t have a hair dryer at your disposal, or if the hair dryer simply isn’t working, head to your local hardware store to purchase a handle puller. Once the handle is off, remove the stop tube, unscrew the cartridge retaining clip using a small screwdriver or awl (hold onto it well, it tends to spring off), and then remove the handle washer. You should then be able to see the cartridge stem."

Untwist the cartridge stem and then remove it with pliers. If the pliers aren’t working, you’ll need to use a cartridge puller. Fit the puller over the cartridge stem and twist to unscrew it gently. Once it’s loose, use pliers to remove it. Insert the new cartridge in its place, and screw it in. The new cartridge should be identical to the old one."
