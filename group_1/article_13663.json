      "content": "Part your hair down the middle, then clip the right side out of the way. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to part your hair down the center first, from forehead to nape. Twist and clip the hair on the right side of your head into a bun or ponytail so that it doesn't get in the way. Your hair must be long enough to pull into a high ponytail on each side of your head. Sailor Moon has straight hair, but having curly hair for this part will help give you more volume. You can straighten your hair in the next part, if you wish."

      "content": "Create a vertical part on the left side of your head, just behind your ear. Run the handle of the rat-tail comb down the left side of your head. Start at the center part and finish at your hairline, just behind your ear. Drape the hair that's in front of your ear across your shoulder, and clip the hair that's behind your ear out of the way. Don't worry about how the clipped-off portion of your hair looks for now. This is just to keep it separate from the hair that’s in front."

      "title": "Pull the hair that's in front of your ear into a high ponytail.",
      "content": "Pull the hair that's in front of your ear into a high ponytail. Make the ponytail at the very top of your head, right where it starts to curve down to the side. It should be aligned with the vertical part that's just behind your ear. For extra volume, consider teasing the ponytail with a brush or comb. If you have bangs, leave them out of the ponytail. You can curl them at the end to give yourself a more authentic look."

    {
      "title": "Twist the ponytail into a bun.",
      "content": "Twist the ponytail into a bun . Use your fingers to twist the ponytail into a rope. Next, wrap the rope around the base of the ponytail to create a bun. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the bun, then secure the bun to your hair with bobby pins. Plan on using about 3 to 4 bobby pins. If you have thick, curly hair, you may need to use more. If you have short hair, try a sock bun or ballerina bun instead . This won't be as accurate as doing an actual bun, but it's better than having no bun at all!"

      "content": "Repeat the process for the right side of your head. Unclip the hair on the right side of your head. Part it vertically just behind your ear. Clip the hair that's behind your ear out of the way, then pull the hair that's in front of your ear into a high ponytail. Twist the ponytail into a bun and bobby pin it into place. If you teased the left ponytail, you should tease this one too. If you did a sock bun on the left side of your head, you should do one on the right side too."

      "content": "Set the buns with hairspray. Be careful not to get the rest of your hair; you just need to do your buns for now. Alternatively, you can wait until the very end to apply the hairspray, after you've added the ponytails."

      "title": "Undo the back-left section and comb it out.",
      "content": "Undo the back-left section and comb it out. If you have curly hair, consider straightening the section out. This will give you a more authentic look. If you have natural hair, however, consider leaving it as-is, or use braiding hair to create some micro braids , goddess braids, etc. If you have short hair and plan on adding extensions, you must straighten your hair , otherwise the texture won't match.

      "title": "Pull the section into a high ponytail just behind the left bun.",
      "content": "Pull the section into a high ponytail just behind the left bun. Make the ponytail at the same height as the bun, right next to the vertical part that's behind your ear. The ponytail and the bun should be almost touching—as though they are a single piece. Use a hair tie that matches your hair color as closely as possible. You'll eventually be adding a Sailor Moon clip, but there's still a chance that it might show through. For more volume, split the ponytail into 2 sections and gently tug them apart. This will shift the hair tie closer to your scalp as well as cause the ponytail to fan out."

      "title": "Clip in an extension around the ponytail if you want an authentic look.",
      "content": "Clip in an extension around the ponytail if you want an authentic look. Take a 2- to 3-comb hair extension that matches your hair color and pop open the combs. Insert the first comb into the base of your ponytail, right below the hair tie, and snap it shut. Wrap the extension around the ponytail, then slide and snap the second comb into place. Straighten the extension to match the texture of your hair. [2] X Research source For a thicker look, use a 4-clip extension. You can also layer another set of 2- or 3-clip extensions instead. The extensions don't have to be as long as Sailor Moon's hair. You can also totally keep your short hair for a Chibi Moon look. If you have natural hair, consider using braiding hair and creating mini braids instead."

      "title": "Curl the end of the ponytail",
      "content": "Curl the end of the ponytail with a curling iron, if desired. Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may have to curl the ends in multiple sections. Once you have finished curling them, however, gather them together to that they make one, big curl. Don't curl all of the ponytail all the way up to the ponytail. You just need a single coil. If you put your natural hair into braids, you can still curl them by wrapping them around curling rods, then dipping them into boiling water for a couple of seconds."

      "content": "Add a Sailor Moon clip to each bun, if desired. This is completely optional, but it is a nice touch. Depending on the style of the clip, you may be able to wrap it around the ponytail as well. These are sometimes referred to as \"odango shields\". You can buy Sailor Moon hair clips from online stores that specialize in Anime cosplay and accessories. You can also commission someone to make one for you, or you can make it yourself."

The bangs should be long enough to reach your eyebrows, but it'll be even better if they reach your eyes. [3] X Research source Your bangs must be cut straight across in order to get the right look. You may still be able to achieve a similar look with feathered bangs, but it won't be as accurate. If you don't have bangs, but still want an accurate style, add a bang hair piece that matches your hair color. Make sure that it's the right length and cut!"
