      "content": "Rest to help you recover. Get some rest during and after your attacks. Make sure you are resting as much as possible. While it is not always easy to find time out from your busy life, getting rest and relaxation can minimize the effects of vertigo. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you feel dizzy at any point, sit or lie down immediately. Sudden movement—and sometimes any movement—can worsen the sensation of vertigo. Avoid bright lights if possible, such as those from a television, overhead lighting, or your phone, as these can aggravate your vertigo. Avoid driving a car or operating any heavy machinery. Additionally, avoid environments with flashing lights, such as video games, some movies, or dance clubs."

      "title": "Do the Epley maneuver to find your balance.",
      "content": "Do the Epley maneuver to find your balance. Also known as the canalith repositioning procedure, the Epley maneuver helps to reset the balance mechanisms in the inner ear by repositioning the particles in the vestibular organs (the balance organs). These particles can get trapped in the inner ear, which causes dizziness. You can do this at home, although it should be demonstrated by your healthcare professional before you undertake it yourself as it does require some quick movements. Consider asking a friend or family member to act as your assistant so that your head lands in the right spot each time. Here's how to do it: Sit on a bed. Turn your head 45° by looking to the right. Lie back quickly and place your shoulders on the pillow. Your head will be lower than your shoulders and you will still be looking 45° to the right. Remain in this position for 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds, turn your head 90° to the left (so it’s facing 45° to the left). Do not raise your head during this movement. Remain in this position for 30 seconds. Turn your entire body and your head another 90° to the left and wait for 30 seconds. At this point, you should be lying on your left side. Your head should still be lower than your shoulders. Some people find that this works right away, while others need to do it several times for it to be effective.

      "content": "Try the Half Somersault maneuver to feel less dizzy. This is another good exercise and, unlike the Epley maneuver, does not require an assistant. One study found that patients who did both exercises experienced symptomatic relief but reported less dizziness and fewer complications when doing just the Half Somersault. You will likely need to do this exercise multiple times before you experience some relief. Follow this procedure: [10] X Research source Get down on your knees and look up at the ceiling for a few seconds. Touch the floor with your head. Tuck your chin slightly towards your chest so your head moves toward your knees. Wait for the vertigo to subside (about 30 seconds). Turn your head in the direction of your affected ear (i.e., if you feel dizzy on your left side, turn your head so that it faces your left elbow). Keep your head in this position for 30 seconds. Then, raise your head so it is level with your back while you're on all fours; your spine should look like a straight line. Keep your head at that 45° angle. Stay 30 seconds in this position. Raise your head and back so that you are upright again, but keep your head tilted to the shoulder of the side you're working on. Take your time to stand up. Rest 15 minutes before repeating a second time or doing the other side."

      "content": "Practice the Brandt-Daroff regimen to help relieve your vertigo. These exercises involve the head and the muscles of the neck and can be performed at home without a physician's supervision. The repeated head movements of this regimen help you habituate to the experience of vertigo by dispersing the particles in the vestibular organs in the inner ear. Perform the following movements: [11] X Research source Begin in an upright, seated position. Quickly lie down on one side with your nose pointed up at about a 45° angle. Stay in this position for about 30 seconds (or until the vertigo is gone). Then, get back in your seated position. Do this exercise on the other side. This exercise is most effective if you do multiple repetitions a day over 2 weeks."

      "content": "Maintain a fixed gaze to fight dizziness. Staring at one point can help you overcome dizziness. It helps improve your vision and maintain focus while your head is moving. Dancers, when doing turns, are told to \"spot.\" This is where they keep their eyes focused on one spot for as long as they can as their body rotates. This lets them spin without becoming dizzy and is the same principle that can be applied here. Focus on a spot straight ahead during your dizziness spell and the dizziness will likely subside. Here's how to practice stabilizing your gaze: Look straight ahead and focus on something (like a small colored square or button) held at eye level in front of you. Move your head from side to side, all the while maintaining your gaze on the target. Slowly increase the speed of your head movement. Make sure your target is still in focus and is not just a blur. If you start to feel too dizzy, slow down. Try to do this for 30 seconds, completing 3 reps total. Switch to nodding your head up and down in 30-second increments, doing 3 total reps. Keep working on it until you can do this exercise 3 times every day. [12] X Research source"
