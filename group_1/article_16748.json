      "content": "Look for hidden cameras on or near everyday objects and decorations. Unfortunately, hidden cameras can be as small as the end of a pen, making it easy to hide them virtually anywhere. Look in areas where a camera might be able to hide, such as in a plant on a desk or on a smoke detector in the kitchen. When searching a room for hidden cameras, search in places like: [1] X Research source Smoke detectors Electrical outlets and power strips Light fixtures, light bulbs, and night lights Bookshelves, cabinets, and desks Laptops, USBs, and computer mice Small holes in the wall Pictures or other decorations Stuffed animals and other toys Clocks and watches Clothes hooks Pens Plug-in air fresheners Appliances Peepholes and doorbells Keyholes Air filters Mirrors Decorative plants Screws Showerheads"

      "content": "Look for the camera’s lens with a flashlight. Most of a hidden camera is usually hidden, but the camera’s lens must always be visible for the camera to be effective. This means that you can typically spot a hidden camera by looking for its lens. The best way to do this is to use a flashlight: [2] X Research source Turn off all the lights in the room. Turn on a flashlight and scan it around the room. Alternatively, you can use your phone’s flashlight. Look for reflective surfaces where they shouldn’t be."

      "content": "Look for items that seem out of place. While things like stuffed animals and books can be placed pretty much anywhere, mirrors and decorations (e.g., pictures or paintings) often aren't. If you see a mirror or decoration at a weird height or in an otherwise odd location, there may be a hidden camera embedded. [3] X Research source Check to see if a mirror is two-way to confirm whether or not a camera is embedded, as this is an easy way to hide a camera."

      "title": "Turn off the lights to search for camera indicators.",
      "content": "Turn off the lights to search for camera indicators. Most cameras have red or green lights which blink or display steadily. If the hidden cameras were poorly installed, you may be able to see these lights when you turn off the room's lights. [4] X Research source This method isn’t completely foolproof, so don’t rule out hidden cameras if you don't see any indicator lights, as they can still easily be hidden."

      "title": "Look for infrared light with your phone’s front camera.",
      "content": "Look for infrared light with your phone’s front camera. Another easy way to hunt for hidden cameras is to use your cell phone’s front camera. Simply turn off the lights and look around the room through your phone’s camera. Your phone may be able to pick up small, red dots of infrared light coming from a secret source. [5] X Research source Most rear cameras have infrared filters, which will prevent the camera from detecting infrared light , which is why it’s best to use your front-facing camera. Before trying this method, first see if your phone is able to pick up infrared light. Just look through your phone’s camera at the end of a TV remote. Press a button on the remote. If you can see the remote’s sensor light up on your camera, you’re able to detect infrared light with your phone. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the Wi-Fi network to see if something's connected that shouldn't be. Most hidden cameras are connected to Wi-Fi to allow operators to control them via Bluetooth. While this feature is handy for taking illegal footage, it also works to your advantage. Check to see what devices are connected to your router. If something’s there that shouldn’t be, it may be a hidden camera. [7] X Research source To check your router, simply log into your router or internet provider’s account. Select the router you want to check and view what devices are connected. Hidden cameras usually pop up as “unknown” or odd names you don’t recognize.” If you don’t know how to access your router’s information or aren’t at home, try using a Wi-Fi scanning app, like Network Analyzer or Wi-Fi Analyzer . These scan what devices are on nearby networks."

      "content": "Use your cell phone to scan for interference. While this method isn’t foolproof, it can still help give you peace of mind and find certain types of cameras. All you have to do is: [8] X Research source Make a call on your cell phone, and leave the caller on the line. Walk around the room with your phone on speakerphone. Listen for crackling, clicking, or buzzing from your phone."

      "title": "Scan the room with a radiofrequency detector.",
      "content": "Scan the room with a radiofrequency detector. An RF detector lets you scan for hidden cameras by physically sweeping the device around the room and listening for feedback. If you hear sudden crackling or beeping through the detector, there’s a good chance you’ll find a hidden camera in front of it. This is one of the most accurate ways to find a hidden camera. [9] X Research source When using an RF detector, you'll need to unplug any items that broadcast radio signals, like kitchen appliances, baby monitors, routers and modems, gaming consoles, and TVs. You may need to cycle through several different frequencies before you find the correct one. RF detectors can also be used to scan for wireless microphones."

      "content": "Create a DIY camera detector . Professional camera detectors can cost several hundred dollars, but you can make a cheap one with nothing but a paper towel and a flashlight: [10] X Research source Turn off all the lights in the room and draw the blinds (or wait until nightfall). Hold up a paper towel roll to one eye, then close the other eye. Place a flashlight at eye level (in front of the closed eye) and turn on the flashlight. Scan the room, watching for glints as you do so."

      "content": "Hidden cameras are usually small and disguised like common objects. Hidden cameras come in all types of shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, there’s no one size fits all, which sometimes makes them tricky to detect. Hidden cameras are usually small enough to fit in tight spaces and disguised to look like everyday items, such as smoke detectors, outlets, teddy bears, and USB chargers. [11] X Research source Because of this, it’s best to use multiple detection methods to try and find a hidden camera if you suspect one is near. The best thing to look for when searching for a hidden camera? A camera lens. No matter the size or shape, all hidden cameras have a lens."

      "content": "If you find a hidden camera, contact law enforcement. If a hidden camera is in your private space (whether that’s your bedroom, bathroom, hotel room, or Airbnb), it infringes on your privacy. Cover the camera immediately and call local law enforcement to report the situation. [12] X Research source Document where the camera is by taking photos and videos. Avoid removing or damaging the camera, as the location could be a clue for officers. Leave the space if you feel unsafe or if you’re unsure if there are more cameras hidden."

While we can’t speak for the Airbnb you might be in, Airbnb has a strict policy against indoor security cameras of any kind. In March 2024, the policy was updated to state that no security cameras are allowed inside a listing. [15] X Research source Outdoor cameras, doorbell cameras, and noise decibel monitors are still allowed; however, hosts are required to disclose the presence and location of such devices."
