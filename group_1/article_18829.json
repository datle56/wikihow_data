      "content": "Use the frog stretch to loosen up your hips and groin. Get onto your knees on an exercise mat and spread your knees out so they’re wider than shoulder-width. Walk your hands out and lower yourself onto your forearms. Press your pelvis down toward the ground while moving your feet outwards so that they are wider than your knees. Hold that position for 15 to 20 seconds, then release back into a kneeling position. Repeat this stretch 5 to 6 times. [1] X Research source This stretch is great at loosening up your lower body, which will make moving into a split a bit easier."

      "content": "Do the seated forward bend to open your hips and warm up your legs. Sit on the ground with your legs stretched out in front of you. Keep the soles of your feet together, and slowly bend forward. Stretch out your arms toward your toes and grasp your feet if you can. Hold the position for 15 to 20 seconds, and repeat the stretch 5 to 6 times. [2] X Research source Breath deeply from your stomach as you move through these stretches. If you find yourself holding your breath, take a moment to adjust and take a deep breath, exhaling it slowly."

      "content": "Complete a few sets of low lunges to stretch your groin area. Lunge forward with your right leg until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Keep your back leg extended as straight as possible. Stretch forward to bring your chest closer to your right thigh, and deepen your stretch as much as you can. Hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds, release the pose, switch legs, and repeat. Try to do a total of 5 to 6 low lunges on each leg. [3] X Research source Remember, splits require a high level of flexibility in your hips and groin, so any exercises you can do to strengthen and also loosen up those areas will help you perform much better and will also reduce the risk of injury."

      "content": "Work on the half split pose to begin getting yourself ready for a full split. Get down onto both knees on an exercise mat. Stretch your right leg out in front of you while keeping your back and shoulders as straight as possible. Keep your left leg bent at a 90-degree angle as you stretch forward and lower your chest toward your leg. Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds and repeat this movement 5 to 6 times. Avoid rounding your spine during this move. If you feel yourself crunching over, take a moment to breathe in and straighten your back."

      "content": "Use a yoga block to try a full split without hurting yourself. When working toward the full split, you may find you're almost there but are afraid to fully commit. When you run into this, use a yoga block to hold yourself up a bit from the ground. Place the block under your bottom, under a thigh, or under your hands so you can hold yourself off the ground a bit. Whichever position you choose, hold it for 15 to 20 seconds before releasing it. Repeat this stretch 5 to 6 times. [4] X Research source Play around with the placement of the yoga block to find out what position helps you the most."

      "content": "Hold the full split for 30 seconds at a time to acclimate your body. Once you’re able to do a split, get into position and hold it for 20 to 30 seconds. This will help stretch the muscles that are often strained during this move, and you’ll be able to more easily move into a split during your cheerleading routines without an issue. [5] X Research source Never move straight into a split without warming up first. You’ll very likely get hurt and have to spend a week or more recovering before you can resume activities."

      "content": "Warm up your legs by doing side-to-side hops. This is a great way to activate your hips and legs and get them warmed up. Simply hop from foot to foot and repeat this 5 to 6 times. For a harder warmup, jump as far to the side as you can without losing your balance. [6] X Research source This exercise helps with your mobility and your balance, as you have to find your center of gravity on each hop so you don’t fall over."

Lower your hips until the opposite thigh is parallel to the ground and that knee is aligned over your ankle. Repeat this movement 5 to 6 times on each leg. This not only works out your legs, but it also helps improve your balance, which is an important part of cheerleading. [7] X Research source For a more advanced move, go ahead and hold the lunge position for 10 seconds before returning to standing. This will stretch your hamstrings even more."

Hold the position for 15 to 20 seconds and then switch legs, repeating the movement 5 to 6 times per leg. [8] X Research source It’s okay if you can’t reach your toes yet.

Place your hands on the ground in front of you, then left a leg up off the floor about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Hold that leg up for 4 to 5 seconds, then set it back down. Repeat this movement 5 to 6 times on each leg. [9] X Research source Try to increase the amount of time you can hold your leg up in the air by 1 second every day. This will build up your leg muscles and help you have more explosion power when you do your jumps."

Do 10 reps of side arm raises by raising your arms so they’re level with your shoulder; hold the pose for 5 seconds before releasing. Do 10 reps of forward and backward arm rotations to loosen up your arms and shoulders. Simply put your arms out to the side and move them in a large circle, rotating your shoulders. [12] X Research source The more flexible you get, the wider you’ll be able to make your circles. If you can only do small circles at the beginning comfortably, that’s okay!

[16] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. Make up a schedule for yourself and plan out which days of the week you’ll commit to flexibility training. Try to spread the days out so they don’t fall next to each other for optimal benefits. [17] X Research source For example, if you do strength training on Mondays and Wednesdays, schedule your flexibility training for Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Don’t forget to schedule in some downtime to allow your body to rest and recuperate."

      "content": "Warm up before each workout to prevent the risk of injury. Getting your heart rate up means there will be better blood flow to your arms and legs. Plus, your limbs will be loose and limber, making them less prone to strains and injuries. Spend 3 to 5 minutes jogging, biking, doing jumping jacks, jumping rope, or even just walking briskly to get warmed up. Neglecting to warm up could make your recovery after a workout harder, and your body will be even sorer than it would be."

Because you’re not trying to build muscle while working on your stretching, you don’t need to do as many repetitions. Remember, if something hurts and you’re in pain, stop doing the movement right away, even if your time isn’t up yet. If you get bored while stretching, try listening to music or to a podcast to make the time go by faster. Just don’t lose track of your reps!"

For maximum benefits, you don’t want to do all the same exercises every day for months at a time. You’ll get bored, and your body will get used to the movements. Try switching up your routine every 2 to 3 weeks by adding in some new stretches and retiring ones that have become too easy."

If you work with someone on your cheerleading skills, let them know you’re interested in moves to increase your flexibility. Based on your skills and needs, there may be some specific exercises that would be really beneficial to your growth as a cheerleader. If you don’t work with a coach, think about the movements you struggle with in cheerleading. Pinpoint where you are struggling (whether it’s that your legs aren’t flexible enough or your shoulders feel too tight) and look up specific stretches you can do for those areas."
