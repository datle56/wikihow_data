      "title": "Draw a small circle and an oval with a pointy bottom to make the head.",
      "content": "Draw a small circle and an oval with a pointy bottom to make the head. Begin drawing Spidey’s body by creating his head . Lightly sketch a circle in the upper half of your paper. Then, extending from the bottom of the circle, draw an oval with a narrow curve at the bottom. Make the bottom of this oval slightly pointed to create Spiderman's chin. [1] X Research source The top half of your circle should also make up the top half of your oval. Don't erase the line from the bottom of the circle. You'll use it as a guideline for drawing the details of the mask. Make the width of the oval half the width of the circle. If you draw the oval too low, the jaw will be too large. Press lightly as you draw so you can go back and erase guidelines once you're finished."

      "title": "Sketch 2 vertical lines for the neck and draw an oval for the chest.",
      "content": "Sketch 2 vertical lines for the neck and draw an oval for the chest. Draw a short vertical line coming down from each side of the jaw where it meets the sides of the head. Then, draw an oval positioned horizontally. Make the top line of the oval touch each of the lines for the neck. [2] X Research source The length of the oval should be about twice the length of the head, and the width of the oval should be the same as the width from the top of the head to the chin. However, you can make the oval wider or thinner, depending on how big and muscular you want Spidey to be."

      "title": "Make the torso by drawing 2 lines that angle down from the chest.",
      "content": "Make the torso by drawing 2 lines that angle down from the chest. Leave a space that's as wide as the width of the oval that you drew for Spidey’s chest. Then, draw a horizontal line below the oval to give you an idea of where the waist is. From there, draw a straight line from the end of each oval down to the ends of this waistline. [3] X Research source The waistline should be about ¾ the size of Spiderman’s upper chest."

      "title": "Sketch an upside-down pentagon below Spidey’s waistline.",
      "content": "Sketch an upside-down pentagon below Spidey’s waistline. To create Spiderman’s lower torso, draw 2 short, straight lines coming down from each end of the waistline. Make the lines angle away from the body since this is where Spiderman's hips are. Then, draw a V-shape from the bottom of these lines, which will sharpen the bottom of the torso, and make him look posed and ready for action. [4] X Research source Round the bottom of the V-shape to create a more realistic lap. Draw the bottom torso to be about half as wide as Spiderman’s head or chest."

      "content": "Draw a half-circle with a circle below it to make arms and shoulders. Sketch a half-circle on 1 end of the chest's oval. Make the half-circle extend about ¾ of the way down the side of the chest segment. Then, draw a rounded U-shape extending from the bottom of the half-circle. Draw the bottom of this curved shape level, so the upper arm is appropriately distant from the chest. [5] X Research source Repeat this step on the opposite side of the torso to outline Spiderman’s other upper shoulder and arm."

Make this oval the same length as the U-shape. Then, draw a vertical rectangle extending from the bottom of the oval. Make the rectangle narrower to create a more realistic-looking wrist. [6] X Research source Draw the bottom of the rectangle so it's level with the very bottom line of the torso. Repeat this for the other arm."

      "title": "Sketch 2 U-shaped lines and circles extending from the torso.",
      "content": "Sketch 2 U-shaped lines and circles extending from the torso. To make the upper legs and knees, make a U-shape coming down from 1 side of the bottom torso. Make the upper legs half as long as the entire torso and half the width of the bottom torso. Then, draw a circle (about the size of Spidey’s fists) below the U-shape to create a knee.

      "content": "Draw U-shapes and vertical rectangles below the knees. Lightly sketch another U-shape extending down from the knee circle. Draw it about 1 ½ times as long as the knee circle and half as wide as the upper leg shape. To finish the lower leg, add a vertical rectangle to the bottom of the U-shape. Make this rectangle the same length as the U-shape. [9] X Research source Draw these on the opposite leg as well, but sketch them at a slight angle so it looks like Spiderman is resting his weight on one leg. (This stance looks more heroic.)"

      "content": "Sketch 2 angled feet so it looks like Spidey is pointing 1 foot forward. On Spiderman's right foot (the leg on the left side of the page), make a triangle at the bottom of the leg. Position the triangle so the top point touches the bottom of the rectangle used for his lower leg. Put the other 2 points where the bottom of Spidey’s foot begins and ends. To draw the opposite foot, make 2 vertical lines coming straight down from the lower leg. Then, sketch a short horizontal line to connect them. [10] X Research source Drawing a square-shaped foot makes it look as though this foot is pointing forward."

Draw another point close to the center vertical guideline, but don't let the point touch it. Then, draw the final point up towards the top of Spidey’s head (near the sides). Draw lines to connect each point. [12] X Research source Position the first point of each triangle at an equal distance from the vertical guideline."

Then, make a straight line that extends from the middle of the eyes up towards the top of the head at an angle. Keep drawing these straight lines around the head and leave space in between each. [14] X Research source . Use a ruler if you need help creating perfectly straight lines for the webbing on Spiderman’s face. Avoid drawing over the eyes that you just finished making.

[15] X Research source Make the bottom webbing lines curve up instead of down since they're being drawn toward the center of Spiderman's face. The further you get from the center of Spiderman’s face, the larger the curved lines will be between each segment."

Draw from the neckline, across the shoulder, and down the outer edges of the arm. Connect this line to the outline of the torso, tracing over the outer legs, feet, and finally the inner legs. [16] X Research source Draw this bold line with one smooth, consistent stroke so the shapes are all connected. Make the line around the knees and elbows bulge a little to indicate the joints."

Make the line curve down in the middle on each side of the chest. Then, draw a short straight line near each inner thigh. Angle them towards the knee so they look like bulging muscles. [17] X Research source If you'd like to draw more muscles, sketch a few short horizontal lines that curve up from Spiderman’s lower torso pentagon. These will look like V-lines near his abs."

Then, draw just a few knuckles since all of them wouldn’t be visible from the angle you’re drawing. To draw his left hand, make his thumb close to the torso and draw 2 or 3 knuckles along the clenched hand. [18] X Research source Draw a small line near the left and right side of each hand to resemble the thumb. The thumb line should stop about halfway to the top of the hand. Draw your knuckle lines in one smooth stroke, curving the line just a tiny bit for each finger."

Then, draw a slightly smaller diamond above the first diamond so the bottom of the top diamond overlaps. Then, to make the legs, draw 4 short lines that extend up from the center of the 2 diamonds and 4 short lines that point down from the center of the diamonds. [19] X Research source Shade in the spider’s face and body diamonds before sketching the 8 legs. You can draw your spider as simple or as complex as you like. If your Spiderman drawing is small, keep the logo tiny, and don't worry about drawing all of the details."

Draw a horizontal line on each calf to create the boots (which will be red) and make a horizontal line that curves up on each forearm to indicate gloves (which will also be red). Then, draw a horizontal line below each shoulder towards the chest. Make each line curve down to the waist. Then, draw a horizontal line along the waist to separate the torso from the lower half of the outfit. [20] X Research source Make the long segments on the sides of the torso as wide or narrow as you like."

Then, make horizontal lines that curve up in the middle of each segment between the vertical lines. [21] X Research source Leave a small space between each vertical line. If the lines are too close, you won't see the webbing."

      "title": "Erase unnecessary guidelines and color in Spiderman if you like.",
      "content": "Erase unnecessary guidelines and color in Spiderman if you like. If you want your Spiderman sketch to look bolder, use a pen to draw over all of the lines that you want to be visible. Once the ink dries, erase the guidelines. Then, use colored pencils to make the webbed portions red. Color the remaining segments blue. [22] X Research source To make the muscles stand out, shade them in with a black colored pencil. If you'd like to color your Spiderman in with markers, outline your drawing with a thick, black marker. Like all skills, drawing requires you to practice . If you don’t love how Spiderman looks in your first sketch, keep at it. The more you try, the more likely you are to improve each of your Spiderman pictures."
