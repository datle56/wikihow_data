      "title": "Cut 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) from the top of the onion.",
      "content": "Cut 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from the top of the onion. The top of the onion, or the stem, is the pointed end of the bulb. Set your onion on a cutting board, and measure down from the top of the stem by about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). Use a sharp knife to make a straight cut so you have a flat edge on top of your onion. [1] X Research source Leave the root on the other side of the onion uncut."

      "title": "Halve the onion from top to bottom.",
      "content": "Halve the onion from top to bottom. Set your onion down so the side you just cut is face down on your cutting board. Place the blade of your knife in the middle of the root on top and cut straight through the onion so you have 2 halves that are the same size. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel back the outer skin from each half of the onion.",
      "content": "Peel back the outer skin from each half of the onion. The outer peel usually has a top layer that’s easy to remove and a second layer that’s more difficult to pull off. Rip the loose outer peel off the onion and throw it away. Pick the edge of the next peel with your fingernail to separate it from the rest of the onion. Pull the peel back toward the root without removing it completely. [3] X Research source The peel still attached to the root can be used as a “handle” to make holding onto your onion easier while you cut it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut straight lines toward the root of the onion.",
      "content": "Cut straight lines toward the root of the onion. Hold your onion by the peel near its root. Start on one side of the onion, placing the tip of your knife 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from the root. Make vertical cuts from the root toward the flat edge you cut earlier. Work your way across the onion, spacing each cut the same distance apart from one another. [4] X Research source The root will help hold your onion in place, so be sure not to cut completely through it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make 2-3 sideways cuts from the flat side.",
      "content": "Make 2-3 sideways cuts from the flat side. Press down lightly on top of the onion and hold your knife so the blade is parallel to the cutting board. Start cutting into the flat side of onion 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) up from the cutting board. Angle your knife slightly down so you don’t cut toward your fingers. Just before you reach the root, pull your knife out of the onion. When you’re finished with the first cut, make cuts that are the same distance apart until you reach the top of the onion. [5] X Research source Work slowly so you don’t accidentally cut yourself."

    {
      "title": "Slice the onion lengthwise to dice it.",
      "content": "Slice the onion lengthwise to dice it. Turn your onion so the root is on the same side as your non-dominant hand. Put your fingertips on top of the onion so the side of the knife blade touches your knuckles. Starting on the flat side, cut through the onion. After each cut, move your fingers back so you can guide your knife. Make cuts until you reach the root. [6] X Research source Make sure all of your cuts are the same distance apart so your pieces are all the same size."

      "content": "Cut the onion in half with a knife. Cut the stem and root off the top and bottom of your onion so you have 2 flat edges. Set the onion upright on one of the flat sides and cut through the middle of it so you have 2 pieces that are about the same size. [7] X Research source Make sure the chef’s knife you use is sharp or else it will be difficult to cut through your onion."

      "title": "Remove the outer peel from the onion.",
      "content": "Remove the outer peel from the onion. Use your finger to tear off the loose outer peel from your onion. Pick at the edge of the peel on your onion with your fingernail to separate it. Pull the peel completely off so the surface feels smooth to the touch. [8] X Research source If you have trouble separating the peel with your fingernail, scrape it with the edge of your knife to lift it."

      "title": "Put the onion halves in your food processor.",
      "content": "Put the onion halves in your food processor. Take the lid off of your food processor and put the onion halves on opposite sides of the container. Make sure the onions aren’t directly on top of the blades since they won’t dice as well otherwise. Place the lid back on top of the food processor and secure it in place so it doesn’t come off. [9] X Research source Be careful of the blades while putting your onions into the machine since they are sharp and could cut you. Never operate your food processor without the lid."

      "title": "Use the “Pulse” button to dice your onions slowly.",
      "content": "Use the “Pulse” button to dice your onions slowly. Press the “Pulse” button once to start chopping your onions. Watch through the container to see how much it chops your onions. Press and hold the button for 2-3 seconds at a time before letting go so you can see how big the pieces are. Keep pulsing the onions until they’re as small as you need them. [10] X Research source Be careful not to pulse your onions too much or else they will turn liquidy and you can’t use them in your recipe."

      "title": "Pick firm onions without any sprouts or soft spots.",
      "content": "Pick firm onions without any sprouts or soft spots. Look for black or brown spots on the onion peel to see if they’re starting to mold. Avoid buying any onions that have green sprouts growing from them since they are not fresh and are more likely to spoil faster. Look for onions that feel solid and don’t have any discoloration. [11] X Research source Whole onions stay good in your pantry or fridge for up to 3 months."

      "content": "Chill the onion in your fridge for 15 minutes before cutting it to prevent crying . Onions release a gas when they’re cut open may make you tear up. Put your onion in the fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes before you want to dice it to help prevent the gas from releasing. That way, you won’t get teary-eyed while you’re working with it. [12] X Research source You can also wear kitchen goggles to help prevent any tears."

      "title": "Practice safe knife skills.",
      "content": "Practice safe knife skills . Keep your index finger and your thumb wrapped around the base of the knife and hold the handle securely with the rest of your fingers. Keep the fingers on your other hand in a claw shape so you don’t accidentally cut your fingertips while you’re chopping. When you make your cut, rock your knife forward to get the cleanest cut. [13] X Research source Always keep the knife blade pointed away from you so you don’t accidentally cut yourself."
