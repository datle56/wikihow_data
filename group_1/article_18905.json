    {
      "title": "It sounds like a no-brainer, but this one’s super important.",
      "content": "It sounds like a no-brainer, but this one’s super important. If you don’t go to class, you can’t learn the material effectively. Some professors actually factor attendance into your final grade. Although skipping a class or two may be okay, make it a goal to show up for every class so you can stay on track with your course work. [1] X Research source If you do have to miss a class, text a friend or classmate and ask them to send you the notes. That way, you’ll still get the material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Participation is just as important as showing up.",
      "content": "Participation is just as important as showing up. If your professor says something you don’t understand, raise your hand and ask them about it. If they ask the class a question, do your best to get it right to prove you’ve been paying attention. [2] X Research source Directly engaging with the material in class will help you learn and remember it. While it’s not super common, some university classes actually grade you on participation. If your professor does, asking and answering questions is even more important."
    },
    {
      "title": "Come to class with a notebook and a pencil for note taking.",
      "content": "Come to class with a notebook and a pencil for note taking. Some teachers may allow you to take notes using your laptop, but be very careful to avoid getting distracted by things like the internet. Be sure to write down what’s on the presentation and anything the teacher talks about a lot, since it’s more than likely that will be on a future test. [3] X Research source If you have trouble taking legible notes, try using the Cornell notes style. If your handwriting is a little messy, try typing your notes instead of writing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "It can help you understand the course work better.",
      "content": "It can help you understand the course work better. Most university classes have required reading and optional reading on the syllabus. If you’re having trouble with a particular subject, try reading articles or books about it that the professor recommends for some extra help. [4] X Research source You can also find supplemental reading online or at your library if you're not understanding something. An alternative text on the work may help you better grasp the material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep tests and due dates in mind by looking at your schedule.",
      "content": "Keep tests and due dates in mind by looking at your schedule. You can find your syllabus either online or in a handout from the first day of class. Try to check it every week and remind yourself of upcoming tests, projects, or papers that are due. [5] X Research source Some professors will remind you when a due date is coming up, but others won’t. In most university classes, it’s up to you to keep your deadlines in mind throughout the semester."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep yourself organized so you don’t fall behind.",
      "content": "Keep yourself organized so you don’t fall behind. Before the start of each week, write down what you have to do and which assignments you need to work on. It might be helpful to carry around a planner or a journal to keep track of all your classes. [6] X Research source Decide when to study, do homework, socialize, and so on. Have a daily routine you follow that works with your class schedule. Stick to general rules that work for you. For example, maybe you need a couple of weeks to write a solid paper. Make sure to always start papers a week before they're due."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cramming at the last minute can be stressful.",
      "content": "Cramming at the last minute can be stressful. Instead, after your classes each day, review your notes and study the concepts. If you work on studying a small amount every day, this will help you retain the information long term. [7] X Research source Find a time when you can most easily study. Look for gaps in your schedule. Maybe you could study a bit in the morning on days you have a late class. Maybe you could study after lunch and before a class around 5 at night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Just because you can write a paper in one night doesn’t mean you should.",
      "content": "Just because you can write a paper in one night doesn’t mean you should. If there are any assignments or projects that are going to take you a while, start them now! Giving yourself extra time will help you do the best possible work you can do for the highest grade. [8] X Research source This is super important for final projects that might take the entire term or semester. It can seem like a long time, but the deadline will approach faster than you think."
    },
    {
      "title": "Meet with your professor one on one to ask questions.",
      "content": "Meet with your professor one on one to ask questions. Usually, their office hours will be printed on the syllabus or online somewhere. You can show up and ask any questions you need to (as long as they’re class related). [9] X Research source Don’t be afraid of asking “silly” questions—your professor is there to help! Usually, they’ll be happy to go over concepts with you until you feel confident."
    },
    {
      "title": "The teacher’s assistant can also help you if you’re struggling.",
      "content": "The teacher’s assistant can also help you if you’re struggling. If your class has a TA, reach out to them and ask to meet with them after class. You can ask them questions or have them look over your work to see if you’re on the right track. [10] X Research source Usually, TAs are students too, so they’ll understand exactly where you’re coming from. However, this also means they might be slightly busy, so be prepared to work around their schedule if they need to get to class or do homework."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get feedback and help from your classmates.",
      "content": "Get feedback and help from your classmates. Reach out to a few other people in the class and see if they want to meet once or twice a week to study together. If there’s a concept you aren’t understanding, ask your study group for help (and if there’s something they need help with, work with them on it, too). [11] X Research source It’s okay to work on homework and assignments together, but make sure you aren’t plagiarizing someone else’s work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Most classes have a drop-date, so you can withdraw without penalty.",
      "content": "Most classes have a drop-date, so you can withdraw without penalty. If you fell behind early and you know you aren’t going to pass the class, it might be a good idea to withdraw instead. Then, you can take the class again next semester and get a good grade. [12] X Research source If it’s past the drop-date for a class, it will be marked with a Late Withdrawal. However, that won’t affect your GPA, so it’s still a better option than failing. If you’re unsure whether or not to drop the class, check in with your academic advisor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for at least 8 hours of sleep to feel refreshed.",
      "content": "Aim for at least 8 hours of sleep to feel refreshed. Many people neglect sleep in college, but you're unlikely to be an academic success if you're tired all the time. Consistently running on less than 4 hours of sleep will inhibit your ability to concentrate. Stick to a sleep schedule. Try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day. Avoid electronic screens before bed, as these can stimulate brain activity and make sleep difficult."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give yourself the energy to do well during class.",
      "content": "Give yourself the energy to do well during class. Avoid processed foods and sugary foods as much as you can. Have a salad for lunch instead of a slice of pizza. Snack on things like fruit, vegetables, and nuts over chips and other junk foods. You will be surprised by how much more energetic and confident you feel when eating a diet of healthy foods. Splurging on a dessert or a treat every now and then is totally fine, but it shouldn’t be an everyday occurrence."
