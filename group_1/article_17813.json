      "title": "Give someone the finger.",
      "content": "Give someone the finger. There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic \"flip-off.\" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across. Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across. For a more \"edgy\" and carefree gesture, extend your thumb to the side instead of tucking it behind your hand."

      "title": "Try using both hands.",
      "content": "Try using both hands. For added effect, whip out the \"double-finger\" flip-off. [2] X Research source Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same time to show them that you are unusually angry. Or, do \"the X\": Cross your middle fingers into an \"X,\" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Switch fingers.",
      "content": "Switch fingers. For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Or, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis. Or, flip someone off with one hand and bump your fists together side-by-side. When you bump, switch your raised middle finger to the other hand. Keep bumping it back and forth."

      "title": "Act like you are itching your nose.",
      "content": "Act like you are itching your nose. Reach up to your face as though you are going to itch your nose, eyebrow, mouth, or anywhere on your face. [3] X Research source Look in the direction of the person that you want to flip off. Then, use your middle finger to scratch while staring pointedly. [4] X Research source Or, if you’re wearing glasses, you can use your middle finger to push the bridge (between the lenses) upward and act innocently as if you're just adjusting your glasses. The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh."

    {
      "title": "Raise your middle finger while you’re drinking something.",
      "content": "Raise your middle finger while you’re drinking something. Grab a water bottle, soda can, or other drink in one hand and lift it up to your mouth with your knuckles facing the person you want to flip off. As you drink (or pretend to), raise your middle finger at them. If they notice and you want to add some insult to injury, let out a loud, satisfied “Ah” sound, like you’ve just chugged a cold glass of water on a hot day."

    {
      "title": "Flip the person off behind their back.",
      "content": "Flip the person off behind their back. You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out. If someone provokes or insults you, it’s usually best to walk away, but you can subtly give them the middle finger as you do it, too."

      "title": "Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off.",
      "content": "Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off. Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender, but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final \"pop\" of \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off. Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect."

      "content": "Practice \"the balloon.\" Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: \"blow\" into your thumb and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. [5] X Research source Then, hold your middle finger of the \"balloon hand\" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your \"balloon hand\" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off."

      "content": "Pretend to \"find\" your middle finger. Act as though you are looking for something in your pocket, between the couch cushions, in your purse, or in a desk drawer—anywhere works! Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found and flip them off! Alternately, lean down in front of the person as though you are picking something up off of the ground. Come up flashing your middle finger, and say, \"Did you drop this?\" [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Try the \"double extreme.\"",
      "content": "Try the \"double extreme.\" Extend the middle fingers of both hands. Then, bring your arms behind your back and through your legs. This should leave you with both middle fingers clearly presented (having long arms or being flexible helps with this!)."

      "title": "Flip someone off with “three” middle fingers.",
      "content": "Flip someone off with “three” middle fingers. Spread your fingers apart on both hands and turn them so your palms are facing you. Place your right hand over your left so that your right ring finger is between your left ring finger and left pinky. Fold your left ring finger and pinky down around the base of your right ring finger, then fold in both thumbs, both pointer fingers, and your right pinky. [8] X Research source This leaves both of your real middle fingers up, plus your right ring finger between them which looks like a third “middle finger.” This is great for when someone returns your middle finger with two middle fingers and you need a way to one-up them."

      "content": "Flipping the middle finger is an obscene hand gesture showing contempt or defiance. The way you curl your hand into a fist and direct the finger at someone shows rebelliousness and possibly even aggression. [9] X Research source Basically, it’s a nonverbal way to say something like “F*ck you” or “Go f*ck yourself” to someone who’s really made you angry. It’s definitely considered a very rude gesture, so use it sparingly!"

      "title": "“The finger” was an obscene gesture as early as ancient Greek times.",
      "content": "“The finger” was an obscene gesture as early as ancient Greek times. Back then, the middle finger represented the male genitalia. One early reference comes from the playwright Aristophanes in 419 BC. In The Clouds , a character makes vulgar, rhythmic gestures with his middle finger before doing the same with his crotch. [10] X Research source The ancient Romans also used the middle finger and called it the digitus impudicus (the shameless or offensive finger). The middle finger probably came to the US with Italian immigrants in the late 19th century. An early photo from 1886 shows Boston pitcher “Old Hoss” Charles Radbourn flipping off the New York Giants in a joint team photo. While the middle finger originally symbolized a phallus, it gradually expanded to be an overall symbol for protest, rage, or even excitement like we know it today."
