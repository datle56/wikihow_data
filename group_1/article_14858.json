      "content": "Drink brandy neat when you have a good quality aged brandy. The best brandies should be savored on their own. This will help you enjoy the flavor fully, heightening your experience and allowing you to truly get a taste of the best brandy experience. Drinking brandy “neat” means that you are drinking it by itself with no ice or mixer."

      "title": "Use a brandy snifter (or, a cognac glass).",
      "content": "Use a brandy snifter (or, a cognac glass). A brandy snifter or brandy balloon is a short glass with a wide base whose sides taper in at the top. It will have a short stem and come in many sizes, although no more than 2 ounces (60 ml) will usually be served at a time. These glasses are perfect for drinking brandy because they concentrate the subtle aromas at the top of the glass when nosing or smelling them. A thoroughly clean snifter that has been air-dried prevents other tastes from interfering with that of the brandy."

      "title": "Serve immediately.",
      "content": "Serve immediately. Brandies do not need to breathe like wine does. If you let it sit for too long then some of the volatile alcohols will evaporate. This will lose some of the character of the brandy."

      "title": "Warm up the glass in your hand.",
      "content": "Warm up the glass in your hand. Many connoisseurs prefer to warm up the brandy because gentle heat enhances the flavor and aroma. The best way to do this is to simply hold the glass in your hand to gently warm it up. The wide base of the glass makes it easy to warm in your hand. [1] X Research source You also can warm the glass by pouring warm water in it and then pouring out before filling with your brandy. Another way to warm the brandy is to carefully heat the glass over an open flame. Be careful not to overheat! Overheating can cause the alcohol to evaporate and ruin the bouquet and flavor. Do not swill the glass because you can lose some of the subtle aromas in the brandy."

      "content": "Take a very small sip. Your first sip should simply wet your lips so that it does not overpower you. The first sip should be the smallest possible sip and will bring the flavor into your mouth. If you become overpowered it may put you off tasting the brandy again."

      "content": "Take more sips, starting small and working your way up to bigger sips. These are meant to acclimatize your mouth to the flavor. Only once your taste buds are acclimatized can you fully appreciate the taste of the brandy. Drinking brandy is as much about the aroma as it is about the taste so make sure you continue to appreciate the aroma as you sip the brandy."

      "content": "Try not to look at the type and cost of the brandy if you are tasting a number of brandies. Both type and price can influence the way you taste a brandy so it is best to cover this information when tasting to really discover the flavors that you like. This can help you learn more about yourself as well. You can mark the glasses on the bottom somehow before pouring them. Then mix the glasses up before drinking so that you do not know which is which."

      "content": "Drink brandy in mixed drinks when you have a younger and less expensive brandy. For example, if you have a VS brandy or another unnamed brandy then you can mix these into cocktails. Brandy is part of the wine family so it does not always work well with certain sodas and tonics but there are many good-tasting mixed drinks. Although Cognac is an aged, more expensive brandy, it is commonly used in mixed drinks as well."

      "title": "Learn how brandy is made.",
      "content": "Learn how brandy is made . Brandy is any distilled spirit made from fruit juice. The fruit is crushed to get just the juice and then the juice is fermented to make fruit wine. After that, the fruit wine is distilled to produce brandy. The brandy is then usually aged in wooden barrels, although some brandies are not aged. [8] X Research source Brandy is made from grapes but there are brandies made from other fruits such as apple, peach, plum and many others. When brandy is made from another fruit, the fruit name is said first before the word “brandy.” For example, if made from apples, it would be called apple brandy. [9] X Research source Brandies get their dark color from aging in barrels. Un-aged brandies will not have this caramel color but colors will often be added to create the same look. [10] X Research source Pomace brandy is made a bit differently. Instead of just fermenting the grape juice, fermentation and distillation to make pomace brandy will include the skins, stems and seeds of the grapes. Pomace brandy is also known as marc (English and French) and grappa (Italian). [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Get an overview of the history of brandy. The name \"brandy\" originates from the Dutch \"brandewijn,\" or \"burnt wine,\" which evokes the warm, glowing feeling from the first sip of a fine brandy. [12] X Research source Brandy has been made since the 12th Century but was originally only made by apothecaries and doctors and used as a medicine. French authorities only allowed winemakers to begin distillation in the 16th century. The French brandy industry grew slowly until the Dutch began importing brandy for consumption and for export to other European countries. It was cheaper to ship in terms of the amount of alcohol than wine, and so was economically viable for merchants. The Dutch invested in building distilleries in the French winemaking areas of the Loire, Bordeaux and Charente. Charente became the most lucrative area for brandy production and is the location of the town called Cognac. [13] X Research source"

There are different aging systems and categorizations for different kinds of brandy. General aging labels can include AC, VS (Very Special), VSOP (Very Special Old Pale), XO (Extra Old), Hors d’age and vintage but these vary greatly for different types of brandy. [15] X Research source VS (Very Special) has been aged a minimum of two years. These are best used for mixing as opposed to drinking neat. VSOP (Very Special Old Pale) brandy is usually between 4 and a half to six years old. XO (Extra Old) brandy are usually six and a half years old or more. Hors d’age brandies are too old to determine the age of for some reason or another. For some brandies these labels are regulated while for others they are not."

It is made from a blend of Colombard and Ugni Blanc grapes and distilled once in column stills. Then it is aged for at least two years in French oak, resulting in a more rustic brandy than Cognac. After aging different aged brandies are blended to make a consistent product. [16] X Research source 3-star or VS (Very Special) brandy has a youngest brandy in the blend that has aged at least two years in oak. VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least four years in oak, although many of these brandies are actually much older. Napoleon or XO (Extra Old) brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least six years in oak. Hors d’age brandy is when the youngest brandy in the blend has aged at least ten years. If the Armagnac has an age on the label it means that the youngest brandy in the bottle is that age. There are also vintage Armagnacs that are at least ten years old and the year of harvest will be displayed on the bottle. These age categories only apply to Armagnac; Cognacs and other brandies will have different meanings for these categories."
