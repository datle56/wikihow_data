      "content": "Find a flat surface where you can run. Running on a track is the most popular place for sprint training because the distances are demarcated by lines on the ground, making it easy to keep track of exactly how far you’re running. The surface is also good for shock absorption, which is helpful for keeping your joints healthy and free of injury. [1] X Expert Source Tyler Courville Professional Runner Expert Interview. Personal interview. 7 March 2019. If you don’t live near a school, gym, or other place with a track, you can still run sprints on any number of flat areas. Consider running on soccer field, football field, or another long stretch of grass or turf that is relatively flat. Depending on length and patterns of usage, you might also be able to find a parking lot or other paved area nearby that is relatively flat and would work well for sprinting. Look for an area at least 40 meters long. While pavement is not ideal for running, lots of people run marathons on the road, so a handful of sprints is surely a better option!"

      "title": "Do dynamic stretches.",
      "content": "Do dynamic stretches . Doing a limited number of dynamic stretches before sprinting has been shown to improve sprint times and help the body avoid injury. Dynamic stretches are stretches performed while walking. Too much of this type of intense stretching will cause fatigue and decrease your sprinting performance, so aim to spend about 10 minutes if you’re in average shape, and up to 20 minutes if you’re super fit. Dynamic stretching requires more effort and is therefore more tiresome than the gentle stretches most people are familiar with. You don’t want to put in twenty minutes and expend all your energy—then you won’t have any left for sprinting! [3] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Here are a few stretches you can try: Gluteals – Walking High Knees Hamstrings – “Toy Soldiers” or “Frankensteins” Adductors – Hurdler’s Walk Quadriceps – “Butt-Kickers” Gastrocnemius – Tip-Toe Walking."

      "title": "Start with a 30-second sprint.",
      "content": "Start with a 30-second sprint. Thirty seconds is a good starting time, so long as you have a stopwatch or other device that can alert you when the time is up. Once you improve your stamina and speed, you can increase to longer time periods. If you don’t have an appropriate timing device, try sprinting for about 200m. If you’re not sprinting on a track and have no way of measuring the distance exactly, try counting your steps, aiming for between 120 and 130. This won’t give you exactly 200m/30 seconds, but it will put you reasonably close."

[4] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Doing so can lead to injury, especially if you’re not using proper form or your muscles aren’t sufficiently warmed up. [5] X Research source For your second sprint, increase to 80% intensity; after this, if you’re not experiencing joint or muscle pain (which are signs that you need to back off), you can increase to total or near-total intensity for the remainder for the session. Pain while sprinting could signal that you need more warm-up time or that you’re not using proper form."

      "title": "Rest for 2-5 minutes in between sprints.",
      "content": "Rest for 2-5 minutes in between sprints. You need rest between sprints so that your body can recover and you can sprint at the same speed multiple times. You should rest 3 seconds for every 1 second that you sprinted. So, for example, if you sprinted for 30 seconds, you should rest for 90 seconds; if you sprinted for 60 seconds, rest for 3 minutes. [6] X Research source Walking should be your form of “rest,” not sitting or standing. This will keep your muscles from cramping. Walk back to the place where you began your sprint, and you’ll be ready to start again. [7] X Research source Sprinting is an intense exercise that will use up all of the oxygen in your muscles. You need adequate rest time between each sprint to maximize your speed and allow the oxygen to get back to your muscles. Otherwise you may feel nauseous and/or lightheaded."

      "content": "Keep your first session short. Four sprints is plenty for your first sprinting session. This may not seem like a lot, but when this kind of intense work is new to your body, starting with too much too soon is a sure recipe for injury. [8] X Research source After a few sessions you can gradually increase the number of sprints, eventually moving up to 8 or 9, depending on your individual fitness level and goals."

Because this is such a high-impact, high-intensity workout, it should be limited to a few times a week and you should allow at least 48 hours in between. [10] X Research source While this might not seem like a lot, soon you will begin to see improvements in your running times as well as your breathing rates. [11] X Research source Beyond that, the shape and tone of your body will quickly begin to improve as well!"

      "content": "Find a good hill where you can train. A good running hill will be fairly steep and at least 40 yards long. Unless you know of such a place (and its length) off the top of your head, you’ll probably want to drive around in your car and check out some nearby places. If you don’t have a car, then take a walk around the area or ride the bus if one is available. Depending on the hill you choose, you may need to consider traffic flow, availability of sidewalks or berms (if running on the road), lighting, foliage, and the general safety of the area that you will be running in. As with any athletic activity, it’s important to be aware of the conditions and plan your attire appropriately, including whether to running shoes or cross-trainers."

      "content": "Do dynamic stretches on a flat area. Even though you’ll be sprinting up the hill, you’ll want to do your stretching on flat ground so as not to over-tire yourself. Dynamic stretches are performed while walking, and you can help prevent injury if you do a limited number of these before beginning your sprinting workout. Aim to spend about 5–10 minutes stretching before doing hill sprints. Some particularly good stretches for this type of workout are high knees, butt kicks, and toy soldiers. Stretch until you feel energized—not fatigued."

Hold your chin at the normal level and keep your eyes looking forward. You should keep your torso upright and the balls of your feet should land directly under your chest. Do not lean forward when running. [13] X Research source Hills sprints have a great fitness pay-off but are very challenging—if you’re unable to maintain proper form, then you should stop to avoid injury and over-work.
