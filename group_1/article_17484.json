      "title": "Cross out a small mistake and write the correction next to it.",
      "content": "Cross out a small mistake and write the correction next to it. Using a black gel pen, strikethrough errors in the pay to the order of, date, and memo lines on the check. [1] X Research source Avoid making squiggly lines or trying to block out the mistake completely in ink, or that might raise red flags for the bank clerk who processes the check. Then write the corrected word or number next to the mistake in neat, legible lettering."

    {
      "title": "Write your initials next to the corrected mistake.",
      "content": "Write your initials next to the corrected mistake. Your initials indicate to the bank clerk that you approved the changes made to the check. Place them directly above or adjacent to the correction where the bank clerk can easily see them. Use all 3 of your initials (first, middle, and last), if possible. [2] X Research source Be aware that the bank may not accept the check even after you fix it. Corrections can signal to the bank clerk that someone has altered the check without the owner knowing, leading them to suspect the check isn't authentic. Even if they know you or the payee, they may still reject the check if the bank's policy says they must. If you’re worried your payee's bank won’t accept your check, call or visit them and ask them about it. Sometimes banks will fine people for trying to submit checks that should be voided."

      "content": "Void checks with large errors like an incorrect amount. If either of the amount values is incorrect, void the check and write another one to avoid any confusion. Similarly, write a new check if you made a significant mistake in your signature and it no longer matches how you normally sign. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "No, you should never use whiteout to correct a check.",
      "content": "No, you should never use whiteout to correct a check. The bank clerk must be able to see that you made a mistake on the check and then corrected it properly (with a strikethrough line and your initials). Whiteout blocks out the mistake completely, which will raise the bank's suspicions when the person you gave the check to tries to deposit or cash it. Ultimately, the bank will refuse to accept a check with whiteout on it. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, it's legal to correct some mistakes on a check.",
      "content": "Yes, it's legal to correct some mistakes on a check. For example, you can correct a misspelled payee name, a misprinted date, and anything written in the memo line. However, you should avoid correcting the amount lines or the signature. These types of changes could be viewed as attempts at a crime called check fraud, which is when someone writes a check in someone else's name and tries to cash or deposit it to steal their money.

      "content": "Write the word “void” in large, capital letters across the check. Write it in big enough letters to take up the entire check from left to right (but avoid covering up the banking digits on the bottom left portion of the check). [7] X Research source As an extra precaution, write the word “void” again in places like the signature line or the written amount box."

This will help you account for it later on when you balance your checkbook . [8] X Research source For example, you might write in your check register that it was check #104 and was voided because you wrote the wrong amount on it."

A voided check can be useful for setting up electronic bill payments or to set up a direct deposit account at a financial institution. [9] X Research source Use a scanner to scan the check and save it to your computer files or take a photo of it with your mobile phone. Alternatively, you can just keep the voided check itself.
