This method also works well if you are adding the rice noodles to soup, but you can add rice noodles to soup without soaking or cooking them first."

Otherwise, you will likely break more than a few. Note that fresh rice noodles are soft, but most rice noodles are sold in their hard, brittle form. Fresh rice noodles do not need to be cooked or soaked in water. Instead, they are added directly to the dishes they are served in or steamed. [1] X Research source"

Since these noodles are only partially cooked, you will either need to transfer them to another dish immediately or store them in a way that prevents them from sticking together or drying out. Drain the noodles. The easiest way to do so is to pass them through a colander. Rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process. [2] X Research source Drain once more. Add the noodles into the stir-fry or soup if the dish is near the end of its cooking process. If you are not ready to add the noodles to the dish yet, toss them with a small amount of sesame oil to prevent them from drying out or clumping together temporarily.

Use this method if you do not plan on cooking the noodles further as part of another dish. The boiling method works especially well if you plan on using the rice noodles in cool noodle dishes, including salads and bean dishes. Boiling the noodles is also recommended for flat rice noodles used as wrappers."

      "content": "Place the noodles in a pot or heat-resistant bowl. Dry rice noodles are very brittle, so they must be handled carefully if you do not want to break them into tiny pieces. Fresh rice noodles are not brittle, but they are not cooked with boiling water. Instead, they are usually steamed or added to recipes without being soaked first."

      "content": "Pour boiling water over the noodles. [4] X Research source Unlike wheat noodles, rice noodles are not boiled in water over direct heat. Instead, they must be covered with boiling water and allowed to cook off the stove. To fully cook the noodles, allow them to soak for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring them gently every 1 to 2 minutes to help loosen them. The noodles are done when they are completely limp. Thin, thread-like noodles may cook in less than 7 minutes, while flat rice noodles may take more than 10 minutes if they are thick. Remove the noodles sooner if you plan on cooking them in another dish. The noodles should be pulled out once they just begin to separate if you plan on cooking them further in other hot dishes. This will only take a few minutes. To create a chewier noodle, pre-soak the noodles in lukewarm water before cooking them in boiling water. Soak the noodles in lukewarm water until they are just barely pliable. Drain, then finish cooking in boiling water for an additional 2 minutes or until the center is chewy but not hard."

They will not return to their fully dry state, but they will become partially dry. Drain the rice noodles. The easiest way to do so is by pouring the contents of the bowls through a colander. Lay the moist noodles out flat. Place them in a single layer on a large plate or platter. Allow them to dry for at least 30 minutes in a draft-free area."

      "content": "Serve in stir-fries. Thin, cooked rice noodles present a good alternative to standard rice for Asian-inspired stir-fries. Rice noodles are a key feature of Pad Thai, a specific type of stir-fry commonly consisting of eggs, fish sauce, red chili pepper, tamarind juice, and other protein and vegetable ingredients. If adding the rice noodles to the stir-fry as it cooks, do so during the last few minutes and only partially cook the noodles beforehand. If pouring the stir-fry ingredients over rice noodles after you finish cooking everything, use fully cooked noodles. If using fresh noodles instead of dried, add them directly to the stir-fry during the last few minutes without previously soaking or cooking them."

The best way to add rice noodles to soup is to add uncooked noodles to the broth during the last few minutes of cooking. Monitor closely to make sure that the noodles are not becoming overcooked. You could also add partially cooked noodles to the broth, but you should add them after the soup has already been removed from the heat and immediately prior to serving. The hot broth will be enough to finish cooking the noodles even without being over direct heat."
