      "content": "Section off the top of your client's hair. This section needs to span the width of their forehead. Start it at the corners of their forehead where the hairline curves down. Part it backwards until you reach the crown of the head. Comb the section forward, twist it, and clip it out of the way. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a vertical part going from ear-to-ear. Drag your comb from the center part straight down to just behind your client's left ear. Twist and clip the hair behind the ear out of the way, and leave the hair in front of the ear hanging loose. Repeat this step for the right side. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the hair where you want to make the cut with your fingers.",
      "content": "Hold the hair where you want to make the cut with your fingers. Pinch the sectioned hair between your middle and index finger, holding them horizontal across the hair. Slide your fingers down where you want the shortest layer to land. Hold the hair out and away from the face. [3] X Research source Take a small strand of hair and measure it against the face to see where it lands. Mark where you would like the shortest layer with your fingers, and use that to guide your length. For hair that falls past the shoulders, somewhere around jaw-length would be ideal. For hair that ends above the shoulders, somewhere around nose-length would work great."

      "title": "Cut a V shape into the hair below your fingers.",
      "content": "Cut a V shape into the hair below your fingers. While still pinching the hair, cut upwards, making an upside down V-shape just below your fingers. Both sides of the V-shape should be the same length. Once you finish the cut, run a comb under the hair to straighten it back out. [4] X Research source Use 7-inch (18-cm) dry cutting shears for best results. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Comb the left side section forward and join it to longest front strand. Drop the entire front section of hair, except for the longest strand on the left side edge. Grab the left side section (all of the hair in front of the left ear) and pull it forward. Add the long strand from the front section to it. [6] X Research source Keep the newly-gathered section horizontal and parallel to the floor. Hold it out in front of the client's face; don't drag it across."

      "content": "Cut diagonally from the shortest strand down to the longest. The leftover strand from your front section is now the shortest. Cut at an angle starting at the shortest front strand and finishing at the longest back strand. How steep the angle is depends on the difference in lengths between the two edges. [7] X Research source You can also cut at a shallower angle, but this will shorten the overall length of the haircut."

If there is a significant difference in length, cut the hair accordingly. [8] X Research source You can do this by measuring the back strands against the longest side strands, then cutting them. You can also compare two strands from each side of the head to see if they are the same length."

      "content": "Start with wet hair that's parted into 4 sections. Part the hair down the center first, going from the forehead down to the nape of the neck. Next, create a part going across the top of the head like a headband, from just behind the left ear to just behind the right ear. [9] X Research source This style will give you some face-framing layers that angle down into a V shape on the back. This method is meant for cutting someone else's hair, but you can alter some of the techniques to cut your own."

Pinch it between your index and middle fingers where you wish to cut it, then snip the hair off below your fingers. [10] X Research source Something around nose-length will give a very heavily layered look. If your client has very long hair or if they like to wear their hair in ponytails, make it about jaw-length instead. Hold the scissors so that they are almost vertical. Snip upwards into the hair instead of making an horizontal cut. This will keep the ends from being too blunt."

Tilt the comb so that it is parallel to the angled part on the client's head. Make sure that the comb is just below the end of the central guide strand so that you have room to cut. [12] X Research source Use a comb color that contrasts with your client's hair. This will make it easier to see."

Flip the hair over your index finger and cut it so that it is the same length as the central guide. This will create a face-framing cut on the front. Use a pair of 7-inch (18-cm) dry cutting shears for this."

Comb the hair forward into the previous cut before cutting the hair. Repeat combing the hair forward and cutting until you reach the vertical part, then do the other side. Measure the uncut strands against a previously-cut strand. Pull hair from both sides of the head together to see if they are the same length or not. As you continue to cut the hair, you'll notice it naturally taking on an angled, V shaped cut."
