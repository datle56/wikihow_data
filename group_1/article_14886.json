The water will be infused with the flavor and nutrients of the raisins. Carefully pour the mixture into a sieve or colander to separate the raisins from the water. Then pour the water back into the pot and place the raisins in a small container to store them. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Drink the water first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. It’s thought that drinking the water on an empty stomach is the best way for your body to absorb the nutrients. Try drinking your water right when you get up before you have your breakfast. There isn't scientific data to back this, but it is fine to give it a try. [4] X Research source If you don’t want to drink it in the morning, you can drink it at a different time during the day. Just make sure that you haven’t eaten anything for several hours before drinking your kishmish water. The recommended amount is to drink a glass of kishmish water each morning. If there are health benefits, you can likely get them from this amount. If you like the taste, there's probably no reason you can't drink a couple of glasses. Check with your doctor if you have any concerns."

Some people believe that having an empty stomach allows the kishmish water to work faster. While that is not backed by science, it will not hurt you to eat the raisins on an empty stomach.

But if you want to get the most out of the raisins, eat them after they’ve soaked. There is some evidence that raisins can help lower blood pressure. It is possible they include other benefits. Either way, the raisins are a healthy and tasty treat. [6] X Research source You can snack on the raisins throughout the day. You don’t have to eat them at the same time as you drink the water."
