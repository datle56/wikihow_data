      "content": "Perform deadlifts early in your workout. A deadlift is one of the best workouts for building muscle mass. It is a compound workout, meaning that it trains multiple muscle groups with the same motion. Do compound workouts like this early in your workout while your body is still fresh and can handle big motions. Then move on to more targeted exercises. [1] X Research source Perform a deadlift by standing in front of a barbell with your feet shoulder-width apart. Then bend your legs down and grab the barbell. Stand up straight, and then bend back down to bring the barbell to the floor. Keep your back straight and focus the weight on your legs to prevent back injuries. Never start doing deadlifts with more weight than you can handle. This can seriously injure your back and legs. Start small with deadlifts to build your body’s mass. Exercises like deadlifts, squats, and bench presses are great for any age group. [2] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 14 May 2020."

      "content": "Do squats to build your leg and back muscles. Like deadlifts, squats are a compound workout that trains multiple muscle groups. Do them early in your workout as well when you’re still fresh. [3] X Research source Line yourself up under the squat rack so the barbell rests just below your neck. Grab the bar and stand up, lifting the barbell off the rack. Then bend your hips and knees until your legs are parallel with the floor. Stand back up to complete the motion. Keep your back straight and focus the weight on your legs. Start off with light weights when doing squats as well. They can hurt your back if you start with too much weight."

Perform them on any day that you’re training your biceps. [4] X Research source Take a dumbbell in each hand and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lift your arms at the elbow so the dumbbells nearly reach your shoulders. Then lower your arms to complete the motion. Do 3 sets of curls in a workout."

      "content": "Build your triceps and chest with pushups . The triceps and chest work together on most pushing motions, so training them together is important for building your upper body. Pushups train both muscles. Place your hands on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Then bend your elbows until your chin reaches the floor. Push yourself back up to complete the motion. [5] X Research source If you don’t like pushups, try a bench press as an alternate exercise. Once you’ve mastered these movements, you can try a more advanced exercise for building your chest and arms like doing a pull-up or chin-up. Reader Poll: We asked 759 wikiHow readers and 59% of them agreed that the best exercise for building upper-body mass is a pull-up. [Take Poll]"

These core areas support your balance and posture while you lift heavy weights. Do at least one core workout per exercise session. There are many to choose from. [6] X Research source Sit ups are the most common core workout. Start out with these to get your core into shape. Planks are another good core workout. Hold yourself in a push-up position and tighten your core. Hold the pose for as long as you can without stopping.

      "content": "Warm up and stretch before exercising. A good warmup routine is especially important if your muscles are weak. Cold muscles are easier to strain, so you’re more susceptible to injuries if you don’t warm up. Do some jogging, walking, jump rope, or jumping jacks to get your body moving. Try to break a sweat during your warmup routine. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 10 minutes of light jogging or riding on a stationary bike is a good warmup activity. Then stretch all your major muscle groups after your warmup routine. Focus specifically on the muscles you’re training that day. You can also wait to stretch until after your workout.

This works your entire muscle group and ensures a quality workout. [10] X Research source Do reps slowly as well. Performing weight exercises quickly is more of a cardio workout, and won’t help build mass. A general rule is that if you feel like you’re working out at a good pace, slow down a little more. Try setting a stopwatch and see how long you can extend 3 reps of push-ups. [11] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 14 May 2020."

      "content": "Develop a workout schedule and stick to it. An exercise program requires more than going to the gym and doing random workouts. Targeted workouts that train specific muscle groups on a regular schedule build muscle more effectively. Design a weekly schedule that mixes in 3-5 exercises for every workout session/ Be consistent with this schedule every week. [12] X Research source Let your muscle groups rest for 24-48 hours between workouts. If you train your biceps on Monday, wait until Wednesday to train them again. A sample workout schedule is biceps and back on Monday, triceps and chest on Tuesday, legs and back on Wednesday, and rest day on Thursday."

      "content": "Schedule 2 rest days per week so your muscles can recover. While it may seem counterproductive, resting is very important for building muscles. Exercising causes tears in your muscles. If you work out every day without a rest, these tears won’t heal. Schedule in 2 rest days every week so your muscles heal properly. Don’t take more than 3 rest days per week, though, unless you’re injured or sick. If you still want to be active on your rest days, try taking a walk or riding your bike. These activities keep you moving without stressing your sore muscles."

Use a notebook and write down the date and the activities you do for every workout. Note down how much weight you used and how many reps you did. Use this information to increase your workout intensity as you improve. [13] X Research source Also note how you felt during each workout. Writing “hard” next to one workout could tell you that you should ease off that activity or use a lighter weight. Taking a “before” picture is helpful too. Before you start your new workout regimen, take a picture of yourself in the mirror without a shirt on. Then take another picture at the end of every month so see the physical changes in your body."

      "content": "Prioritize strength-building exercises over cardio. While cardio workouts are important for well-rounded health, they could also inhibit your ability to build muscle. Running, swimming, and hard cycling burn calories and protein that your body needs for muscle growth. If you do a lot of cardio, replace these workouts with more weight training. This ensures your body’s resources go towards building up muscle mass. [14] X Research source Don’t cut out cardio entirely. Rather, fit cardio into your routine only after you’ve done at least 3-4 weight workouts per week. You can still run or bike to warm up for workouts. This keeps cardio in your routine while serving your muscle-building goals."

      "content": "Start with light weights when you’re just beginning. This is a rule whenever you start a new workout routine, but it’s especially important if your muscles are weak. Lifting too much weight can cause injuries that prevent you from working out for weeks. Start very small in the beginning. Spend at least a week getting used to working out with light weights. Then scale the weight up when you feel comfortable. A good guideline for finding the right weight is doing 10 reps with it. If you pick up 15 lb (6.8 kg) dumbbells and struggle to do 7 curls, then they’re too heavy. Switch to a lighter weight."

Start by adding 250-500 calories to your normal daily intake. If you're still having trouble building muscle after a few weeks, increase this intake by 10% a week until you start gaining more muscle mass. [15] X Research source If your baseline caloric intake is 2,000 calories per day, then increase this to 2,250 for a week. If you haven't gained anything, try 2,500 the following week. Speak with your doctor about determining your ideal baseline caloric intake. Then add 250-500 on top of this.

Getting the proper dosage of protein is especially crucial when you’re doing a workout regimen. If you’ve had trouble building muscles in the past, up your intake.

Your doctor can tell you if a supplement might interact with any medications you're on and direct you towards the best products. The most common supplement types are creatine and whey. These both boost your protein intake and support muscle growth. Always buy supplements from a reputable dealer like a licensed vitamin shop."
