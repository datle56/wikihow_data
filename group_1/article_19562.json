      "content": "Use an herbicide. Onion weed can be effectively and fairly safely eliminated by using an herbicide containing glyphosate. You should follow the directions given with the herbicide, but in most cases you simply spray the herbicide on the weeds you want to eliminate. [3] X Research source Please note: The WHO considers glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen. Its use is prohibited in some states and countries. Please check with your local laws and use caution if handling this chemical. Always spray on a clear, non-windy and dry day. Always wear protective gear when using an herbicide."

      "content": "Cover the area in plastic for a herbicide-free option. Take a sheet of opaque black plastic that is large enough to cover the area infested with onion weed. Use several sheets if necessary. Hold the plastic in place with rocks or stakes, and leave it there for several weeks. [4] X Research source By cutting off light that the plants need to survive, this method will eventually kill the weeds. This method will probably also dry out the soil in the area, and may kill grass or other plants along with the onion weed. Plan it to take a year or so for the soil and area to return to normal."

      "content": "Dig bulbs out of the ground. You can pull wild onions out of the ground, but merely yanking on the green stalks will leave the bulbs in the ground. This means that before too long, the weeds will return. To really eliminate the weed, you will have to take a small trowel and dig the whole plant out of the ground, bulb and all.

      "content": "Choose an herbicide. Only certain herbicides are effective against wild onions. Look for “postemergence” ones, meaning herbicides that are sprayed on the plants after they sprout options include herbicides containing: [6] X Research source Imazaquin A combo of 2,4-D, dicamba, and mecoprop (MCPP) in them. Glyphosate (useful only if you have a small number of wild onions to eliminate)"

      "title": "Attack persistently.",
      "content": "Attack persistently. Because wild onions have long, smooth leaves, it isn’t easy for herbicides to stick. This means that you will most likely have to spray several times a season, possibly for more than one year. Don’t give up! [7] X Research source Spray in late fall and again in late winter or early spring. Mowing before you spray might help."

      "content": "Try a natural method instead. If you want to avoid herbicides, dig up the bulbs first and discard. Then spray ordinary white vinegar in the hole. Refill the holes with new topsoil. You can also try smothering wild onions under black plastic, in the same way as you would for onion weed."
