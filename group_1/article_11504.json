As you move to the left side, leave your head in the center as if it is stuck in place while you step out to the side. This will cause you to lean your body to the side. Next, step out with your right foot past your starting position. Bring your left foot to meet your right, tapping your left foot on the ground. During this motion, your upper body should come back to the middle and then lean over to the right side, while your head stays in place. Repeat, swaying your body and stepping side to side to the beat of the music. Move your arms to the beat as you move from side to side. Your arms can be bent at your waist as you sway or you can raise them in the air. Just move them naturally with the movement of your body as you move to the tempo of the music.

Then, push your chest out and lean your head back as you start to stand back up straight. Your head should come back to center as you straighten your body and knees.
