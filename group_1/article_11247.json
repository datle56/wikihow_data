      "title": "Comb your hair out and straighten it.",
      "content": "Comb your hair out and straighten it. Before cutting your hair, make sure it’s free of any knots and tangles and that it falls straight. If you have straight hair, you can cut it dry or damp. If you have wavy or curly hair, wash it, dry it, and straighten it so that your cuts will be more precise and even. [1] X Research source If you have curly or wavy hair and don’t plan to style it straight, remember to cut it a little longer than you want it to be: once it’s wavy or curly again, it’ll be shorter."

      "content": "Pull your hair back into a low ponytail. Part your hair down the middle. Pull it back into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck, then secure it with a hair tie. Make sure that the ponytail is neat and smooth, and that all your hairs are in elastic. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie another elastic a few inches/centimeters below the first one.",
      "content": "Tie another elastic a few inches/centimeters below the first one. Smooth your ponytail down as much as you can, then wrap another elastic around it. Adding elastics gives you control before and as you cut. Depending on how long your hair is, and how short you plan on cutting it, you may need to add a third elastic below the second one. If you don’t have extra elastics, just gently pull the first elastic down to right above the place you want to cut your hair. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the ponytail in your fingers where you want to cut it, and cut.",
      "content": "Hold the ponytail in your fingers where you want to cut it, and cut. Make a V-shape with your fore and middle fingers, then close your fingers around the ponytail. Using sharp hairdressing shears , cut your hair slowly and carefully, a little bit at a time. [4] X Research source Make sure to cut an inch or so below the hair tie, rather than above, so that it’s easier to flatten out the hair between your fingers. Cutting above the hair tie, where your hair is thickest, will result in a choppier cut."

    {
      "title": "Undo the ponytail and check the shape.",
      "content": "Undo the ponytail and check the shape. Turn around so that your back is facing the mirror, and hold another mirror up in front of you. Your hair will either have a rounded bottom edge or a slight curve. [5] X Research source If this is not straight enough for you, proceed to the next step."

      "content": "Part your hair down the center and make 2 ponytails. Drape the left side of your hair over your left shoulder, and the right side over your right shoulder. Tie them tightly, letting the hair hang over your shoulders. [6] X Research source If your hair is particularly thick or unruly, it into 4 ponytails to make it more manageable. Just make sure all ponytails are the same length and lie in front of your shoulders."

      "content": "Pinch one ponytail in your fingers and cut. Grab a ponytail, then pinch it between your fore- and middle fingers as you did earlier, and drag your fingers downward at a slight upward angle (that is, with the angle higher nearer your shoulders and lower at your neck). Cut the hair below your fingers using the same process as before. [7] X Research source Cutting your hair at this angle will allow you to cut the hair from the back of your head shorter ; when you brush your hair out, it will be the same length."

      "title": "Repeat the process with each ponytail.",
      "content": "Repeat the process with each ponytail. To ensure that you’re cutting each ponytail at the same length, measure the uncut hair against the cut hair. Take the innermost strands from both the left and right sections. Note where the cut strand ends on the uncut strand with your fingers. [8] X Research source"

While some cuts are best done on dry hair , a straight-across haircut is best done on wet hair to ensure it’s as smooth, straight, and manageable as possible. You don't have to wash the person's hair with shampoo and conditioner, but it needs to be wet (but not soaking). [9] X Research source Keep in mind that however short you cut their hair, it will be a bit shorter when it’s fully dry."

Clip the bun out of the way, or secure it with a hair tie. Leave the bottom portion of their hair loose.

[11] X Research source You can also use a rat-tail comb to measure out the sections. This will prevent you from accidentally pulling down too hard on it."

Make sure your fingers stay parallel to the part you made earlier and the floor.

To even them out, let the hair fall where it would naturally fall by the person’s shoulders and trim it using your fingers as a guide. [18] X Research source"
