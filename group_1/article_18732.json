      "content": "Eat for your increased exercise while still cutting calories. Making diet changes can be tough, especially if you have started an exercise routine. Start by making smart choices for your 1200-1400 calories. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat. Processed sugar and high fructose corn syrup can negatively affect weight loss. Also avoid eating processed foods. Stick with natural, unprocessed foods. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Try to snack on things like avocados, kale chips, carrot sticks, hummus, berries, and other produce that provides the essential micronutrients, complex carbohydrates, health fats, and proteins your system while curbing your appetite. Add in low-fat dairy. Eat high protein Greek yogurt, skim milk, and low-fat cheese as part of your normal calorie intake. The dairy can help build muscles and make you feel fuller longer. Eating a dessert or some fries may be part of your daily menu, but make these occasional, \"treat\" foods, instead of your normal routine. Remember that treat foods aren't to be eaten every day, or even every week."

      "content": "Prepare your body for muscle building and fat loss. Making significant, positive body changes is both physical and mental. Make sure your body is at top shape so you see the best results. Schedule time for sleep. People who get fewer than 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night are more likely to carry weight in their mid-section. [2] X Research source This will keep you from your goals. Try to set aside the hour before you go to bed to turn off electronics and relax from the day, so that you can get restful sleep. Add a stress reducing activity to your day. When your body feels stress because of work or your personal life, it releases cortisol, which can tell you to pack on pounds on your waist.

[4] X Research source Switching from 30 minute workouts to 1 hour workouts can improve your tone and fat loss greatly. Your curves will get more pronounced faster. If you don't have time to do 45-60 minutes at once, break up the time into 2 30-minute workouts. Do a 30 minute workout at the gym and do a speed walking session after dinner. Make sure to have at least 1 workout that is 30 minutes to reap the benefits. Reader Poll: We asked 157 wikiHow readers if they found cardio effective for losing weight, and 73% of them said yes.

      "content": "Do interval training. High-intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is where you do short bursts of intense work followed by less intense activity or rest. This kind of workout is great for blasting fat away. To do this, warm up, then switch between low/moderate and high intensity for 2 to 4 minutes at a time. For example, try running for as fast as you can for 1 minute (or 15 or 30 seconds to start if you can't run for a minute). Walk for twice that time (2 minutes for 1 minute of running; 1 minute for 30 seconds; 30 seconds for 15 seconds). Repeat 5 times for a fat blasting 15 minute workout.

[6] X Research source Make each of your workouts different to work different muscle groups for all-around tone and keep your metabolism running high. Try a class, such as spinning, barre, cardio burn, flow yoga, or boot camp once per week. Workout on a machine, like an elliptical, treadmill, or stair stepper 1 day. You can set these machines for interval workouts. Try other activities like swimming, hiking hills, speed walking, or biking to further break up the routine. Use 30-minute or longer strength training sessions as both cardio and strength training workouts. Use weight machines or hand weights and add them to a 30-minute machine workout. Decrease the time that you rest between sets to keep your heart rate up and your body sweating."

      "content": "Tone the curves around your hips, thighs, waist and breasts by strength training. To get and maintain a curvy figure, pay attention to your legs and arms while strengthening your core. [7] X Research source Another thing to do while strengthening your curves is not to forget the back of your body. [8] X Research source Strength train 3 to 4 times per week - basically every other day. Once your cardio exercise burns off excess fat, these exercises will provide hourglass curves. Do squats to target your glutes and thighs. Always keep your stomach flexed and your spine neutral. Add hand weights for added resistance. Try step ups to improve your glutes, hips, and thighs. Place a bench in front of you that is at knee height or higher. Place your right foot on the bench. Then, step up onto the bench with your left foot. Lower your left foot and your right foot. Repeat 12 times with each foot leading. Do side steps to improve hips and the outside of the thighs. Do planks. Start out with a half-plank on your knees if you are beginning. When your strength increases, advance to a full body plank. Go for side planks to work your oblique muscles. Do Serratus pushups. This will work the shoulders and chest areas to better support curves in your upper body. Get on your hands and knees. Lower your arms so that you are resting on your elbows. Flex your stomach muscles in and get into a low plank position with your legs out. Squeeze your shoulder blades together for 2 to 5 seconds, then let them go apart. Do this in 2 sets of 10 while breathing slowly in and out. Target your outer thighs with clam shells. Get on your side, resting on your elbow. Place your knees in front of you as you would when you sit in a chair. Open your knees while keeping your heels together. Pause and lower your knees with control until they meet. Do 20 clam shells, and make sure your hips stay stacked so all of the work remains in your thighs."

      "content": "Avoid wearing all black. Black is a slimming color and can emphasize your thin frame, or diminish the curves you do have. Instead, wear bright colors, or even better, patterns that give some texture to your body. If you have a curvy bottom half, but not a curvy top half, then wear a darker color on bottom and a lighter color on top to balance out your shapes."

This gives the illusion of more pronounced curves by drawing attention to the smaller waist. [10] X Research source Try a peplum top or dress. This style of dress can help emphasize a curvy silhouette despite your body type. Peplums flare at the hips, and narrow at the waist. Wear a belt. Like a peplum, belts help give the illusion of an hourglass figure by helping to narrow the waist and letting the material flare at the hips. [11] X Research source"

These garments, like cinching the waist, make your waist appear smaller while making the rest of your look curvy. Try shirts with sleeves that add volume, like ruffle sleeves or puffy sleeves. Another great look for an hourglass effect is a wrap shirt. Try maxi dresses, mermaid skirts, tulip skirts, pleated skirts, and skirts with layers to help give the illusion of curves. Also try harem pants and dolman sleeves, or ruffles along the front."
