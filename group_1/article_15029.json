      "title": "Cut the figs in half.",
      "content": "Cut the figs in half. Use a paring knife to cut the figs in half from stem to tip on a cutting board. Cutting the figs in half will help them dry more quickly."

      "title": "Lay them on a wire or wooden rack covered with cheesecloth.",
      "content": "Lay them on a wire or wooden rack covered with cheesecloth. Put a layer of cheesecloth on top of any wooden or wire rack, such as those intended for cooling or dehydrating. In order to dry properly, the figs need airflow from above and below, so don't use a solid surface like a baking sheet. Place the figs cut-side up on the cheesecloth. Alternatively, you could put whole figs on wooden skewers and hang them in the sun, using clothespins to attach the skewers to branches or to a clothesline. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover the figs with cheesecloth.",
      "content": "Cover the figs with cheesecloth. This will protect them from insects as they dry. Tuck the cheesecloth tightly around the drying rack, securing it with tape if necessary, to make sure it won't come loose. [2] X Research source If you hung up your figs instead, you won't be able to protect them with the cheesecloth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the rack in full sunlight during the day.",
      "content": "Place the rack in full sunlight during the day. This method works best when it is very dry and hot outside. Don't place the figs in the shade, or they won't dry as quickly and may spoil before they're properly preserved. You'll need to bring them in each evening so they don't get spoiled by dew."

    {
      "title": "Return the figs to the sun for 2 to 3 days.",
      "content": "Return the figs to the sun for 2 to 3 days. Each morning, turn the figs over so they dry evenly on all sides and then place them back outside in the sunlight. The figs are ready when the outside feels leathery and no juice can be seen on the inside when squeezed. If the figs remain a little sticky, you can finish them in the oven."

      "content": "Preheat your oven to 140° F (60° C). This should be the lowest setting your oven has, which is necessary to dry the figs at a low, even temperature. Drying them at a higher temperature would result in cooked figs . [3] X Research source If your oven doesn't heat to such a low temperature, set it at the lowest possible temperature and keep the oven door partially open."

      "content": "Put the figs in the oven for up to 36 hours. Prop the oven door open slightly to allow the moisture to escape and prevent the figs from getting too hot and cooking instead of drying. If you don't want to leave the oven on continuously, you can turn it off halfway through, then turn it back on if necessary. Be sure to turn the figs occasionally during the drying process.
