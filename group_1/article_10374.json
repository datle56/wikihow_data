      "content": "Clean debris off the wall with water and a sprayer. Remove as much debris as possible from the wall so the concrete bonds cleanly to it. Spray away most debris with water from a garden hose. Also, try mixing 1 cup (240 mL) of a mild dish soap into about 5 US gal (19,000 mL) of hot water to scrub off tough stains with a concrete brush. [1] X Research source Use a power washer for extra cleaning power. If you don’t own one, see if your local hardware store has one to rent. For tough stains you can’t quite remove by hand, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of trisodium phosphate in about 1 US gal (3,800 mL) of water. Scrub it into the stains with a brush before rinsing it off with clean water. The chemical is strong, so cover up with long-sleeved clothing, gloves, goggles, and a respirator mask.

      "content": "Mix surface bonding cement with water to a pasty consistency. The easiest product to use on a cinder block wall is surface bonding cement. All you have to do is pour the cement into a container such as a wheelbarrow, then stir in the water with a shovel. You need approximately 4 cups (950 mL) of water for an 80 lb (36 kg) bag of cement mix. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Shop online or visit your nearest home improvement store for cement and all the tools you need to apply it. With surface bonding cement, you don't need to apply a concrete bonding adhesive. If you wish to use another type of cement or concrete, also get a bag of adhesive. Mix it with water and spread it on the wall first."

      "content": "Wet a section of the wall again to prepare it to bond with the cement. Spray the entire wall thoroughly with water from a garden hose. Then, go back to a section of the wall to work on first. Spray it once again with water. Dampen an area approximately 3 ft × 6 ft (0.91 m × 1.83 m) in size, or as much as you can cover with cement in about 10 minutes of work. [4] X Research source The wall needs to be well-soaked in order for the cement to bond to it. Always work on one part of the wall at a time to avoid any problems with the cement coating."

      "title": "Spread a 1⁄4 in (0.64 cm) layer of cement on the wall.",
      "content": "Spread a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) layer of cement on the wall. The cement needs to be applied in sections to prevent it from drying out before you’re finished working. To prevent issues, start out by covering the small portion you dampened. Scoop some cement out of your mix with a trowel, hawk, or another tool, then slather it over the area with a trowel. Start at the top of the wall, spreading the concrete from left to right. [5] X Research source A hawk is a flat tool used to pick up and hold lots of concrete, mortar, or other material. Normally you would have to dip into the mix many times. Using a hawk reduces this, making the application process much easier. For a faster way to cover wall sections, take advantage of a concrete sprayer. Load the concrete into the sprayer, then hold it close to close to the wall to avoid spraying the areas you aren’t ready to work on yet. If you need to check the cement’s thickness, try using a tape measure on an open part of the wall."

      "content": "Repeat dampening the wall and spreading cement until you’re finished. Spray another small section of the wall, completely soaking it before applying a layer of cement. Smooth out the cement before moving onto the next portion. Keep doing this until your wall is coated in a single, perfect layer of fresh cement. If you make a mistake, scrape off the cement right away with a trowel or another tool. Cement is much easier to take care of before it hardens!"

      "content": "Mist and dry the cement for 3 days. Get a big misting bottle and fill it with water. Dampen the concrete twice a day for 3 days straight to ensure it cures correctly. After that, your wall is done and you can enjoy the strong but smooth finish the cement gives it. Cement can be painted over by coating it with a concrete primer. Another option is to mix colored concrete pigment into your wheelbarrow of wet cement to give it some color."

Look for tough stains, damaged spots, and other issues you need to address. Spend time lifting stains with soap, trisodium phosphate, and other cleaners. Also, clear debris out of damaged spots and repair them. To repair damage, mix mortar . Fill in the gaps to level out the wall as much as possible."

      "content": "Brush a concrete bonding agent on the wall and let it dry overnight. The bonding agent provides a surface for the first layer of stucco to adhere to. If you don’t apply it, the finished wall may end up looking patchy and uneven. Use a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush to go over the entire wall top to bottom. Coat the wall with a single layer of the bonding agent.

If you’re making your own, get sand, lime, and Portland cement. Try combining 3 parts sand, 1 part lime, and 1 part cement to create a good mix that adheres well to vertical walls. [7] X Research source You can also mix in a concrete pigment to color the stucco if you don’t plan on painting it later."

      "content": "Apply a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) scratch coat with a trowel. If you have a concrete sprayer, use it to cover large areas quickly. Otherwise, try picking up the stucco mix with a flat tool like a hawk and then transferring it to the wall with a trowel. Add the stucco to the top of the wall, then spread it from left to right, repeating this as needed to finish the layer. The scratch coat is like a second base for the outer layer of stucco, so don’t skip it. Applying a large amount of stucco all at once is a recipe for an unappealing finish."

      "title": "Scratch the stucco 5 to 10 minutes after applying it.",
      "content": "Scratch the stucco 5 to 10 minutes after applying it. Waiting allows the scratch coat to solidify it a little bit so you don’t accidentally end up scratching the wall underneath it. When you’re ready, get a tool called a scarifier, which looks like a handheld rake or comb. Rake it horizontally across the entire wall to scratch lines into the stucco. [8] X Research source A scratch coat is a rough initial layer. You create scratch marks on it to create a base for the final layer to bond to, leading to a stronger wall covering. The scratch marks don’t have to be perfectly horizontal or even. Simply drag the tool across the wall a few times. As long as you have marks along the entire wall, you can create a much stronger finish. If you don’t have a scarifier available, use the edge of a trowel or another tool. Make the scratches about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) deep."

Keep it wet by spraying it with water from a misting bottle each morning and afternoon. If you let the stucco dry out before it finishes curing, it may weaken and crack. Stucco is similar to concrete and needs to be treated the same way. Always let the first layer cure before applying a second one."

      "content": "Apply a second layer of stucco and let it dry. Finish the wall cover by repeating the process with another 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) layer. This time, instead of scratching the stucco, use the trowel to create whatever finished design you want. When you’re finished, mist it and dry it for at least 2 days. For example, some designers sweep a trowel across the stucco to give it an uneven, ridged design. You could also use a scarifier to give it a scratched design or leave it flat if you wish. If you wish to use concrete pigment, don’t forget to mix it in with the fresh batch of stucco. Otherwise, you can apply wall paint to the stucco after it finishes drying."

Furring strips are little more than wood boards treated to be water-resistant. They are approximately 2 × 4 × 8 in (5.1 × 10.2 × 20.3 cm) in size. Cut 2 separate boards to the same width as the wall. [9] X Research source Look for furring strips at your local home improvement store. Some places sell pre-cut strips, but you can also ask to have treated pine boards cut to the size you need."

      "content": "Position the boards to the top and bottom edges of the wall. The first strip is easy to position since you situate it on the side of the wall at the very top. For the lower board, measure up about 6 in (15 cm) from the bottom edge of the wall. Make sure the boards go from one end of the wall to the other, adding additional boards as needed if yours are too short. [10] X Research source Consider marking the installation points with chalk first. Check the line with a level to ensure the furring boards will form a straight row when you install them. If your wall has windows, doors, and other obstructions, keep the furring strips away from them. Install separate furring strips around each of these components, basically framing them. For soffits and fascia, you can get separate pieces of vinyl designed to fit these wood components. Slide the vinyl into a top strip or J-channel and nail them as needed to hold them in place."

Position it so it extends about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) below the lower furring. Place 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) galvanized siding nails in the slots pre-cut in the starter to pin it in place. [14] X Research source Look for vinyl siding kits online or at your local home improvement store to get all the components you need. Alternatively, buy the parts separately to suit your wall. If you’re working around doors and windows, get more vinyl starters. You need corner pieces and J-channel pieces to connect them together. They attach to the furring boards the same way the starter does."

Work from one side of the other, pinning the panels with 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) galvanized siding nails placed in their pre-cut nailing slots. When you get to the end of the wall, start with the next row, allowing the new panels to overlap the first ones by 1 in (2.5 cm). [15] X Research source Look for labels on the nail slots in each panel. These slots are often marked with letters to help installers line up rows of panels properly. The vinyl panels are pretty thin, so don’t put the nails in too tightly. Pound the nails in so they’re about even with the upper lip of each panel. That way, the panels can expand and contract as the weather changes."
