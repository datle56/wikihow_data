      "content": "Keep a log of the specific times you urinate throughout the day. For a 24 to 48 hour period, write down what time it is when you urinate on a normal day. This will show you how long you usually wait to go to the bathroom so you have a good starting point for your training. Do this the day before you start your bladder training to get the most accurate information. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, you might feel the urge to urinate every hour or so. If you know that, you can figure out how much longer you need to wait. Most people urinate between 4 and 7 times a day on average. If you’re going much more than that, bladder interval training is probably right for you."

      "content": "Try to hold your urine for 15 minutes longer than you normally would. For example, if you normally go to the bathroom every hour, try to hold it for an hour and 15 minutes. This can be tough at first, so don’t beat yourself up if you don’t quite make it. Try to avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea. These make your bladder more active and can make the need to urinate more intense."
