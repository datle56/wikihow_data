      "content": "Choose between a dealership, independent shop, or franchise for maintenance. Routine or scheduled maintenance are small jobs (like oil changes or filter replacements) listed in your user manual that keep your vehicle in great running condition. You have the most flexibility with these kinds of services: [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source You can go to any dealership if your vehicle is still under warranty (it doesn’t have to be the exact dealership you purchased the car at). Dealerships will definitely have the know-how to service your specific vehicle, but is usually the most expensive option. In most cases, you can also go to any franchise or independent shop if you’re under warranty (just double check your contract to be sure). They’re usually less expensive than a dealership and can handle nearly all routine maintenance, but there’s a slim chance they may not have certain tools or training to service your specific vehicle, depending on the make and model. A franchise shop may be a faster and cheaper option than an independent shop or garage, but an indie shop may do better work or have better mechanics on staff (it depends on the individual shop, though—more on that later)."

      "content": "Look at dealerships, independent shops, or specialty shops for repairs. If your vehicle is under warranty and you need a repair beyond basic maintenance, a dealership is your best bet—they’ll have all of the tools, training, and access to necessary parts to work on your car. If your warranty has expired, a good independent shop should be able to do most if not all of the work to repair your car as well. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source However, for very large or complicated repairs, you may want to look into a shop that specializes in your make and model (especially if you drive a luxury vehicle or a vehicle that requires specialty parts, for example). They may have training and equipment other shops don’t."

      "content": "Ask trusted family and friends for recommendations. This is one of the easiest ways to find good service at a reasonable price, especially if you know people that drive the same vehicle as you (or a similar one). Ask your local friends and family for their recommendations or make a social media post to cast a wider net in your area. Quality mechanics care about building a good reputation in their community, so the locals usually know best!

      "content": "Check online reviews on sites like Yelp , CarTalk , or Angi . Read about other customers’ experiences at specific shops or with local mechanics by checking reviews. Sites like CarTalk, for example, offer ratings and reviews on mechanics and shops for free, while other sites like Angi (formerly Angie’s List) require a subscription. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Read both the good reviews and the bad ones. Customers may rate certain services highly and others poorly, so reading lots of reviews can help you determine if the shop or mechanic is a good fit for the maintenance or repair you need."

The American Automobile Association (AAA) provides a database of high-quality repair shops and garages with experienced, National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence-certified (ASE-certified) or factory trained mechanics. Just enter your zip code, select the type of facility you want to search (mechanical, auto body/detailing, or auto glass), enter the distance you’re willing to travel, and hit “Search” to find a list of approved shops in your area. Or, look for an “AAA Approved Auto Repair” sign in the shop’s window to indicate the shop has met AAA’s high standards. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source To see how a shop stands up, visit the BBB website and search the shop’s name. Check its overall rating as well as the specific complaints listed by customers, including how quickly and effectively the shop addressed those complaints. Also check whether the shop is BBB accredited, which means they’ve been vetted and demonstrated an ethical, quality commitment to their customers."

      "content": "Confirm they have a state license to do business legally. If a shop looks sketchy and you’re wondering if it’s even legal, look it up on your state’s Department of Consumer Affairs or Attorney General’s office websites. [7] X Research source Many of these sites will have a licensed auto shop search tool as well. The standards and requirements for licensure vary by state, but by verifying the license, you’re at least making sure you’re not getting scammed or ripped off by an illegitimate business."

      "title": "Check a mechanic’s credentials on a specific shop’s website.",
      "content": "Check a mechanic’s credentials on a specific shop’s website. A quality auto shop or garage hires quality mechanics and technicians. Most shops will post or display their mechanic’s certifications and credentials on their website or in the waiting area at the shop. If these aren’t posted, ask about them—reputable shops and mechanics will have no problem showing you how qualified they are. [8] X Research source Certifications to look for include: ASE-certified technicians: The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) is an independent, nonprofit organization that tests and certifies mechanics based on their skills and knowledge of current auto technology. To be certified, mechanics must pass a written test and have at least 2 years of documented industry experience. The highest level of certification is the Master Automobile Technician. Factory- or automaker-trained technicians: Some automakers have their own certifications for mechanics to work on their cars (typically at dealerships) and offer special factory service training for specific makes and models. Other certifications: ASE or factory certifications are the most trustworthy, but some mechanics may also have training and certification from auto parts suppliers, service equipment manufacturers, or community colleges and technical training companies as well. These are not as rigorous, but they’re better than nothing (or a mechanic refusing to show their qualifications)."

      "content": "Visit a shop in person to get a sense of the atmosphere and convenience. Test a local shop for a super minor repair or maintenance service, like an oil or filter change, to get a sense of how they work before you need a big repair. [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Are the staff friendly and knowledgeable? Do other customers seem satisfied? Is the waiting area clean and is there easily accessible information about the shop and its mechanics? This is also a great chance to test how convenient the shop is. Do the hours conflict with your schedule? Is it near work so you can drop off your car to be serviced during the day? Is there alternate transportation nearby for after you drop off your vehicle? Professional auto mechanic Jason Shackelford says that a good mechanic will want to be ASE-certified: “Taking the initiative to earn your ASE shows potential employers and customers you’re serious about an automotive career and continuing education is always needed in this field.”"

      "title": "“Are you able or certified to service my specific vehicle?”",
      "content": "“Are you able or certified to service my specific vehicle?” Not every mechanic is able to work on every car or truck. If you’re concerned about your specific make and model or specialty parts and services, just ask. [10] X Research source A trustworthy mechanic will let you know if the service or repair is beyond their ability, training, or certification."

      "title": "“How long will I have to wait for the repair to be done?”",
      "content": "“How long will I have to wait for the repair to be done?” Repair time can vary widely based on your vehicle and the type of work being done on it. Do a bit of research ahead of time and ask several shops or mechanics for their estimate (assuming you know what work needs to be done). [11] X Research source Then, do a quick search online to see what the average repair time for that service is and compare your answers. Shops that give you an estimate in the ballpark of the average repair time are probably being honest, while others that go noticeably under or over the average might be suspicious."

    {
      "title": "“Do you offer a guarantee or warranty for your work?”",
      "content": "“Do you offer a guarantee or warranty for your work?” Most shops offer a 12-month or 12 thousand mile (whichever comes first) guarantee or warranty on their work; if your car has an issue within that time, you can take it back to the shop for them to fix it. However, guarantees can vary depending on the shop and the particular service or repair you need done. Try asking about a common repair, like brake work, as a gauge.

      "title": "“What is your hourly rate? Does it vary by car mode?”",
      "content": "“What is your hourly rate? Does it vary by car mode?” The hourly rate usually refers to labor. Knowing a shop or mechanic’s hourly labor rate can help you estimate total repair costs and compare shops. Ask whether the rate changes for your specific make and model (for example, work on luxury sports cars might cost more than for a 10-year-old sedan). [13] X Research source"

      "title": "“Can you break down and explain this repair cost?”",
      "content": "“Can you break down and explain this repair cost?” Ask for a repair or service estimate that includes full breakdowns of both parts and labor, and never be shy to ask why a repair costs what it does. Keep in mind that the cheapest fix isn’t always the best—highly trained technicians or parts covered by longer warranties make for a better (but potentially more expensive) repair. [14] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source An independent mechanic may be able to give you a better price than a dealership (if going there doesn’t void your warranty). However, a dealership is guaranteed to have the specialty tools and know-how for your make and model."

      "title": "“Are your mechanics ASE-certified?”",
      "content": "“Are your mechanics ASE-certified?” If you like the vibe of a shop but still want to confirm that the mechanics there are highly skilled and trained, just ask the owner or a front desk employee (in person or by phone). ASE-certified technicians must recertify every 5 years, so you can rest easy that they’re up-to-date on the latest tech for your vehicle.

      "title": "“Do you charge for preliminary inspections, diagnostics, or estimates?”",
      "content": "“Do you charge for preliminary inspections, diagnostics, or estimates?” Most quality auto shops won’t charge for a preliminary inspection since it’s largely visual and doesn’t require any real labor. This involves examining the exterior of the car and calculating the suspected parts and labor involved in the repair. [16] X Research source If they do charge for the diagnostic, they may credit the cost toward the final cost of repairs, which is also a sign of a good shop. [17] X Research source Keep in mind that preliminary visual estimates usually fall short of the final cost of repair. For a truly accurate estimate, a technician will have to at least partially take apart some of the vehicle for inspection. Since this involves labor, it’s normal to expect a fee."

    {
      "title": "“Do you use OEM parts?”",
      "content": "“Do you use OEM parts?” Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts come directly from the manufacturer of your vehicle and are guaranteed to fit and work exactly how they’re supposed to. If having OEM parts is important to you (like if you have a luxury car or your car is still fairly new when you need a replacement), then ask if an auto shop has them. Many will have to specially order them, which will lengthen your repair time. Some, however, may have direct access to OEM parts—it all depends on the shop and the specific parts you need. [18] X Research source If you go into a dealership, you’re almost always guaranteed to get OEM parts. Keep in mind that OEM parts are more expensive than aftermarket or used parts."

      "content": "A trustworthy mechanic will gather as much info about your car as possible. This helps them diagnose the issue you’re having and give you as accurate of a time and cost estimate as possible. Some questions to look out for include: What brings you in today? What’s concerning you about your vehicle? When did you first notice anything unusual? What kind of work has been done on your vehicle? Do you have any records of previous work done to your vehicle?"

      "content": "Get a second opinion if you notice any of these potential red flags at a shop. Listen to your gut if something feels off about a certain shop or mechanic and look into other locations to compare costs and quality of service if: [19] X Research source A technician gives you a total price without a breakdown or explanation They don’t give you an estimated cost up front. They won’t explain the repair in easy-to-understand language or use complicated industry terms or jargon They make a recommendation without a clear explanation They use “scare” language to convince you to use their services (for example, “I wouldn’t drive this if I were you.”) They won’t share their certifications or qualifications They refuse to give you your old parts if they say they need to be replaced They act super confident about the price ahead of time but something always comes up that increases the costs. They incorporate a lot of diagnostic fees and costs that they didn’t disclose up front."
