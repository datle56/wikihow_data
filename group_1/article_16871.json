      "content": "Pro: Renting with a private landlord can offer extra flexibility. Renting with a property group can come with a lot of bells and whistles, such as an in-depth lease and a credit score check. Renting with a private landlord, however, often makes it easier to skip over a lot of the extra paperwork, contracts, and fine print that are commonly associated with corporate landlords. [1] X Research source Let’s say that you’d like to adopt a dog—a corporately managed property will have hard, non-negotiable terms on pets, while a private landlord can more easily make an exception. [2] X Research source Renting with a private landlord may also be more accessible if you’re struggling with issues like poor credit, past evictions, or prior financial issues."

Private rentals don’t always have these same amenities, which may lower your monthly bill. [3] X Research source Private landlords might also be more willing to negotiate with you on lower rent. For instance, they might chop off part of your rent in exchange for your help with yard work."

Sure, it’s not necessarily hard to get in touch with a private landlord about a maintenance issue—but how long will it actually take them to fix the problem? Since the landlord personally owns the property, they might be a little stingy with repairs, or simply put the repairs on the back burner. A corporately-owned property will likely respond more quickly to your request. [7] X Research source"
