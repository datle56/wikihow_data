      "content": "Wear your wig as you cut it if you want to use your face as a reference. The easiest way to ensure your bangs look exactly how you want is to put on your wig before you make your cuts. Place the wig on your head from back to front, and ensure it fits comfortably around your forehead. Secure the wig using the clips along the band so it stays in place. [1] X Research source With this method, look in the mirror when making your cuts."

      "title": "Cut your wig on a styrofoam head if you want the process to be easier.",
      "content": "Cut your wig on a styrofoam head if you want the process to be easier. If you’d rather look at your bangs directly when you trim them, purchase a styrofoam head from a craft supply store, and put your wig on top of it. Try to align the wig on the head so the forehead is roughly the same height as yours. This way, you don’t wind up cutting the bangs too short. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that styrofoam heads are slightly smaller than human heads, so your bangs will look a bit different on the mannequin than on your head. You can try on the wig first and use a bobby pin to mark where you want to cut the bangs. Use T-pins or straight pins to hold the wig in place as you work with it. Pin the wig at the crown of the head and at the temples, for instance."

      "content": "Tie back all of the hair aside from the bangs so it's out of the way. To make it easier to access the bangs, grasp the majority of the hair, and secure it out of the way either with a hair tie or with a clip. This way, you don’t accidentally cut the other hair by mistake. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Comb the bangs forward so you can trim them with ease.",
      "content": "Comb the bangs forward so you can trim them with ease. Use a rattail comb to brush the bangs of your wig straight down. Comb them until each hair lays smooth and evenly. As you do this, clip back any hair that you don’t want to trim. [4] X Research source If there are stray hairs sticking up, you may trim the bangs unevenly."

      "title": "Leave some longer pieces on the side if you want to frame your face.",
      "content": "Leave some longer pieces on the side if you want to frame your face. While this is optional, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) or so slightly longer on each side can look quite flattering when wearing a wig. Do this if you want to give your bangs a bit more shape and texture. [5] X Research source You can do this whether you are trimming straight or side-swept bangs."

    {
      "title": "Cut off the extra hair from the ends if you are trimming extra-long bangs.",
      "content": "Cut off the extra hair from the ends if you are trimming extra-long bangs. After your bangs are sectioned off from the rest of the hair, make a blunt chop straight across 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) past your eyebrows to make your bangs easier to work with. Depending on your wig type, the bangs may be very long when you get the wig. Some wig designers do this intentionally so you can customize the look of your fringe, particularly for synthetic wigs. [6] X Research source This does not have to be an even, precise cut. The purpose of this is to simply get rid of the weight at the bottom of your bangs."

      "title": "Split your bangs into 2 equal sections so you can cut them evenly.",
      "content": "Split your bangs into 2 equal sections so you can cut them evenly. To ensure your bangs are straight and not slanted or crooked, divide your bangs in half to make 2 equal sections. Then, cut 1 section at a time. Comb the section before you cut it, and pinch the section between your index and middle finger. [7] X Research source If you cut your bangs all at once, your bangs may look slightly curved rather than completely straight. This is because the hair on the sides gets pulled more toward the middle as you make your cut."

      "title": "Make small vertical snips rather than cutting your bangs straight across.",
      "content": "Make small vertical snips rather than cutting your bangs straight across. While pinching the hair in between your fingers, hold the scissors in your dominant hand and angle the blade so it is parallel with your hair fibers. Gradually chip away at the bangs rather than using 1 large chop. This way, you take off small bits of hair at a time. [8] X Research source This is a more forgiving technique when cutting synthetic and human hair."

      "content": "Trim off 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) at a time. Keep in mind that once you cut the wig, the change is permanent and you cannot simply wait for the hair to grow out. Because of this, it’s best to trim your wig gradually. Working in sections is also better to help you not feel overwhelmed by the task. Start by snipping off 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) or so, and then cut off more as you go. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Move on to the next section when you finish trimming the first. Once you’ve snipped the first section of hair to your desired length, use a small section of hair from the last part to act as a guide. Follow the length of that hair as a guideline when cutting the rest of your bangs. [10] X Research source This way, you can easily match the length of both sides for a precise, straight style."

      "content": "Comb both sides of your bangs together to check your length. After you cut the second section, use your rattail comb to connect both parts and see how your bangs look overall. Inspect the overall length and precision of the cut. [11] X Research source If you are trimming your hair yourself, check your fringe from multiple angles in the mirror. If using a styrofoam head to cut the bangs, try slipping on the wig and seeing how the bangs lay on your face."

You can make this decision based on personal preference or on the particular details of your cosplay character, for instance. [13] X Research source For example, maybe your eyesight is better on the left side so you want your bangs angled toward the right."

After your move your bangs to the opposite side, pinch the ends between your index and middle finger so there is about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) at the bottom. Then, tilt your fingers so they make a 45-degree angle with the end of your hair. [15] X Research source This way, you can easily follow the angle of this finger when you make your cuts."

If you need to touch up your fringe, comb your hair toward the side you want the bangs to lay, and try just barely moving the scissors in the direction you want the hair to go. Squeeze the scissors just a tad to trim the hair, rather than closing them all the way. [18] X Research source This way, you don’t make any blunt cuts across your side-swept fringe."
