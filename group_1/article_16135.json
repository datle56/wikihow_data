      "title": "Yes, baking powder expires and loses potency over time.",
      "content": "Yes, baking powder expires and loses potency over time. The good news is it doesn't mold or taste bad, so if you accidentally use some in a recipe, you can still eat the dish after it's prepared. The problem is the dish may not rise. So instead of light, fluffy cakes or plump cookies, for example, you could get flat, dense desserts that aren't very pleasant to eat. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Baking powder lasts up to 6 months unopened and 3 months after opening.",
      "content": "Baking powder lasts up to 6 months unopened and 3 months after opening. The USDA recommends replacing your baking powder if it's been open for 3 months, even if the expiration date is still many months away. If it's still sealed, you can keep it in your pantry until the expiration date (or for 6 months, whichever comes first). [2] X Research source After that, the baking powder will start losing its potency, so you're better off replacing it."

      "content": "Stir 2 tsp (10 g) baking powder into 1 cup (8 oz / 240 ml) hot water and see if it fizzes. If the mixture fizzes and the baking powder dissipates, it's still potent and will make your baked goods rise like you want. But if you don't notice any reaction between the two ingredients, your baking powder is inactive and you should throw it out. [3] X Research source Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate, which is essentially just baking soda. When sodium bicarbonate comes into contact with a liquid like water, it releases carbon dioxide and creates bubbles. This is a process called leavening and is what causes your baked goods to rise. If you don't see bubbles when you add the baking powder to the water, that means the sodium bicarbonate is inactive. Make sure to use hot water, not cold water, as baking powder reacts faster to higher temperatures."

      "content": "Combine ½ tsp (2.8 g) cream of tartar, ¼ tsp (1.5 g) baking soda, and ¼ tsp (1.5 g) cornstarch. This mixture is equivalent to 1 tsp (5 g) of regular baking powder and mimics its three basic components: a base, an acid, and a stabilizer. To produce carbon dioxide and make the dough in baked goods rise, the base (baking soda) needs to react with an acid, like cream of tartar. The cornstarch stabilizes the acid and the base so they don't start interacting before you put the batter or dough in the oven. [4] X Research source The heat in the oven will help your homemade baking powder release its carbon dioxide and cause the baked goods to rise. What if I don't have cornstarch? Gluten-free baking expert Traci Morgan-Hoernke suggests using tapioca starch, potato starch, or arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch. You can also substitute ½ tsp (2.8 g) of cream of tartar and ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of baking soda for every teaspoon of baking powder in your recipe. [5] X Research source Just make sure to put your batter or dough in the oven as quickly as possible because the cream of tartar and baking soda will react immediately as soon as you add liquid to them!"

      "content": "Combine ¼ tsp (1.5 g) baking soda with ½ cup (4 oz / 120 ml) of an acidic food like yogurt. If you don't have cream of tartar on hand, but you have baking soda and food with acid in it, you can combine them into a homemade leavener. Add ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of baking soda to your dry ingredients and ½ cup (4 oz / 120 ml) of buttermilk, yogurt, lemon juice, or vinegar to your wet ingredients for every teaspoon of baking powder in your recipe. After you combine the dry and wet ingredients, transfer the batter or dough to the oven quickly . The baking soda and acid will react fast! [6] X Research source Never substitute baking soda for baking powder at a 1:1 ratio. Baking soda is about 4 times as potent as baking powder, which is why we recommend you only use ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of the soda for every teaspoon of the powder."

If you have any on hand, simply replace your regular all-purpose flour with the same amount of the self-rising variety. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that self-rising flour also contains salt, so you may need to reduce the amount of salt in your recipe (if it calls for any, which most baking recipes do)."

No matter what you're baking, though, if it calls for eggs, you can separate the yolks from the whites and whip the whites with a whisk or a beater until they form medium peaks. Add the yolks into the batter when the recipe tells you, then after all the ingredients are combined, gently fold in your egg whites with a spatula. Then bake the batter according to your recipe's instructions. [8] X Research source Avoid overmixing or being too heavy-handed with the spatula when you're folding in the egg whites. You might cause them to break and lose all their air."

Use it to replace all the liquids in your recipes for batters with light, bubbly structures, like waffles, pancakes, and fritters. The club soda will help them turn out light and airy.

Add however much pepper you prefer for taste, then spread the mixture over the skin of the raw bird. Set it in the refrigerator to rest uncovered for 12-24 hours so it can dry brine (which will help it retain its moisture during cooking).

      "content": "Baking powder is safe to eat when it expires, but it's probably lost its potency. You don't have to worry about getting sick if you accidentally use some in a recipe after it expires. Most likely, though, you'll find that your baked goods don't rise well, if at all. If you run out of baking powder in the middle of a recipe, you can make a substitute with other common household ingredients like baking soda, cream of tartar, and cornstarch."
