      "title": "It's best to remain as calm as possible.",
      "content": "It's best to remain as calm as possible. While being sick and calm is not an easy thing, you want to be clearly understood in order to be treated respectfully. Make sure the rude person isn't you if you are addressing this particular issue. Rudeness doesn’t mean they’re a bad person either; they might just lack social skills."

      "title": "Hospitals and emergency rooms are busy.",
      "content": "Hospitals and emergency rooms are busy. The more severe patients are treated first. Staff do their best to prioritize and can lack a smile on their face when so many people have severe problems they have to deal with. Emergency rooms are highly stressful environments and staff might be dealing with personal problems on top of that. That shouldn't excuse their behavior, but it might help you understand that their attitude is not personal."

      "title": "Try to get some information on the hospital beforehand if possible.",
      "content": "Try to get some information on the hospital beforehand if possible. In the United-States, Medicare is now putting the data out there for you to see and compare. Log on to medicare.gov, and compare hospitals in your area. Pay close attention to readmission rates. This tracks how many patients had to be readmitted for the same condition. You can also research how satisfied patients were with the care they received. It will help you determine where you can get the best care for your illness."

      "title": "Unfortunately, getting treated at a hospital can take some time.",
      "content": "Unfortunately, getting treated at a hospital can take some time. While the nurses and providers would like things to be quick and fast, that is not always the case in the hospital or emergency department. Understand it takes time for testing, and for the doctor to get back to the nurses."

      "title": "If you’re unhappy with a hospital staff member, there are ways to address this.",
      "content": "If you’re unhappy with a hospital staff member, there are ways to address this. If you don't like how the nurse or the provider is treating you, you have the right to ask to be treated by someone else. Ask to talk to the triage nurse, charge nurse, or the nurse manager of the floor, and if they are not available then you can ask to speak to the nursing supervisor. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "It helps for the acutely ill patient to have an advocate to make sure their needs are met.",
      "content": "It helps for the acutely ill patient to have an advocate to make sure their needs are met. Have a family member there during the day and another in the evening. They can then take turns advocating, communicating with the doctors and nurses, and asking questions. The advocate can keep a log or email notification, informing family members of the testing done, the care received, the doctor’s plans, and any questions to ask. With HIPAA laws you will be able to find out more information if you are there advocating for the patient and you are at the bedside."
