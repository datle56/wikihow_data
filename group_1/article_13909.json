      "content": "A welfare check is when a police officer physically stops by someone’s home to see if they’re okay. Regular citizens don’t actually perform welfare checks—instead, they call law enforcement and request an officer to check in on a friend, loved one, neighbor, or co-worker. Local police officers respond to the request and knock on the person’s door to see if they’re safe and doing well. [1] X Research source Welfare checks are commonly requested for elderly loved ones and neighbors."

      "content": "Call a local police non-emergency number or 911. Always call 911 if you suspect that the person is in active, immediate danger (like a suicidal friend or loved one). Dial the police non-emergency number for serious but not necessarily life-threatening concerns (like a neighbor you haven’t heard from in a few days). [2] X Research source Check your police department’s website to find the non-emergency number. If you’re calling on behalf of a distant friend or relative, be sure to call their local precinct."

She hasn’t gotten her mail in several days and I haven’t seen her around the neighborhood at all. She’s 81, so I’m worried that she might have fallen or suffered a medical emergency.” “I’d like to request an immediate welfare check on my friend Josh Adams. He lives in apartment 17B in the Meadow Springs apartment complex on 700 Main Street. He just posted a suicide note on social media, and I’m afraid that he might take his own life.”"

The police stop by and find that she’s fallen and injured herself. In this case, they’d call for medical assistance before calling you back."

[5] X Research source You can request a welfare check for a friend or loved one who’s experiencing any type of life-threatening mental health crisis. When making the call, ask if a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) is available to help the person in need—CIT officers are best equipped to handle these types of situations.
