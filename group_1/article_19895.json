      "content": "Pour acetone or nail polish remover onto a cloth. Choose a terrycloth or microfiber towel so that you don’t scratch the clear coat or paint on your car.

      "content": "Knead the clay. You only need a small, flat section the size of your palm, so if you bought a new bar you should cut it in half. Then, seal it in a Ziploc bag and place it in a bucket or bowl of warm water, which will warm up the clay so you can manipulate it more easily. Take the half of the bar and knead it in your hands. You want to form a pancake or patty with the clay. [3] X Research source"
