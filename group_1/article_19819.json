      "content": "Hang out at clothing stores in touristy areas. If you are an aspiring model, spend a lot of time in places where scouts from modeling agencies tend to be searching for new talent. In big cities, there will almost always be scouts looking for new signings at clothing stores in prime, high-traffic areas. These locations are frequented by lots of fashionable, attractive young people. Go shopping – even just window-shopping – whenever you can, especially in big cities. In London you can go to stores like Top Shop in Oxford Circus. In New York City, try H & M in Herald Square or Zara in Bryant Park. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Attend concerts and festivals. Concerts by musicians popular with teenagers, such as Ariana Grande, and music festivals like Coachella, are also places where lots of young and good-looking people tend to congregate. Model scouts flock there as well to find new talent. These are great spots to be scouted if you’re an aspiring model, so go to these events whenever you can. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Go out in public as much as possible. To attract the attention of a model scout out in the real world, you’ll have to leave your home and be seen in public places as often as you can. You never know where a scout might be looking, so be prepared to be discovered anywhere. Some top models were discovered in random locations, such as airports and supermarkets, or even just walking on the street. [3] X Research source One scout for a top agency reveals that he actively searches at McDonald’s in tourist locations in big cities to try to find foreigners or small-town beauties, so don’t rule out being discovered at a fast food restaurant!

      "title": "Wear simple clothes whenever you go out.",
      "content": "Wear simple clothes whenever you go out. If you’re trying to be scouted, don't let your outfit be a distraction. Scouts want to be able to see what your body and proportions look like. Wearing overly elaborate clothing can hide your shape and make it harder to imagine what you’d look like in different styles. Stick to simple, flattering basics like a plain T-shirt and jeans. [5] X Research source Summer is a better time than winter to be scouted in places with seasonally variable climates, since bulky winter clothing makes it harder to discern potential models’ shapes.

      "content": "Keep your hair and make-up minimalist. Scouts are searching for natural beauties, so don’t hide your bone structure and features under too much make-up or distractingly elaborate hairstyles. Go for a clean, fresh-faced look with little to no make-up and don’t worry about perfection. [7] X Research source Sometimes features that you might think detract from your appearance, such as a slightly crooked tooth, are exactly what will set you apart in a scout’s eyes.

      "content": "Always check a scout’s credentials. If you get approached by a scout, perform your due diligence to make sure they’re legitimate and not a fraud. Get the scout’s information. Go home and look up the agency they claim to be from online to make sure it’s the real deal. Phony scouts try to get aspiring models to come to their studios and take pictures, for which they’ll charge astronomical amounts of money. A real agent will never ask you for any money."

      "content": "Make your Instagram profile public. Today in the digital age, modeling agencies are increasingly turning to Instagram to scout new talent. Set your Instagram account to public, not private. This way your profile can be seen by everybody, not just your confirmed followers. The default Instagram account setting is public, so if you’ve just created your account there’s no need to do anything. If you already have an account set to private, go to your profile page. Select the ‘settings’ icon (the gear symbol in the top right hand corner). Under Options turn off your Private account setting. Social media is a great place to get scouted.

      "content": "Keep your Instagram account professional. If you’re an aspiring model with a public profile, you want potential employers to view it. Don't put anything inappropriate on your account that you wouldn’t want a future boss to see. Include relevant personal information in your account’s biography section, including the city you live in and your email address, so that modeling agencies will be able to contact you.[Image:Get Scouted for Modeling Step 8.jpg|center]] Avoid posting your exact address online in a public profile, however, for safety reasons."

      "content": "Post lots of different kinds of pictures on your profile. Show your face and body from many angles and in lots of poses to highlight how versatile you are as a model. Post pictures from many environments and settings. Your photographs should also capture your everyday life and activities, to give a sense of who you are and what you look like in natural settings. Take pictures at parties, work, or school. Don’t post heavily edited or retouched pictures, or add multiple filters, because then your natural beauty is obscured. Selfies can be useful for showcasing certain unique facial features and bone structures, but make sure they aren’t the only kind of picture you’re posting and keep them appropriate. For instance, bathroom selfies probably won’t help build your Instagram modeling profile."

To be a successful model, you have to be more than pretty and unique-looking. Be personable, engaging, easy to work with, and interesting.

      "content": "Use hashtags to get noticed by brands and agencies. Put a hashtag, or pound (#) symbol, in front of a word or phrase in your photo caption so that your picture comes up in any search for that hashtag. Caption your photographs with existing popular hashtags so that model scouts searching through these hashtags will see them. Use phrases like #scoutme or #getscouted. Include multiple hashtags in the caption of any photograph. Tag modeling agencies directly to try to get their attention. For instance, Elite Model Management uses the hashtag #MakeMeElite, while Wilhelmina Models, another leading agency, uses #WillyScouts. Search on agencies’ Instagram accounts for the hashtags that they use."

If they like your aesthetic, they might use your picture on their Instagram page. This will increase your exposure and your modeling experience. After you've chosen the picture you want to post and added any filters, you'll be taken to the Share screen. Choose the Tag people option. Tap on the picture and start entering the username till it appears in a dropdown menu. Then you can select it. The account you've tagged will be notified and see your picture."

A modeling agency that has noticed your account and likes your look might try to arrange a casual meeting with you by sending you a Direct Message (DM) on Instagram. This is known as ‘sliding into your DMs.’ Check your DMs regularly. If you get contacted, verify that the person reaching out to you is from a legitimate agency. [13] X Research source You can access your DMs on Instagram by hitting the icon that looks like a paper plane in the top right hand corner of your phone screen.

Some agencies mention specifically in their Instagram bios that they want aspiring models to message them directly. Open your DMs and tap the + icon in the top right hand corner to compose a new message. Write a quick, professional message introducing yourself. Include two small sized images that are representative of your look."
