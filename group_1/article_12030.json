      "content": "He’s experiencing sexual problems. Most people’s minds jump straight to an affair as the root of sexual distance, but there are a variety of causes for this. Some may be personal to your husband while some may be due to marriage stress or external factors like stress. Some of the most common reasons are: [1] X Research source He has a naturally low sex drive, low testosterone levels, or may be on the asexual spectrum. He’s anxious or embarrassed by a sexual disorder or erectile dysfunction. He feels rejected by you or doesn’t receive enough physical affection in the marriage.

This is more likely if you’re both frequently upset, angry, or frustrated with each other. The relationship problems can be one-sided or involve both of you equally. [2] X Research source A big issue is often a lack of communication. One or both of you might not be communicating your wants and needs to fix problems. There’s a general lack of respect or courteousness in the relationship. You might feel insecure or jealous or have unresolved trauma over past experiences of being not wanted by a partner. He may be stressed over work, anxious or depressed, or have avoidant attachment issues."

      "content": "Physical and mental health challenges are affecting his feelings. Feelings like grief, depression, or stress can leave your husband feeling drained and without any extra energy to put into your marriage. Physical issues like pain or illness can also lower his sex drive, which makes him self-conscious or more anxious than before. Some common mental and physical health causes for marital distance can be: [3] X Research source Depression and anxiety Body image issues Mental or physical exhaustion Attachment issues or a fear of intimacy (emotional or physical) Chronic pain or mobility issues, particularly in older men"

Stress can damage his physical and mental health, but also affect his ability to give you support and affection when you need it. He may not even notice you’re hurting if he’s psychologically incapacitated. Daily stressors, like traffic, don’t generally contribute to stressed neglect, but chronic conditions like being overworked can exhaust his mental and emotional resources.

Some events, like infidelity, can be traced to one partner, while others, like severe illness or the loss of a child, are tragedies outside your control. Situations that can drive a wedge between you and your husband could be: [5] X Research source Previous infidelity, affairs, or lies that lost his trust [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Financial trouble like your home being foreclosed on a sudden loss of income One of you is or used to be very ill and needed constant support A death of a family member or close friend Interference from his parents or family, like in-laws not liking you or expecting him to spend all his time with them A natural disaster like a hurricane or fire destroyed your home or cost you a lot of money"

      "content": "He has an addiction. Your husband might be struggling with alcohol or drug abuse, gambling, or be “married” to something else like a hobby or gaming. Addiction can reduce the quality time you spend together and make you both feel emotionally isolated (especially substance abuse). It can also lead to frequent arguing, money problems, domestic violence, or forcing you to enable or cover up his problem. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "He’s having a physical or emotional affair.",
      "content": "He’s having a physical or emotional affair. Anger or resentment, differences in sexual appetite, or a lack of emotional intimacy may cause him to be unfaithful. Once this happens, his interest in you or your marriage is likely to drop off. Affairs often begin as meaningless and friendly interactions with someone else and then grow into sexual or physical intimacy. [8] X Research source An emotional affair usually involves a third party that secretly knows the inner workings of your marriage while you’re unaware that they know. Infidelity is one of the top reasons that marriages end because it’s so hard to rebuild trust afterward."

      "title": "Try not to blame yourself or feel guilty.",
      "content": "Try not to blame yourself or feel guilty. It’s hard to admit his feelings and actions are out of your control—that’s why people put blame on themselves when they feel unwanted. Consider what your husband could do to make you feel wanted. Remember that your feelings are legitimate and deserve to be heard—it’s only when you bring up the problem that you’ll find out whether he cares enough to change or not. [9] X Research source Remember, some signs of not wanting you are toxic attempts to control you. Remove yourself from the house if you feel your safety or wellbeing is at risk. If the root of your husband’s distance is abusive or manipulative, seek individual or couples counseling rather than trying to mend the relationship on your own."

Let him have some space if he ignores you or avoids your requests to talk, but make it clear that you need things to change. Think through what’s not working and be sure about the resolutions you’d like to see so you can present them to your husband clearly—he’s more likely to listen if you have a clear idea of what you want the marriage to be like. [10] X Research source Acknowledge the issues you’re bringing to the marriage, too. It shows self-awareness and a commitment to change that may inspire him to open up. Take the high road and avoid harsh criticism, pettiness, ignoring him back, or demanding things from him. Try not to descend to his level. Tell him you’ll plan an intervention with friends or family if he's unwilling to talk. Make it clear that this can’t go on without giving ultimatums."

Choose a quiet time somewhere you’re both comfortable, like your living room or a private backyard space. Talk about the marriage as equal partners without laying blame. [11] X Research source Tell him your feelings clearly with a kind and respectful tone. One or both of you may feel intimidated talking about your issues so intimately. Use “I” statements to express yourself without criticizing him, which might shut him down. Try things like “I miss you” or “I feel like we’ve been drifting apart.” Ask for his perspective and thoughts and make it clear you’re listening—understanding his side of things is crucial for moving forward together."

      "content": "Think over his suggestions for changes he’d like to see. Take in what your husband says and mull it over before automatically disagreeing. Even if you interpret the issue(s) differently, hear him out to be empathetic and show him you think his feelings are valid. Think about what you’re willing to compromise on to make things work. [12] X Research source Let him have space if it’s one of his core needs. If your husband doesn’t get time to unwind and recharge, he may be more tempted to shut you out."

If he’s stressed about work or experiencing anxiety or depression, encourage him to explore treatment like therapy or counseling to help him cope and navigate treatment options. If a major project or work issue is involved, acknowledge that he might not be able to give you 100% of his attention until the situation is over.

Shake up your sex life by getting intimate in different parts of the house or experimenting with role playing and toys. [16] X Research source Schedule adventurous and exciting new activities together, like zip lining or a road trip.

      "content": "Maybe your husband stopped making an effort in your marriage. Perhaps your marriage feels one-sided, like you have to put in all the work and energy. Maybe you’ve noticed your husband just isn’t putting in the same effort he used to, or he doesn’t reach out to you when you’re not home anymore. Here are some of the most common signs of being unwanted (subtle and not so subtle): [17] X Research source Your husband’s not happy with you or your marriage, no matter how hard you try. He doesn’t make much effort to reach out to you or ask about your life. He forgets special dates or anniversaries. He doesn’t engage with you or seem to respect your opinions, thoughts, or point of view. He’s not physically affectionate. This includes a lack of sex and things like not wanting to hug, kiss, or cuddle. Your husband has stopped making plans with you and makes a point to be out of the house or with friends. He treats other people better than you and points out your flaws or puts you down (privately or in public). He’s generally more selfish and irritable than he used to be. You feel like you’re living with a roommate rather than a partner or spouse who respects you. He blames you for the quality of your marriage and might try to turn your kids, friends, or even family members against you."

      "content": "He might be sexually withdrawing from you. This could be a total lack of sex or something more subtle, like less intimate or less frequent sex. Most people’s mind will jump straight to an affair, but there are a variety of causes for this. Some may be personal to your husband while some may be due to marriage stress. [19] X Research source Remember that your husband’s ebbing interest may not have anything to do with you. Don't let it lower your self-esteem while you navigate the issue."

      "title": "Your emotional connection as a couple seems weaker or damaged.",
      "content": "Your emotional connection as a couple seems weaker or damaged. Strong marriages need a balance between closeness and distance, but sometimes relationships fall out of balance when one partner checks out. This leads to emotional distance—maybe your husband stops talking about your future together, becomes secretive, or shows limited affection. In these cases, he may be emotionally neglecting you (on purpose or unintentionally). [20] X Research source Emotional distance can happen when one partner is avoidant and prefers to isolate when problems arise rather than face them directly."

      "title": "He may not be spending quality time with you.",
      "content": "He may not be spending quality time with you. Quality time is the collection of moments you spend together that hold a lot of meaning or value. The exact amount of time each couple needs is different, but not getting enough of it is a major problem for any marriage. Quality time is what builds memories, strengthens connections, builds trust, and helps relationships last. [21] X Research source When your husband pulls away from quality time, it may mean he isn’t prioritizing your marriage or has external stressors affecting his life balance."

      "title": "He might not want to be in the relationship anymore.",
      "content": "He might not want to be in the relationship anymore. If this is the version of “not wanting” you’re experiencing, the signs are probably apparent and shouldn’t be ignored. Maybe he’s avoiding you entirely and rejecting all affection, or always busy and completely unwilling to put time or effort into repairing your marriage. In these cases, it takes serious work, conversation, or counseling to fix the issue. [22] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Spend more time together doing things you both enjoy.",
      "content": "Spend more time together doing things you both enjoy. Make an effort to have more quality time together—maybe there’s a new hobby both of you are interested in picking up, like woodworking or making your own sushi. Sign up for a class to learn something new with one another. You’ll get to see a different side of each other since you’ll both be excited and a little vulnerable while you try something new. [23] X Research source If you have a special talent, like playing an instrument or cooking something special, pull it out during quality time to wow your husband. Plan a weekend getaway together if a lack of time together is part of your problem. Leave the kids at home and try not to be on your phones too much."

      "title": "Share fond memories of your relationship often.",
      "content": "Share fond memories of your relationship often. Walk down memory lane and talk about your favorite or most meaningful moments together. The nostalgia and reminder of a time when your relationship seemed easier will make both of you feel more passionate, excited, and aroused by each other. This is a great way to get the “spark” back and let your emotions flow more freely. [24] X Research source For an extra sentimental experience, recreate your first date. Put on similar outfits and go to your first meeting spot if it’s nearby or still around."

      "content": "Keep your channels of communication open. Communicate clearly and often—be honest about what you’re feeling (the good and the bad), but keep it kind and respectful. Talk about more than just day to day things like bills and the kids’ schedules and include your thoughts, opinions, and feelings. Make sure you’re being a good listener, too, and taking the time to really understand what your partner is saying and what they need. [25] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Share your internal world—the fears and opinions you have about things in your life, work, a friend or family issue, or something intellectual. Try scheduling time to talk specifically about your feelings and relationship if it doesn’t come naturally to you and your husband. Regularly talking with your spouse is one of the best ways to keep your marriage healthy and happy."

      "content": "Notice when unhelpful, non-constructive patterns arise. Pay attention to cyclical arguments or frustrations in your marriage and address these cycles quickly. First, think to yourself about what triggers your responses and how you feel leading up to and during arguments. Then, ask to calmly talk to each other about what you’ve noticed and develop a game plan for how to prevent or deal with it in the future. Make sure to hear out your husband’s side of things and consider compromising if needed. [26] X Research source Handle your conversations about these unhelpful patterns with humor and respect for your partner. Some patterns could include trying to help or change him when he doesn’t want it, or wanting him to open up more but he resists you (a push-pull pattern)."

      "content": "If you’ve explored every solution, it may be time to end the marriage . Prioritize yourself and leave the relationship when your attempts to fix the issue don’t result in meaningful change or improvement. Rather than waiting and wishing for him to change if he doesn’t want you, take matters into your own hands to make yourself happy. Consider if there are absolute deal breakers in your marriage at the root of your issues, like one spouse wanting a child while the other one doesn’t. Stand up for your personal values. If you can’t tolerate a husband who was unfaithful, then it’s probably the right decision to leave if he cheats. Remember, you deserve to feel wanted and have your needs met by your partner or spouse.
