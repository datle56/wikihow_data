Tame flyaways and frizz with smoothing cream, hair oil, or a hair serum. This will help keep the hairs from shifting when you cut them. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Separate your bangs from the rest of your hair, if needed. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create two angled side parts. Have them span from the arch of one eyebrow to the arch of the other, and meet in a V about 2 inches (5.1 cm) behind your hairline.
