      "title": "Include basic and physical information relevant to acting.",
      "content": "Include basic and physical information relevant to acting. Unlike most other careers, casting directors need to know your physical appearance and size so they can cast you in appropriate roles. At the top of your resume, list your name and contact information (including phone number, email address, mailing address, etc.). Beneath this, specify your height, weight, ethnicity, hair color, eye color, and the age range you can portray. [1] X Research source An acting resume is similar to other types of professional resumes: it should open with your name, acting union affiliation (if applicable), and contact information. Unless you are under 18 years old, don’t specify your exact age, just the age range you can play. [2] X Research source Note that while it’s important to have a physical copy of your acting resume and portfolio, many actors post their portfolios online so they’re easily accessible."

    {
      "title": "Highlight your acting credits.",
      "content": "Highlight your acting credits. Create a section titled “Credits” or something similar for this information. If you have theater, TV, or film credentials, be sure to list them on your resume. If you have a lot of credits, tailor your resume toward the specific role you’re planning to audition for and highlight previous roles that are similar to this one. [3] X Research source For example, if you’re auditioning for a comedic role and have acted in comedy before, these roles should be at the top of your “Credits” section. If you don’t have much, or any, acting experience, try out for student films and independent films. This is a great way to gain experience and build relationships in your field."

    {
      "title": "Create an Education section to highlight your training.",
      "content": "Create an Education section to highlight your training. Including your acting-related training and education in your resume will show that you understand the craft, even if you don’t yet have professional experience. For example, if you attended a well-known acting school, studied with a famous acting coach (or actor), or majored in acting, theater, or drama, list this experience under the “Education” section. [4] X Research source If you’ve been professionally trained as an actor outside of an academic setting, use your resume to highlight the training you received and its duration."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on relevant previous experience.",
      "content": "Focus on relevant previous experience. Present this information in a “Work Experience” section. Instead of filling your resume with every role you’ve ever played, tailor your presentation of work experience to the role you’re auditioning for. Include professional work you’ve done after high school and college. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re auditioning for a role in an action movie, use your resume to highlight other action-oriented roles you’ve played in the past rather than focusing on comedic or romantic roles. Think of an acting resume like any other resume; don’t bog it down with irrelevant details."

      "title": "List additional skills and awards to make your portfolio stand out.",
      "content": "List additional skills and awards to make your portfolio stand out. Depending on the role you’re auditioning for, skills like singing or dancing may give you an edge over your competition. Listing any recognitions and/or awards you’ve received related to acting can also impress casting directors. Create both a “Skills” and “Awards” section as needed to reflect your experience. [6] X Research source For example, if you’re trying out for an action-based role, it may be relevant to list any martial arts experience you have. Or, if the character is bilingual, make sure to include the languages you speak."

      "content": "Link out to your social media or IMDb page, if relevant. While it isn’t necessary to include links to your social media, doing so can sometimes be another outlet to show any special skills as well as your ability to gain a following. If you have enough acting credits to have an IMDb page, link out to this as well so casting directors can see your work that may not be listed in your resume. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Include a cover letter when giving your portfolio to casting directors. These days, most acting portfolios also serve as an actor’s website, but it’s still a good idea to have a physical copy to hand to casting directors at auditions, and having a good cover letter can make your portfolio stand out. Address your cover letter to the casting director and briefly explain why you’re interested in the role and why you’re qualified. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Reach out to a professional headshot photographer.",
      "content": "Reach out to a professional headshot photographer. Headshots, as the name suggests, are photographs that only show your face and neck, and they’re a crucial part of an acting portfolio. Therefore, it’s important to choose a photographer who has experience working with actors. Search online or reach out to other friends in acting to find a local photographer who can take high-quality headshots for your portfolio. [9] X Research source Never try to take your own headshots. Even if the photographs look acceptable to you, a casting director or audition manager will be able to tell that they are not professional-grade material. Headshot photographer Martin Bentsen says having a professional background and lighting are key to taking a great headshot: “A professional backdrop [is going to be] either completely blurred out of a flat color. If you have a friend who’s taking a picture or you’re doing it unprofessionally, the image isn’t really going to stand out that much, [and] it’s going to look like you didn’t pay much money for it. On top of that, the background and lighting could be distracting, as the casting director [would be] thinking about the background instead of your expression.” [10] X Expert Source Martin Bentsen Acting Coach & Headshot Photographer Expert Interview. 8 May 2020."

      "title": "Vary your facial expressions in your headshots.",
      "content": "Vary your facial expressions in your headshots. Take advantage of your time with the photographer to take photos that showcase a range of styles and emotions. It would be redundant to present headshots with identical expressions. For example, in one headshot, go for a more “edgy” look, and in a second, opt for a broad, welcoming smile. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Include headshots that are tailored to your role.",
      "content": "Include headshots that are tailored to your role. Your headshots help land you auditions by appealing to casting directors, so make sure the photos you choose suit the type of role you’re auditioning for. Headshots often convey the “type” of actor you are and the type of characters you’re capable of portraying. [12] X Research source For example, don’t submit a headshot in which you look edgy and rebellious if you’re auditioning for a lovable, kind character."

      "content": "Tailor your headshots to the type of acting you do. Headshot demands can differ based on the type of acting work you’re auditioning for in addition to the specific role. If you’re planning to audition for television shows or for commercials , you’ll need a “commercial” headshot, in which you are smiling. If you want to audition for theater or films, plan to submit a more serious headshot in your acting portfolio. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick at least 2 headshots you like best to include in your portfolio. You’ll have many options to choose from following your headshot photoshoot. In general, a good acting portfolio will include 2 or 3 headshots, so choose a couple of photos that look good and that you’d be proud to hand to an audition manager. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Take some mid- and full-body shots, as well.",
      "content": "Take some mid- and full-body shots, as well. While headshots are generally the most important photos to include in your acting portfolio, other photos can also be beneficial. For example, mid-shots capture you from the waist up and can help show body language. Full-body shots, as the name suggests, show your entire body, including your build, overall look, and physical details that may be important for specific roles. [15] X Research source In general, when taking photos for your acting portfolio, it’s best to wear simple clothing that doesn’t distract from your natural appearance. Focus on conveying emotion and character with your eyes and expression rather than relying on clothing. [16] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep your headshots up-to-date.",
      "content": "Keep your headshots up-to-date. In general, it’s best to update your headshots every 6 months or whenever you change your appearance. For example, if you have long brown hair in your headshots and show up to an audition with a buzzcut, the director may not be pleased. Updating your photos regularly helps ensure there are no unwanted surprises. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Contact a professional reel producer.",
      "content": "Contact a professional reel producer. A demo reel (or showreel) is a short video compilation that showcases your best work. It should give casting directors an idea of your acting ability and versatility. A professional demo reel editor will be able to take the various sequences of footage you provide and edit the scenes together into an effective compilation. [18] X Research source Be prepared to pay for this service. Demo reel editors usually charge from $60 to $75 an hour. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Select footage from your highest-profile acting work.",
      "content": "Select footage from your highest-profile acting work. Demo reels typically contain footage shot in a theater or clips from a film or television performance. However, if you’re an inexperienced actor with no significant acting performances, it’s acceptable to make a demo reel using independent films, student films, or online media. [20] X Research source If necessary, film yourself acting to make your own demo reel. Make sure to stand in front of a blank background and shoot close in. Only your chest, arms, and face should be visible in the footage. Reels help demonstrate that you remain calm and collected when in front of a camera. Actor Ben Whitehair says creating your own demo reel is beneficial if you don’t have official acting credits: “Even if you don’t have any experience [the casting director] can still watch [your] self-tape audition” to see if you’re a good actor. “It will increase your odds of getting the audition. Everybody starts with zero credits on their resume.” [21] X Expert Source Ben Whitehair Social Media Expert Expert Interview. 3 June 2021."

      "title": "Include 60-90 seconds of your best work.",
      "content": "Include 60-90 seconds of your best work. Select 3 or 4 scenes that are relatively similar to the role you’re auditioning for. This will show the audition manager you’re capable of performing the type of role that the script calls for. Don’t make the demo reel much longer than 90 seconds. [22] X Research source Even as little as 60 seconds will give the casting director enough material to make a decision."

    {
      "title": "Update your demo reel as you gain experience.",
      "content": "Update your demo reel as you gain experience. Because your demo reel should include your best and highest-profile work, it’s important to update it as you continue to book roles. Like your headshots, aim to update your demo reel every 6 months or whenever you do a performance you’re particularly proud of. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "What’s the difference between an acting portfolio and a resume? An acting resume is a single document (usually one page) that focuses on your accomplishments. [24] X Research source An acting portfolio includes a resume as well as professional photos and acting clips so casting directors can get a fuller idea of what you can do as an actor."

      "content": "Is an acting portfolio the same as an actor’s website? Today, acting portfolios are mainly digital and are typically synonymous with an actor’s website, as the websites often include the same information as a portfolio. Still, it’s important to have physical aspects of a portfolio, like headshots and a resume, to leave with casting directors at auditions. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "How do I make a portfolio with no experience? Lead with professional headshots to make an impression, and try to bulk up your education and training by taking acting classes and seminars and auditioning for local or student productions. Take up hobbies that could benefit your portfolio, like learning a new language or taking a dance class. Use audition clips for your demo reel, and ask for letters of recommendation from acting professors , coaches, or other professionals to boost your hireability. [26] X Research source Acting expert Tara Blau Smollen says, “Working in a community theater is an amazing experience, especially for young performers.” If you don’t yet have a resume, she recommends going to auditions and talking to other performers to network and learn about auditions.

Including a personal statement or bio in your acting portfolio allows you to convey your passion for acting and showcase your personality.
