      "content": "Pick the right moment. Make sure that you choose a very good and appropriate moment to first approach her. If you pick the right moment, you’ll be able to present yourself in the best light possible. Remember, first impressions are everything. Consider the following: Avoid moments when she is busy or distracted. Avoid inappropriate moments like during a lecture or exam. Try to take advantage of a moment when you’ve naturally come into contact with her, like when both checking out in the lunch line, or in the library."

      "content": "Start off by introducing yourself, if you don’t already know her. Introductions are important, so don’t botch this up. Make sure your introduction is memorable and smooth. Put a little forethought into it. Consider: Quickly telling her something interesting about yourself, so that you’re more memorable. Asking her simple facts about herself, if you don’t already know. Don’t keep her too long, if either of you are in the middle of going somewhere. Comment about your surroundings. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not boast.",
      "content": "Do not boast. Boasting can be a really big conversation disaster. While it’s both a good thing and very tempting to try to talk yourself up when you initially meet her, this could be dangerous. You don’t want to come across as a braggart, as arrogant, or as overly confident. However, you do want to show yourself in the best light possible."

      "title": "Be a challenge.",
      "content": "Be a challenge. Avoid sending her the message that you’ll do anything to be with her and you’re essentially a pushover. Try to find the middle ground where she knows you want to be with her, but she knows she’s got to work a little bit too if she wants to be with you. There is no real formula for this, and you’ve got to feel it out as you get to know her. Don’t play petty games like “if she doesn’t call me, I won’t call her.” Avoid making your schedule completely open to her. After all, you’ve got your own friends and family, and they are important, too. Give her time. Don’t return calls immediately (unless appropriate) and don’t expect phone calls back right away. Relax, and let things develop over time."

Remember, if she likes you and wants to be close to you, she’ll probably do something to send you signals or to reciprocate your interest and feelings. Don’t call her every day. Don’t ask her out every weekend, unless she suggests that she wants to go out, too. Don’t invite yourself to events where she’ll be, and try to work yourself into her social activities."

      "content": "Act naturally. Above and beyond all else, act naturally and be true to yourself. You don’t want to make yourself into someone completely different just to get close to the girl that interests you. You want someone who will like – and maybe love – you for who you are. If who you are makes it so she doesn’t want to be close to you, that’s okay. Maintain the friendship, but move on and find another romantic interest. Everything will work out for you in the end.
