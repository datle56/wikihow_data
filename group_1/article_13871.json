      "title": "Go for a jab to your opponent’s face to distract them.",
      "content": "Go for a jab to your opponent’s face to distract them. Stand within arm’s length of your opponent and with your feet close to shoulder-width apart. Reach out with your nondominant arm to jab your opponent in the face or head. You can either let the jab connect or you can fake it and throw them off more. Either way, your opponent will react to block the blow, which will distract them from the takedown you’re about to perform. [1] X Research source You can also go for your opponent’s legs if they try to jab at you. Duck out of the way if they try to throw a jab before you can. Only practice takedowns on opponents that have a similar experience level as you so you don’t hurt yourself or anyone else."

      "title": "Wrap your arms around the knee of your opponent’s leg that’s closest to you.",
      "content": "Wrap your arms around the knee of your opponent’s leg that’s closest to you. As your opponent is blocking your jab, quickly bend your knees to step toward them and drive your forehead into their chest. Keep your back and head straight while you go for the leg that’s closest to you. Hold your elbows as close to your side as you can so you have the most power and stability. Wrap your arms around their leg so you’re holding their knee or thigh tightly against your chest. Keep your head facing their chest rather than looking down since it could make you vulnerable to other blows. [2] X Research source You can lock your arms if you want to, but you don’t need to if you already have a tight grip. The goal of this hold is to make it difficult for your opponent to move the leg you’re holding onto."

      "title": "Lift your opponent’s leg and squeeze it between your thighs.",
      "content": "Lift your opponent’s leg and squeeze it between your thighs. Once you have a firm grip on your opponent’s leg, pull their knee up so their leg is lifted up off of the ground. [3] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview. 26 January 2021. Squeeze your thighs together so you’re holding their calf tightly between them. In this position, it will be difficult for your opponent to break out of the hold since they won’t be able to use the leg you’re holding onto. [4] X Research source Perform all of the actions for your takedown quickly after one another so you can get your opponent to the ground as fast as you can."

      "title": "Push your body down to force your opponent to bend their knee.",
      "content": "Push your body down to force your opponent to bend their knee. While you have a firm grip on your opponent’s leg, bend your knees quickly and pull their leg down with you. Use as much power as you can when you smash down so your opponent is shocked and won’t be able to fight back as well. Your opponent will be forced to bend their other leg so they’re off balance. [5] X Research source Your opponent will try to fight against you while you’re holding onto them. Do your best to stay focused and maintain your grip so you can finish the takedown."

      "title": "Turn your body by 90 degrees to force your opponent down.",
      "content": "Turn your body by 90 degrees to force your opponent down. Sidestep toward your opponent’s free leg to cause them to shift their center of gravity. As your opponent loses their balance, they will fall onto their back or side. Maintain your grip on them throughout the takedown so they aren’t able to escape or get up immediately after you bring them down. You can also try putting your leg behind your opponent’s leg and push them so they trip and fall down. Make sure you have a padded floor in the area where you’re practicing so you don’t severely hurt anyone when you perform a takedown."

      "title": "Step to the right so your opponent steps to your left.",
      "content": "Step to the right so your opponent steps to your left. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Take a small step to the right with your right to shift your weight. Your opponent will try to circle around you and take a step toward your left side and apply their body weight on their right foot. [6] X Research source You can also perform a low takedown by stepping to the left if you want. Choose whichever direction you feel more comfortable with or you’re able to do."

      "title": "Sweep your left arm behind your opponent’s right heel.",
      "content": "Sweep your left arm behind your opponent’s right heel. Bend your right knee so it’s close to the ground and lunge forward with your left hand to reach around your opponent’s leg. Drop your hand on the floor 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) behind your opponent’s heel since they will step back once you make your move. Once their heel hits your hand, grab it with your hand using a tight grip. The lunge forward is known as the “penetration step” and gets you next to your opponent quickly. When you lunge for your opponent’s leg, move your body to the left to avoid any blows your opponent may try to land while you’re grabbing them."

      "title": "Pull your opponent’s leg up so it’s parallel to the ground.",
      "content": "Pull your opponent’s leg up so it’s parallel to the ground. Once you have a firm grip on your opponent’s heel, straighten your knees until they’re slightly bent and pull their leg up toward your chest. As you get their leg up, wrap your right arm around their ankle so you can get a better grip. Your opponent will be off balance and won’t be able to use their raised leg to defend themselves. [7] X Research source Stand up quickly after you sweep your opponent’s heel or else they may be able to break free."

      "content": "Grab the inside of your opponent’s thigh with your left hand. As your right arm is looped around your opponent’s leg, place your left hand on their upper thigh to brace your grip. Your opponent may try to fight back while you’re grabbing them, but you will be able to take them down as long as you move quickly. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Push your opponent’s thigh to finish the takedown. Turn your body toward your opponent’s right side and push on their thigh to make them lose their balance. The force of you turning and pushing their leg will force their back to the ground so you can finish your takedown. Maintain your grip as they hit the floor so they can’t get up right away. [9] X Research source If you brought your opponent’s leg up toward your shoulder, then use one of your feet to trip them to force them down."
