If all the standard troubleshooting steps don't fix the stick drift problem, you will need to take the controller apart and attempt a physical repair. This will void your warranty. If your controller is less than a year old, contact Microsoft and see if you qualify for a warranty exchange. [9] X Research source If you do qualify for a warranty exchange, ask for a controller that has the newer stick modules that last longer. If you are not comfortable attempting a physical repair, you can take it to an electronic repair shop and see if they can fix it for you."

A lot of times, the plastic piece comes loose and starts to rise. This could be what is causing the drift, so removing the grey plastic piece on the side of the module may fix the drift problem.

      "content": "Move the motherboard forward and prop it on the trigger buttons. It's the larger circuit board. Be careful not to touch any of the metal parts on the circuit board. Place your index finger on the top of the board and your thumb on the bottom. Wiggle it gently until you are able to remove the circuit board. Use the trigger buttons as a prop so that the circuit board rests tilting towards you."

      "title": "Turn the black piece on the side of the joystick module.",
      "content": "Turn the black piece on the side of the joystick module. Use a flathead screwdriver to turn the black piece on the left side of the joystick module you are having problems with. If the stick is drifting up, turn it counterclockwise. If it is drifting down, turn it clockwise. Give it two or three full turns. Then wiggle the stick inside the module and give the black piece a few more turns. Repeat a couple of times. While you have the controller disassembled, see if the insides need any cleaning. Use condensed air to clean out any dust or debris inside the controller."

    {
      "title": "Test the controller.",
      "content": "Test the controller. Go ahead and reassemble the controller. First, reattach the motherboard and put the controller back in the backplate. Put the rubber joysticks back on the modules and then place the faceplate back on. Don't reinsert the 5 screws on the back until you are sure the controller is working. Go ahead and test the controller. If it is not working, take it apart again and give the black piece on the side of the module a few more turns. Repeat until the controller is working. If you are not able to get the stick drift to stop, you may need to replace the joystick modules. You can purchase Xbox One controller parts online, but it is not recommended you try to replace the modules yourself unless you are skilled at soldering and desoldering . You may want to take it to a repair shop, or just get a new controller. [10] X Research source"
