Generally, the more active you are, the more calories you'll need to maintain your current weight. [1] to quickly assess your daily needs. The US government recommends between 1,600 to 3,200 calories per day for adults. On average, most adults need about 2,000 calories. Generally speaking, the recommended daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories a day for women and 2,500 for men. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Activity levels have a huge impact on the number of calories you can consume. For instance, if you sit for most of the day, you might only be able to eat 1,800 calories without gaining weight. If you're very active, you might need 2,200."
