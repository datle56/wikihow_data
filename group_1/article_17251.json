More detailed instructions on how to find the Qibla using a compass can be found here . Get yourself a Qibla compass. Find out the direction to Mecca from you location. Hold out your compass flat, wait for the dial to settle. Turn towards the direction to Makkah for your location. Done."

There are over a dozen different iPhone or iPad free apps (look like Athan Pro or Qibla) that will use the built-in GPS and compass to point in exactly the correct direction no matter where in the world you are. The internet has sites that will calculate the direction that is shortest distance to al Qiblah."
