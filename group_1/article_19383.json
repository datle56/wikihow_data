      "title": "Place some eggshells.",
      "content": "Place some eggshells. This is a very effective and inexpensive way to scare away geckos: they see eggshells and they think “predator.” Leave two eggshell halves around your home, such as at outdoor entryways, or in the kitchen. Do not crush the eggshells, leave them in two halves. One two-halves pair at every entrance should be enough: the geckos just need to run into it, then they'll run away from it. To keep the eggshells fresh, change them every 3 to 4 weeks."

      "title": "Set sticky traps.",
      "content": "Set sticky traps. Many of the insects that geckos eat are drawn to light, so, oftentimes, geckos will hang out in those areas. Placing some flypaper near light sources will not only catch geckos’ pesky food source, but will likely catch the geckos themselves. Catching animals in this method is often considered extremely inhumane, as the animal will slowly dehydrate to death. A good position to place the flypaper is on the inside of the light bulb’s shade/housing. You can also set glue boards or sticky cards near windows or other outdoor entryways. If you find a live gecko stuck in one of your sticky traps, you can unstick it and set it free by pouring vegetable oil over the trap while slowly peeling the animal from the glue. Be sure to gently pull up on the animal, and only where the oil has worked on the glue. The gecko can injure itself while struggling with the glue, which is why glue traps are not typically recommended."

      "content": "Make a coffee and tobacco ball. Using moist coffee grounds and some tobacco powder, form a small ball with your hands and stick it on the end of a toothpick. Put this near where the geckos are nesting or where they might easily find it, like an outdoor entryway. The geckos will consume some of this ball and die."

      "content": "Pepper-spray around your home. The irritation felt by humans when sprayed by pepper-spray is not unlike that felt by geckos that encounter it. Mix some pepper and water in a spray bottle and spray the solution around your home in places like under the refrigerator, behind the couch, or on the walls – basically, anywhere warm or anywhere you’ve seen a gecko. Cayenne pepper or chili powder can be used in place of pepper. Tabasco sauce can be used in place of the home-made pepper-spray. Warning: spraying too much may repel ‘’you’’ from your home, so be mindful of its irritating effect."

If you have a stubborn gecko that just refuses to be repelled from your home, you can try capturing him manually, as it were, by setting a box against a wall and “encouraging” the gecko to get inside. Then you can release it back into the wild – and set some more repellents to keep it out! [1] X Research source"

Maintain the general cleanliness of your home by keeping the floor swept and not leaving piles of stuff lying around, such as laundry, newspapers, boxes, etc. [2] X Research source Keep your furniture six inches from the walls and don’t hang up many pictures: geckos are nocturnal and like warm, dark places to hide out during the day. [3] X Research source Keep your thermostat turned down as low as you can handle: geckos like the warmth and humidity of your home when it gets cool at night. If you have any leaky faucets or pipes or any area that generally offers stagnant water in a humid environment – fix them and remove the water because geckos are drawn to those environments.

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to make your yard less welcoming: Remove any places where water can stagnate, such as birdbaths, as these are the breeding grounds for insects geckos prey upon and sources of hydration to geckos. [5] X Research source Water your yard sparingly, as lizards enjoy the moist environment and will drink the water for hydration. [6] X Research source Do not plant succulents: if a gecko cannot find any water for hydration, it will nibble on succulents to survive. [7] X Research source Trim back your bushes, especially those close to your house, because geckos love places to hide. [8] X Research source Placing some netting over your shrubs will keep geckos from using them as hideouts. [9] X Research source Use outdoor lighting sparingly, as it draws insects that geckos prey upon. If you must use outdoor lighting, consider sodium vapor or yellow lights. [10] X Research source"

So next time you peel a cucumber, don’t throw the peelings away but instead leave them lying around your kitchen counter or bathtub to keep roaches from venturing out into your home. If you find your cucumber peels are attracting ants, you can always use Borax: sprinkle somewhere there is high roach traffic and you should see their population drop in about a month. Contrary to popular belief, Borax is only mildly toxic to humans and pets."
