      "title": "Blot the area to absorb as much of the urine as possible.",
      "content": "Blot the area to absorb as much of the urine as possible. If you come upon fresh urine , use a thick towel to soak up as much of the urine as you can. Blot lightly so that you don't press the liquid deeply into the fabric. [1] X Research source It helps to fold the towel so you can continually refold it to use a dry side when one side gets damp. After you're done, the towel will probably stink, but that's a good thing. It means the thing you've blotted hasn't absorbed the smell—the towel has. After a good wash, the towel should be fine. But just to be safe, maybe don't use your favorite towel."

      "content": "Spray on a fabric odor eliminator for a quick fix. If you don't have time to fully treat the area, a fabric odor eliminator will cover up the smell in a pinch. Keep in mind, though, that these products don't actually solve your problem—they just freshen things up for a short time. You'll still need to go back and clean the area at some point if you truly want to completely eliminate the odor. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the spot with a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water.",
      "content": "Clean the spot with a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water. Put your mixture in a squirt bottle so you can easily spray it on the surface. The vinegar breaks down the uric acid in the urine and also cleans the stain. Leave the mixture to air dry. [3] X Research source Diluted vinegar is generally safe for fabrics, but if you're concerned, do a spot test in an inconspicuous area before you apply it to the urine stain. You can set a fan to blow on the spot if you want to try to speed up the drying process. Don't use a hairdryer, though—heat can make the odor worse."

      "title": "Sprinkle baking soda on the fabric to absorb the odor.",
      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda on the fabric to absorb the odor. If the spot is dry to the touch, wipe it down with a wet rag first so the baking soda will stick where you want. Use a soft fabric brush or a washcloth to lightly scrub the baking soda into the surface of the fabric. [4] X Research source Let the baking soda sit for 5-10 hours, then vacuum it up. It works best if it's uncovered, but you might need to move the furniture or cover the spot with a laundry hamper or something similar so no one messes with the spot."

      "title": "Spray the spot with an enzymatic cleaner if the smell lingers.",
      "content": "Spray the spot with an enzymatic cleaner if the smell lingers. Buy an enzymatic cleaner online or wherever cleaning supplies are sold. Follow the instructions on the product bottle to apply the cleaner. Typically, you'll simply saturate the surface with the cleaner, then rub it in with a towel or washcloth. [5] X Research source This is the least labor-intensive option, so if this is a regular occurrence, it's better to just invest in a bottle of cleaner and use it first instead of trying other methods."

      "title": "Wipe wood, tile, and other hard floors with a paper towel and basic floor cleaner.",
      "content": "Wipe wood, tile, and other hard floors with a paper towel and basic floor cleaner. If there's a puddle, use a paper towel to soak it up and get it off the floor. Use whatever floor cleaner you normally use to clean the spot after you've soaked up the puddle. [6] X Research source As long as you caught it pretty quickly and the liquid didn't soak into the floor, this should be all you need to do."

      "title": "Rub water and baking soda paste into unsealed hard surfaces.",
      "content": "Rub water and baking soda paste into unsealed hard surfaces. Pour a little baking soda into a bowl, then dribble water into the baking soda and stir it well. Keep adding water until you've formed a thick paste. Rub this paste into the surface with a sponge or cloth. [7] X Research source Wait until the paste has completely dried, then wipe it off with a clean, damp cloth. If there's still some remaining odor, repeat the process. You may want to put a box or other container upside down over the spot, especially if it's in a high-traffic area, to keep people from walking on it or pets from messing with it."

      "title": "Spray an enzyme-based cleaner on carpets or rugs.",
      "content": "Spray an enzyme-based cleaner on carpets or rugs. You can buy these cleaners online or wherever cleaning or pet products are sold. Pet urine is much stronger than human urine, so pet products will work just fine for human urine as well. [8] X Research source Follow the application instructions on the bottle. While specifics differ among brands, they usually tell you to simply saturate the area in the cleaner and let it dry—that's it! Some products tell you to rub the cleaner into the surface with a rag to produce a lather, then wipe the excess lather off. Enzymatic cleaners also work well to get rid of urine smells outside , particularly on man-made surfaces."

Let it sit for at least 30 minutes, then vacuum it up. [9] X Research source The baking soda will help pick up any lingering odor. In carpets or rugs, simply leaving a little baking soda in the fibers can keep the area fresh. Just rub it in well so that it's not immediately visible."

When you call the company, give them all the details about the problem, including how long the spot has been there and everything you've done so far to try to get rid of it. [10] X Research source You might also be able to rent a wet vacuum or carpet cleaner from your local discount or home improvement store. Don't run steam cleaners with hot water if you still have an odor—they'll lock in the odor and make it even more difficult to remove."

If you need to wash several items, compare the water temperatures—you'll want to wash them at the warmest temperature recommended that won't harm any of your items. [11] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Independent U.S. government agency focused on consumer protection Go to source If the item says \"dry clean only,\" don't take any chances—take it to your local dry cleaner as soon as possible for your best chance at removing the stain and odor.

[13] X Research source When the cycle's over, check to see if the smell's still there. If it is, run the items through the wash again. It'll be much harder to get the odor out if you let them dry."

If you're partial to a particular brand, chances are they also make an enzymatic version you can use to get rid of urine smell."

[17] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Even if it's not possible to hang your laundry outside, it's still better to air dry them inside than to put them in the dryer. Heat isn't great for urine and might cause the smell to come back even if you think it's gone."

Let it sit for about 15 minutes to disinfect your toilet and break down any urine that's spilled out. [18] X Research source You can also pour vinegar in the toilet bowl and follow up with a little baking soda. The mixture will instantly foam up and you can use the foam to scrub the inside of the bowl with your toilet brush.
