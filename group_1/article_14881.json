      "title": "Add cold creamer or milk to reduce the temperature immediately.",
      "content": "Add cold creamer or milk to reduce the temperature immediately. If you tend to drink your coffee black, try giving coffee creamer or milk a shot! Keep the creamer or milk in your fridge and add 1–3 teaspoons (4.9–14.8 mL) to your coffee based on your personal preference. Alternatively, add cream after ordering a cup at the local coffee shop. The cold milk or creamer will instantly lower the temperature of the coffee, which will minimize the odds that you burn yourself. Coffee creamer comes in a variety of flavors, so if you don’t like regular coffee creamer, you may have simply not found your preferred flavor. There are also non-dairy creamers that you can use if you’re lactose intolerant."

      "title": "Drop a single ice cube into your coffee if you don’t like creamers.",
      "content": "Drop a single ice cube into your coffee if you don’t like creamers. If you prefer to drink your coffee black, drop a single ice cube to the hot coffee to cool it off. The ice cube will melt in 30-60 seconds, and the small dose of cold water will lower the overall temperature of your coffee. Keep in mind, this will water your coffee down a little, although if won’t dramatically alter the flavor."

      "title": "Give freshly brewed coffee 3-5 minutes to cool before taking a sip.",
      "content": "Give freshly brewed coffee 3-5 minutes to cool before taking a sip. In terms of flavor and safety, the optimal temperature for a hot beverage is 136 °F (58 °C). However, most coffee makers heat the coffee to 160–180 °F (71–82 °C). When you pour yourself a cup of coffee at home, let it sit out on the counter for 3-5 minutes to let the temperature drop on its own. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you really want to get scientific with it, buy a glass thermometer and put it in your coffee after letting it cool. This will let you know if you if you’ve reached the optimal temperature for a perfect cup of coffee."

      "title": "Blow over the surface of the coffee for 8-10 seconds before taking each sip.",
      "content": "Blow over the surface of the coffee for 8-10 seconds before taking each sip. A lot of people blow on their coffee to cool it off when they first get it, but few people remember to do it before taking every sip while the coffee is still hot. Blowing on the surface of the coffee is actually quite effective at cooling it, but it only reduces the temperature at the surface. While the coffee is still steaming, blow on it for 8-10 seconds before taking a drink. Blow on the surface for a few seconds after each additional sip. [3] X Research source If your coffee is scalding hot, blowing on it isn’t going to dramatically cut the temperature down on its own. You’re better off letting it cool on its own for 3-5 minutes before doing this. If you can’t tell how hot the coffee is, always blow on it before slowly taking a small sip."

      "title": "Remove the to-go cup's lid to cool the coffee faster.",
      "content": "Remove the to-go cup's lid to cool the coffee faster. If you grab a drink at your local coffee shop, grab a seat and take the lid off. Removing the lid will dramatically decrease the temperature and let it cool. Wait 3-5 minutes for the coffee to stop steaming before putting the lid back on to head out or taking a sip from your beverage. [4] X Research source Do not do this if you’re driving or walking around. While it will still cool the coffee, you’re way more likely to spill and burn yourself with the lid off while you’re on the move."

      "title": "Stir your hot coffee with a metal spoon for 30-45 seconds to release some of the heat.",
      "content": "Stir your hot coffee with a metal spoon for 30-45 seconds to release some of the heat. Moving the coffee around in the cup will expose more of the liquid to the open air above it. The metal spoon will act as a conduit and absorb a lot of the heat in the heat in the coffee. Stir your drink with a metal spoon for 30-45 seconds to cool it off quickly. [5] X Research source Only do this if your cup or mug is resting on a table and it isn’t filled to the brim with coffee. The spoon has to be metal if you want to cool the coffee off dramatically."

      "title": "Use a cup sleeve to keep the mug or cup from burning you.",
      "content": "Use a cup sleeve to keep the mug or cup from burning you. If you’re at a coffee shop, ask for 2-3 of those cardboard sleeves that go over the cup. For your home coffee, pick up 2-3 fabric cup sleeves and slide them under your mug before pouring your coffee. This will keep you from burning your hands on the hot ceramic mug or paper cup. [6] X Research source There are lots of really cool cloth sleeves that you can buy online. They typically don’t cost more than a few dollars too!"

      "content": "Pour your coffee in an insulated travel mug with a sturdy lid to drink on the go. If you’re taking your coffee on the road, use an insulated travel mug with a heat-proof lining. If your coffee is really hot, the insulated lining will keep your mug from getting really hot and burning your hands when you pick it up. [7] X Research source If your mug doesn’t have a sturdy lid, you risk spilling the coffee and burning yourself. A high-quality insulated thermos will also work if you’re a huge fan of coffee and drink a large amount over a longer period of time. Never bring an open ceramic mug filled with coffee into your car. You’re extremely likely to spill if you do this."

      "content": "Switch to iced coffee instead of hot coffee to avoid hot spills or burns. If you’ve never given iced coffee its fair shake, you should. From delicious mocha coffee with tons of creamer to cold brew black coffee, there are just as many options and flavors available when compared to the hot stuff. If you tend to burn yourself by spilling in the car or when you’re a little groggy in the morning, consider swapping your hot coffee out for an iced version of the drink."

      "content": "Walk slowly with coffee and don’t carry too much stuff. When you’re taking a mug of coffee to your desk, front porch, or couch, be careful and walk slowly. Walk smoothly to avoid spilling the cup and burning yourself. If you’re on the run or at work, avoid carrying other items in your hands while you’re transporting your coffee. It may sound obvious, but a lot of people forget they’re carrying an extremely hot cup of coffee when they’re on the go. [8] X Research source Alternatively, you can keep your coffee in a thermos with a strap and hang the strap over your shoulder when you’re on the move. Make sure that the lid is on tight before doing this, though."
