      "content": "Learn which types of butterflies are native to the region in which you live. Knowing this will help you figure out which host plants to look for when seeking the caterpillars that emerge from the eggs that butterflies lay on the plant leaves. To learn more about the types of butterflies and caterpillars that reside in your area, either visit your state’s official website, go to a forestry and wildlife conservation website or office, or borrow some butterfly books from your local library. There are about 20,000 different species of butterflies in the world, and about 725 different species in North America. If you live in the U.S. it’s likely that there are about 100 butterfly species near you — even more if you live closer to Mexico."

You can look up images and descriptions of the plants online or in a book, or even download a mobile app. Here are some common host plants: [1] X Research source Milkweed thrives in dryer climates across the U.S. and is a common host for Monarch butterflies. Spicebush thrives in moist woods and marshes, and commonly hosts the Spicebush Swallowtail. Paw-Paw trees grow in moist places across Ohio and most of the Eastern U.S., and commonly host the Zebra Swallowtail. [2] X Research source Parsley, dill and fennel can grow in the wild but you’re more likely to find them planted in a butterfly aficionado’s garden. These herbs commonly attract the Black Swallowtail. Walnut and Sweet Gum trees host the Luna Moth. Several types of walnut trees grow across the U.S. They thrive in deep, fertile soils that are protected from cold air and water-logging. [3] X Research source Sweet Gum trees thrive in deep, moist bottomland and full sun. [4] X Research source Black Cherry trees host the Cecropia Moth, the Viceroy, and the Red-Spotted Purple butterfly. They grow across North America on various types of soils, but thrive in cool, moist and temperate locations."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with what different types of caterpillars look like. Caterpillars look different from one another based on what species of butterfly they come from/will turn into. For example, they can be brightly coloured, hairy, spotted, skinny or fat. You can narrow down which type of caterpillar you’ve found by considering the host plant. For example, if you find a caterpillar on a Milkweed leaf, it’s likely a Monarch. The next step in figuring out which type of caterpillar you’ve found is to consider its appearance. As an example, Monarch caterpillars are striped yellow-green, white, and black, and look kind of thick and chubby. It’s a good idea to consult a book or website if you’re unsure of which type of caterpillar you’re looking at. Some websites even help you figure out which caterpillar you’ve found using checkboxes.

      "content": "Ensure that it’s the right season. It’s possible to find caterpillars between early spring and early fall each year; different butterfly species lay eggs at different times. The key is to find out what types of butterflies are native to your area, then look up when they are most likely to lay eggs. Monarch butterfly eggs are laid and hatched in March and April; it takes the caterpillar about 2 weeks to be fully grown, after which it will attach itself to a stem or leaf and begin its metamorphosis into a butterfly. [6] X Research source Cecropia and Polyphemus moths lay eggs in late May and June. Their eggs hatch within 1 to 2 weeks, and then the caterpillars spend the summer eating and growing, making their cocoons in August or September. They spend the winter in cocoons and emerge in late May or June as butterflies to lay eggs and start the cycle once more. [7] X Research source As a general rule, June is a good time of year for finding caterpillars. If you can't wait until they’re in season, it’s possible to buy caterpillars from some companies so that you can raise them into butterflies yourself. [8] X Research source"

As an example, a Monarch looks like a creamy yellow oblong dot — kind of like the head of those colored tailoring pins. If there are butterflies around, you might even see a butterfly lay an egg. If a butterfly lands on a leaf and lingers, it’s possible she’s laying an egg, so go and check the underside of the leaf once she’s gone."

You can also try putting ice and/or baking soda on the sting to help with pain and swelling. Caterpillar stings are similar to bee stings in that they are generally not fatal, but severe reactions can occur.

Many people would prefer to leave caterpillars in their natural habitats, but if you feel comfortable taking one home, make sure you have a suitable container for it. Suitable containers for caterpillars include aquariums or even one-gallon jars. The top of the living space should be breathable and securely fastened: cheesecloth or a thin-mesh screen will work well. Do not simply poke holes into a jar lid, as this will not provide enough fresh air for the caterpillars. In addition, if they crawl on to the lid the sharp edges of the holes may cut the caterpillars open. [17] X Research source"

Caterpillars won’t eat dead, dry, or old leaves, so it’s imperative to make fresh ones available to them each day. You can keep leaves in water to preserve them, but do not keep the water in the same container as the caterpillar as the caterpillar could fall into it and drown.

Caterpillars eat until they outgrow their skin, which usually happens about four times before the caterpillar reaches its final “instar”, or life stage between sheds. In its final instar the caterpillar becomes a pupa (for butterflies this is also known as a chrysalis). In many moth species the pupa stage will involve a cocoon or the caterpillar burrowing down into soil to pupate. After anywhere from a few days to a few months, a butterfly or moth will emerge from the pupa. Its goal is then to mate and reproduce before dying."
