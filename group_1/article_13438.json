Be sure that they know that such feelings are natural and that people experience grief differently.

Ask big, broad questions, that encourage them to think about their feelings and explore the subjects that they are interested in. Make it clear that you want to know what they feel, but are not questioning the validity of their feelings. Do not ask “why” questions. These make it sound as if you do not understand or support their feelings. Ask broad questions like “How do you feel?” Ask “What bothers you the most?” Instead of asking “Why do you feel that way?” ask “Could you give me specific examples?”"

When I go to work I am tired and can’t think clearly. I am getting more and more nervous and depressed because I can’t function during the day.” Ask, “So your grief is causing sleep problems that disrupt your life?”"

      "content": "Refrain from unsupportive behavior. Everything you do should be directed at them. Anything that suggests your focus is elsewhere will be counterproductive.

      "content": "Keep your body open and relaxed. Crossed legs and arms may suggest that you are closed off or uninviting. Try to sit straight up, with your limbs open. Your body should appear relaxed and you can gesture with your hands to show emotional support. Also be sure that your body is facing directly toward the grieving person to indicate that you are engaged with them. Sit on the same level as the person you are talking to. Do not take a chair that allows you to tower over them, or them over you. This creates a sense of power imbalance that is not helpful for open conversation."
