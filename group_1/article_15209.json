      "title": "Choose your method wisely.",
      "content": "Choose your method wisely. Consider whether to use an at-home dye kit or professional dyes, or go to the salon. Carefully consider the costs, processes, and risks involved in each method. For the salon method, costs and products will vary. Check out websites of local salons or call them for pricing. If possible, talk to a stylist in person. Use the box kit method with caution. Read online reviews to help you choose a box kit that works best on black hair. A popular box kit is L’Oréal Paris Preference Les Blondissimes LB01: Extra Light Ash Blonde. It won’t dye your hair platinum, but may get you down to an ashy blonde in one go. [1] X Research source Use professional-quality products, if possible. Some professional companies require a cosmetology license in order to make a purchase, so keep that in mind."

      "content": "Be prepared for the time and expense. Regardless of which method you choose, it will likely take multiple bleachings to achieve the gray tone that you want. Take the time and expense (i.e. multiple salon visits, multiple purchases of dye kits or professional products) into consideration before you decide."

      "title": "Build your hair’s health before you go gray.",
      "content": "Build your hair’s health before you go gray. In the weeks or months leading up to the bleaching, avoid using harsh hair products and heat styling tools on your hair. If your hair feels damaged, do weekly deep-conditioning masks until it feels healthy enough to be bleached. Use good-quality shampoos and conditioners to moisturize your hair without adding buildup or stripping your hair of its natural oils. Look for low pH, oils (argan, avocado, olive), glycerin, glyceryl stearate, propylene glycol, sodium lactate, sodium PCA, and alcohols that start with “c” or “s.” Avoid strongly fragranced products, alcohols that begin with “prop,” sulfates, and any products that claim to add volume."

    {
      "title": "Purchase bleach powder at a beauty supply store.",
      "content": "Purchase bleach powder at a beauty supply store. To dye your hair gray at home, you’ll need to start by bleaching it. You can buy bleach powder from a professional beauty supply store or online. It is typically sold in packets or tubs. If you plan on bleaching your hair more than once, a tub is the cheaper long-term option. Some bleach kits may come with bleach powder and cream developer, so if you go that route, you may not need to purchase individual products. Check the kit's packaging for details. Consider buying red gold corrector. Red gold correctors often come in little packages that you add to your bleach mixture to reduce brassiness. This is optional, but recommended."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase a 10 to 20-volume cream developer.",
      "content": "Purchase a 10 to 20-volume cream developer. Cream developer reacts with the powder to bleach your hair. It comes in different volumes ranging from 10 (weakest) to 40 (strongest). The higher the volume, the quicker it will turn your hair blonde, but also the more damaging it will be. Most stylists recommend using 10-volume or 20-volume. A 20-volume developer is your safest bet for effectiveness and gentleness. If you have fine, fragile hair, use a 10-volume developer. For dark, coarse hair, a 30- or 40-volume developer might be necessary. Do not use a 50-volume developer at home."

    {
      "title": "Buy a hair toner to help eliminate brassiness after bleaching.",
      "content": "Buy a hair toner to help eliminate brassiness after bleaching. Toners are what take your hair from yellow to white, which is the ideal base for gray. They come in a variety of shades, including blue, silver, and purple. Even if you’re not dyeing your hair at home, a toner can be used every few weeks to maintain your color. Use toners to neutralize unwanted colors and remove brassiness. For example, to neutralize hair that’s too golden, choose a toner shade that’s opposite gold on the color wheel, such as a blue or violet ash-based toner. Some toners need to be mixed with developers before being applied, while others come ready to apply."

      "content": "Buy a gray hair dye and the other necessary tools for home use. You can find gray hair dye at most local beauty shops or use online retailers that sell professional-quality brands. If you purchase online, pay attention to reviews. Also, pick up an applicator/tint brush, a plastic mixing bowl, a plastic spoon, gloves, hair clips, and a plastic shower cap. If the veins on the underside of your wrist look blue or purple, opt for a cool white gray tone. If your veins look green or yellow, go for a warmer, steely gray.

      "title": "Do patch and strand tests before bleaching.",
      "content": "Do patch and strand tests before bleaching. A patch test is necessary to make sure that you’re not allergic to anything in the bleach mixture. A strand test will help you calculate how long you need to leave the bleach mixture on your hair. If you only do one test, do the patch test. A severe allergic reaction could be fatal. [3] X Research source To do a patch test, create a tiny amount of the bleach mixture and place a dab of it behind your ear. Leave it for 30 minutes, wipe off the excess, and avoid getting the skin wet for 48 hours. If there's no skin irritation after 48 hours, go ahead with bleaching your hair. To do a strand test, prepare a small amount of the bleach mixture and apply it to a strand of your hair. Check it every 10 to 15 minutes until it reaches the desired color. Note the time it took to reach this color."

      "content": "Apply coconut oil to your hair before bleaching to protect it. Rub a small amount of extra virgin coconut oil between your palms to warm it up, then massage it into your hair and scalp. Leave the coconut oil on your hair for at least 3 hours before bleaching. You don't need to wash it out before you proceed. This can moisturize and protect your hair from damage. Coconut oil is an effective hair moisturizer because it is made up of molecules that are small enough to penetrate the hair shaft. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine the bleach powder with developing cream. Add the correct amount of developer to the bowl containing the powder, and mix them together with a plastic spoon. Aim for a thick, creamy consistency, similar to gravy. Unless stated otherwise on the packaging, the ratio of developer to powder should be roughly 1:1 — 1 spoonful of powder per 1 spoonful of developer. Add a red gold corrector to the mixture, if desired. This is optional, but it can help reduce brassiness and make your hair whiter, which will help you achieve a better gray. Once the powder and developer are combined, add some red gold corrector to the bleach-developer mixture. Read the package instructions for how much you need to add."

Work with 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) strips of hair and start at your ends, brushing the mixture upwards and leaving roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of roots. Work from the back of your head to the front of your head. This will make it much easier to keep track of what hair you’ve already applied bleach/dye too. After you've covered the rest of your hair, apply bleach to your roots. It is important to save the roots for last because the warmth of your scalp causes your roots to develop faster than the rest of your hair. Unless your hair is quite short, use clips to section off your hair as you work on it. Be sure to use plastic clips, since metal can react to the bleach mixture."

      "content": "Cover your saturated hair with plastic wrap. You can also use a clear plastic shower cap. As the bleach works, your scalp may begin to itch and sting. This is normal. If the tingling and stinging on your scalp become too painful, remove the plastic wrap and wash out the bleach. Avoid the temptation to apply any heat to your hair at this point, as applying heat could end with your hair falling out completely."

If your hair is orange or still dark, you will need to bleach it again, waiting at least 2 weeks between bleachings. [5] X Research source Remember that the darker the blonde, the darker the gray will be, so bleach your hair as light as you want your gray shade to be. Note that you won’t need to reapply the bleach to your roots if your roots are whiter than the rest of your hair. Just apply bleach to the parts you want to lighten further. Depending on how dark, coarse, and thick your hair is, it could take up to 5 bleachings to turn it pale yellow. [6] X Research source"

The only difference is that you’ll be doing just your roots, and not the rest of your hair. Renew your color when your roots are 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the longest. If you let your roots grow longer than that, it may be more difficult to touch them up without having them clash with the rest of your hair. If the rest of your color needs a touchup, apply toner to all of your hair, rinse it out, and apply gray dye to your hair.
