A scam that has been becoming popular is where someone will randomly send you some money on Cash App. This money is stolen, and the user who sent it will try to send you a refund request for the money back. Any offer that promises you a lot of money all at once is likely a scam. The exception is giveaways, but you should still be wary of what source is promoting any giveaways or sweepstakes."
