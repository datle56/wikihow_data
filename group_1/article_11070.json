      "content": "Place a ramekin in a storage container. Get out a non-reactive container that's large enough to hold the pork belly. Set a small ramekin upside down in the bottom of the container. Use a plastic, glass, or enamel container, but avoid metal containers since these will affect the flavor of the pork. [4] X Research source When you place the pork on the ramekin and the pork gives off liquid, the ramekin will keep the pork from curing in its juice."
