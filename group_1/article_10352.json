      "title": "Compare your Crocs’ color to the options on the Crocs website.",
      "content": "Compare your Crocs’ color to the options on the Crocs website. Each line of Crocs comes with its own unique array of colors with fun names like Moon Jelly and Dreamscape. Go to the official Crocs website and find the product that matches the one you have. If your shoe’s color isn’t an option, that’s a good sign your Croc is counterfeit."

      "title": "Check if your Crocs’ heel strap is rigid or fixed.",
      "content": "Check if your Crocs’ heel strap is rigid or fixed. Genuine Crocs (especially Crocs Clog shoes) have a moveable heel strap that you can move to the front of the shoes to make them into sandals, or push to the back of the shoes for extra heel support. If your Crocs’ strap can’t pivot or is unusually stiff, your shoes could be fake. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the Duke crocodile logo for inaccuracies.",
      "content": "Inspect the Duke crocodile logo for inaccuracies. The logo typically appears on the buttons on both sides of the strap (on both shoes). Duke the crocodile should have two eyes, two hands with three fingers each, and six bumps on the back. The fourth bump from the top is bigger than the other bumps. If these details aren’t right, you could have counterfeit Crocs. Not every Croc has the Duke crocodile logo. Always check your product against the same item on the official Crocs website to know what it’s supposed to look like."

    {
      "title": "Reference the logo button against official Crocs images.",
      "content": "Reference the logo button against official Crocs images. Shoes that don’t have the Duke crocodile logo will have logo buttons on the sides of the straps. In the Literide line, the Crocs name is embossed in an oval; in the classic line, there’s simply a circular button. A missing button or one with typos and blurry printing indicates a fake Croc. [2] X Research source Collaborations have unique logo buttons that represent the collaborating brand."

    {
      "title": "Look at the outsole to see if the product information is there.",
      "content": "Look at the outsole to see if the product information is there. Genuine Crocs should have the Crocs brand name with a trademark symbol (™), the official Crocs website address (www.crocs.com), the country of origin, size information (including a letter and number), and the city of production (often Boulder, Colorado). [3] X Research source Not all Crocs products have all this information, but the majority of Crocs do. High-soled Croc lines may display origin information inside the shoe or the back strap. Collaborations may have additional information specific to the partnership. Missing or misspelled information on the outsole is a sign your Crocs are counterfeit. The Crocs website lists China, Italy, Mexico, Vietnam, and Bosnia as countries of origin. [4] X Research source Crocs have also been manufactured in Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and India.

      "title": "Weigh the Crocs to check for low-quality materials.",
      "content": "Weigh the Crocs to check for low-quality materials. Genuine Crocs are made with patented Croslite materials to give them their lightweight feel and flexibility. Knockoffs are made with low-quality materials like rubber. They’ll feel heavy and inflexible. [6] X Research source An adult pair of Crocs typically weighs between 11–16 ounces (310–450 g) . [7] X Research source Heavier shoes could be fakes. Kids Crocs will be lighter. You should be able to easily clean your Crocs , but fake Crocs could hold onto stains and scuffs more than real ones."

      "title": "Check for circulation nubs and 13 holes per shoe.",
      "content": "Check for circulation nubs and 13 holes per shoe. One of Crocs’ patented design features is the circulation nubs on the inner sole. Fake Crocs may have these little bumps, but they won’t feel the same as those in real Crocs. Real Crocs also have 13 holes on each shoe. [8] X Research source Another design feature unique to Crocs is that almost every model is molded in one piece. If parts are glued together, your Croc is almost certainly counterfeit."

      "title": "Test if your Crocs have traction on wet surfaces.",
      "content": "Test if your Crocs have traction on wet surfaces. Authentic Crocs have slip-resistant grooves on the bottom of the shoe to give you traction on wet surfaces. Carefully walk in your Crocs on a slippery surface—if you feel like you’re about to slide and fall, those may be counterfeit Crocs. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a barcode lookup tool to check the tag’s UPC.",
      "content": "Use a barcode lookup tool to check the tag’s UPC. Every Croc shoe model has a unique Universal Product Code (UPC), the 12-digit number under the barcode. You can look it up online using a barcode lookup tool to confirm the tag matches the product it’s attached to. Other details on the tag include information about the product’s origin, distributor, materials, and sizing. If these are missing, the shoes could be fake."

      "title": "Wear your Crocs to check if the sizing feels accurate.",
      "content": "Wear your Crocs to check if the sizing feels accurate. Regardless of what’s printed on the sole of your Crocs, the actual size of fake shoes may be wrong. If they feel suspiciously tight or loose on your feet—especially compared to other Crocs you’ve worn—they’re probably counterfeit."

      "title": "Consider if your Crocs are tight or painful to wear.",
      "content": "Consider if your Crocs are tight or painful to wear. Authentic Crocs are designed to be comfortable and support your feet. If your Crocs are uncomfortable and even painful while wearing , that’s a sign they’re knockoffs that weren’t designed with the same materials or construction as real Crocs. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the packaging for proper materials and branding.",
      "content": "Inspect the packaging for proper materials and branding. When you purchase Crocs from authorized online retailers, they almost always come in a transparent polybag with the Crocs brand name printed on it—not in a shoe box. [11] X Research source There is typically a product sticker with a barcode on this bag. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Research sellers who offer extreme discounts on Crocs. While Crocs offers discounts and some re-sellers may sell at a discount, a very low price could be a sign that the Croc is a knockoff. Try to read reviews of the product and seller if ordering from a third-party website like eBay, Etsy, TikTok Shop, or Amazon. [13] X Research source"
