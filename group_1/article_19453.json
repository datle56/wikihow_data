      "content": "Use a bowl with apple cider vinegar and dish soap to catch the flies. Pour enough apple cider vinegar into a bowl so it’s two-thirds full. Add a drop or two of liquid dish soap to the bowl, and then cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Poke about 10–15 holes in the wrap with a toothpick and set it out to attract the fruit flies. [1] X Research source Fruit flies will be drawn to the scent of the vinegar and drown when they come into contact with the soapy surface. The plastic wrap prevents any fruit flies from escaping once they crawl inside. [2] X Research source Empty the bowl and replace the bait every 2–3 days until your fruit fly infestation clears up. Fruit flies usually only survive for 1–2 weeks, so it won’t take long to catch them all. Avoid using distilled white vinegar since it doesn’t attract fruit flies very well."

      "content": "Trap flies with a paper funnel and jar baited with fruit. Roll a regular piece of paper into a cone so the opening at the point is less than 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm). Tape the paper so it holds its shape. Set a ripe piece of banana, peach, or tomato inside a jar. Set the point of the cone in the jar so it’s just above the bait. After a few days, toss out the trap and replace it with fresh bait. [3] X Research source The fruit flies will go down the funnel toward the bait, but they won’t be able to find their way back out and get stuck. Stick the trap in your freezer overnight to humanely kill the flies before throwing away the old bait. That way, they won’t fly away or stay alive in your trash.

Put ripe fruit, apple cider vinegar, old beer, or wine in the bottom section of the bottle. Take the cap off the top section of the bottle, and place it upside-down inside the lower section. Leave your trap out in your kitchen for 2–3 days to capture the flies. [5] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Flies will be able to fly down into the bottle trap, but they won’t be able to get out by themselves. Alternatively, take an old beer or wine bottle that still has a little bit inside and cover the top with a piece of plastic wrap. Poke a hole or two in the plastic wrap so flies can crawl in but are unable to get out."

Place the adhesive flypaper where you’ve seen the most fruit flies, which will normally be in your kitchen near the trash or by the sink. Leave the flypaper up as long as you see fruit flies in your home. If the strips fill up with flies, take them down and throw them away.

If you notice any fruit flies outside of your home, load the insecticide into a garden sprayer and apply it around the base of your home. If you’re growing any fruits or vegetables in a garden, be sure to treat them directly with Spinosad as well to kill any fruit flies that stop by for a meal. [9] X Research source Spinosad impacts a fruit fly’s nervous system to kill it, but it doesn’t pose any serious threats to pets or other animals. You can safely use it around pets and children. Rinse off any fruits and veggies that you applied Spinosad to before you eat them. Try to limit your exposure to Spinosad since it could cause slight eye irritation or allergic reactions.
