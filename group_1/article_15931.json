Because of this, an INFJ may have a hard time opening up to an ENTP, especially in bustling social settings. [1] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Even so, when they do build trust with one another, they’re able to have deep, meaningful conversations.

      "content": "ENTPs and INFJs can grow to trust one another. INFJs are incredibly empathetic and compassionate. Their value of commitment means that they’ll honor an ENTP’s word no matter what. On the other hand, ENTPs are very charismatic. Their spontaneity may lead them to stray from an INFJ, but if given adequate space, they’ll likely keep an INFJ’s trust. If you’re an ENTP, stick with your partner’s schedule to earn their trust . Routine doesn’t come naturally to you, and an INFJ will value your effort and dedication. If you’re an INFJ, practice being direct with your partner about your needs to earn their trust. State exactly what you need and want in the relationship and set clear boundaries . This way, an ENTP will know what is and isn’t allowed."

      "content": "ENTPs and INFJs can create fireworks in bed. ENTPs are all about spontaneity and physical affection, making them a firecracker in the bedroom. Although they’re quite reserved, INFJs seek emotional intimacy, and an ENTP’s desire for physical intimacy can help them break down their walls. Even so, this pairing’s differences could lead to romantic dry spells, which may cause an ENTP to wander from their INFJ partner to satisfy their needs. If you’re an ENTP, be understanding of your partner’s needs too. They’re not as vivacious as you, but they’ll turn around with time! Have patience and know that an INFJ will do everything they can to fulfill your needs (as long as they’re ready to do so). If you’re an INFJ, express your wants and needs with your partner openly. Tell them what you like and dislike in the bedroom. If you’re up to experimenting, don’t be afraid to show it! An ENTP loves nothing more than mixing things up and trying new things."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source This difference in social livelihood could put stress on a relationship. If you're an ENTP, don’t force an INFJ to go out with you. Let them stay in and recharge by giving them space to be alone.
