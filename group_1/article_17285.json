Here's how to find these two quantities from two points: \"Rise\" is the change in vertical distance, or the difference between the y -values of the two points. \"Run\" is the change in horizontal distance, or the difference between x -values of the same two points. Example 2 (cont.): The y-values of the two points are 2 and -4, so the rise is (-4) - (2) = -6. The x-values of the two points (in the same order) are 1 and 3, so the run is 3 - 1 = 2."

Example 4 : To find the y-intercept of y 2 = x + 1 {\\displaystyle y^{2}=x+1} , substitute x = 0 and solve the quadratic equation . In this case, we can solve y 2 = 0 + 1 {\\displaystyle y^{2}=0+1} by taking the square root of both sides. Remember, when taking a square root, you must account for two answers: a negative and a positive. y 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {y^{2}}}={\\sqrt {1}}} y = 1 or y = -1.
