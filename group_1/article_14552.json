      "title": "Draw an oval-shaped head at the top of your paper.",
      "content": "Draw an oval-shaped head at the top of your paper. Place a circle near the top center of the page so there’s enough room to add anime hair later on. Put the point of the chin slightly outside the bottom edge of the circle since the jaw will come lower down. Sketch in curved jaw lines from either side of the circle toward the mark you just made to make a pointed chin for your anime girl. [1] X Research source Work lightly in pencil so you can erase and make changes if you need to. If you have trouble drawing a circle , use a compass to help you draw one. Don’t add any facial features yet since you may need to make adjustments to the size of the head later on. Be careful not to draw the head too large, or else you won’t be able to fit the rest of the body on the sheet of paper."

      "title": "Make a vertical line down the paper’s center that’s 6.5 times taller than the head.",
      "content": "Make a vertical line down the paper’s center that’s 6.5 times taller than the head. Measure the height of the head from the top of the circle to the point of the chin. Start your line at the top of your character’s head and draw it straight down so it’s 6 ½ taller than the head. Space horizontal marks down the vertical line so they’re the same distance apart as the head height to use as guides. [2] X Research source Measure your proportions each time or else your anime character won’t look natural. The guideline will also help keep your drawing symmetrical."

      "title": "Sketch an hourglass shape with 2 circles in it for the torso.",
      "content": "Sketch an hourglass shape with 2 circles in it for the torso. Draw the top line of the hourglass shape slightly below the chin to form the shoulders. Draw curved lines going toward the center line, and flare out the bottom of the hourglass shape so it’s slightly wider than the shoulders for the hips. Draw 2 circles with a compass in the top half of the hourglass shape for your character’s breasts. [3] X Research source When you’re finished, the head and torso together will be about 3 heads tall. Your anime girl’s shoulders should be about 1 ½ times wider than the head. Draw small circles on the top corners of the hourglass shape if you want to visualize the shoulder joints better."

      "title": "Draw two long, slender tubes for each arm that end in mitten-shaped hands.",
      "content": "Draw two long, slender tubes for each arm that end in mitten-shaped hands. Draw tubes extending down from the shoulder joints on the top of the torso. Once you reach the point where the body is narrowest, put circles inside the tubes you’re drawing for the arms to mark the elbows. Continue extending the tubes down to the bottom of the hourglass and sketch small circles for the wrists. Draw mitten shapes for the anime hands that are attached to the ends of the arms. [4] X Research source The upper arms and forearms on your drawing will be the same length. Try posing the arms a different way if you don’t want them straight down. Just make sure the total length of each arm is about the same length as the drawing’s torso."

      "title": "Draw wide tubes with narrower ones beneath them for legs, then trapezoids for feet.",
      "content": "Draw wide tubes with narrower ones beneath them for legs, then trapezoids for feet. Start by drawing tubes extending from the bottom of the torso on either side of the center guideline. Once the upper legs are 1 ½ heads tall, draw circles in the tubes to represent the knee joints. Continue drawing the lower legs so they’re the same length as the upper legs before adding circles for the ankle joints. Draw trapezoid shapes attached to the ankle joints for your character’s feet so the bottoms line up with the last horizontal line. [5] X Research source Make sure both legs are the same length, or else your drawing won’t look symmetrical."

      "title": "Erase your guidelines, so you have the basic shape of the body.",
      "content": "Erase your guidelines, so you have the basic shape of the body. Use a small eraser to clean up the extra lines on your drawing. Erase the center line running through the middle of your character and any horizontal guides you drew to figure out the proportions. [6] X Research source Be careful not to erase the outline for your character, or you’ll have to redraw it."

      "title": "Sketch facial features and hair onto your figure’s head.",
      "content": "Sketch facial features and hair onto your figure’s head. Place the eyes just below the center of the circle and add eyebrows slightly above them. Add the nose and eyes below the eyes in the middle of the face . Choose a hairstyle for your anime character and draw it in clumps rather than individual strands. [7] X Research source Look at various characters’ hairstyles to get an idea of different anime hairstyles that you can draw. Draw the hairstyles on a piece of tracing paper on top of your drawing so you can practice sketching without affecting the rest of your drawing. That way, you can try multiple styles before committing to one."

      "content": "Add clothing to the figure. There are many different outfits you can draw on your character, so choose one that looks the best for your drawing. Lightly sketch the clothes on your character’s body so you can get an idea of what it will look like. Once you find a style you like for your character, erase any lines from the body that are covered by clothes to clean up your drawing. [8] X Research source Look at pictures of real people wearing the kind of clothes you want to draw on your character so you can see where it folds and bunches up so you can make your drawing more realistic."

      "content": "Make an oval with a pointed bottom near the top of your paper for the head. Place the oval in the top middle of your paper so you have enough room to add hair later on. Draw angled lines down from either side of the oval that extend down to form the jawline. Sketch the jaw lines so they meet at a point below the oval to form the chin. [9] X Research source Male anime characters usually have longer, narrower faces than females. Don’t draw your circle too large, or you won’t be able to fit the rest of the body on the page."

      "content": "Extend a vertical line that’s 6 ½ times taller than the head down the page. Measure the height of your character’s head from the top of the circle to the bottom of the chin. Multiply the measurement by 6 ½ to find out how tall your character should be so it’s proportional. Start the line in the top center of the head and extend it straight down to the length you found so you know how tall your character should be. [10] X Research source You can also draw horizontal lines marking the head size along the vertical guide. That way, you can visually see where the character’s anatomy lines up."

      "content": "Sketch in a rectangular shape for the torso. Draw a horizontal line below the chin on your character’s head to mark the tops of their shoulders. Add lines down from the ends of the shoulder that angle slightly toward the center guide. Once the torso extends halfway down the vertical guideline, draw a horizontal line on the bottom for the hips. [11] X Research source Your character’s shoulders should be about twice the width of their head and the hips slightly narrower. Put circles on the top corners of the shoulders to mark the joints so you can visualize them better. Keep the body as symmetrical as you can so your character looks proportional."

Sketch small circles inside the tubes to mark the elbows so you know where you can bend the character’s arm. Continue extending the tubes until the forearms are the same length as the upper arms. Add circles for the wrists before adding the hands on the end. [12] X Research source You can draw mitten shapes if you don’t want to add fingers right away to your character’s hands. The arms will be about the same length or slightly longer than your character’s torso."

Once you’ve drawn them halfway between the hips and the end of the center line, add circles inside the tubes for the knees. Add the lower legs so they’re the same length as the upper legs before drawing a trapezoid shape for the feet. [13] X Research source Draw one leg first and extend horizontal guidelines from the knee joint and foot so you can line them up when you add the other leg. Hold your drawing out in front of you and look at its proportions to see if they look natural or unnatural."

Be careful not to erase any of your character’s outline, or you’ll have to redraw it. Continue erasing any lines that aren’t a part of your character. [14] X Research source If you don’t have an eraser on your pencil, you can either use a block eraser or a small clickable eraser to work in tight areas."

      "content": "Sketch in facial features and muscles to add details. Draw rounded rectangular shapes your slightly lower than the center of the head for your character's eyes. Add a small line for the tip of the nose, and draw the mouth below the eyes so they’re lined up with the middle of the circle. Pick a hairstyle that fits your character well and sketch it onto their head. Draw the hairs in clumps that end in a point rather than drawing individual strands. Then add in lines following along with your character’s muscles, such as around their pectorals or their abs. [15] X Research source You don’t have to add muscles if you plan on drawing loose-fitting clothes on them. Look at musculature charts to see what shapes and lines the muscles would make on your character."

Sketch the style lightly onto the outline of your character’s body so you can see what it would look like if they were wearing it. Once you’re happy with how the clothes look, erase any part of your character’s body that’s covered by clothing to make it look more believable. [16] X Research source Practice drawing clothes on a sheet of tracing paper so you don’t have to draw and erase your drawing each time. Look at pictures of real people in similar outfits as what you want to draw so you can see how the clothes fold or bunch up."

      "content": "Try drawing your favorite anime characters. Drawing a well-loved character will not only help with inspiration, but you can also use their form as a reference for later sketches. Notice how their bodies look in different poses and angles so that you can practice drawing anime bodies in action. Having a physical picture of them can be useful, too, as tracing over the pictures can help you understand the anime anatomy even better."

Artist Renee Plevy encourages taking a class and constant practice in order to improve your skills. She says, \"You need to do a lot of reading and a lot of sketching. But primarily, you need to find a good teacher in your area who will help you to see what you're missing.\" She goes on to say that it can be difficult to develop your \"artist's eye\" on your own, so a little professional guidance would certainly help. \"You need to find a teacher that can help you see more than you've seen in the past,\" she stated."
