You won't find them in other biomes at all. Terrain - Villages will usually spawn in dry, flat areas. This means that if you're looking for them in the Taiga biome, you'll need to find a flat section. Appearance - Villages resemble clusters of buildings surrounded by wood-enclosed farms and populated by non-aggressive people."

While fire at night may be lava, there's a good chance that the fire is coming from torches—and torches typically mean villages. Be extremely careful while doing this if you're playing survival mode on anything other than \"peaceful\" difficulty. It's best not to investigate the torches until the following day due to mobs."
