      "content": "Take a few deep breaths so you feel relaxed . If you’re in a situation where you need to fake a smile, take a moment to try to relax.

      "content": "Draw up the corners of your mouth. The most obvious part of a smile is to curl up the corners of your mouth, creating a smiley-face curve with your lips.

      "content": "Bring the smile into your eyes. A natural smile will affect your whole face, including your eyes. When you’re practicing a realistic smile, the corners of your eyes should crinkle slightly. The muscles used here are called the orbicularis oculi, and while you can’t contract them voluntarily, you can mimic a realistic smile by squinting slightly. [4] X Research source In addition to squinting the muscles around your eyes, you may want to slightly raise your eyebrows."

      "content": "Say a word that ends in \"uh\" instead of saying \"cheese.\" You’ve probably heard the phrase “Say Cheese!” a million times before taking a picture, but this won't give you a realistic smile. That’s because you clench your jaw when you say the word “cheese,” and the ee sound stretches your mouth. Instead, say a word ending in “uh,” like “karma” or “mocha.” [5] X Research source Words ending in the syllable \"uh\" will create a more natural, relaxed expression that resembles a real smile."
