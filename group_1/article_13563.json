      "content": "\"Silent repost\" means you find a post relatable but are too shy to repost it. It's not a TikTok feature, but a thing people comment (either \"silent repost\" or \"#silentrepost\") when they think a video is relatable, funny, or sexy, and they wish they could repost it , but they wouldn't want their followers to see it in their feeds."

      "title": "You can't repost a TikTok without your followers knowing.",
      "content": "You can't repost a TikTok without your followers knowing. Even though some TikTokers claim you can do a silent repost, it's not actually possible. But there are a few alternatives! The first is to comment \"silent repost\" or use the hashtag #silentrepost to tell the creator you relate to their post and wish you could repost it. If your goal is to give the creator a little boost, this is the best option! The other is to create a collection of favorites called \"silent repost\" and add the TikToks you wish you could repost to the collection. You can make your silent repost collection public so people can see it on your profile if you'd like—the videos won't show up in your friends' feeds as reposts, but people who check out your profile can see that you appreciate them. If you don't want anyone to see, you can make your collection private."

Really, the name doesn’t matter—even if you've seen TikToks telling you that adding videos to a folder called \"silent reposts\" will repost the video silently, it's (unfortunately) not true."
