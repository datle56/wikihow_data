      "title": "Short kings can have great personalities.",
      "content": "Short kings can have great personalities. In fact, since it’s fairly common for heterosexual women to vocally prefer taller dudes, some short guys may overcompensate for a “lack” of height by being extra attentive, extra fit, or extra funny. We’re not making promises, but…why not give it a whirl? On the other hand, since it’s easier for guys over 6 feet tall to get dates, they may feel they don’t need to work as hard on valuable relationship skills like active listening, thoughtfulness, loyalty, humor, and so on. While some gals gravitate to the over-6-foot crowd because taller guys are perceived as more dominant, stronger, tougher, “bad boy”-ish, etc., this overlooks the fact that tallness really has nothing to do with a guy’s ability to beat someone up (if that’s something you require in a mate). [1] X Research source Plus, if you’re the same size, your wardrobe just doubled. If you’re lucky enough to score a hot date with a dude with roughly your same body type and a sense of style, his closet es su closet. You can wear each other’s clothes and save money on shopping."

      "content": "If you like being the short one, you may need to ditch the heels. If you’re a heel-wearer and you’re committed to being the short queen in the relationship, dating a guy who’s your height or only slightly taller may mean switching to flats. (On the bright side, this may mean you have an excuse to buy new shoes.)"

      "title": "If he’s significantly shorter, kissing may be a little awkward.",
      "content": "If he’s significantly shorter, kissing may be a little awkward. Of course, this is true if you’re dating a guy who’s significantly taller than you, too. Kissing anyone who isn’t roughly your height may take some finagling, but it’s worth it for the right guy. It just might take some creativity: he can stand on the stairs, you can wear flats or bend over, you can kiss while sitting on the couch, etcetera. Just be willing to laugh about it and have fun, and it’ll be fine. Anyway, height really doesn't matter when you're lying down...if you catch our drift."

      "content": "You might get comments from others about your height difference. People are gonna people, unfortunately, and in this lovely society we’ve cultivated in which a large chunk of (usually heterosexual) folks believe man = tall and woman = short, someone inevitably is going to remark on how you’re taller than your date . What can you do? You can ask them with a straight face what they’re talking about and force them to reckon with the ridiculousness (and rudeness) of their comment. You can say, “We’re both happy. What’s bothering you?” If they’re tall and you’re sassy, ask them, “How’s the weather up there, Jolly Green Giant ?” Just ignore them. They’ll (probably) get the picture and be duly embarrassed."

      "content": "Some short guys may struggle with low self-esteem due to their height. Even the most confident short kings may deal with anxiety about their height, and in some cases this could be a problem—especially if the girl they’re dating is working to overcome her own height-related biases. This isn’t a guarantee, though: lots of short guys are totally confident in their height and know hotness is about more than being 6 feet tall. While insecurity about his height might be something he can get over the longer you’re together, it’s also possible it could lead to petty fights or resentment or mistrust in the relationship. To help keep his insecurity in check, try to regularly compliment him about what you like about him—both the appearance-based and the more abstract qualities, like his brilliance or gentleness—and avoid comparing his height to other taller guys. [2] X Research source But try not to feel like you need to kick the flats or hunch over just to make him feel better about the height difference. If you’re happy in heels, wear your heels!"

      "content": "Yes, it’s definitely possible to change your preferences! Some of your preferences are hardwired into your brain, but it may also be possible to retrain your brain by practicing being more open-minded and questioning your bias against shorter guys—do you prefer tall dudes because it genuinely matters (or matters that much )? Or is it something you’ve been subconsciously pressured to prefer by society? Is it inherently wrong to have aesthetic preferences? No—but insisting on a superficial aesthetic trait (especially one that someone can’t help) over more important qualities like kindness or loyalty is, let’s face it, rather foolish. Consider this: how often do you claim to prefer tall guys on the apps without actually meeting a short guy in person? Sometimes, once you go out with a shorter guy, you'll realize a) 5'7\" really isn't even that short and b) he might be super fun and sexy in person."

Yes, it’s no myth: short guys do tend to struggle to get dates more than taller guys do, and women report preferring to date taller guys. [3] X Research source According to one study, about half of women prefer to date a guy who’s significantly (at least 8 inches) taller than they are, while only about 13% of guys prefer to date a woman who’s shorter than they are (and then it’s only about 3 inches).

      "content": "What is considered \"short\" for a guy? \"No one under 6 feet\" has become so prevalent on dating apps it's turned into something of a joke, but the exact definition of \"short\" varies from woman to woman: for some, it's anyone shorter than they are themselves. For others, it might really be any guy under 6-foot. But the average man in the United States is actually only 5-foot-9 , so \"short\" would technically probably be 5'7\" or under.

      "content": "Why do some women care how tall their date is? Some women (and gay men) prefer to date a guy who’s taller (even significantly taller) because they’ve been socially ingrained to value this trait. But there is also evidence to suggest some women’s preference for tall dudes is biological: tallness may be associated with dominance, social status, good genes, or even being a “bad boy,” since being short may be perceived as a sign of “weakness.” [6] X Research source (Please!) Some women report feeling safer when they’re out and about with a tall guy who may be able to protect her. But this obviously doesn’t take into account the fact that some shorter guys are still very strong—maybe even stronger than guys a foot taller than them. [7] X Research source Unfortunately, the “social status” thing is somewhat true (or at least it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy): according to an APA study, tall guys tend to be paid more than short guys on average.

      "content": "Do all women prefer tall guys? No way—not only are there loads of gals who can ignore a guy’s height if he’s got other great qualities, but there are tons of women who actively prefer bite-sized boyfriends. And why not? Who wouldn’t want to date Marty McFly, Jason Schwartzman, or Zac Efron? We love short kings! 😍 Some studies suggest it’s primarily cis, straight women who prefer tall guys, which isn’t super surprising when you consider the hypermasculine ideal of a tall, beefy alpha is a result of millennia of aggressive heteronormativity. The adherence to heteronormative gender stereotypes may also make it easier for cis straight women to ignore the fact that, well, rejecting a guy for being too short could really hurt his feelings, since “big tough alphas” aren’t supposed to have feelings."
