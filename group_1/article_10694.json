    {
      "title": "List your strengths and weaknesses.",
      "content": "List your strengths and weaknesses. Before you attempt to make a new position, take into account the ways you impact your company. You may find out that you aren’t showing your strongest points in your work. On the other hand, your weakest points can hold you back. Use your list to help you identify ways you can do better at work. [1] X Research source Creating a job at work is almost like going through a job interview. Not only can your strong points give you new ideas for jobs, but they make the company more likely to set up a new job for you. For example, you may realize that computer programming is your strong point, not sales, so you decide to transition to a job that involves computers."

    {
      "title": "Come up with new ways to provide value to the company.",
      "content": "Come up with new ways to provide value to the company. If you want a job that doesn’t exist yet, you have to go out and get it. That may seem a little strange, but it’s up to you to convince the company that you’re the right person for the job. To do this, seize opportunities for new work and projects in addition to your existing responsibilities as an employee. Prove to the company that you’re a go-getter whose ideas should be heard. Researching a company’s structure, goals, and employees is very helpful. Look for ways to modernize old jobs or areas the company falls short in. Pick the right projects for you. You don’t need to take on everyone’s extra work. Instead, understand your limits and try to stick to responsibilities that relate to the job you want. If you want to be a social media manager, for instance, you might volunteer for work that involves writing and advertising."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sell the project to the boss.",
      "content": "Sell the project to the boss. Draft a basic outline explaining what your project is, your duties, and what good it will do for the company. Try to summarize it in a single sentence you can offer to the company’s leaders. Tell them the summarized version face-to-face. If they are interested, you can then explain the project’s details. [2] X Research source If you’re uncertain about your project, ask a friend, mentor, or coworker for advice. Recite the summary in the mirror until you feel confident. You can say something like, “The company’s computer systems are out of date, and you can benefit by having me update, manage, and maintain them.” If you’re not already an employee of the company, your project pitch also doubles as an interview. Make sure you talk to someone with hiring power and document your proposal in writing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take initiative when working on projects.",
      "content": "Take initiative when working on projects. Getting a new project off the ground can be a challenge, even if you get approval for it. Creating the job requires hard work persistence. Instead of waiting to be asked to do specific tasks, volunteer to do them in your spare time. Continue working and proving that the role you want to create is valuable. [3] X Research source Avoid resting on your laurels. It’s up to you to figure out what needs to be done to create the job and make it a reality. Use your judgment when waiting for permission. Something like charging a business expense requires permission, but doing extra work in your free time often does not."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prove your talents by showcasing what you contribute.",
      "content": "Prove your talents by showcasing what you contribute. To make a job permanent, you need to put your abilities on display. Find ways to keep bosses, hiring managers, and other influential figures on the same page with you. Normally a project worth doing proves itself through results, but sometimes you may need a push to get an opportunity. [4] X Research source For instance, if you want to design a website, show examples of graphical editing and coding. If you invent a new sales position, make a graph displaying how you increased sales. You should let your contributions show through no matter what kind of work you are doing. Even if you’re doing a routine task, do it well to improve the chances of a company letting you do something new."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay on top of your existing duties.",
      "content": "Stay on top of your existing duties. Usually, a new job isn’t created right away. You may find yourself working to create the job while also fulfilling other responsibilities. Taking care of those responsibilities first is important. You may feel a little busy, but it will be worth it when you succeed. [5] X Research source If you don’t handle the duties you were given when you were hired, you may have a hard time convincing companies to create a new job. If you are already employed by the company, discuss time management with your boss. Many bosses will help you and also recommend you to new roles befitting your skills. For instance, if you were hired as an accountant, you have to be an accountant until you are officially moved into another role."

      "title": "List what you would do in your ideal job.",
      "content": "List what you would do in your ideal job. Freelancing is an opportunity to work on your own schedule. What you get in flexibility you lose in certainty. You may not get the security of steady work and an hourly wage, so you should focus your efforts on a strong skill you have that you enjoy doing. [6] X Research source Write down your work experiences, skills, strengths, and weaknesses to help you figure out what you want in a freelancing gig. As a freelancer, you are responsible for finding and completing all work. You could also work for someone else as an agent or independent contractor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose an area or field to work in.",
      "content": "Choose an area or field to work in. Many different fields are open to independent contractors. Tasks like writing, computer coding, and drawing are often done for commissions, but they aren’t the only opportunities. Explore your options to find something you can do without becoming a paid employee for a company. Try asking around your area to find services that are needed but not currently available. For example, you may be able to consult businesses on how to advertise or serve as a promotional agent for artists."

    {
      "title": "Get any training you need to succeed.",
      "content": "Get any training you need to succeed. You may have identified an interesting job but don’t feel like you have the proper qualifications to succeed. A lot of education comes from hands-on experience, but you should also look for outside help. This can mean doing research at your local library, attending classes at a school in your area, or finding a mentor who has experience in the field you want to be a part of. [7] X Research source For instance, if you want to be a freelance writer but have no experience in publications, you can benefit from taking a few writing courses and getting a few articles into local publications."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a resume to advertise your qualifications.",
      "content": "Create a resume to advertise your qualifications. Qualifications speak to your potential to produce great work. Most people will check to see what makes you a good hire. You should list your successful work experiences and have them available, whether you meet with clients directly or seek them online. [8] X Research source For example, your resume should list major work experiences and awards related to your work, such as that article you got into Quilters Monthly . An alternative to a resume is having a portfolio of your work. If you make websites, for instance, you should save your biggest and best work to wow potential clients."

      "title": "Network to keep friendly relations and meet potential clients.",
      "content": "Network to keep friendly relations and meet potential clients. Networking is key, especially when you are first starting out. You may get few opportunities at first until you build your reputation. Reach out to new clients, fulfill their demands, and convince them to recommend you to new audiences. Most of this is done by locating clients and doing exceptional work for them. [9] X Research source Maintain professional relationships by meeting all expectations and deadlines. If you agree to do animation in a style you don’t like, you have to do it because the client wants it. Be friendly but not aggressive when chasing opportunities. Listen to your clients and don’t take it personally if they turn you down. Try advertising yourself on freelancer sites such as Upwork."

    {
      "title": "Stay flexible to find new work when you need it.",
      "content": "Stay flexible to find new work when you need it. If you can’t seem to make enough money, take a step back and analyze your strategy. The service you provide may be too specific for most businesses or not in demand at the moment. Look for alternate opportunities, even if they aren’t 100% related to your ideal job. [10] X Research source A narrow idea such as a reptile care salon, for example, may not do as well as a salon that services dogs, cats, and birds as well. Think of natural extensions of your work. Many professional writers knew they needed to transition to computer skills as computers became more prevalent. Avoiding overextension is important as well. A large coding project on a deadline, for instance, may be better for a team than a single freelancer."

    {
      "title": "Settle on a specialty after you have built an audience.",
      "content": "Settle on a specialty after you have built an audience. With enough work, you may find a certain skill or service that sells well. This will become your speciality. Your specialty is your focus and your main source of income. Your skills will also grow from having to perform your specialty over and over again. [11] X Research source For instance, a certain art style or item you make may be more popular than others. You may find you do better writing restaurant reviews or consulting sports-related businesses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look out for job and growth opportunities.",
      "content": "Look out for job and growth opportunities. Even if you become a successful freelancer, you may spot better opportunities. Businesses may hire you in an interesting role that gives you more money and perks. On the other hand, you may be able to turn your freelance work into consistent work that is rewarding in its own way. [12] X Research source For instance, if you do freelance transcription work, you may be able to hire others and form your own transcription service. Even if you take a regular hourly job, you can do freelance work on the side. Manage your time and avoid taking on more work than you can handle."

      "title": "Choose a job that fits your passions.",
      "content": "Choose a job that fits your passions. Ideal jobs involve something you enjoy doing. Since you enjoy the subject or activity, chances are you already have some knowledge about it. It doesn’t matter how obscure your choice is. You can always change your plans later if you don’t think they will work out. [13] X Research source For instance, many computer developers got their start from an interest in technology. Combining interests may help you come up with a unique idea. You can open an online store crafting and selling merchandise from your favorite movie or video game series, for example. Another way to choose an idea is to see what services are lacking in your area. If your area has a demand for dog walkers but no one has filled that role yet, you can step in."

    {
      "title": "Practice your craft until you get good at it.",
      "content": "Practice your craft until you get good at it. Be the best you can be so you can continually attract new customers. Study the good or service you wish to provide. Read about it and try doing what you want to do before you monetize it. You should seek to improve your product before and after you start your business. Expect to make mistakes along the way, but use these as learning experiences rather than failures. [14] X Research source For example, if you want draw for commissions, you may not be the world’s best drawer at first. With practice, you can become more talented and attract more business. Try taking classes online or at a local school. Whether you want to weld rings or start a translation service, professional instruction can help you improve your skills,"

      "title": "Create a business plan.",
      "content": "Create a business plan . Writing down your ideas can help you find a cohesive vision for your business. A business plan describes what your company will sell and how it will sell it. Write out other aspects, such as who will work for you, where you will put your funding, and how you will overcome challenges you face. [15] X Research source Your plan doesn’t have to be big and comprehensive at first. Do your best with it for now, then edit it as your business grows. Having a plan can be useful if your business grows. Many investors will need to see a plan before they give you money."

    {
      "title": "Select a name for your business.",
      "content": "Select a name for your business . Most businesses have a unique, catchy name that is easy for customers to remember. Your name is your brand. You do not have to come up with a clever name, but it is important if you plan on having a physical storefront or advertising. [16] X Research source Your business name should sound professional but related to your field. For instance, Shampoodle is a fitting name for a dog grooming business. When you come up with a name, make sure other businesses aren’t using it. Do a quick search online and check social media websites to see if the name is available. If you plan on working alone, your name can often double as a business name. Many consultants, artists, and other professionals depend on name recognition."

    {
      "title": "Register your business if it is required in your area.",
      "content": "Register your business if it is required in your area. Registration requirements vary from area to area, so research your local laws. In many places, you do not need to register a 1-person business as long as you use your real name. If your business uses a different name, you may need to register it with your state government to get a business ID. [17] X Research source Registering a business name allows you to protect it. You can even trademark so no one else can take it. If you hire employees, you may also need to register your business with your government’s tax agency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure funding for your business.",
      "content": "Secure funding for your business. Starting a business requires an initial investment to pay for supplies, electricity, and whatever else you need to operate. While you can get a loan, you may not need to put yourself in debt if you plan on working for yourself. Find unique ways to deliver your goods or services without taking on extra expenses. [18] X Research source For example, you can start an online store from the comfort of your own home. You could visit customers to give them private music or fitness lessons. Getting a loan is useful if your business’ scope is large and costly, like if you wanted to set up a store, stock it, and hire employees."
    },
    {
      "title": "Network",
      "content": "Network to build an audience for what you sell. The first part of building a network is to please your initial customers. Ask them to spread the word by recommending you to their friends and by posting positive reviews online. Also, reach out to new potential customers and opportunities that allow you to build your business. [19] X Research source Networking can be a challenge. You may have to deal with some criticism and negativity before your business feels stable. Work with other businesses in your area. Make friends with their owners. A lot of businesses, for instance, recommend customers and advertise with each other."

      "content": "Build your income stream by improving your visibility. There are many ways you can grow your business, from physical merchandise to online ads. Always be aware of new opportunities, such as traveling to meet new customers. Build your online presence as well to ensure customers know your name. [20] X Research source Starting a website is a useful first step you can do for free. Also start social media accounts under your business name. You can order promotional cups and pens, for instance, or start an online store to sell products outside your area."
