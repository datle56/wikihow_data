Examining your A file is an important starting point for understanding how your past contacts with immigration may impact any future applications you file for an immigration benefit. [14] X Research source A FOIA Request can be sent to three different agencies of DHS: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). You will need to identify your purpose in filing a FOIA request in order to determine to which agency the request should be sent. Only file a FOIA request if the information you need is specifically related to immigration. If, for example, you need a record of your criminal convictions in the U.S., a FOIA will not be helpful. Instead, you should request a background check from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). If you wish to obtain the immigration record of a person other than yourself, you will need to secure that person's consent. If you request an immigration record for a non-consenting party, you will be provided with only limited information that is releasable to the public."

This is helpful if you have ever entered the U.S. fraudulently or been caught at the border when attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. The CBP record will provide you with a critical starting point for analyzing how your fraudulent or illegal entry into the U.S. will affect you if you apply for an immigration benefit or if you are fighting a removal case in immigration court. If you need information about applications you have filed with USCIS, send your FOIA request to USCIS. For example, if you applied for residence through marriage and were denied, your USCIS record would provide you with the reasons why your application was denied. If you have been detained by immigration authorities and wish to obtain a copy of the charging document in your case, send your FOIA request to ICE."
