      "content": "Show employees you appreciate them. “Creating a positive work environment where employees feel valued, respected, and supported is crucial,” Fermin says. If you have people working under you , he stresses the importance of “celebrat[ing] team successes and milestones, and tak[ing] time to recognize individual accomplishments.” Giving employees positive feedback (in addition to constructive criticism when necessary) and offering public and private praise after employees succeed are great ways to help them feel seen and as if their contributions to the company matter. You can also have a little fun with your employees and boost morale by handing out silly workplace awards , like the “Silent Assassin” (for the worker who doesn’t say a lot, but somehow manages to finish every task before anyone else) or the “Follow-Up Fairy” (for the worker who always checks in just when you need their help most)."

[9] X Research source Foster open communication by checking in with employees regularly, just to see how they’re doing or if they have anything they’d like to talk about.

      "title": "Listen to employees’ feedback.",
      "content": "Listen to employees’ feedback. “Your employees may have ideas or feedback on how to improve the workplace or company,” Fermin notes. “Take the time to listen to their input and consider their suggestions. This shows that you value their opinions and ideas and that you are committed to creating a positive work environment.” Consider having regular brainstorming sessions where employees can pitch ideas to improve the company or cool projects they’d like to work on. Inviting employees to pitch ideas (and, just as importantly, actually considering them and implementing some) will not only help them feel valued, but it’ll likely also help them feel a sense of ownership over the company and increased responsibility for its success."
