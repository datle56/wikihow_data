      "content": "Mix the powder with honey if you don’t like the bitter taste. Amla has tons of benefits, but it doesn’t exactly taste great. To avoid the sour bitterness, take 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of honey combined with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of amla powder. The sweetness of the honey disguises the amla. [9] X Research source This mixture is also known to help clear up congestion and cure colds. Use raw honey. Because it hasn’t been pasteurized, it has more nutritional benefits than regular honey."

      "content": "Blend amla powder into a smoothie filled with fruits and veggies. One of the best and easiest ways to disguise the tart taste of amla is to mix it into a smoothie. Start with your usual ingredients like bananas, almond milk, spinach, and ice, then add a dash of the powder before you blend it. Pour your smoothie into a bowl instead of a cup for a trendy smoothie bowl. Top it with more fruit, shaved coconut, or granola. The amla powder will give your smoothie a slight brown hue."
