      "title": "Figure out why you're attracted to him.",
      "content": "Figure out why you're attracted to him. Think about what made you fall for him in the first place. It could be his looks, personality, or a combination of the two. It could be that you're not even attracted to him and there are other reasons why you're pursuing him—like a vulnerable point in life. Understanding what attracted you to him is the first step to letting go of him. Finding the source of your feelings is also a step towards getting rid of feelings of guilt you may be experiencing."

      "content": "Reflect on your feelings. Take some time to reflect on the emotions you’re experiencing. Remember that nothing you’re feeling is wrong or bad.

      "content": "Accept the reality of it. You may still be tempted to be with him. Accept that you need to move on from him. He has a girlfriend, and it is not you. This is difficult to accept sometimes, but you won't be able to get over him until you do. Keep in mind that he may not have a girlfriend later down the road. You can’t be with him now, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t be with him in the future. Even still, move on in order to better your own life."

      "content": "Stop the flirtation. Your interest may be unrequited, but if he does flirt with you, put an end to it. You can simply stop flirting back, or you can tell him you no longer feel comfortable with this behavior. It’s okay if it feels difficult to stop the flirtation. Just realize that the flirtation will only end up hurting you, him, and his girlfriend in the end. Don’t become the other woman or mistress. You may get to be with him, but it is unfair to everyone involved. Even if he offers to leave his girlfriend for you, consider if this step would be worth it. Think about it this way: if he is willing to leave his girlfriend for you, what would he do to you when he finds \"the newest thing\"?"

      "content": "Don’t compare yourself to his girlfriend. At some point, you may find yourself wondering why he is with his girlfriend and not you. This is not a healthy way of thinking. Don’t look at her pictures and compare yourself to her. You are a unique and wonderful person on your own. It could be that you and the guy are just not meant to be. If his girlfriend is your friend, try to maintain the friendship without taking your feelings out on her."
