Instead, it may be easier to swap out a few ingredients for foods with a little extra protein.

Consuming whole foods is generally better for meeting all of your daily nutritional needs, and most people can get enough protein from their diet alone. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Instead of using protein supplements like bars or powders as meals, try to use them to get in those last few grams of protein during snack time. Mix protein powders into water or low-fat milk as a shake or add them to pancakes, oatmeal, fruit smoothies, or plain yogurt. Filling your diet with a variety of protein sources, vegetables, fruits, and grains can help you avoid nutrient deficiencies. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try to look for powders and bars with at least 12 g of protein per serving, 200 or fewer calories, 2 grams or less of saturated fat, 5 grams or less of sugar, and no trans fat (partially hydrogenated oils).

      "title": "Split your protein intake goal into at least 5 meals.",
      "content": "Split your protein intake goal into at least 5 meals. Most meals that are considered to be “high-protein” have around 20 to 25 grams on average, which means you’d likely have to split a goal of 120 g of protein into at least 5 meals throughout the day. For example, to eat a total of 120 g of protein a day you may split your protein intake into 4 larger meals with 24 g of protein each and 2 snacks with 12 g of protein each. Divide how much protein you’d like to consume each day by the number of meals, including snacks, to ensure that each meal has about 20-25 g of protein. If your body takes in more than 40 g of protein in a short period of time, the excess protein may go into fat storage or become waste instead."

Meal planning can help you make healthy nutritious meals and meet your 120 g protein goal consistently each week. [9] X Research source Consider eating intuitively—try eating an amount of protein, and if it feels good, keep at it. If it doesn’t, consider lowering or increasing your protein intake. Keep your caloric goal in mind when planning meals if your goal is to lose weight—each gram of protein is about 4 calories, which means eating 120 g of protein may add 480 calories a day to your diet."
