      "title": "Select your pencil properties.",
      "content": "Select your pencil properties. The default pencil setting is a black round 3 px stroke, unless you're working on a dark background. [1] X Research source To change the stroke: Locate the Stroke area of the Design panel, which is on the right side of Figma. Click the colored square to select a color. If you want to choose a color that's already on your canvas, click the eyedropper tool below the color picker, then click the desired color. By default, the opacity is set to 100%. To draw with a less opaque color, you can decrease the opacity by changing the percentage. The icon of three horizontal lines and the number \"3\" indicate the size of the line in pixels. Click this icon to increase or decrease the pixel size. You can change the shape of the pencil by choosing one of the three options— None for an undefined shape, Square , or Round . If you want to draw with a dashed line instead of a solid line, click the three dots to open the Advanced Stroke menu, then choose Dash or Custom , both of which allow you to specify the distance between dashes."

If you want to undo the last stroke, just press Cmd + Z (Mac) or Ctrl + Z (PC). To draw a straight line, just hold down the Shift key as you drag your cursor. Each stroke creates a new layer in the current frame. You can see all of your layers on the Layers panel, which is on the left side of the workspace."

      "content": "Create a curved line using Bezier handles. To make a line with a curve, click and hold a vector point, and then move the mouse cursor in the direction of the curve. Click again where you want that segment to end. You can then drag the Bezier handles, which are the blue narrow lines protruding from the curve, to reshape the curve in any direction. You can also turn a straight line into a curved line easily. Click the line you want to curve and press Return or Enter . Then, click the Bend tool (it looks like a curved line with circles on either end), hover the mouse cursor over the line you want to bend, and then drag it in the desired direction. Creating curved lines can be kind of challenging, so Figma recommends experimenting with this free game that can help you master the process: https://bezier.method.ac"
