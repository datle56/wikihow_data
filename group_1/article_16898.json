Each user's name is displayed to the right of their Bitmoji icon. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that it is not guaranteed you will find someone's real name. Every user creates their own display name, meaning they aren't obliged to put their full or real name. Additionally, users have the ability to not display their name altogether. Since the chat page shows your most recent interactions up top, it may be harder to find the name of someone that you haven't Snapchatted in a while.
