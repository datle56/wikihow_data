      "content": "Check if your partner gives you clues that your dynamic is temporary. Whenever you talk to or hang out with your current SO, you might get the creeping feeling that your connection can end at any moment. You might also have a lot of “fun” together but never have any serious talks about the future. In order to get a sense for whether you’re in a short-term situation until someone else shows up in your partner’s life, pay attention to details like: [1] X Research source The person you’re dating never defines the relationship you have. They call you up only when they have free time. They never make plans with you in advance. They keep the dynamic on the “down-low” and don’t tell anyone about it. They only hang out at your place and won’t go out in public with you. They’ve recently ended another relationship. They still talk about and idealize their ex. They’re rarely sensitive to your needs and mostly focus on their desires. They don’t express curiosity about you or your dreams. They focus purely on a physical connection."

      "title": "Compare the love life you’d be happy with to what you have now.",
      "content": "Compare the love life you’d be happy with to what you have now. Picture the connection you dream to have with someone, then describe it to yourself. Create a mantra that tells you you’re deserving of love and that celebrates values—such as supportiveness—that you believe are important. Finally, reflect on whether that vision matches what you see in your current romantic situation. To start to create a better future, make comments like: [2] X Research source “I am worthy of affection. I hope to be with someone who nourishes my heart. Right now, I feel that there’s some coldness and distance in my relationship.” “I am very lovable. I’m searching for a situation where I’m praised and appreciated. Currently, I feel a little overlooked.” “I’m an exciting, happy-go-lucky person. I’m seeking adventure and spontaneity. These days, I don’t do very much with the guy I’m seeing.”"

[3] X Expert Source Kate Dreyfus Holistic Love Coach & Intuitive Healer Expert Interview. 22 November 2021. Then, be direct about any behaviors that you won’t accept. When you recognize your own “non-negotiables,” or ideas that you feel strongly about, you’ll protect yourself. Before you talk to who you’re dating, prepare to speak up for yourself with words like: [4] X Trustworthy Source New York State Government Official website for the State of New York Go to source “I expect to have plenty of advance notice about dates. I find last-minute plans and cancellations disrespectful.” “I need a mental and emotional connection. I won’t accept a dynamic that’s purely physical. “I believe in strong communication and want a partner who’s curious about my opinions. I can’t stay in a relationship where we never talk.”"

      "title": "You’ll be able to see if you’re experiencing the TLC you need.",
      "content": "You’ll be able to see if you’re experiencing the TLC you need. Check in with yourself about the “love languages”—praise, quality time, gifts, acts of service, and touch—and identify which ones mean the most to you and that you hope you'll receive. Also, consider the ways that you express your own love. It’s important to know what fills you with joy so you can communicate about what may be missing in your connection. [5] X Research source It’s possible that your partner may not understand your love language. If that’s the case, it can explain why you haven’t felt fully cared for in the relationship. You might both receive and express love languages in different ways. For example, you may crave cuddles while your partner wants praise. You have a better shot at a strong relationship when these preferences are communicated. Even if this particular connection doesn’t work out, knowing your love language will strengthen other dynamics you enter."

      "content": "An honest and transparent talk lets you know where you stand. Reach out to your partner and chat about why they started to date you. Then, check in about their last relationship. If it ended recently—for example, just a couple months ago—then they may not be ready to dive deep with anyone. It’s best for you to know this ASAP to decide if the dynamic is worth investing in. [6] X Research source It’s also possible that your partner still hasn’t fully healed from their past relationship, even if it ended a while ago. If the person you’re seeing just wanted some “fun” after a heartbreak, then that’s a sign that they’re on the “rebound.”"

      "content": "Review behaviors that make you question the relationship. If there are behaviors that make you doubt how committed the person you’re seeing is, bring those issues up. These actions might be really dramatic, such as ghosting you multiple times. However, they can be more subtle, like talking about themselves a lot and never asking questions about you. Whatever the case is, share your perspective so they’re aware of how they act and the way it impacts you. [7] X Research source Bring up any ways that your partner has been inconsistent. For example, say something like, “When we first dated, we hung out twice a week, and now we only see each other once a month.” Be clear about behaviors that you don’t find normal in a healthy relationship. Make a comment like, “You openly flirt with a ton of people online, but you’ve never publicly mentioned me or taken a picture with me.” Talk about how these patterns affect you. Share an outlook like, “When you don’t acknowledge me, I feel like I’m insignificant in your life.”"

      "content": "Express if the person you’re seeing doesn’t seem serious or invested. Pay attention to how your partner discusses the relationship. Do they only speak about the present and just want to live in the “now”? Maybe they make a lot of noncommittal comments about how they just want to “go with the flow.” If they never even consider what the future might look like with you, then it’s a red flag that they’re treating your dynamic as a short-term one. [8] X Research source If they never put dates down on their calendar and “lock in” a day to see you, that’s already a hint that they don’t think about the future. When they can’t clearly define what kind of relationship you’re in and what it can develop into, they probably haven’t thought about how your connection could progress. Test your partner with a question like, “Where do you see us a year from now?” Their answer can tell you how casually they’re treating your relationship. For example, they might tell you they have “no clue.”"

      "content": "Discuss whether you’ve met your partner’s friends or family or if you’re “hidden.” When you ask to meet their inner circle, do they make up a lot of excuses? Maybe they say that they just can’t find the time to introduce you to everyone or they say that all their loved ones are busy. The individual you’re dating might also just change the topic. Tell them that you notice them dodge the discussion and that they’re not fully integrating you into their life. [9] X Research source Start off with a friendly tone and say something like, “So! When am I meeting your friends?” If your partner doesn’t give you a clear answer, ask why they haven’t included you in their social circle yet. Finally, explain why it’s important that you interact with the people they care about. Make a comment like, “I would feel like you’re proud of me if you went out in public with me.”"

Once you’ve reviewed the patterns that aren’t serving you in the connection, switch gears and open up a dialogue about the situation you do want. Then, you'll both have a chance to determine if your romantic visions are aligned. Make clear comments like these so your partner knows exactly what you expect: “I want to see the person I’m dating at least once a week. I also want quality time, like watching a movie together or going out to dinner.” [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

[11] X Research source Bring up qualities that excited you in the very beginning. For example, you can say, “When I first met you, I noticed you had the most amazing laugh and that you had a fantastic sense of humor.” Then, discuss why you thought the two of you had long-term potential. Share something like, “You seemed really open and warm, so I thought there’d be a lot of care and affection in our relationship.” Ask your partner what they felt ready for. Pose a question like, “At first, you were so enthusiastic and down to hang out. What was going through your head when you met me?”"

Think about your past as well as any recent situations and how either may have had a negative effect on your self-image. Maybe you had a caregiver that was hardly present in your life or you’ve had multiple relationships where you didn’t get your needs met. After you’ve considered why you may feel down on yourself and accept less, reach out to your support network and share that you’d benefit from some extra kindness. [12] X Research source A therapist can help you look into your past so you can better understand why you are drawn to certain relationship styles. Your friends and a mental health professional can remind you of your worth and what you deserve so you can pursue people who fully cherish you."

Tell your partner when you’re emotionally and physically tired. For example, say, “I always drive to you. It’s really wearing me out. I need the person I’m dating to come see me as often as I travel to them.” Reader Poll: We asked 707 wikiHow readers about what led them to end a tricky romantic relationship, and 63% agreed that when it started to make them feel anxious or confused, that was the final straw.

Whether they change their act or you have to part ways, you’ll finally end a placeholder relationship. [17] X Research source Tell them what you’ve learned and why you’re empowered if you leave.
