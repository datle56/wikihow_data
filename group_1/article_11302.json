      "title": "Grab a pair of heavy-duty kitchen or craft scissors.",
      "content": "Grab a pair of heavy-duty kitchen or craft scissors. Standard scissors with a flat blade won’t easily cut through a popsicle stick. However, you can use any pair of serrated scissors that are designed for the kitchen. Large pairs of craft scissors will work as well. [1] X Research source This method will leave a rough edge behind wherever you cut."

      "title": "Open your scissors and hold the popsicle stick against the blades.",
      "content": "Open your scissors and hold the popsicle stick against the blades. Put your thumb and index finger in the finger holes. Hold the popsicle stick that you want to cut in your nondominant hand. With your blades opened all the way, place the section that you want to cut as close to your handle as possible so that it sits perpendicular at the junction where the 2 blades meet. [2] X Research source You’ll need special scissors if you’re left-handed."

      "title": "Close the finger holes quickly and firmly to cut the stick.",
      "content": "Close the finger holes quickly and firmly to cut the stick. With your other fingers at a safe distance, bring your thumb and index finger together to start closing the blades. Close your scissor blades all the way through the popsicle stick until the two blades snap together. The harder you close your scissors, the less likely you are to fray the edge.

      "title": "Inspect your edge and remove any splinters.",
      "content": "Inspect your edge and remove any splinters. You don’t want random pieces of wood falling off of your popsicle stick. After you’ve cut it, hold it up to your eye and look for splinters. If there are any, carefully pinch them between your thumb and index finger and pull them off. You can use sandpaper to smooth out rough edges by gently rubbing it on the edge where you cut your popsicle stick. Any grit sandpaper will work."

      "title": "Find a pair of wire cutters with a flat blade bigger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
      "content": "Find a pair of wire cutters with a flat blade bigger than 1 inch (2.5 cm). You are only going to use the wire cutters to brace the popsicle stick in place when you snap it, so the blades don’t have to be sharp. Wire cutters create a lot of even pressure between their blades when you close the handles. This means that they are unlikely to cause a splinter or uneven edge where you snap the popsicle stick. You can use a pencil to draw a guide line where you want to cut the popsicle stick. This will help you keep your wire cutters positioned correctly when you twist your wrist to make your cut."

    {
      "title": "Hold your wire cutters loosely while you line them up on the stick.",
      "content": "Hold your wire cutters loosely while you line them up on the stick. Wrap your dominant thumb over the top handle of the wire cutters and put your other fingers around the bottom handle. Hold your hands steady and put the popsicle stick in the wire cutter’s jaws. Slide your popsicle stick in the tool’s jaws to find the spot that you want to cut it."

    {
      "title": "Tighten your grip and hold the popsicle stick in place.",
      "content": "Tighten your grip and hold the popsicle stick in place. You don’t need to squeeze very hard to get the blades to tighten around your popsicle stick. Don’t push down hard, or you’ll risk snapping the stick. Even though they tend to have smaller blades than scissors or snips, wire cutters pack a punch when you squeeze the handles. Keep your free hand clear of the blades while you position your popsicle stick."

    {
      "title": "Wiggle your wire cutters back and forth while keeping them closed.",
      "content": "Wiggle your wire cutters back and forth while keeping them closed. With your free hand, hold the longest section of your popsicle stick in place by wrapping your fingers around it and staying still. Then, move your wire cutters back and forth in order to loosen the wood at the junction where you’re holding them. Keep your grip at the same level of pressure while you move your wire cutters."
    },
    {
      "title": "Snap the wood off by twisting the wire cutters.",
      "content": "Snap the wood off by twisting the wire cutters. Once you hear a few creaks from the wood loosening, you can snap the stick by rotating the wire cutters with your wrist. Turn your wrist sharply to the left and right without moving your arm. The popsicle stick will snap at the junction where you held it with the wire cutters."

      "title": "Choose your snips based on how you want to cut.",
      "content": "Choose your snips based on how you want to cut. Snips are color coded based on the direction that they’re designed to cut. Green snips make cuts to the right, red snips make cuts to the left, and yellow snips cut straight lines. Choose your snips based on whether you’re trying to cut at an angle or make a straight cut. [4] X Research source The advantage of using snips is that they’re going to cut quickly. They may make your popsicle stick slide as you cut it though, so keep a firm grip while cutting."

      "title": "Open your grip and position your cut.",
      "content": "Open your grip and position your cut. Hold the popsicle stick in your nondominant hand and loosen your grip on the snips to open the blades. Position your popsicle stick between the blades wherever you want to cut it and hold it steady. [5] X Research source Keep your free hand clear from the blades as you position your stick."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze the handles to close the blades and make your cut.",
      "content": "Squeeze the handles to close the blades and make your cut. You don’t need to squeeze hard; snips are designed to cut sheet metal and generate a lot of cutting power automatically. As you squeeze, keep the popsicle stick still so that your cut stays consistent. Tighten your grip until you hear a snap and then release the handles. [6] X Research source"
