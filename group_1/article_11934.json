You know right from wrong, you know what your goal is. You know that to make a friendship you need to be interesting, entertaining and engaging."

For example, \"I don't mean to harm people, however, I struggle with self-control and may forget to act morally.\" Some people may not feel comfortable getting close to you, and that's okay.
