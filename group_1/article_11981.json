      "content": "See your gynecologist if you have monthly cramping but no period. Imperforate hymens are often diagnosed in newborn babies, but if not you might not notice a problem until you get your first period. If you have an imperforate hymen you will not have a normal period because the hymen is blocking the blood from coming out of the vagina. You will still have menstrual cramps, though, so if you have abdominal pain every month but no period you should get checked. You might also have other symptoms like back pain, difficulty urinating, or constipation. Some girls will be able to feel a hard mass in the lower abdomen below the belly button, which is the menstrual blood stuck in the uterus.

The average age for first periods in the United States, for example, is 12 to 13 years old.

Two big things that indicate puberty are needing your first real bra and getting armpit and/or pubic hair. At this point you will probably start your period within 3 to 6 months if you haven’t already. If you don’t get your period within two years of these changes, see your doctor.

The doctor will assess your vagina by looking and feeling. If it looks like you have an imperforate hymen, your doctor might do a test called a pelvic ultrasound to make sure there aren't any other problems causing your symptoms.

Your surgeon will cut a very small hole in your hymen to replicate the regular opening for the vagina, and he or she will take out any old period blood that has been stuck in the uterus. [11] X Research source It’s a safe and easy procedure and girls recover from the surgery within a few days."

If not, dilators are used to keep the incision open after the procedure. A dilator is a small tampon-like object that you place in the vagina for about 15 minutes every day while you're recovering.

You doctor might also give you a jelly with pain-relieving lidocaine in it. You can apply this lightly to the area of your vagina if you’re sore, and a few minutes before you have to pee. [14] X Research source It’s okay to take a bath while recovering. It might feel soothing and will help keep the area clean. Use a hair dryer on the cool setting to dry the sore area and avoid the scratchiness of a towel. After surgery, your doctor may also prescribe a topical estrogen cream for you to use to help the area heal and prevent scar tissue from forming."

While procedures that make only a small cut in the hymen to “preserve virginity” may exist, the opening often closes up again causing unnecessary pain and the need to repeat the procedure.

Talking to friends and family can help relieve stress about the condition or the surgery. You can always ask loved ones to go to the doctor with you to better understand your condition. Remember that having an imperforate hymen wasn't caused by anything you did or your mom did during pregnancy. It just happens, and isn't that uncommon!"
