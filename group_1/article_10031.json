      "content": "Choose boneless salmon filets to cook for your dog. Pick the freshest fish available since it will be the healthiest for your dog. If you can’t find any boneless filets, be sure to pick out all of the bones before cooking the salmon. If your dog swallows fish bones, they could potentially harm your pup’s digestive system.

      "content": "Skip the seasonings and oil. Spices like salt and pepper can irritate your pup’s stomach, so save them for filets you cook for yourself. Since oils add more fat to the salmon, avoid using them while you’re cooking so the meat isn’t too greasy for your dog.

      "content": "Cook the salmon until the meat reaches 145 °F (63 °C). Any cooking method works to prepare the salmon as long as it reaches the proper temperature. Use your stove or oven to heat the fish until the meat looks opaque. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of your salmon at its thickest point to see if it’s ready to serve to your pup. [3] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source Bake your salmon in an oven at 350 °F (177 °C) for about 20 minutes. Sear salmon in a pan over high heat for about 3–4 minutes per side. Poach your salmon in a pot of simmering water for about 10 minutes to fully cook it through. Raw salmon may contain bacteria that causes loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, or rapid weight loss, so always cook the fish fully before serving it to your dog."

      "content": "Consult with a vet to determine how much salmon to give your dog. The amount of salmon you give your dog really depends on their breed, size, and activity level, so portions may vary. Reach out to your vet and let them know that you want to give your pup salmon as a meal or treat. The vet’s office will be able to recommend specifically how much food to give your dog so they get enough to eat without growing overweight.

If you don’t have rice, use quinoa as a substitute. Stir a dog nutrient powder into the food to help add other helpful nutrients that are found in store-bought dog foods."
