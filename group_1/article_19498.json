[1] X Research source The term “June bug” is a general term used to describe over 100 different species of beetles that become abundant during the months of May and June. [2] X Research source The surfaces of their bodies can be green, red, or brown. The undersides of their bodies are often a shiny, metallic green or gold, and they have wings that are protected beneath their hard shell."

If you look closely, you’ll see they move around by crawling on their backs rather than using their small legs.

      "title": "The life cycle of a June bug allows them to live up to 3 years.",
      "content": "The life cycle of a June bug allows them to live up to 3 years. In late May and early June is when you’ll notice adult male and female June bugs emerging from the soil to mate. The females will then burrow deep into the soil to lay their eggs. When June bug eggs hatch, the white grubs will feed on nearby plant roots. For the next two years, the grubs will grow, eat more, and become more destructive. During the late summer/fall of their third year, they will begin to “pupate” in the soil, or begin the process of transforming from a larva to a mature beetle. In the spring the cycle begins again as they emerge as adults to find a mate. [5] X Research source"

Mix 10-20 drops of essential oils in a spray bottle full of water or vinegar to make a potent bug repellent. Shake well as oil and water tend to separate, then spray infested areas outdoors. After spraying the essential oils outside, keep pets away from the sprayed area for a couple of days, as some oils can be toxic to animals.

There are usually two types of beetle traps – the first uses sex pheromones and the second uses a floral scent to lure the bugs. In general, pheromone baited traps are more efficient and will catch more June bugs. [9] X Research source If you’re looking for a way to make your own beetle traps, you can easily make one by combining 1 packet of yeast, 1 cup (240 mL) of molasses, and 2 cups (470 mL) of water, or by simply filling a jar with vegetable oil. [10] X Research source Place your homemade bug trap by your June bug-infested spot. The bugs will be attracted to the jar and once they fall in, will become stuck. Check on the trap every 2-3 days and add new bait. [11] X Research source"

Once you’ve picked them up, place them in a bucket filled with soapy water to drown them before disposing of them. [12] X Research source Don’t worry about June bugs being hard to catch!

[13] X Research source They’re a natural form of pest control that is safe for the environment, humans and animals. [14] X Research source Just follow the specific instructions on the back of the bag to mix the nematodes in water and use a sprayer, hose end sprayer or watering can to drench infested garden areas. [15] X Research source You only need about 20,000 beneficial nematodes to treat 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ), however they are so small that they’re usually packaged in bags of 5 million (enough to treat 1,500 square feet (140 m 2 )). It’s best to buy beneficial nematodes from your local home and garden store. Since they’re alive, shipping can stress them out and cause them to die."

      "content": "Spread diatomaceous earth to get rid of adult June bugs. Diatomaceous earth is fossilized remains of algae, and when it’s spread on the ground it has small, sharp edges which are deadly to insects, but harmless to humans. Scatter the dry diatomaceous earth in outdoor areas where you’ve spotted the June bugs. Spray the wet mixture with a hose sprayer. For areas that can’t be reached by dry diatomaceous earth, mix at a ratio of 4 tablespoons (57 grams) of diatomaceous earth and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. HARRIS’ diatomaceous earth is a great choice as it’s food grade, which is it’s most safe and gentle form."

Additionally, creating messy, areas with logs, vegetation or leaves will attract June bug predators like frogs and toads. June bugs are food for many animals and you can easily reduce the number of June bugs in your garden and lawn by creating an environment where June bug predators can thrive. [16] X Research source"

Use curative insecticides as an easy way to get rid of large numbers of grubs. Apply during the evening when they come to the surface to avoid the insecticide not reaching them deep in the soil. [17] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source However, be aware that this can lead to dead, smelly grubs showing up on the surface of your lawn. Simply don a pair of gloves and dispose of the dead grubs in a trash bag. Before applying insecticides, mow your lawn to shake out wildlife. You want to avoid spraying bees or other pollinators that are essential to your garden’s health. It’s also important to ensure there are no bunny holes, frogs or other small animals in your grass before using insecticides. If you’re worried about your garden or lawn animals’ health, St. Gabriel Organic Milky Spore insecticide is safe for pets, plants, and humans. All you have to do is sprinkle the powder insecticide over your lawn. The grubs will eat the insecticide, die, decompose, and spread more of the insecticide. This leads to an almost 10-year insecticide effectiveness."
