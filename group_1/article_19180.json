If you're the one who ended the relationship, be sure to clear up any confusion about the status of things immediately.

      "content": "Try not to run into him. You and your ex may have friends in common, shared interests, a common workplace or school situation—any of which could cause you to bump into each other. Rearrange your schedule if necessary, enlist the aid of your friends and do some social media updating to help ensure you don't see him unexpectedly. Update your Facebook page. Change your relationship status and \"unfriend\" your ex. Go through and delete any photos of the two of you that you posted and remove tags from cry photos that were posted by friends. If your friends are firmly on your side in this break-up, ask them to \"unfriend\" your ex as well. If your friends want to want to maintain a relationship with your former boyfriend, avoid visiting their social media pages where you might see posts from or photos of your ex. Change your routine. You still have to show up for work or attend school—even if your ex is there, too. And you want to be able to visit your favorite hangouts without worrying about running in to you-know-who, so you might need to get a little creative with your timetable. Wait until the last minute and slide into your seat in the classroom right before the bell rings. That way, you won't risk having an unwanted conversation with your ex. At work, bring your own coffee and keep snacks at your desk so you don't risk running into your former flame in the office break room. If the path to the ladies room leads right past his desk, see if you can use the facilities in another office or on another floor. If you fear an encounter at the copier, save your Xeroxing for the end of the day or enlist a sympathetic co-worker to make copies for you. If you frequent the same dry cleaners, bar, library or other location as your ex-boyfriend, try going on a different day than usual or stopping in a little earlier or later than your regular time to avoid seeing him.

Discard photos, letters he sent and gifts he gave you. If you're not sure that you're ready to let it go, stash it all in a box and out of sight. If you have emails your ex sent you, delete them. If you think there might be a correspondence or two you want to save, create a folder, put all emails inside and plan to review them later. If you have a piece of jewelry that may have sentimental value for your ex, ask him if he'd like to have it back. If not, then do with it as you see fit."

[3] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. Everyone grieves differently, but grief has some common elements. The five stages of grief introduced by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in 1969 have become a universal guideline for what someone experiencing a loss can expect to go through: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. You won't necessarily go through all of these stages in your journey toward healing and even if you do, you may not go through them in order. Still, it's good to know what you might expect and understand that what you're feeling is perfectly normal. Depending on the circumstances of your breakup, you may also feel sadness, loneliness, regret, anxiety, guilt, insecurity or a variety of other negative emotions. You may also experience physical symptoms of grief. Headaches, nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, weight gain, aches, pains and fatigue are common for someone going through a breakup."

Rather than fuming about what you should have said and what you'd say now if you ran into your ex, commit those thoughts and feelings to paper. Don't worry about being terribly coherent, and good grammar and spelling certainly don't count here. The idea is to get the anger, sadness, resentment and whatever other emotions out of your system and onto paper."

If you see someone you're attracted to, make eye contact and smile. Remember, a cup of coffee or a conversation isn't a commitment. If you do meet someone you like, stay away from giving them the lowdown on your breakup and a list of your ex's faults and failings. A potential new guy doesn't want to hear about the old guy so soon and definitely not in negative terms. Talking bad about your ex is a turn-off."
