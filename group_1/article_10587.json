      "content": "Open the spreadsheet program of your choice. To create a spreadsheet, you will need to use a spreadsheet program. Many different programs are available for free online if you don't already have a program like Microsoft Excel or Numbers installed on your computer. For example, Google Drive, Apache OpenOffice, Zoho Sheet, and Excel Online are just a few of the many free options available to you. [1] X Research source Once you've found a program to use, install it and open the program up to a blank sheet in a new workbook (a collection of sheets)."

Go to the next cell to the right, C1, and write in \"Due Date.\" This column will record due dates of various bills or payments, where necessary. Go another cell to the right, to D1, and write in \"Paid?\" or something similar. This is an optional column that allows you to track whether or not the bills due at the dates in the C column have been paid."

      "content": "Create cells for recording monthly income. Start in cell A2 by typing in \"Income.\" This simply serves as a heading for the rest of your income items. Then, go to the next cell down, A3, and type \"Net Pay.\" Then, type \"Other Income\" in the next cell down, A4. For most people, this will be all the income line items you will need. However, if you receive a substantial amount of income from another source (investment income, royalty income, etc.), you may want to include additional line items for those types of income."

      "title": "Make a cell that calculates total monthly income.",
      "content": "Make a cell that calculates total monthly income. When you've created cells for all of your types of income, you'll need one that totals up your monthly income. Create this cell in the next available cell underneath your last income line items (so, if you only have \"Net Pay\" and \"Other Income,\" this will be cell A5). Write \"Total Income\" in this cell. In the cell directly to the right of that cell (B5 in the example), you need to create a formula to calculate total income. This formula is the SUM formula. Start by typing \"=SUM(\" in that cell. Then, click the cell to the right of \"Net Pay\" and drag down to the cell to right of your last income line item cell. In the example, this would be cells B3 to B4. Alternately, you can type in the cell range by typing the first and last cells, separated by a colon, into the SUM function. The whole formula should look something like this: =SUM(B3:B4). [2] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source The SUM function in excel adds up the value contained within the specific cells, which can either be input individually (B2, B3, B4) or in a range (B2:B4). Excel has many other functions that can be used to simplify calculations. If you receive an error message when entering the formula, this means that you have made an error in writing your formula. Recheck it to make sure that it matches the formula above."

      "title": "Fill in expense titles.",
      "content": "Fill in expense titles. Next, you need to input expense in the same way that you put in income. Odds are that there will be considerably more individual line item expenses than there are income items. Because of this, it's easiest to split your expenses up into general categories. Start by skipping a line after your \"Total Income\" cell in column A and write in \"Expenses.\" In the next cell down, write in \"Housing.\" This is the largest expense for most people, so create space for this category of expenses first. In the cells below this one, fill in different housing expenses that you have each month, like mortgage or rent payments, utilities, and insurance, using one cell for each expense. Skip a line after this category and move on to Food, following the same pattern. Here are some ideas for expense line items and categories, in case you miss any: Housing: mortgage or rent; Utilities (power, gas, water); Internet, cable, satellite; Insurance; Other (taxes, HELOC payments, etc.) Food: Groceries; Eating out; Other food expenses. Transportation: Car loan payments; car insurance; car maintenance; public transit costs; gas; parking/tolls; Other transportation expenses. Health: Health Insurance; Co-pays; Medicine; Other health expenses. Personal/Family Expenses; Money sent to family; Child support; Daycare; Clothing/Shoes; Laundry; Charitable giving; Entertainment; Other personal expenses. Financing expenses: Credit card fees; check cashing fees; Bank fees; Other fees. Other: School loans; School expenses; Credit card payments; money put into savings; Miscellaneous."

Just like you did for income, create a new cell underneath the last expense line item and write in \"Total Expenses.\" In the cell directly to the right of this one, input your sum formula. Again, you just need to type \"=SUM(\" and then click and drag down from the cell to the right of your first expense line item and drag down to the one to the right of your last. It doesn't matter if you've left blank spaces anywhere, as the program will ignore them. For example, your sum equation here may look like this: =SUM(B9:B30). Make sure to always close the parentheses in your equation by adding a closing parenthesis mark."

Skip another line under your cell in column A where you wrote \"Total Expenses\" and write in \"Cash Balance.\" This cell will be used to calculate the difference between your income and expenses. In the cell directly to the right of this one, you need to enter the formula to find the difference between those two values. Start by typing \"=\" and then click on the cell in column B that contains your total income formula. Then type a \"-\" and click on the cell in column B that contains your total expense formula. This cell will now calculate the difference between the two. For example, your equation might look something like \"=B5-B31\". Note that no parentheses are required for this equation."

For example, you may think nothing of spending $8 or $10 each day on lunch, but over a month this adds up to several hundred dollars. In this case, you could consider packing a lunch or seeking cheaper options. Look for cases like this where you could reduce your spending, if necessary."
