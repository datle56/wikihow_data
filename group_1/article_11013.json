      "content": "Visionaries Visionaries are highly autonomous workers, meaning they can make decisions based on logic. They understand the details and rules behind specific tasks, but that doesn't mean they follow them. They're here to pave a path to exceed company goals and accomplish the impossible. [1] X Research source Visionaries may also be categorized as \"achievers\" due to their ambitious and determined nature. Despite the overlap, being an achiever can be a separate personality type."

      "content": "Researchers Researchers are the complete opposite of visionaries, as they tend to follow company rules and guidelines. They're detail-oriented individuals who take pride in ensuring their work is always well-executed and polished. They're the people you go to when you're stuck on a problem, but they're not always the most sociable people in the workplace. [2] X Research source Researchers may also fall under the \"Analysts\" personality type as they share an appreciation for logic and structure. They're also considered the go-to people within the workplace. However, they primarily focus on numbers and data."

      "content": "A culture index survey identifies 4 key areas of employee engagement. The data studies employee motivation, thinking, behavior, and interaction through a series of yes or no questions, true or false statements, or a numbered scale. Typically, these surveys will feature short questions about personal work style, team dynamics, and approaches to problem-solving. [9] X Research source For example: For insight into employee engagement, a survey may ask, \"How likely are you to recommend this job to another friend?\" This could be ranked on a scale from 0 (not likely) to 5 (definitely). Culture index surveys are designed to be completed in under ten minutes to keep workers' interest."

      "content": "Culture index results provide insight into employee engagement. Instead of speculating where a business is struggling, the data from a culture index survey gives employers the ability to make actionable changes. [10] X Research source It gives them concrete information on where workers may lack motivation or feel unsatisfied with their jobs so they can improve teams and effectively boost morale. For example, if more employees rank high in social-ability in an independent working atmosphere, an employer could use this information to create more team-building events within the company. Similarly, when used during the hiring process, candidates may not be the right fit if they rank low in autonomy for a leadership role."

It allows them to voice their opinions, ideas, and concerns based on what’s happening within the company. Additionally, seeing their feedback used to make positive internal changes can make them feel heard, creating a positive work environment for all. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "According to the index, the test is valid and reliable. All of the items on the culture index were statistically analyzed to ensure they’re valid, meaning that they measure the categories they’re supposed to, like autonomy. Previous survey respondents also retook the test to ensure it’s reliable, which means that the test provides consistent results. However, it’s unclear whether the test is evidence-based. There’s little research supporting the creation of the test and its reported benefits."
