      "title": "Comfort",
      "content": "Comfort Both men and women sit cross-legged because it's a comfortable position for our bodies. Sitting cross-legged reduces muscle fatigue in the torso and shifts the weight off soft tissues. It also helps stabilize the lower extremities, such as your legs, ankles, and feet. [1] X Research source Comfortable cross-legged positions you can try include criss-cross applesauce, crossing one foot underneath your opposing thigh or your buttocks, or crossing one leg over the other at the knees."

    {
      "title": "Confidence",
      "content": "Confidence Men and women adopt cross-legged positions to project confidence. Men, for example, tend to opt for the Figure 4 pose in which they prop their ankle on top of the opposing knee or thigh. [2] X Research source Women typically cross at the knees and point their top foot outward instead of tucking it demurely back."

    {
      "title": "Elegance",
      "content": "Elegance Women cross their legs at the ankles to demonstrate elegance and poise. This is a favored position of the female members of the royal family in England such as Princess Kate Middleton and Duchess Meghan Markle. [3] X Research source Another elegant pose is crossing the legs and then tucking them both slanted back toward your chair legs instead of pointing the feet outward."

      "title": "Relaxation",
      "content": "Relaxation When a man or woman crosses their legs, it may be a sign they feel relaxed and comfortable wherever they're sitting and whomever they're with. When they uncross, they may be getting ready to leave – or they could simply be shifting to stretch their legs. Many of the meanings behind crossing your legs can change based on the context of the situation. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Modesty",
      "content": "Modesty Women often cross their legs at the knees or the ankle to bring their thighs together and maintain modesty in a mini-skirt or a short dress. Similarly, men may cross their legs at the knees to appear less dominant and more relaxed. [5] X Research source Not as many men cross their legs at the knees, however, since this position can put uncomfortable pressure on their crotch area."

      "title": "Standing with your legs crossed can help relieve tired legs and feet.",
      "content": "Standing with your legs crossed can help relieve tired legs and feet. If you've been standing for a long time, you may find yourself crossing one foot in front of the other and then raising your back foot so only the toes rest on the ground. This move helps shift your weight around so you can reduce the pressure on each leg (at least temporarily) without sitting down."

      "title": "Crossing the legs while standing can enhance a female figure.",
      "content": "Crossing the legs while standing can enhance a female figure. Models and influencers tend to use this pose often because it lends them a demure, diminutive look, which can enhance the outfit they're wearing. It also makes their legs look half as wide as they are in real life and gives the impression of a slimmer silhouette. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Someone crossing their legs toward you may mean that they like you.",
      "content": "Someone crossing their legs toward you may mean that they like you. If you're in a room with several people and someone sitting cross-legged is pointing their knee or foot at you, it may not be a coincidence. They may be positioning themselves to look at you full-on and command your complete attention, or so they can brush your foot with theirs. This posture could portray interest of any kind—whether romantic, platonic, or professional. [7] X Research source They could also just be sitting that way by accident, or they could be pointing their foot at you to stretch their toes. The way someone sits doesn't always have a deeper meaning or a complex thought process behind it."

      "title": "Many people think women are attractive when they cross at the knee.",
      "content": "Many people think women are attractive when they cross at the knee. This pose shows off their legs and lets them point their top foot outward if they want or tuck it back, both of which can be extremely alluring. A great example of an attractive leg cross by a woman is the infamous interrogation scene in Basic Instinct (1992) starring Sharon Stone."

    {
      "title": "Some people find men attractive in specific crossed-leg positions.",
      "content": "Some people find men attractive in specific crossed-leg positions. For example, if they sit with one leg crossed over another or adopt the Figure 4 pose, many find that extremely sexy. A big part of the allure is their attitude. If they appear nervous or even overly confident, they may kill the vibe. Men may want to avoid crossing at their ankles, as that position hints that you have something to hide – not attractive at all! [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Sitting cross-legged can have some negative effects, such as joint pain.",
      "content": "Sitting cross-legged can have some negative effects, such as joint pain. Frequently sitting with your legs crossed can lead to a number of health issues, such as circulatory issues, poor posture and back pain, nerve compression, and joint pain. Sitting cross-legged can inhibit your blood from circulating properly, which may contribute to vein inflammation and a higher blood pressure. Similarly, sitting cross-legged can compress nerves in a way that causes tingling, or it can lead to long-term misalignment in your pelvis and spine. [9] X Research source Some studies have shown that sitting with your legs crossed can have positive health benefits, including a reduction in muscle fatigue and improved joint stability. However, these studies were conducted on otherwise healthy patients, and the hip flexion and spinal column rotation required for the sitting position was still considered unfavorable compared to erect sitting.
