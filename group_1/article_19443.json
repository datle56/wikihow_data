      "content": "Apply an over-the-counter antifungal cream 1-2 times daily. The most effective at-home treatment for foot fungus is an over-the-counter antifungal cream. Go to the pharmacy and look for creams containing miconazole, clotrimazole, terbinafine, or tolnaftate, which are usually the most effective. Rub the cream on the rash and surrounding skin 1-2 times per day, according to the product instructions. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source It’s best to apply the cream right after washing your feet so it can stay on for as long as possible. You could also use antifungal sprays or powders, but they usually don’t cover the rash as well as creams and ointments.

      "content": "Trim your nails before applying the cream for nail fungus. Regular OTC antifungal cream can also work for nail fungus, but it's more difficult for the cream to reach underneath your nails. If you have nail fungus, trimming your nails can help relieve pain and help the cream reach the rash better. Wet your nails to soften them and trim them back with a nail clipper. Then apply the cream normally. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Creams and sprays are overall less effective for nail fungus because the cream can’t reach underneath the nail. You’ll probably need oral medication for nail infections. Cover the skin around your nail as well so the rash doesn’t spread further. Clean the nail clipper when you’re done and don’t share it with anyone else. This could spread the rash."

      "content": "Continue applying the cream for 2 weeks after the rash disappears. OTC creams usually clear the rash within 1-2 weeks, but don’t stop applying the cream when the rash improves.

      "content": "Visit a podiatrist for prescription cream if the rash doesn’t go away. If you’ve been using OTC treatments for 2 weeks and the rash hasn’t improved, then don't worry. You probably just need a stronger medication. Make an appointment with a podiatrist for an exam. They will probably prescribe a prescription-strength cream. Apply the cream exactly as the doctor tells you to so the rash clears up. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The instructions for prescription-strength creams are usually very similar to OTC ones.

      "content": "Take oral antifungal medication if the rash doesn’t respond to cream. If the fungus doesn’t respond to topical treatments, or if it’s under your nail, you might need an oral medication instead of cream. You usually have to take these medications for 6-12 weeks to make sure the infection is all cleared. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking the medication correctly. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some oral antifungal medications are terbinafine (Lamisil) and itraconazole (Sporanox). The type that your doctor prescribes depends on the type of infection you have. Oral antifungals could cause liver problems, so your doctor may order periodic blood tests to make sure the levels in your system are correct. They may not recommend oral medication if you have any type of liver disease or damage."
