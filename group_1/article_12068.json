      "title": "Know the difference between alcohol abuse and addiction.",
      "content": "Know the difference between alcohol abuse and addiction. While abuse can lead to addiction they are still separate things. Alcohol abuse means that a person uses alcohol more than they should, either through binge drinking or drinking too often. Addiction to alcohol means that a person's body is physically dependent on alcohol, so if they don't drink they will experience withdrawal. Look for the following signs of chemical dependence and addiction in your parent: Higher tolerance (requiring more alcohol to feel the effect) Inability to follow through with responsibilities and obligations Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when they don't drink Secretive about drinking or hides alcohol Inability to quit drinking Frequent binge drinking Physical injury or illness Blackouts Impulsive behavior Inability to cope with stressors Spending more time with others who drink while avoiding those who don't Dismissive when others talk about their drinking Legal consequences from drinking, such as a DUI"

      "content": "Recognize the immediate effects of alcohol. Alcohol affects the brain and can lead to blackouts and memory loss. Avoid arguing with your parent if they are drunk as this can make situations frustrating. Your parent may say things they wouldn't normally say and upset you, then later not remember saying anything. [1] X Research source If you're upset with your parent while they are drunk, remove yourself from the situation. Say, “Let's not discuss this now. I'm going to leave and we can talk tomorrow.”"

      "title": "Accept that alcohol can cause family tensions.",
      "content": "Accept that alcohol can cause family tensions. The more heavily your parent drinks, the higher the risk of problems with the family. Additionally, older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, which may explain why situations may escalate as your parent ages. [2] X Research source As long as your parent continues to drink, there will likely be family tensions. It's difficult to accept difficult family situations. However, it's impossible for you to change your parent's behavior. Do what you can to ease tensions by being a good listener, finding negotiations, and respecting your family members.

      "title": "Avoid blame shifting.",
      "content": "Avoid blame shifting. Some alcoholics believe that alcoholism is a disease that cannot be cured, but it can with proper treatment and a committed individual. They may claim that they have no control, but they do still have choices. Don't allow your parent to manipulate you by claiming they're just sick or by blaming you for relapses. People who suffer from addiction may hide behind illness to control the behavior of those who want to help them. This enables them to continue doing what they've been doing."

      "content": "Create respectful boundaries with your parent. You may want your parent to be a part of your life and your children's lives, yet not want to place yourself in an unsafe or uncomfortable situation. Create some boundaries for yourself and your family and discuss them with your parent.

If you feel like your parent jeopardizes your children's safety, say that they are not allowed to babysit for the children or to drink in your home under any circumstance.

If your parent tends to drink at a certain time of day, avoid visits or phone calls after a certain time."

      "content": "Put away your sense of responsibility. You may want to take care of your parent or take away their means of consuming alcohol.
