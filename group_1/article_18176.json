      "content": "Slide on a pair of welding gloves, insulated shoes, and a face mask. You’re working with some heavy-duty electricity when you fractal burn wood, so it‘s important to protect yourself ahead of time. Grab a pair of welding gloves, along with a pair of insulating shoes, which will absorb electrical shock. [1] X Research source Slip on a face mask or respirator, as well—fractal burning creates small puffs of smoke, which you definitely don’t want to breathe in. [2] X Research source Boots or shoes made with pure rubber can keep you safe from electrical shock. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your Lichtenberg figure wood burner near your work surface and plug it in. Your Lichtenberg wood burner essentially looks like a metal box with 2 electrical probes attached. Set this box near your work station, and arrange both probes upright in their respective slots. Place the foot pedal on the floor, and plug in the power cord. [4] X Research source Don’t use a regular electrical transformer for this project—this is extremely dangerous, and you can end up getting seriously hurt.

      "content": "Lay a piece of unblemished wood on your work surface. You can experiment with different types of wood, like cherry, maple, walnut, or mahogany. Double- and triple-check that the wood is flat and steady on the surface, so it doesn’t shift while you’re burning it. [6] X Research source Since fractal burning designs are essentially scorch marks, they tend to show up better on lighter woods. Some artisans find that fine grain fiber board and plywood work well for this craft. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix 2 tbsp (29 g) of baking soda into 1 US qt (0.95 L) of water. Fill a bowl or container with tap water and set it near your work station. Stir in 2 spoonfuls of baking soda—this will help the wood conduct electricity, and will help you choose where your fractal designs will go. [8] X Research source On its own, wood won’t conduct electricity and make the cool lightning design that you’re going for. The baking soda solution helps the wood conduct electricity, which creates the unique burn marks. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Spread the solution over the surface of your wood with a brush. Dip a foam or regular paint brush into the baking soda solution and spread a thin layer over part of the wood. Only use a little bit—the surface of the wood should be damp, but not sopping wet. [10] X Research source For instance, you might paint the water over the center of the wood if you’d like the fractal design to show up there. You can also paint the edges of your wood with water."

      "content": "Pick up a probe in each hand. These probes control the electricity that goes into the wood, and help create the cool lightning effect. Don’t let these leads touch, or else you’ll create a huge electrical shock. [11] X Research source Specialty machines will have circular parts attached above the metal parts of each probe. Always hold each probe above this circular portion, so you don’t burn or shock yourself by mistake."

      "title": "Place the probes on 2 separate points of the damp wood.",
      "content": "Place the probes on 2 separate points of the damp wood. If you’d prefer long, intricate burn marks, place both probes on opposite ends of the plank. If you’d prefer a shorter design, place the probes a few inches or centimeters away from one another. Touch the probes directly to the wood, which will create the lightning-shaped burn marks. [12] X Research source The further apart the probes are, the longer the wood will take to burn. Make sure the probes don’t touch when you place them on the wood!"

      "content": "Hold the probes in place until you’re happy with the size of the design. You’ll see smoke and sparks coming off the surface of your wood—this is completely normal, and it’s how the “lightning” design forms. Watch as 2 scorch lines wiggle and burn their way across the wood until both are touching. [14] X Research source"
