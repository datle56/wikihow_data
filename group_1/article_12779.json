      "content": "Choose someone to imitate. [1] X Research source To keep your accent consistent, pick one British speaker to mimic. Opt for a public figure who's been recorded extensively in interviews on a wide variety of subjects, which will likely increase the vocabulary that they use. Choose someone of similar build to yourself so you can mirror them more exactly. Also find someone with the same temperament as you so that you have to \"act\" less; for example, if you're a quiet introvert by nature, imitating someone who's more bombastic would probably be more tiring and unconvincing."

Since the difference in accents is largely produced by the way a speaker physically forms sounds, study the speaker's throat, mouth, tongue, and jaw as they talk. [2] X Expert Source Patrick Muñoz Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Note the way Britons refrain from grinning like Americans when they speak and how they open their mouths vertically instead of horizontally; [3] X Research source for instance, picture Alan Rickman saying, “Ho ho ho,” in Die Hard . Although it's hard to see, another British tendency is to make much more use of the tip of their tongue than Americans do. [4] X Research source Strengthen your own tongue by practicing consonant-sounds repeatedly, making sure to use the tip of your tongue to full effect."

Use a mirror or a computer's camera to watch yourself as you do so. Match the way you set your face, throat, and mouth to that of the speaker. Mimic all of their body language as well to mirror them more closely. [5] X Research source Start small. Play short clips at first. Find ones where the speaker is using simple, common phrases that you normally use, too, so you can spot the differences between their pronunciation and your own more clearly. Expand your rehearsals. Once you've mastered mimicking short phrases, begin tackling longer speeches. Gradually increase the number of lines you repeat at one time. If you're watching an interview, practice lengthy answers individually. Then try answering multiple questions with lengthy answers, all in one go. Continue building each rehearsal until you're performing the speaker's entire interview. Also start expanding your sources. Find material where the person you're imitating experiences strong, genuine emotions as they speak. Note how this effects their speech."

As you attempt speaking in your British accent for longer stretches, record each one. Play them back and listen for where your British accent weakens and your natural accent (or some other British accent that slipped in there by mistake) emerges. Identify whether that was simply due to fatigue or if it's a common flaw that you're repeating elsewhere in similar circumstances. If replicating a particular sound gives you difficulty, select or come up with a phrase that makes heavy use of it, like a tongue-twister. Practice it repeatedly until you overcome this hurdle.

      "content": "Listen to samples of each regional accent. Use sources that clearly identify where the speaker comes from, such as person-on-the-street features on the BBC news or even game shows when they introduce new contestants. Listen to interviews with public figures whose background is either widely known or easily researched online or with other reference material. Rely on current sources, since accents may change over time. Be discerning with your sources. Think of American media and how well (or poorly) different mediums reflect the way Americans actually talk. Notice how newscasters and public speakers like politicians often adopt speech patterns found nowhere else in society. Watch the countless number of American actors who butcher other American accents in American-made TV and movies. Pick your sources for British accents with that in mind. If you do rely on TV or movies, choose British productions instead of American ones that just happen to feature British actors. Be aware that American productions sometimes direct foreign actors to tone down their accents so American audiences have an easier time understanding them. Also stick to films with contemporary settings, as opposed to period pieces, since accents and lingo may change over time."

Learn the difference between sounding “posh” (the RP) and “common” (regional accents.) Historically, British society used to place a great deal of emphasis on the RP as a way to judge each other's social standing. However, this bias isn't as prevalent as it once was, and fewer people strive to speak the Queen's English. [14] X Research source Although it's still in use, today you're more likely to hear it from public speakers, such as government officials, newscasters, and actors.

Be wary of relying on some British bands for lingo, since many (especially in rock's early days) emulated American blues and rock, to the point of adopting Americanisms in their lyrics; the Rolling Stones, for example, often used “dollars” instead of “pounds” in songs like “19th Nervous Breakdown.”"
