      "content": "Learn what Status Conditions are. Status Conditions are effects that harm the other Pokémon, but do not come from moves that inflict unique conditions. \"Paralysis\" is a Status Condition that lowers the Speed stat by a lot for until it goes away. It also sometimes makes the Pokémon not be able to use a move for 1 turn. It can be inflicted by an Electric type move, or any move that has a chance of paralyzing the target. Speed is pretty important, as the Pokémon with a higher Speed stat always gets to go first, which if it doesn't go first, it might cost you a battle. \"Burn\" is a Status Condition that deals damage every turn. It can be inflicted by a Fire type move, or any move that has a chance of burning the target. \"Poison\" is a Status Condition similar to \"Burned\", except the fact that it can be inflicted by a Poison type move instead of Fire type. \"Frozen\" is a rare Status Condition similar to \"Paralyzed\", but it prevents the Pokémon from moving at all until the Status Condition goes away, and it doesn't lower the Speed. \"Sleep\" is a status condition very similar to \"Frozen\", but it isn't rare, and it doesn't form a ton of ice around the target, it just closes it's eyes. It also makes it easier to catch the other Pokémon."

TM54, also known as False Swipe, is a Normal type move that inflicts damage, but never faints the opponent, thanks to the fact that it always leaves 1 HP left for the opponent to not faint, unless the opponent faints itself. False Swipe is obtained after you beat the Melemele island kahuna, Hala."

To complete the game, you have to fight the Elite 4, along with beating Hau in the Champion's room, and you'll be deemed Champion by Kukui. Becoming champion is hard , so be prepared. The Elite 4 specialize in Steel, Rock, Ghost, and Flying. Steel type is vulnerable to Ground, Rock, and Fighting type. Rock type is vulnerable to Water, Ground, Grass, Steel, and Fighting type. Ghost type is vulnerable to Dark and Ghost type. Flying type is vulnerable to Electric, Ice, and Rock type."

Ultra Space works like a piggy ride and a train mashed together; you ride on the back of Solgaleo (or Lunala, depending on which one you decide to ride when you defeat Necrozma in Ultra Space), and you go through this big, purple tunnel. To navigate Ultra Space, you use the Circle Pad or your movement of the 3/2DS to go through Ultra Space."

      "content": "Know how wormholes work. In Ultra Space, there are also wormholes that, if you enter one, transfers you to another world. Besides that, there are also big wormholes that suck you in if you don't have enough speed. These wormholes do the same things as regular ones, the only differences are that they're big, and they can suck you in, no matter if you like it or not. The farther into ultra space you travel, the higher the shiny odds will be on non-Legendary Pokémon. The shiny rates on Legendary Pokémon will remain at 1/4096 without the Shiny Charm, or 1/1365 with the Shiny Charm. If you plan to shiny hunt these Pokémon, be prepared for the long haul. Both, big and normal wormholes are circular, and they can have different colors and rarity. A wormhole with no rings is a completely normal wormhole, while one with 1-4 rings is rare. Generally, you're going to want to go into one with at least 3 rings if you're trying to look for Mewtwo."

      "content": "Be very patient. Remember that you'll most likely not be able to go to the right wormhole on the first try. Mewtwo's wormhole is very far away, so you'll need to remember that it'll probably take a while to get there. There is also not a 100% chance that you'll encounter Mewtwo even under the right conditions, so be prepared to have to go through Ultra Space a ton before you even hear its cry. If you want a Mewtwo that's competitive, or good for fighting other people around the world, you're also going to want to get a Timid/Modest synchronizer to make sure the Mewtwo is a good nature. Synchronizers work when a Pokémon that has the ability \"Synchronize\" (Umbreons and the Abra evolution tree are some of the Pokémon that have that ability) appears in battle. Synchronizers have a 50% chance of transforming the other Pokémon's nature into the synchronizer's nature. Timid lowers the Attack and raises the Speed, while Modest lowers the Attack and raises the Special Attack. Special Attack and Speed are very important stats for Mewtwo, while Attack is not."

It's your choice. If you do a soft reset, make sure you didn't save after you catch it, as soft resetting goes to your previous save. If you do keep it, then congrats!

More specifically, a defense to lower the damage from Physical Attacks. Speed is, again , you guessed it, speed. It helps make a Pokémon go first, which can be important. Special Attack is similar to Attack, but it makes Special Attacks, or attacks that do not touch the target, more powerful. Special Defense is similar to Defense, but it makes Special Attacks less powerful. HP is the least important one; it is a stat that keeps Health Points in battle greater (the same value as in the stats). That makes the Pokémon a little bit more difficult to faint."

An Effort Value is a value of training done to a Pokémon's stats. EVs are similar to strength, they can rise and fall. EV Training is a training done to your Pokémon that raises it's/their stats. EVs are similar to IVs, except that they can rise by defeating certain Pokémon or EV Training at Poké Pelago, an Alolan island you unlock after you finish the Fire Trial with Kiawe. IVs stand for Individual Values. Individual Values, like EVs, are values of training done to the stats of your Pokémon. The difference between EVs and IVs, though, is that IVs can only rise, and they can only rise from Hyper Training. Hyper training is unlocked for your Pokémon when it/they reach level 100. Bottle Caps and Gold Bottle Caps are used for Hyper Training. Bottle Caps raise one IV stat, while a Gold Bottle Cap can raise every IV stat. You can get Bottle Caps by fishing (rarely) and from Festival Plaza. However, Gold Bottle Caps only come when you get Surfing Pikachu (beat all 4 Mantine Surfing champions), get some kind of event Pokémon (only some event Pokémon hold a Gold Bottle Cap), or from Festival Plaza. The only place you can Hyper Train, though, is in Hau'oli City Shopping District, in the mall, besides the antique shop. Natures are little personalities for your Pokémon. Depending on which nature your Pokémon has, one stat will rise and another will fall. Adamant increases the Attack stat and lowers the Special Attack stat. Bashful does not do anything, it raises the Special Attack stat, and lowers it. Bold increases the Defense stat and lowers the Attack stat. Brave increases the Attack stat and lowers the Speed stat. Calm increases the Special Defense stat and lowers the Attack stat. Careful increases the Special Defense stat and lowers the Special Attack stat. Docile does not do anything, it raises the Defense stat and lowers it. Gentle increases the Special Defense stat and lowers the Defense stat. Hardy does not do anything, it raises the Attack stat and lowers it. Hasty increases the Speed stat and lowers the Defense. Impish increases the Defense stat and lowers the Special Attack stat. Jolly increases the Speed stat and lowers the Special Attack stat. Lax increases the Defense stat and lowers the Special Defense stat. Lonely increases the Attack stat and lowers the Defense stat. Mild increases the Special Attack stat and lowers the Defense stat. Modest increases the Special Attack stat and lowers the Attack stat. Naive increases the Speed stat and lowers the Special Defense stat. Naughty increases the Attack stat and lowers the Special Defense stat. Quiet increases the Special Attack stat and lowers the Speed stat. Quirky does not do anything, it raises the Special Defense stat and lowers it. Rash increases the Special Attack stat and lowers the Special Defense stat. Relaxed increases the Defense stat and lowers the Speed stat. Sassy increases the Special Defense stat and lowers the Speed stat. Serious does not do anything, it raises the Speed stat and lowers it. Timid raises the Speed stat and lowers the Attack stat."

Then, select which drink they/it should have (the drinks raise the stats, and there's a drink to raise the XP). If you have 1 set for Pokémon to play with, also known as Isle Evelup level 1, it raises 1 EV. If it's level 2, then it raises 2 EVs. If it's level three, also known as maxed out (where there are three sets to play in), it raises 4 EVs. Maximum amount of sessions you can possibly do is 99. A recommended EV set for Mewtwo is 40 Defense, 216 Special Attack, and 252 Speed. [1] X Research source For Defense, it will take 40 sessions at level 1 Isle Evelup, 20 sessions for level 2 Isle Evelup, and 10 sessions for level 3 Isle Evelup. For Special Attack, it will take 216 sessions, or 99+99+18 for level 1 Isle Evelup, 108 sessions, or 99+9 sessions for level 2 Isle Evelup, and 54 sessions for level 3 Isle Evelup. For Speed, it will take 252, or 99+99+54 sessions for level 1 Isle Evelup, 126, or 99+27 sessions for level 2 Isle Evelup, and 63 sessions for level 3 Isle Evelup."
