Alternatively, press CTRL + SHIFT + D . Select from a list of standard page sizes or type in a custom width and height. This article will use 300x300. You do not have to hit Enter; just close the dialog box."

      "content": "Resize the image so you can easily trace it. Here's how: Click the Select and transform tool in the column of tool icons on the left side of the workspace, or press F1. Click on your raster image until outward-pointing arrows appear at its corners. If you see rotational arrows, click in the middle of your raster image again. Click on one of the outward-pointing corner arrows and hold CTRL while moving the mouse diagonally to resize your raster image to the size of the vector image. Holding CTRL maintains the aspect ratio of the selected object."

You won't need nearly as many as are there, so it's helpful to eliminate some of them. There are two ways to do this: Select a section to edit and hit CTRL L to Simplify the path. This is an easy way to eliminate excess nodes. Unless you are doing some really fine work, this method should be sufficient enough for you. You can use the Simplify command multiple times on the same selected nodes. Select a section to edit. Click on nodes (squares), and delete them by hitting the Delete key after each selection."

Moving the square will move its location, and moving the two circular extensions off of it will adjust its Bezier curve segments. You will have to experiment and read the Inkscape manual to get the hang of it. To get the basic shape of your image, move the nodes (squares) to the correct places before doing further adjustments. You will find yourself adjusting the curves, but moving the nodes first makes it easier. You can click on a segment connecting two nodes and adjust the line."
