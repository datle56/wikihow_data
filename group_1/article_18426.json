[1] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source Most workouts for your major body parts should start with basic, multi-joint strength training exercises that allow you to lift more weight overall, such as the bench presses for chest, overhead presses for deltoids, barbell rows for back and squats for legs. This will allow you to lift heavier on these exercises, while you're still fresh and have enough energy to better stimulate muscle growth. One of the best full-body exercises is the pull-up, which helps build your shoulders and back while strengthening your core. Reader Poll: We asked 759 wikiHow readers and 59% of them agreed that the best exercise for building upper-body mass is a pull-up. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Go all in. Doing high-intensity workouts is the key to building muscle. Light workouts, even if they're long, don't go nearly as far to produce the right conditions for your muscles to break down and rebuild. Plan on doing 30-45 minute sessions 3-4 times per week (every other day). This may sound like a surprisingly manageable plan, but remember that during each session you have to make it as intense as possible. Your muscles will definitely get sore at first, but that will ease up once you get going with a routine. During each session, lift as much weight as you can using the correct form. Test your limits to find out how much weight you should lift by doing reps with different weights. You should be able to do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps without having to put the weights down. If you can't, lower your weight. Generally, the 6-12 rep range stimulates bulky muscle growth, while lower reps favor strength gain at the expense of muscle size. If you can do 10 or more reps without feeling a burn, add more weight. You simply will not get bigger unless you challenge yourself to go all in."

      "content": "Use proper form. To develop precise technique, do every rep with good form. Beginners, strive to keep the rep target inside your strength capabilities. Find the right groove for each exercise. Don't train to fail when you're just starting. You should be able to complete the full motion of an exercise without having to lean over or change position. If you can't, you should be lifting less weight. In most cases you'll start with your arms or legs extended. Work with a trainer for a few sessions so you'll learn the right form for different exercises before continuing on your own."

Instead of focusing on your day, or the blonde next to you, strive to get into a muscle-building mindset to help increase gains. Here's how to do it: Visualize your target muscle growing as you complete every rep. If you're doing lifts with one hand, place your other hand on the muscle you're hoping to improve. Doing this can help you feel exactly where the muscle is straining, and help you refocus your efforts. Remember, it's not the amount of weight on the bar that's important; it's the effect of that weight on the muscle that leads to increases in the size and power you're after. This has a lot to do with how you're thinking and what youâ€™re focused on."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should be getting your calories from nutritious whole foods that will give your body the right kind of fuel to build up your muscles fast. Foods high in sugar, bleached white flour, trans fats, and additives are high in calories but low in nutrition, and they're going to build fat instead of muscle. If you want your muscles to grow and look defined, you need to eat an array of whole foods from every food group. Eat calorie-rich protein dishes like steak and roast beef, roasted chicken (with skin and dark meat), salmon , eggs, and pork . Protein is very important when you're building muscle. Avoid bacon, sausage, and other cured meats, which contain additives that aren't good for you to eat in large quantities. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables of all kinds. They provide you with fiber and essential nutrients and help to keep you hydrated. Eat whole grains like oatmeal , whole wheat, buckwheat , and quinoa instead of white bread, biscuits, muffins, pancakes, waffles, and similar foods. Eat legumes and nuts like black beans, pinto beans , lima beans , walnuts, pecans, peanuts, and almonds."

For lunch, you might eat a chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread, several handfuls of nuts, an avocado , and a big kale and tomato salad with grapeseed oil dressing. For dinner, have a big piece of steak or another protein, potatoes, and vegetables. Have an extra serving of each if you need more fuel for your gains."

To build muscles, you need to be getting the vast majority of your calories from calorie-rich whole foods. That said, you can help accelerate the process by taking certain supplements that have been shown not to harm the body. Creatine is a supplement that has been shown to increase your ATP stores, which is the chemical compound that your body uses to fire your muscles. This means you can do more reps before your ATP stores are depleted, which means more total volume. It comes in a powdered form, and you mix it with water and drink 3 grams of it once a day. Protein shakes like Ensure are acceptable supplements to have around for when you're having trouble eating enough calories between meals.
