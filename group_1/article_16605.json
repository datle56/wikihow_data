      "content": "Pick up lightweight spackling to avoid harsh edges. Lightweight spackling isn’t as thick and doesn’t weigh as much as typical putty or spackling does. Use this to ensure your wall won’t have any harsh edges left by the putty to make your job easier. [2] X Research source You can find this type of spackling at most hardware stores. Look for “lightweight” on the package."

      "title": "Apply the lightweight spackle with a putty knife.",
      "content": "Apply the lightweight spackle with a putty knife. Open up the tub of wall spackle and dip the end of your putty knife into it. Grab a small glob of spackle that is just larger than the hole you want to fill. Place the putty knife right above the hole and drag it downward to apply the spackle, focusing on the hole with about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) of spackle around it. [3] X Research source You can find a putty knife at most hardware stores. Putty knives are flat, skinny tools made specifically for applying putty and spackling to walls."

      "title": "Smooth out the spackle with your putty knife.",
      "content": "Smooth out the spackle with your putty knife. Drag the edge of the putty knife down around the edges of the hole to remove any unnecessary spackle. This will take the excess off your wall and make it easier to smooth out later. [4] X Research source Try not to push your putty knife into the hole, or you could dent the flat surface of the spackle. Instead, stick to the outside edges."

      "title": "Wait 1 to 2 hours for the spackle to dry completely.",
      "content": "Wait 1 to 2 hours for the spackle to dry completely. Point a fan at your wall to speed up the drying process. Try not to touch the area until a few hours have passed so that the spackle has a chance to dry. [5] X Research source If you try to work on the spackle while it’s still wet, you could accidentally remove it from the hole in your wall."

      "title": "Sand the spackle slightly to remove the top layer.",
      "content": "Sand the spackle slightly to remove the top layer. Use a fine grade sanding sponge or paper to slightly rough up the top layer of spackle. Don’t push too hard into the spackle or try to make it flush with the wall, or you could leave a shiny spot that is hard to cover up, especially on textured walls. [6] X Research source You can find sanding sponges or papers at most hardware stores."

Clean off the surrounding area of your wall if you notice any white dust from the sanding. [8] X Research source Water breaks down the top layers of the spackle, but your sponge won’t be wet enough to dampen the spackle in the nail hole."
