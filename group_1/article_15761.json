Rather than tap each key separately, lightly touch the first key and without lifting your finger, slide it across the screen to the next letter of the word.

The word will appear as it would if you typed it by tapping on the keys. There's no need to tap the spacebar between slide-to-type words as a space will appear automatically. Simply lift your finger and begin swiping across the next word. Try not to press the screen too hard while sliding between letters as this may activate the digital trackpad."
