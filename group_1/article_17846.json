      "content": "Choose a good time to talk. When you're calling a girl, you don't necessarily want to set up a specific time that you'll call. But you should choose a good time when you have some time to devote to talking. Then, you won't feel rushed in the conversation. She'll wonder why you called her when you only have a few minutes to talk. [1] X Expert Source Patti Novak Williams Professional Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 January 2021. If she can't talk when you call, ask when it will be a good time to call back. She might be at work or at an appointment.

      "content": "Choose a good location. Make sure you're in a good spot when you call her. Don't call when you're on the bus or walking through a really crowded area. It can be hard to hear her or your voice might go in and out. Even worse, your call might drop and you'll lose the connection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clear your throat.",
      "content": "Clear your throat. Don't start off the conversation with a frog in your throat that will make your voice sound weird. Clear your throat or give a little cough to make sure your voice sounds clear. If you have a really bad cold and your nose is plugged up, it will be harder for her to understand you over the phone. You can still call to say hi, but keep the conversation short. Cut your conversation short by telling her you're going to get some rest so you can be well for when you get together in person."

    {
      "title": "Don't eat while talking.",
      "content": "Don't eat while talking. The sound of someone eating can be really off-putting, and if you are chomping on a burger or slurping down a milkshake, the phone might amplify that noise. It will also be harder to understand you if you're chewing in the middle of a sentence."

      "title": "Don't wait 3 days to call.",
      "content": "Don't wait 3 days to call. Some dating advice recommends that you should wait 3 days after getting a phone number before you call a girl. This is terrible advice.

      "title": "Deepen your voice slightly.",
      "content": "Deepen your voice slightly. A deeper voice will make it a little bit easier for her to understand what you're saying. It will also be more soothing and comforting to hear a deeper voice. Keep your voice gentle, soft and friendly. [3] X Research source Try to keep your voice modulated so you're not shouting or yelling. You can certainly exclaim if the conversation calls for it, but being too emphatic over the phone can come across the wrong way."

      "content": "Don't talk too fast or too slow. Make sure the girl can understand what you're saying. Slow down your speech so you're talking at a normal pace (but not so slow that you sound awkward). Keep your voice relaxed and even."
