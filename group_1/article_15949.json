When you try to view a website that begins with \"https://\", your web browser requests the site's SSL certificate to ensure a secure connectionâ€”a process called a \"TLS handshake.\" Oppido explains the handshake is like a conversation between the browser and the website, as if to say, \"I have today's security certificates, do you have today's security certificate that checks on your thing? Is the date correct? Okay, we can communicate.\" If part of that process fails, your browser cannot verify the certificate, resulting in errors like ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR and \"This site can't provide a secure connection.\""

According to Oppido, one of the most common causes of SSL errors is setting the date and time incorrectly on your PC or Mac. \"Setting the system back to proper date and time allows the certificate to come through and allow the website to authenticate properly,\" he explains. To rule out this issue, make sure your computer is set to obtain the time and date automatically. On Windows, open Settings and navigate to Time & Language > Date & time .

Whether you are the site owner or just trying to load a website, you can check a website's SSL certificate using Qualys's SSL Server Test . Just enter the URL of the site you're trying to view, click Submit , and look for TLS handshake error or others. If you are the website owner, verify SSL is correctly installed on your website, that your certificate is valid, and that all libraries are up to date. Also make sure your pages do not contain mixed (both http and https) content, and that you've updated your web server configuration (or .htaccess file ) to redirect all http:// traffic to https://. If the certificate is for a new domain or subdomain, or you recently changed the DNS records for the domain or subdomain, there's a chance your DNS changes haven't propagated throughout the internet yet. Depending on the TTL specified in your zone file, DNS propagation can take several hours."
