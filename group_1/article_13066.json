      "content": "Turn off the water valves. Valves for the supply of hot and cold water are usually located behind the washing machine and in a washer box attached to the wall. Turn off the valves by turning them clockwise until they cannot be turned any further. You'll want to turn these off first thing. [1] X Research source This will protect you from major spills if you should accidentally tear a hose in step 2."

      "title": "Pull or drag the washing machine away from the wall.",
      "content": "Pull or drag the washing machine away from the wall. If working alone, grab one side and move it forward, then do the same with the other side. If you have help, try pulling on opposite sides simultaneously. Pull the machine as far out as you can without putting stress on the hoses. Ideally, this will be far enough away from the wall that you can step behind the machine. If your house is on the newer side, some new water boxes are above the washer so it's easier to reach the lines without moving the machine."

      "title": "Detach the hoses from the machine.",
      "content": "Detach the hoses from the machine. If they are attached with clamps, turn the screws atop the clamps counterclockwise until the clamps are loose. Then, point the ends of the hoses toward your bucket to drain any water . Alternatively, you can place them in the drain, located in the washer box. It's a good idea to double-check that your valves are still off before doing this. Some styles of faucet handles are easy to accidentally turn back on, and this could have occurred as you moved the machine or when you stepped behind it. [3] X Research source You may find it helpful to wait a few seconds after turning off the valves to try to remove the hoses, as this will allow the pressure in the hoses to abate, making them easier to remove. Turning on a few other faucets in the house may help them drain more quickly."

      "title": "Remove the drain hose from the drain.",
      "content": "Remove the drain hose from the drain. Depending on your plumbing setup, this might be a laundry sink, a floor drain, a wall-mounted drain, or a tall stand-pipe. Each of these requires a slightly different process of hose removal. Consult the instructions that came with your machine if it is not immediately obvious. Point the free end of this hose toward your bucket as well, to allow any water to flow out."

      "content": "Remove the power cord. Unless you are setting the machine back up in the same spot, it's a good idea to remove the power cord or, if it is not removable, tape it in place. This will protect the plug and prevent the cord from being pulled out accidentally during moving. It's also a good idea to remove any knobs that can come off the machine, to prevent loss."

Depending on the model of your machine, this can be achieved with special bolts, a large y-shaped piece of foam, or even simply tightening some screws in the back. Consult your manual on how best to secure the drum in your machine. You may need to buy a special kit for this."
