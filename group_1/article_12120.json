      "content": "Know your options when a call comes in. When you receive an incoming call, a circle appears on the incoming call screen. Look closely at the options available surrounding that circle, and you’ll see that you need not be flustered. Normally, to answer a call, you would slide the circle to the right side of the screen, and to reject the call, you would slide the circle to the left side of the screen. The other option available is to decline the call with a text message."
