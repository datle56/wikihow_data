It’s hurtful, and it’s not the kind of example I want my kids to see.” Keep in mind that your in-laws will likely disagree with you, but you do not have to defend your decision to them."

This will be helpful to you because you will likely feel guilt from time to time, and remembering that you have always controlled your temper and treated them with respect will help you to keep a clear conscience.

Work on finding a solution that you can both live with. It's unlikely you will resolve the dilemma in one conversation. The discussion should be ongoing. Avoid accusing your in-laws of being bad people. If your spouse is still on good terms with them, they might jump to take their parents’ side. Instead, focus on expressing your feelings objectively.
