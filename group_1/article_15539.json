      "content": "Take a picture or select a photo. Most apps give you the option to either take a new picture (look for the button with the camera on it) or choose one from your photo library (Look for a plus \"+\" icon). You should see the photo in the center of the screen with options and icons at the top and/or bottom of the screen."

      "title": "Choose a filter.",
      "content": "Choose a filter. Every app is different, but many of them, like Instagram, have a variety of \"filters\" or \"lenses\" to choose from, which essentially do all of the editing for you. Look for tabs or icons at the bottom or top of the photo preview to see what adjustments you can make with the app you are using. Most photo editing apps display filters as tiny thumbnail previews at the bottom of the screen. Tap a thumbnail image to see a preview of how it will affect your image. Look for slider bars or an icon with slider bars that you can use to adjust the intensity of the filter."

      "content": "Adjust the exposure. In photography, exposure refers to the amount of light that falls on a photo. If the photo is too dark, then you might need to increase the exposure. If you want the photo darker, then lower the exposure."

      "title": "Adjust the saturation.",
      "content": "Adjust the saturation. Some apps allow you to adjust the saturation, or intensity of color, in a photo. Increasing the saturation of a photo can make the colors pop and make the photo more eye-catching. Too much saturation, though, can make the photo look harsh and almost cartoon-like."

      "title": "Crop the photo.",
      "content": "Crop the photo. Cropping a photo is a good way to add more focus on the subject in the image by cutting out some of the background in the image. The crop tool usually has an icon that resembles two right angles forming a square. To crop an image select the crop tool and then drag the corners of the image inward so that the light part of the image is centered around the subject in the image. Then tap the icon that confirms the changes you made. In many apps, the crop tool displays two horizontal and two vertical lines that divide the image into thirds. You can use these lines as a composition guide. Align the subject or other elements of a photo with the lines or where they intersect. In photography, this is called The Rule of Thirds.

Every app is different, so if it is your first time using one, you might want to go through and check out all the different options for how to edit the photo. Some photo filters may not be free to use. If a photo has a lock icon on it, or a dollar sign, you probably need to pay to get access to the filter."

      "content": "Get some photo editing software. You can do basic edits with programs like Picasa and Instagram, but if you want to make your photos really look amazing, you should get a program specifically designed for serious editing. Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard for professional photo editing, but you don't need to pay for an Adobe subscription to do professional photo editing. GIMP is a free and open-source photo editing program that has many of the same tools as Photoshop, and can be downloaded for free. If you're ready for an upgrade, it's not that expensive to get a license for just Photoshop."

If you have a digital camera, you can transfer photos to your computer using an SD card, or a USB thumb drive. If you are using your mobile phone as your camera, you can save your photos to a cloud service such as iCloud, Google Photos, or DropBox, which can be accessed from a computer. It's a good idea to make sure the images you edit are high-resolution."

Be careful, however: you lose a lot of minor details when you increase contrast. To adjust the contrast in Photoshop, click the icon that resembles a sun that is half white and half black above the Layers panel to the right. This adds a brightness and contrast adjustment layer to the photo.

Sometimes, the photo can be improved by lower the saturation (moving towards black and white) and sometimes it can be improved by increasing saturation. Experiment to see how it affects your image. To adjust the saturation in Photoshop, click the icon that resembles three gradient bars (Hue & Saturation) or the icon with a triangle (Vibrancy) above the Layers panel. This adds a new adjustment layer to the image. Click the new adjustment layer and use the saturation slider bar above the Layers panel to adjust the saturation.

      "content": "Use blurring and sharpening filters carefully. You can find the Blur and Sharpen/Enhance filters in the Filters menu at the top of both GIMP and Photoshop. Be careful how much blur or sharpen you apply to an image. Instead of applying the filter to an entire image, you can use the marquee, ellipse, lasso, or quick select tool to select a part of the image and then apply the filter to the selected part of the image. When making adjustments to an image in Photoshop or GIMP, it's a good idea to right-click the image layer in the Layers panel and select Duplicate . This creates a duplicate layer of the image that you can use for editing, leaving you an unedited copy of the original image in case your edits don't turn out the way you want."
