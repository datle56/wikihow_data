Start by generating a list of things you’ve always wanted to do. Remember that there are no wrong answers when you’re brainstorming! Aim for at least five items on your list. [1] X Research source Perhaps you’ve always wanted to skydive, bungee jump, or go white water rafting. Maybe you’ve always wanted to write a book, perform at an open mic, or grow your own garden. Maybe you’ve always wanted to work as a barista, make a short film, or try a vegan diet."

Learning new things is a great way to meet people, have fun, and feel a sense of fulfillment. Aim to come up with at least five things you’d like to learn. Perhaps you’d like to learn a new language, such as Spanish, Italian, or Chinese. Perhaps you’d like to learn a new creative skill, such as photography, pottery, or landscape painting. Perhaps you’d like to learn how to cook, do yoga, or write poetry. Reader Poll: We asked 381 wikiHow readers and 46% of them chose learning a new language as the skill they’d be most excited to learn. [Take Poll] So you may want to give that a try if you're looking to do something new!"

If this is something new that you’ve just thought of, simply list all the things that stand in your way. A prime obstacle might be money. Another important obstacle might be time. You may not feel like you have time to do the new things you’d like to. Other obstacles could really by anything. For instance, perhaps you would need someone to watch you dog, or perhaps you have a fear of flying that would get in the way."

      "content": "Break each obstacle down into smaller parts. Take some time to examine each reason, and isolate obstacles into individual parts. (This should help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.) Begin thinking of ways to overcome each problem, one by one. [3] X Research source For example, if the problem is financial, begin by determining how much money you would need to complete your goal. Figure out how much you would need to save each week or each month in order to have enough money within a certain amount of time (like six months or one year). Then determine how you can save that money. Could you give up some of your luxuries? Could you find some extra work? If the problem is time, you can create a similar budget. How much time would you need to complete this goal? Let's say you would need to work on this goal 1 hour per day, for six months. Is there anywhere you can spare an hour? Maybe there is something you could give up (an hour of sleep, an hour of TV, and hour of social media). Then you also may need a bigger chunk of time to actually do the thing. This may require getting time off of work, or obtaining childcare. If you are beginning six months ahead of time, hopefully you can talk to your boss, and/or find a friend or relative to help out. If the problem is fear, you can begin facing it little by little. If you are afraid of heights, for example, you can begin by doing some high-elevation hiking, riding a ski-lift, or even taking a glass elevator to a high floor. Begin testing your limits with a new \"height obstacle\" each week, until you feel ready to tackle your big goal."

Look for a club in your area, or even an interest group online for people who are seeking a similar goal. Having someone to talk to is likely to help you achieve what you want to do."
