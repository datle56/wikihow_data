She will make the correct diagnosis and develop an individualized treatment plan for your specific injury. Make sure you tell your doctor about any recently increased physical activity involving your lower legs since this is likely the source of the injury. The doctor will also give you an idea of how long you should refrain from activity. If the pain associated with your Achilles tendon is severe or if you experience a sudden disability with the flexion of your foot, then see a doctor immediately. You may actually have a torn or ruptured Achilles tendon, which is a far more serious diagnosis. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source More common symptoms of Achilles tendonitis that may warrant a trip to the doctor include mild-to-moderate aches in the back of the leg or above the heel, especially after a sports activity or exercise. You may additionally experience tenderness or stiffness in the area, which is most commonly felt first thing in the morning.

You don’t have to stay off the foot entirely, but you should avoid running, stair climbing, and other high-impact sources of stress to the tendon. Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, you may need to rest the tendon anywhere from days to months. Listen to your body and reintroduce high-impact activities slowly. While resting your Achilles tendon, switch to low-impact exercise options such as biking, elliptical exercises, and swimming. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear footwear that protects the tendon. Athletic shoes that both support your arches and cushion your heels can help reduce pain and promote healing. Additionally shoes that are softer at the back of the heel will reduce unnecessary irritation to the tendon. [14] X Research source In some cases, your doctor or physical therapist may also advise some type of insert of orthotic. These devices go into a shoe to increase support on a specific area of the foot. [15] X Research source Orthotic devices more commonly help insertional Achilles tendonitis (lower in the leg where the tendon inserts into the heel) because the area is more likely to be irritated by certain footwear. [16] X Research source If your pain is severe, your doctor may also recommend a recovery boot in order to keep the foot flexed and strain off the tendon. This is usually a short-term step since prolonged use of a boot can weaken calf muscles. [17] X Research source"

[20] X Research source Some of these options include: [21] X Research source Gastrocnemius recession — This surgery lengthens calf muscles in order to take additional stress off your Achilles tendon. Debridement and repair — This operation removes the damaged portion of the Achilles tendon and is usually only for tendons with less than 50% damage. Debridement with tendon transfer — For tendons with more than 50% damage, tendon from the big toe is transferred to the Achilles tendon when the damaged portion is moved in order to keep the tendon strong enough to function."
