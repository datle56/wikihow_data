It's common to wish for things we don't have, but learning to love what you do have will help you live a much happier life. Just because you have small breasts doesn't mean you are less beautiful, they are just one of the things that make you you .

      "content": "Focus on your positive attributes instead of the things you don't like about yourself. Developing your talents, such as dancing, singing, sports, writing, etc. will help you focus on the positive things you have to offer. Being negative won't allow you to see how amazing you actually are. Create a list of strong points and positive attributes (physical and non-physical) about yourself. Write down the things that you love about yourself. Sometimes it helps when you can visually see all of the amazing things about yourself written down. Avoid negative self talk. Negative self-talk includes pointing out all of your flaws and ignoring your positive attributes. You need to be your own biggest fan, so don't talk down about yourself. Talking down about yourself will only add to your insecurities. Stay positive when talking about yourself. Improve your body language. Communicating like you have confidence will actually increase your confidence – basically the \"fake it till you make it\" approach. Acting like you are self-confident will eventually turn into real confidence. Carrying yourself with confidence includes standing up straight, holding your head high, and smiling a lot.

      "content": "Don't judge yourself by society's standards. It can be easy to fall into the trap of judging yourself based on the media, celebrities, and overall societal standards – but don't! It's important to have your own perception of yourself, and not live your life based on the opinions of other people. Most of the time, society's standards aren't realistic, and can cause great harm to self-confidence and individuality. [3] X Research source Even when you look at beautiful celebrities, they all have different body types. Some have huge boobs, but others have smaller chests or no curves at all. Always remember that there are many different types of beauty. Look through different eras of history to see how beauty trends have changed. Expanding your notion of what beauty is may help you see the beauty within yourself. You'll even see that the 1920s were all about the smaller chested Flapper women! Stay away from negative influences like the media or appearance-focused peers. The media often portrays unrealistic body and image standards, such as large breasts and a small waist. If you try to fit into these unrealistic standards, your self confidence will never grow. Your appearance focused peers are most likely struggling with self esteem issues themselves, so don't let their insecurities bring down your self confidence. [4] X Research source"

Ensure that the band is not moving or rolling and that your breasts fit well inside the cups. If there is a gap between your flesh and the cup, it is too big. If flesh spills over the cup, it is too small. Pick the right color to go under what you are wearing. Use silicon bra inserts to make your boobs appear larger.
