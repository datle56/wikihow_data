      "content": "Incorporate granola into your baked goods. The next time you bake a loaf of banana bread or a batch of cookies, fold ½-1 cup (45-90 g) of granola into the dough or batter. Playing with different textures in the same confections can add a whole new dimension to familiar recipes, and you'll never have to choose between crunchy and chewy again! Alternatively, try sprinkling granola clusters directly onto your fresh-baked cookies, muffins, or brownies when they first come out of the oven."

[12] X Research source You can prepare chicken, fish, and vegetables this way, all to delicious effect. In order for your breading to stick properly, it may help to pulse the granola a few times in a food processor or blender."

They also don't tend to get as mushy when cooked for long periods of time, meaning your stuffed dishes will often come out with a much better consistency. [13] X Research source Any dish that ordinarily calls for a breadcrumbs can be made with granola, including stuffed pork chops, fish fillets, peppers, mushrooms, and crab cakes.
