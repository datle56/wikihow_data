[20] X Research source Spot-training, or working one area of your body at a time, has its advantages when it comes to toning specific muscles, but it won’t make fat disappear from just that location. Ultimately, it’s important to know that leg exercises alone won’t give you suddenly-skinny legs— you’ll need to reduce your overall body fat levels to see results."
