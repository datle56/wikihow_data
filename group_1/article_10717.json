    {
      "title": "Make new users your benchmark for design.",
      "content": "Make new users your benchmark for design. The design should be simple enough for a new user to navigate easily. Test your app with a few friends or ideally a larger group of people who are not well-versed in cell phone use. See how they perform, where they get stuck, and whether they find the app intuitive, attractive, and fun to use. Change your design accordingly. Similarly, people who are less educated and young users (kids) are a big market sector. The design must be intuitive enough to help them use your app without hassle."

      "title": "Keep different operating systems in mind.",
      "content": "Keep different operating systems in mind. The mobile internet market is divided among different operating systems. Consider these differences before designing the app. Use responsive design to ensure that your app appears as intended throughout different platforms and operating systems. For making an app for Android your need Android Studio . For making an iOS app you can use XCode Development Kit ."

      "content": "Make sure your app works across different platforms seamlessly. Use a responsive design strategy to create an app that is flexible and customizable for different platforms. Responsive design refers to the idea that an app or website changes its layout, fonts, and graphics according to the hosting device. Don't go for the strategy of creating a trimmed-down version of your site for cell phones. Instead, build the site for the small screen and then enlarge it for the bigger screens."

      "title": "Don't ignore grids.",
      "content": "Don't ignore grids. The grid is an excellent tool to keep your app design consistent and on track across multiple pages. Consistency in graphics, fonts, and icons creates a professional look. Not to mention, it reflects your brand image."

      "title": "Don't forget the offline experience.",
      "content": "Don't forget the offline experience. Not all areas have network coverage. Decide on the offline usability factor of your app. Make sure that most of the features in your app work during offline sessions. In some parts of the world power outages are a regular feature of daily life, so ideally your app would be usable even if you don't have an internet connection. For making an offline experience, you need to learn serverless computing. It will be helping you in creating an offline software application."

They start free and go to monthly/yearly subscriptions. Moreover, they don't need you to write code, as they offer graphical user interfaces. You just need to drag, drop, upload photos, and add checkboxes, and your app is complete. Bingo! Search for an app builder online. There are many sites offering app-building services. Go through some and read content and testimonials. Consider an intuitive and easy interface. Some offer free services while others charge fees. Your app should have enough features that work offline. Make an intuitive design, so new users can use it easily. Consider text, typography, colors, icons, tabs, etc., beforehand to give a consistent look."
