Johtonian Sneasel is a rare spawn in Space-time distortions in the Obsidian Fieldlands. [4] X Research source Space-time distortions have a higher chance of spawning the longer you spend in an area. To get a Space-time distortion to spawn in the Obsidian Fieldlands, you'll need to be in the area for a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 40 minutes before a Space-time distortion spawns. If you're in a menu, pop-up dialogue, or a wild Pokémon battle, the timer for the distortion to spawn will pause. You also cannot rest at a base camp as this will reset the spawn timer."
