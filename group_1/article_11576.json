      "title": "Dress up for dates.",
      "content": "Dress up for dates. Libras supposedly like it when their dates dress up a little, as they love exploring the finer things in life. To impress a Libra on a date, dress up a little. Even if you're going to a place without a dress code, take some time and care with your personal grooming to hold a Libra's attention. For example, put on a button down shirt and tie or nice blouse and dress pants, even if you're going to a more casual restaurant."

      "title": "Expose them to culture on dates.",
      "content": "Expose them to culture on dates. Astrologers believe Libras appreciate highbrow culture, so appealing to these interests can help you woo a Libra. Instead of going with a conventional dinner and a movie, plan something with a sophisticated feel. Take a Libra to a show at a local art museum. Get tickets for a play or concert. Go to an artsy film theater and see independent films, art films, or foreign films."

      "title": "Plan dates at elegant restaurants and clubs.",
      "content": "Plan dates at elegant restaurants and clubs. Libras allegedly like to live it up a little, so don't take them to just any establishment.

This gesture will likely be appreciated by a Libra."

      "content": "Listen to their perspective. Libras are known as the sign of balance. When Libras are considering disagreements and debates, they feel it's fair to let both sides express themselves equally. When a Libra expresses their opinion, it's important you remain silent and listen. Do things like nod, maintain eye contact, and paraphrase what they've said to show you're paying attention. Libras can be a little frank in expressing their opinions. Do not take it personally if a Libra strongly disagrees with you or plays devil's advocate. They are simply trying to show two sides to each argument."

      "title": "Go slowly in the relationship.",
      "content": "Go slowly in the relationship. Libras, due to their supposedly contemplative nature, like to weigh the pros and cons of a potential romantic match slowly. Once a Libra has decided on a partner, they'll eagerly jump into a relationship. However, it can take them awhile to make up their mind, so it's important to allow the relationship to progress at its own pace. Do not force a Libra into a premature commitment. If they're hesitant to define the relationship early on, give them the space to make up their mind."

      "content": "Do not take a Libra's critiques personally. Libras can sometimes come off as critical or disagreeable due to their tendency to look at all sides of an argument.
