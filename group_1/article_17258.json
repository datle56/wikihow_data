      "content": "Keep an open mind. First of all, you should get away from things you've heard about and start with a clean slate. This is one way to learn Truth. Your first task is to learn about religions, not necessarily to pick one for yourself right off the bat. Go to the library and find books on some religions. After you get the preliminary information on each religion, go to their original texts if you wish. Keep reading and learning. Do not accept or reject anything at this point, just keep learning."

      "content": "Meet the religious leaders, preachers and teachers in your neighborhood and online. Ask them about their views on life, God(s), relationships, ethical conduct, and their daily practice of their religion. Use online forums to talk with people all over the world, do not confine yourself to just talking with friends and neighbors. Religion is not just facts but accepting a tradition, culture, and potentially important set of beliefs. Choosing a religion is similar to choosing who to marry. Follow your heart not peer pressure, it is a personal individual choice."

      "content": "Beware of cults. Cults are social or religious groups that often control their members mentally, physically, maritally or sexually.

      "content": "Don't make a quick decision especially as a young person. Take the time to learn about the world. Learn about life, faith, people, religion and seek education including history. Then keep reading about your favorite religions. It may help if good friends or family members share what their beliefs are and why they believe in them; learn about the their religions if you find them desirable. Do not confine yourself to just following the beliefs of what happens to be in your area though. With the internet, you can connect with beliefs all over the world."

If you believe in Gods (more than one deity), then your choice of religions is narrowed down to polytheistic religions. If you believe that God is all, and all is God, then your choice of religions is narrowed down to pantheistic religions."
