      "content": "Spread a pea-sized amount of filler into the scratch with a razor blade. Scoop a small amount of plastic filler onto a new razor blade and begin applying it along the surface in long, flat motions. Hold the blade at a 45-degree angle to create a smooth, even layer. Continue working in long, back and forth motions until the scratches are completely filled. [3] X Research source Plastic filler is a thick substance that helps fill and smooth out cracked, scratched surfaces. You can find it online or at a hardware store. Use a plastic spatula to spread filler over a rounded surface. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait for the filler to dry completely. Read the instructions on your plastic filler or putty to see what the recommended drying time is. Note that some products might be dry to the touch in 20 minutes or so, while others might need more time to harden. [5] X Research source Don’t do anything to the filler until it’s dry to the touch."

      "content": "Dry sand the surface with 80- and 120-grit sandpaper. Take a sheet of coarse sandpaper and remove any obvious dust from the top layer of the hardened filler. Once you’re finished buffing the surface with this sheet, use a smoother, 120-grit piece of sandpaper to even out the plastic. [6] X Research source At this point, you can use a spatula or razor blade to fill in any additional bumps."

Follow the recommended drying time listed and wait for the product to harden all the way. If the surface looks rough, go over it with 80- and 120-grit sandpaper, as well as 400-grit paper attached to a rubber sanding block. [7] X Research source"

Spray over the entire area with the primer, covering both the scratched section and the surrounding sections. Wait for it to dry completely, then apply a second coat.

Once you’ve primed and buffed the surface, spray over the plastic with a base coat. Make sure the color matches the original coat color so your repair can look as smooth as possible. [11] X Research source If you’re working with a smaller surface, like a side-view mirror, you may not need as much paint. Follow the recommended drying guidelines on your base paint before spraying on any new layers."
