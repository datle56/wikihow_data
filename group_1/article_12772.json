This might include your goals, your anxieties, your relationships, your successes and failures, and your likes and dislikes.

It can even help you break through mental blocks and resolve problems. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Journaling is most effective when you do it with pen and paper. Motivate yourself by buying a nice book to write in and a nice pen. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source It also helps quiet your mind, giving your intuition space to grow. [9] X Research source Some popular types of meditation: [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Guided meditations involve being walked through a relaxing imaginary space or situation. Mantra meditations involve silently repeating words to calm and inspire — for example, “I am love”. Mindfulness meditations involve sitting quietly and working on experiencing the moment as fully as possible by keeping a clear mind: when thoughts come into your head, you observe them without judgement, then let them pass. Aim for 10 to 15 minutes of meditation each day. If you find that daunting, start with 1- to 3-minute meditations and then work up to longer periods of time."

      "content": "Go for a mindful walk. If you’re having a particularly hard time quieting your mind for meditation, try going for a walk instead. Be mindful during your walk, paying attention to the sensations of walking and breathing, and to the sights, smells, and sounds around you. Walking is an effective way to boost your mood and clear your mind. Often when our minds are clear, difficult decisions become more clear too. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Live in the moment . Bring the lessons of meditation and mindful walking into your daily life. Try to live each moment mindfully, paying attention to what’s happening in that very moment rather than thinking about the past or the future. Don’t be discouraged if your mind wanders as you learn to live in the moment. Even gurus admit to struggling with this. When your mind wanders, just catch it and bring your attention back to the moment. Over time, you will learn to catch your mind more quickly and put it back on track when it wanders."

      "content": "Pay attention to your bodily sensations. In particular, pay attention to your breath, your stomach, and your chest. Quick breathing, an upset stomach, and a heavy, sad-feeling heart are your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong. [12] X Research source Research has proven that our bodies often know what’s up before our minds do. In one study, participants experienced an increased pulse and sweaty palms long before they mentally realized that they were in a negative situation. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to what your mind is drawn to.",
      "content": "Pay attention to what your mind is drawn to. Is there a song you can’t get out of your head? Do you keep seeing certain words over and over again? These “coincidences” may very well be signals of what’s going on in your subconscious mind. Taking time every day to clear your mind — for example, through meditation or mindful walking — will help you recognize these signals more clearly and, if necessary, act on them. An example of this might be that you keep hearing songs and seeing people who remind you of one of your friends who you haven’t spoken to in a while. Upon consideration you might realize that you miss your friend, so you set up a time with them to reconnect."

      "title": "Consider your life experience.",
      "content": "Consider your life experience. Intuition is linked to emotion. If someone or something reminds you of a previous person or experience you’ve had, you’re likely to associate it with the same emotions, good or bad, that you had in the past. For this reason, you should still question your intuition, because it may be bringing up associations from a past experience that may not be relevant to your current situation.

For this reason, your intuition is more reliable in areas in which you have more experience. [15] X Research source Travel, socialize, and learn new things.

      "content": "Allow your gut and your mind to work together. Studies have shown that relying only on logic does not guarantee the best possible outcome. In fact, people often have more success starting with a hunch and then testing that hunch with logic. [17] X Research source Research suggests that our initial response to a situation is often the correct one, and that overthinking things won’t always yield the most accurate results.

[19] X Research source Instead of going with your gut or first impression of someone, really pay attention to their body language as well as their words to get a sense of who they are. The more you get to know the person, the better you’ll become at being able to tell when something is off with them."

[20] X Research source They may be perfectly nice, but just socially awkward or perhaps from a different culture. You don't have to become close friends or share your deepest secrets — in fact, if you have a bad feeling about them, definitely don’t do those things. Over time, you’ll get to know them better and will be better able to judge whether your intuition was right."

      "content": "Ask yourself whether it’s worth expressing your hunches. Some hunches are best left unsaid for the sake of your relationships. If you do decide to test whether your hunch is correct by bringing it up with a friend/partner/colleague, choose your wording wisely. For example, if you have a hunch that your partner thinks someone else is attractive, but there isn’t any danger of them actually acting on those feelings, it might be best to let them have their crush instead of accusing them of liking someone else and getting into a fight. [21] X Research source As long as it’s only a passing attraction and nothing more, it’s perfectly natural."

      "content": "Don’t dwell on the negative. If you’re prone to anxiety and worry, you’re more likely to intuit when those close to you are having negative thoughts and feelings, but you’re less likely to be able to tell when they’re having positive feelings. [22] X Research source Dwelling on the negative, and talking about those negative hunches, can sabotage your relationships. [23] X Research source"

Clear your mind and breath deeply, then think of someone or something you love. Say a word that opens your heart (e.g. “love” or “gratitude”). [25] X Research source Once your heart is open and your mind is clear, reconsider the same situation you just considered using your brain. Again consider the pros and cons, the facts, the consequences, and your options. Are any of these different when you view them from an emotional angle?"

Think about a time when you were particularly gutsy, and say the word “courage” to yourself as you exhale. [26] X Research source With your gut engaged, think about your decision once more, considering the pros and cons, facts and consequences, and all of your options. Ask yourself what will happen if you fail? What are the risks involved? How do your thoughts differ this time from when you considered your decision using your brain and your heart?"

What’s more important is how you feel when you see the result. For example, if you’ve done a pros and cons list, and you’ve agonized over taking that new job but still can’t decide, flip a coin: heads is yes, tails is no. If the coin lands on yes and you feel sick about it, or it lands on no and you feel relieved, you’ll know that you actually don't want the new job and probably shouldn't take it."

To do a blind reading: Think about a decision you’re struggling with and write 3 possible solutions for it on individual index cards — 1 solution per card. Turn the cards over and shuffle them, then assign a percentage to each card based on how much you’re drawn to it. Make your decision based on the card with the highest percentage."
