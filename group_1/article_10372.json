      "content": "Prepping your skin will help your makeup look great and stay in place. Wash your face with a cleanser designed for your skin type . Gently pat your face dry with a clean towel. Then, apply skin primer to create a smooth surface and help your makeup last longer. If you have or want a more involved skincare routine, exfoliate after cleansing your face, then apply a toner or serum and eye cream before moisturizing and priming. Use a gentle daily exfoliator, or stick to exfoliating once or twice a week to avoid irritating your skin. Let the primer dry for 1-2 minutes before continuing. Primers are especially helpful if you have an indention where your dark spot is. The primer will fill in the indention so your skin appears smooth."

Repeat the process all around your face to set your makeup. [5] X Research source Avoid swiping the puff over your skin, or it will smear the layers of concealer and foundation.
