If you don’t know where your closest laundromat is located, look online to find a laundromat that won’t require a lot of travel. Hauling your clothes all over the place is a pain, so go to the laundromat closest to you unless you have unique requirements or a vehicle that you can drive to the laundromat. [1] X Research source If you’re carrying a lot of laundry, don’t risk your back by walking to the laundromat if it’s farther than 1 block away. Laundromats tend to be busier on the weekend. If you want the best chance of getting an open machine, do your laundry during the week. Some laundromats are open 24 hours a day. Look for a laundromat that is always open if you want to do your laundry late at night or early in the morning."

      "content": "Separate your colors and whites and layer them in your laundry basket. Some people will wash whites on one night and return to the laundromat the next day to wash their colors. Many people simply use 2 machines to wash their colors and whites at the same time. Either way, sort your laundry into 2 separate piles based on the color. [2] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Certified Professional Organizer & Senior Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. Put your whites at the bottom of the laundry basket and place your colors on top. Alternatively, you can get 2 laundry bags to keep your clothes sorted as you travel. This way, you won’t need to waste time separating your clothes at the laundromat. [3] X Research source You can put a sheet of cardboard or some other kind of divider in between your colors and whites if you want to make retrieving each set of clothes from a single basket easier. If you’re walking to the laundromat, a cloth laundry bag will be easier to carry than a hard-plastic or metal bin. If you’re really dedicated to washing materials properly, read each tag on your items of clothing for washing instructions and sort lighter colors from your darks. Wash your jeans separately, and keep delicate fabrics together for a separate load."

      "content": "Bring change with you to operate the washing machines and dryers. The machines at laundromats are almost always coin-operated. Loads typically cost $0.50-2.00 depending on where you live and the size of the machine that you’re using. Take a bag full of change with you to the laundromat to operate the machines. Newer laundromats may have machines that take credit and debit cards, but these machines are pretty rare. Don’t assume that you’ll be able to use a card without contacting the laundromat first."

Laundromats typically sell detergent, dryer sheets, and fabric softener, but the prices are much higher than they normally are at a grocery or corner store. To save money, bring laundry detergent and any fabric softener with you to avoid needing to buy them at the store.

      "content": "Find a washing machine that is unoccupied and check inside the drum. Once you walk into the laundromat, look for a washing machine that isn’t in use. When you find one, put your laundry basket down and open the door. Look inside to ensure that the last person to use the machine hasn’t left anything behind. [5] X Research source Smell the drum before using it. If it smells like bleach, avoid putting non-white clothing inside. Some laundromats offer several sizes of machine. If your laundromat does, feel free to grab a bigger machine if you think it’ll save you some time. Larger machines are typically designed to hold twice as many clothes as a standard machine. Try to avoid grabbing a machine next to an in-use machine in case the other person is planning on using multiple machines. If there is something in the machine and there’s a clerk at the laundromat, turn the lost item into the clerk. If there isn’t an employee there, leave the forgotten item on top of the machine."

      "content": "Use 2 washing machines if you’re washing colors and whites separately. If you have 2 loads of laundry to do, look for 2 empty machines that are right next to one another. If the laundromat is completely packed though, it is considered bad etiquette to take up 2 machines. Avoid loading the machines past the rim of the drum. If you do, your clothes won’t get properly cleaned and you may damage the machine.

      "content": "Load your clothes and add your detergent. Once you’ve selected a machine, load your clothes into the drum. If you’re using multiple machines, load both machines at the same time. Add detergent based on how big your load of laundry is. The average load of laundry is 6–7 pounds (2.7–3.2 kg) and will fill 3/4 of a standard machine. Fill the cap halfway with detergent for an average load and adjust accordingly if you have more or less laundry to do. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There are usually instructions on the container of laundry detergent that suggest how much soap you should use. There are also hash marks on the inside of the cap indicating what a full or half load is for your particular detergent. If you’re using pods, put 1 pod in with each load, regardless of how many clothes you’re washing. Many people prefer to use less soap. If you want to cut back on soap, fill your cap so that it’s 1/8 full. This is usually 2 tablespoons (30 mL) for a standard detergent. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for adding fabric softener. Typically, you fill the cap either halfway or to the rim and add it directly to your laundry."

Either way, once you find an unoccupied dryer, open it to inspect the drum and look for forgotten items of clothing. Take a sniff to see if the drum smells moldy or wet. If it does, the machine is likely not working properly. Find a different dryer if this is the case.

Pull the dial out or press the “Start” button to initiate your cycle. [13] X Research source Some machines allow you to adjust the amount of heat that you use to dry your clothes. The more heat that you use, the more likely your clothes are to shrink—especially if they’re made out of cotton. If you aren’t sure if you can machine dry a particular item of clothing, read the tag. There are washing and drying instructions on most clothing tags. Feel free to add dryer sheets or dryer balls to your dryer if you want to keep your clothes wrinkle and static free ."
