If you are moving a Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed or a mattress with an adjustable base, use your Sleep Number remote or the app on your phone to deflate the mattress to 100. This makes your mattress lighter and easier to move. [1] X Research source Disassembling your bed is a two-person job, so ask a friend or family member to help you take it apart. Getting another person’s help makes disassembly quicker and easier."

Just find your bed’s air pump, which is located at the head or foot of your bed depending on the type of Sleep Number mattress you have. Then, lift up the top or bottom of your bed and look for a bag with 2 white air chamber caps. [2] X Research source Consult your mattress’ user’s manual to find where your air chamber clamps are located. If you can’t find your bed’s air chamber caps, order a new pair on Sleep Number’s website ."

Warning : If you have a medical implant or device, stay 6 inches (15 cm) away from beds with magnets that are being disassembled or are fully disassembled. The magnetic field can interfere with your implant or device."
