      "content": "Face the kangaroo without looking at it. While you don’t ever want to turn away from a kangaroo in your general proximity, you also don’t want to look it in the eye. As tempting as it may be to turn tail and run, make sure you’re consistently facing the animal at all times. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to clear the area with your arms and head lowered. If the kangaroo hasn’t noticed you or isn’t giving you much attention, lean down and bring both your arms and head to a lower level. Carefully exit the encounter if you can, or wait for the kangaroo to vacate the area before you move along. [2] X Research source Use your environment to your advantage as you escape. If there are any fences or trees in your area, try to get behind them so the structure stands between you and the kangaroo."

      "title": "Cough quickly and deeply if a kangaroo approaches you.",
      "content": "Cough quickly and deeply if a kangaroo approaches you. A male kangaroo may display dominance if they view you as a threat—peeing, moving on all fours, and outright fighting behavior are some examples of this. The best way to pacify an aggressive and dominant kangaroo is by offering a quick and low cough, which is kangaroo-speak for “you’re the boss” or “you’re in charge.” [3] X Research source If you don’t cough, the kangaroo might assume that you’re trying to challenge him, which you definitely don’t want."

      "title": "Crawl away on your hands and knees or wait for the kangaroo to leave.",
      "content": "Crawl away on your hands and knees or wait for the kangaroo to leave. If the kangaroo is blocking your path, you have two main options: turn back or wait for the kangaroo to leave the area. If you’re concerned about your potential safety, consider getting on your hands and knees and crawling away from the kangaroo (so you take up as little space as possible in the kangaroo’s eyes). [4] X Research source It’s always a good idea to get a tree or fence in between you and the kangaroo as you retreat. Don’t try to shimmy past the kangaroo and continue ahead—just let it move away on its own."

      "title": "Curl up in the fetal position if the kangaroo attacks you.",
      "content": "Curl up in the fetal position if the kangaroo attacks you. If a kangaroo is insistent on a fight, your best form of self-defense lies in protecting your head and vital organs, not in physically fighting back. Drop to the ground right away, tuck your knees into your chest, and cradle your head with your arms to provide some extra protection. Wait for the animal to move away before you attempt to escape. [5] X Research source As hard as it might be, try to keep quiet as the kangaroo attacks you. In 2017, an Australian resident was randomly ambushed by a kangaroo while she was out exercising. The kangaroo retreated once she stopped making noise during the attack. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Carry a stick or long object with you when you go out for a walk. If a kangaroo starts heading in your direction, extend the stick or long item out, which creates more space between you and the animal. [7] X Research source Warning: Never hit or otherwise hurt a kangaroo. Australia considers kangaroos to be a protected species, so it’s against the law to hurt one. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Never feed kangaroos you encounter. As adorable as they make look from afar, kangaroos are wild creatures—they aren’t meant to be fed by people. In fact, kangaroo encounters sometimes happen because kangaroos no longer fear or naturally run away from people (thanks to their previous in-person encounters). [10] X Research source If you’d like to get up close and personal with a kangaroo, visit a petting zoo where you can safely interact with kangaroos under proper supervision. Try not to leave water or snacks on your property in hopes of attracting some kangaroos there. When kangaroos are fed by humans and have more interactions with them, they’re more likely to act aggressively. [11] X Research source"

The buddy system is always a good rule to follow when you’re walking around outside, especially when kangaroos are involved. If you’re planning to head out, exercise extra caution around dawn or dusk, when you’re especially likely to run into kangaroos (since they’re out getting food). [12] X Research source"

If you spot a kangaroo in your area (like in your yard), don’t try to scare it off—this could cause it to go into defense mode, which you definitely don’t want.

Male kangaroos sometimes circle around female kangaroos in their mating rituals, and may also physically touch or smell the female kangaroo that’s in their sights.

[17] X Research source That’s pretty impressive, considering over 8,100,000 people live in New South Wales, Australia currently! [18] X Research source While kangaroo attacks do happen occasionally, they are very rare and certainly not the norm within Australia. [19] X Research source Did you know? Kangaroos are herbivores, which means they don’t eat meat. [20] X Research source As scary as it would be to be attacked by one, you wouldn’t have to worry about it eating you."
