A simple black outfit may include a black blazer, black T-shirt (crew or V-neck), and black skinny jeans. For something more feminine, try a simple straight-cut dress with 3/4-length sleeves, and minimal seams. Another example of a basic outfit could be light denim skinny jeans with a basic white T-shirt and a pastel cardigan."
