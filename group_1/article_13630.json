      "title": "Take notes to help you remember and understand what you learn.",
      "content": "Take notes to help you remember and understand what you learn. Taking notes helps you remember what you hear or read, but it also helps your brain stay active and absorb information adequately. Write down key points mentioned by your teacher or the textbook, and make note of questions you have about the material while you read. [1] X Research source Although typing your notes can be quicker and easier, writing your notes by hand may help you absorb and remember the material better. [3] X Research source Kaifesh recommends taking notes on recorded lectures, if possible. That way, you can take your time looking up related concepts as you go."

      "title": "When you don’t understand something, raise your hand.",
      "content": "When you don’t understand something, raise your hand. It’s your teacher’s job to help you learn and understand, so don’t hesitate to ask them questions ! Asking questions will not only help you learn the material better, but will also show your teachers that you’re engaged and interested. [4] X Research source If you’re too shy to raise your hand and ask questions during class, try approaching your teacher after class or sending them an email. There’s a good chance another student has the same question, so don’t worry about sounding ignorant or foolish. Teachers love it when you help them teach you! If you’re in college or university, your instructor may have office hours when you can ask them questions and discuss the material with them one-on-one."

      "title": "Plan time to keep up with your homework assignments.",
      "content": "Plan time to keep up with your homework assignments. Kaifesh says to “Set aside time—by class, by assignment, by day—to ensure that you are allotting enough time to do each well before the due dates.” It can be easy to get swamped and lose track of all the work you’re supposed to be doing, so write down each assignment and plan when you’ll get it done as soon as it’s assigned. Keep in mind that homework is intended to help you learn and practice the material; it’s not just busywork! Ask a friend if they want to do homework together, which can help you better understand it and motivate you to get it done."

      "content": "Maintain good attendance and stay actively engaged in class. Attend class every day if you can, and when you’re there, make sure you’re paying attention and participating by asking or answering questions. Even if attendance isn’t mandatory in your classes, showing up will ensure you learn more and don’t miss anything important. [5] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If you do have to miss class, reach out to your teacher or a classmate to find out what you missed so that you can review it. Someone might be willing to share their notes with you. It can be tempting to skip class, but keep in mind that attendance often counts toward your grade, and missing a class is the quickest way to fall behind."

      "content": "Participate in extracurricular activities to make school more fun. Consider choosing an extracurricular like school clubs, sports teams, or student committees. These activities can be fun and enriching, and studies show that students who do them also do better in school overall. [6] X Research source Plus, they’re also a good way for you to get to know your teachers and fellow students. Extracurriculars also look great on college applications, or even job applications."

      "content": "Quiz yourself on the material regularly to help you absorb it. Don’t wait to study for a quiz or test the night before. You’ll remember the material better if you regularly review what you learn throughout the week in shorter study sessions. [7] X Research source This also helps you identify your weak points so that you’ll know where to focus during review. Try different methods of testing your knowledge, such as: Making flashcards to quiz yourself on key concepts Having a friend ask you questions and trying to answer them Taking advantage of quizzes and knowledge checks in your textbooks Taking practice tests or quizzes, if your teacher provides them"

      "content": "Study for tests in a quiet place without distractions like your phone. Kaifesh says to have a snack, get your social media scrolling or other distractions done, then put those things away and start studying. To help you stay focused , look for a place to study where you won’t be bothered by noise or interruptions. Your study space should also be tidy, well-lit, and not too hot or too cold. Kaifesh also recommends listening to music, but only if it helps you concentrate. Try classical music, or music without lyrics. If you’re too tempted to play with your phone, try installing a productivity app that will limit your access during study time, like Forest or Brick . If you’re studying at home, let other people in your home know that you need quiet time without distractions while you’re studying or doing homework."

      "content": "Take frequent breaks while you do homework or study. When you’re working or studying, take a 15 to 20-minute break every hour or so. This helps to re-energize you and get you back on track if your mind starts to wander. [8] X Research source During your break, you can get up and walk around, have a healthy snack, watch a short video, or even put your head down for a quick power nap . Going for even a short walk can give your brain a boost and improve your problem-solving and creative thinking skills! [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a planner to keep track of your class and study schedule. If you’re taking a lot of classes, keeping a daily or weekly planner helps you keep track of them all. Sit down at the beginning of the term and write out your class schedule or any other regularly occurring event, like extracurriculars. Then, as the semester goes on, schedule things like homework, studying, and relaxation. [10] X Research source Also include important dates and deadlines that might be included on your class syllabi, like upcoming tests or projects. A physical planner is handy, but you might also use your phone’s calendar app and schedule notifications to help remind you."

      "content": "Complete time-sensitive or difficult assignments first. When you have a lot of things on your plate, it can be hard to know where to begin. To avoid feeling overwhelmed or stuck, create a to-do list and put your most difficult or urgent assignments at the top. Once you’ve dealt with those, move on to smaller and less urgent items on the list. [11] X Research source For example, if you have a big math test coming up tomorrow, you might put reviewing for the math test at the top of your list. Reviewing this week’s French vocabulary words can go lower on the list."

Keep your textbooks, notes, handouts, school supplies, planners, and anything else you need together in one place so that you can find them easily when you need them. [13] X Research source To keep track of your notes, handouts, and assignments, try using a binder with different sections for each class. Set up a tidy, designated spot for doing school work so that your books and papers don’t end up scattered in different places."

For example, instead of thinking, “I hate math! I’ll never be good at it,” try replacing that thought with “This is really challenging, but if I work hard, I’ll keep getting better at it!” Scientists have found that keeping a positive attitude may actually help your brain’s memory center work better!"

Discuss study strategies with your teacher, or talk to your friends or family about how you’re feeling, and let them know if there are ways they can help. If you need extra help or don’t have a strong support network, find out if your school has a counselor you can talk to. [20] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Sometimes just talking to a friend about how you’re feeling can help you feel better. Don’t be afraid to ask for practical support, either. For example, you could say, “Mom, I’m really stressing about this test. Can you take a few minutes and quiz me with some questions from the review sheet?”"
