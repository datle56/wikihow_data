      "content": "Have period products with you at all times. If you really want to be prepared for your period at school, then the most important thing is to have pads, tampons, pantyliners, or whatever else you use on a regular basis with you throughout the school year, so you don’t have to worry about any unpleasant surprises. That way, you’re always prepared — and you can help out a friend who isn’t. You can also consider using menstrual cups, which are inserted into the vagina and collect blood at its base. They can last up to 10 hours, and you won’t be able to feel them. Though they aren’t as popular as tampons or pads yet, they are just as safe. If you have periods and you think that your period is going to come soon (according to your period cycle), it is always better to put on a pad or pantyliner just before going to school, just to avoid worries. Even if you don't put a pad or pantyliner on, always have extra underwear and pants handy. Period underwear is a reliable option when you are due your period and can give you a sense of security while also feeling comfortable. Never put in a tampon when you are not on your period. Not only will this be very difficult to do, it also increases your risk of infection. If you are concerned about the waste when using pads or pantyliners, you can get reusable ones. This will also give you a sense of security as you know you'll always have them."

      "content": "Understand that getting your period is nothing to be stressed about. When your period first comes, there should be a small amount, not a huge spurt of blood. Therefore, there is no reason to worry about your classmates discovering the fact that you have gotten your period. And there is no reason to worry about people hearing you open a pad or tampon in the bathroom either. Most people will likely ignore any rustling they hear, just like you probably do."

Ask that all bathrooms have facilities for disposing of used pads and tampons. And most importantly, ask that students are allowed one break per class so that they can go if they suddenly get their period."

For one thing, you can put them in your handbag, but if you can’t carry handbags in school, you can cleverly place them in your pencil case, tuck a pad into the pocket of your folder or binder, or even place a tampon down into your boots if you have no better options. If you think of some “hiding spots” in advance then you won’t be so nervous when your period comes. If you have a locker, use it. This will also be an easy place for you to keep your supplies all year long instead of having to bring them when your period comes."

It's unlikely that you will leak through your underwear and pants, but being prepared with an extra pair of underwear and pants or leggings in the event of an emergency will help you avoid worry. Just knowing that they are there if you need them will keep you from worrying about having your period or having a leak.

Wearing period underwear on your period, even in combination with another product can mean you don't need to worry about leaks."

If you tend to suffer from menstrual pain such as cramps, bloating, nausea, or any of the other symptoms that may accompany your period, then you can carry around some medicine just in case.

You can use acetaminophen, ibuprofen, Midol, or another form of over-the-counter medication that works best for you, but make sure it doesn't make you drowsy so you can't focus during school.

Not only will this keep you from being surprised in school, but it can also lead you to take precautions that can keep you from having an emergency, such as wearing a pantyliner or period underwear the week you’re expecting to get your period, just in case you get it a bit early. If you haven't started your period yet prepare for the first time, in case it's at school. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but can range from 21 to 45 days in teenagers and young adults. Mark the day your period starts on a personal calendar, or use a mobile app that helps you track your period, such as Clue, Period Tracker Lite, My Calendar, or Monthly Cycles. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you notice symptoms like these, it’s a good time to double-check your supplies. Make sure your “emergency” products are in their proper places, and restock your supply of menstrual products and pain relievers at home. Wear dark clothing when you expect your period draws near.

If you have no better options and find yourself in the bathroom when your period has just arrived, then your best bet may be to make an emergency pad. All you have to do is take a long piece of toilet paper and wrap it around your hand at least ten times until the pad is thick enough. Place it, lengthwise, in your underwear, and then take another long piece of paper and wrap it around the pad and your underwear another 8-10 times, until the pad is securely in place. You can repeat this one more time with another piece of toilet paper. Though this isn’t nearly as good as the real thing, it will do in a pinch. If you have your period but it’s really light, you can also make an emergency pantyliner. Just get a length of toilet paper about as long as the panty line of your underwear, fold it over itself two or three times, and place it in your underwear."

If you have one available, wrap a spare T-shirt, jacket, or sweatshirt around your waist, especially if you suspect menstrual blood has leaked through your clothing. This should help hide any dark stains until you can change clothing. If this is your first period, keep in mind that first periods generally aren’t super heavy, so it’s possible that you’ve noticed before the blood has leaked through your clothes. That being said, it’s still a good idea to take care of the issue as soon as possible to limit the risk of any leakage. If you discover that blood has leaked through your clothes, change into your PE kit (if available) or ask the school nurse or counselor to call your parents for a change of clothes. Don’t worry about classmates pointing out your sudden wardrobe change; if anyone questions it, you can casually tell them you spilled something on your pants and leave it at that.

You should carry around a water bottle or make sure to hit up the water fountains between classes as much as you can. Aim to get at least 10 8-ounce glasses of water throughout the day (80 oz). It can be tricky to drink a lot during school, but you can make sure to drink extra glasses before and after school. You can also try to incorporate foods with lots of water in them into your diet to make sure you stay hydrated. These foods include watermelon, strawberries, celery, and lettuce. Minimize your caffeine intake. Take it easy with your consumption of caffeinated soda, tea, or coffee. This can make you dehydrated and can actually make cramping worse."

Replace your soda with a water or an unsweetened iced tea and you may feel better. [8] X Research source Fatty foods make you retain water, which makes you feel bloated. You should also avoid whole grains, beans, lentils, cabbage, or cauliflower. Make sure you are still consuming enough calories, or otherwise it can make you feel faint or less energetic."

Though you may feel like the last thing you want to do is go to gym class, it’s been proven that exercise actually makes you feel better when you’re on your period. It’s been shown that aerobic exercise makes your body pump more blood, which lets it release endorphins to counteract the prostaglandins in your body, reducing your cramps and pain. Don’t be tempted to sit in the bleachers and get out there instead. Of course, if you’re really feeling terrible, you may need to take a break from exercise on a given day, but you’ll be surprised by how much better you feel. If you skip gym because of your period, you’ll be singling yourself out and calling attention to yourself, instead of doing what everyone else is doing and taking your mind off of your pain."

      "content": "Plan to take bathroom breaks every 2-3 hours. Before you start your school day, you can make a plan to hit up the bathrooms every 2-3 hours so you can change your products if your flow is heavy, or just make sure that everything is in working order. You may be nervous about leakage, and just having confirmation that everything is fine can make you feel better. Though you won’t need to change your tampon every 2 hours, you can aim to change it every 3-4 hours if you have a heavy flow; if your period is lighter, you may be able to go up to 5 or 6 hours but this is not recommended for tampons because it can lead to toxic shock syndrome. Also, to avoid this make sure to only wear the lowest absorbency you need. Taking bathroom breaks every 2-3 hours will also help you relieve your bladder more often. Relieving your bladder when you have the urge to use the restroom can help relieve the cramps associated with your period. Don't be alarmed if you find you have diarrhea on your period, this is a common thing that can happen on your period."

Avoid flushing tampons, applicators, pads, liners and wrappers in the toilet, the only things that should ever be flushed down toilets are pee, poop and toilet paper. Try to use the bathroom stalls with little bins in them; if you have those, you should still wrap up your tampons and pads with their original wrappers, toilet paper or personal disposal bags, so they are totally wrapped up. Remember it is someone's job to have to empty those stall bins and they should not come in contact with bloody period products. If you do not have a trash can in your stall, just wrap them up with toilet paper, original wrapper or personal disposal bag and throw them in the trash outside; don’t be shy about it, and remember that many students have to dispose of their menstrual products. Always make sure to wash your hands after you’ve changed your pad or tampon. While in theory 100% organic period products can be flushed, this is likely to clog up the toilet, so instead compost your organic products."

Though it’s unlikely that you’ll have a visible leak, you may want to wear darker clothes during the week of or before your period, just to keep yourself feeling secure. You can wear darker jeans or a darker dress just so you don’t have to worry about checking your backside or asking your friends to check for you every two seconds. Plan a few days of wearing darker colors if that makes you more comfortable. That said, don’t let your period keep you from wearing your favorite outfits.

However, your period itself will not smell; what you may smell is the odor-causing bacteria that can grow on a moist pad. To counteract this worry, you should change your pad every 2-3 hours when your period is at its heaviest or wear a tampon or menstrual cup, but change it regularly too. Some people like to wear scented tampons or pads, but this smell can actually be more powerful than the smell of unscented pads, so this can even irritate the vagina.

Remember that a lot of kids have to go through this and tell your parents/guardian when it happens; the sooner you tell them, the better you’ll feel. Your parents/guardians may be proud of you for telling them. You may be a little shy about telling a parent or guardian.

If you go into school with the mindset that it won’t be hard for you to use the restroom if you need to, then you’ll feel much more excited to go about your day. Ask your teachers if you can use the restroom in class with confidence, or even talk to your teachers about it in advance if that makes you more comfortable.
