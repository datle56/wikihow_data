      "title": "Measure out rice and water.",
      "content": "Measure out rice and water. Pour your desired measurement of rice into your pressure cooker. Add water according to the type and quantity of rice you are using. One cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water. [1] X Research source Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion. You can saute onions and garlic on low heat. Then add the rice and cook for a few minutes. After that, add water to the cooker. Or use coconut milk, scallions, and fish sauce. Never fill the pressure cooker more than halfway with the rice and liquid. Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like."

      "content": "Lock the cooker. Close and lock the lid on your pressure cooker by fastening the handle of the cover to the handle for the body of the pot, or however your model is intended to close according to the instruction manual. Place the cooker on a burner of your stove. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, plug it into an outlet and turn it on."

      "title": "Bring your pressure up.",
      "content": "Bring your pressure up. Set the burner on your stove to high heat until your pressure cooker indicates high pressure, then lower the heat to maintain this pressure for three minutes. Check your specific instruction manual for how to properly read the pressure on your cooker. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure for three minutes. The cooker will take a few minutes to pressure up before the three minutes of cooking time. [2] X Research source Lower the heat right away after your cooker reaches high pressure, otherwise your rice can become quickly overcooked."

      "title": "Release the pressure.",
      "content": "Release the pressure. When the three minutes cooking time is up, take the pressure cooker off the burner for a 10-minute natural pressure release, meaning the pressure built up inside releases naturally when taken off of heat. The rice will continue to cook while the pressure is slowly released. For an electric cooker, turn it off when the timer beeps and set it to a natural pressure release for 10 minutes.

      "content": "Open lid and fluff the rice. After 10 minutes of natural release, do a quick release on your pressure cooker to open the lid. Tilt the cooker away from you when opening the lid to avoid the hot steam. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve."

      "content": "Pour water into your pressure cooker. Pour one cup of water into your pressure cooker, or whatever is the minimum quantity required for your cooker to maintain pressure. Then place a steaming basket or other cooking rack into the bottom of the cooker. You may only need a trivet and not a steaming basket or other cooking rack to support the bowl or pot you will place inside the cooker."

Put your desired amount of rice into the bowl, and the correct amount of water for the quantity and type of rice (one cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water). [4] X Research source Choose a stainless steel bowl for ideal cooking, as it will conduct heat better than glass or ceramics. Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion. Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like."

Place bone-in chicken breasts in the pressure cooker and brown them slightly in oil over medium-high heat, without closing and locking the cooker. Then remove the chicken, pour out the remaining fat if you wish, and add in rice, the appropriate amount of water, and the chicken on top to pressure cook for 15 minutes. Add other seasonings like salt and pepper to the chicken, and add carrots or onions to cook in the leftover fat from the chicken, before you add the rice and chicken back in to pressure cook everything. Make sure to close and lock your pressure cooker when all ingredients are added, bring your burner to high heat to achieve full pressure, then lower the heat to maintain pressure. After 15 minutes cooking time, remove from heat and do a quick release of the cooker lid, tilting it away from you to avoid hot steam. [7] X Research source"
