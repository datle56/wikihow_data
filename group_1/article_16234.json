We want to determine which factor makes the polynomial equal zero when we substitute the factor for each \"x\" in the equation. Start by using your first factor, 1. Substitute \"1\" for each \"x\" in the equation: (1) 3 - 4(1) 2 - 7(1) + 10 = 0 This gives you: 1 - 4 - 7 + 10 = 0. Because 0 = 0 is a true statement, you know that x = 1 is a solution."

[7] X Research source Can you factor (x - 1) out of the x 3 ? No you can't. But you can borrow a -x 2 from the second variable; then factor it: x 2 (x - 1) = x 3 - x 2 . Can you factor (x - 1) out of what remains from your second variable? No, again you can't. You need to borrow another little bit from the third variable. You need to borrow a 3x from -7x. This gives you -3x(x - 1) = -3x 2 + 3x. Since you took a 3x from -7x, our third variable is now -10x and our constant is 10. Can you factor this? You can! -10(x - 1) = -10x + 10. What you did was rearrange the variables so that you could factor out a (x - 1) out of the entire equation. Your rearranged equation looks like this: x 3 - x 2 - 3x 2 + 3x - 10x + 10 = 0, but it's still the same thing as x 3 - 4x 2 - 7x + 10 = 0."

You can rearrange this to be a lot easier to factor one more time: (x - 1)(x 2 - 3x - 10) = 0. You're only trying to factor (x 2 - 3x - 10) here. This factors down into (x + 2)(x - 5)."

Plug 5 back into the equation: (5) 3 - 4(5) 2 - 7(5) + 10 = 125 - 100 - 35 + 10 = 0."
