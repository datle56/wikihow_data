Brain rot describes superficial or trivial online content, as well as the mental and intellectual effects of consuming that content. If you’re surfing social media all day long, you may experience some brain rot and need to do something more intellectually stimulating. [2] X Research source Origins: Believe it or not, Henry David Thoreau coined the word “brain rot” in Walden in 1854. He used it to describe the effects of society’s tendency to value simple ideas over more complex thought: “While England endeavours to cure the potato rot, will not any endeavour to cure the brain-rot—which prevails so much more widely and fatally?” [3] X Research source Example: TikTok is just full of brain rot. Gotta get outside and touch grass, bro."

This phrase isn't just pretty insulting to the person you're speaking to; it's also insensitive to fast food workers. So think twice before using it!

If you really want to insult someone, call them \"Skibidi Ohio rizz,\" which just means that they're ultra weird. Origins: Ohio as a synonym for “surreal” or “uncanny” stems from the Ohio memes that were popular in the early 2020s (like the one with the astronauts looking at the Earth from space and seeing that it’s “All Ohio”). Example: We stayed at a creepy old cabin in the woods all weekend. It was so Ohio."

      "content": "A jaw-strengthening beauty technique. \"Mewing\" describes the act of pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth to firm and reshape your jaw in an attempt to look good (don't do this). [6] X Research source Mewing as an activity has turned into a viral looksmaxxing trend on TikTok, but the word \"mewing\" may also be shorthand for \"looking good.\" Some people mew sincerely to try to reshape their jaw, but many youths do it ironically, or even as an excuse to get out of talking to someone, since you can't talk while you're mewing. Origins: Mewing as a beauty technique originated in the 1970s from failed orthodontist John Mew, but took off on social media in the early 2020s, when it was dubbed \"mewing\" in Mew's honor.

You can gain or lose aura points through your actions: e.g., tripping in front of your crush? Minus 20 aura points. Acing a test? Plus a million aura points! Example: Did you see Tommy pick his nose? Ugh, he's got such a negative aura."

    },
    {
      "title": "\"No joke\" or \"no lie.\"",
      "content": "\"No joke\" or \"no lie.\" Since \"cap\" means to brag, lie, or exaggerate about something, it stands to reason that “no cap” means the opposite. \"No cap\" may be added to the end of a sentence to express sincerity or for emphasis, to show you really mean something.

It's not typically used in a positive manner in this context, so it's best to stick to the musical meaning of the word! Example: Ugh, I can't stop listening to \"Pink Pony Club.\" That song is such a bop."
