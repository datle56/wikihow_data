      "content": "Enter the Nether. Finding and activating an End Portal requires ingredients you can only find in the Nether, Minecraft's underworld. Make a Nether portal and travel through it to get started. [1] X Research source To make a Nether Portal, place obsidian blocks in a rectangle 4 blocks wide and 5 blocks high, skipping the interior of the rectangle. If you are low on obsidian, you can skip the corners. Activate the lower obsidian blocks with a flint and steel. The Nether is a dangerous area. Prepare yourself with high quality food and enchanted diamond equipment. You may also want a shield , a bow and arrow , and wood to craft with."

      "title": "Kill blazes",
      "content": "Kill blazes to collect blaze rods. Blazes are yellow, floating monsters surrounded by smoke. They are only found in Nether fortresses — structures supported by pillars over a lava ocean. Defeat blazes and collect the blaze rods they drop. You'll usually need at least 5 blaze rods to find and activate the end portal, and it often takes 7 or more. [2] X Research source It's much easier to find Nether fortresses if you travel along the x-axis (east or west). Killing blazes is difficult, and the rods only drop if you kill them directly or with a tamed wolf. It helps to have an enchanted bow, or plenty of snowballs (it takes seven to kill 1 blaze)."

      "content": "Kill endermen to collect ender pearls. Endermen are the black, tentacled mobs that only attack when you look at them. If you don't have plenty of ender pearls yet, kill Endermen until you do. You'll need two ender pearls for each blaze rod. [3] X Research source This task is made less tedious if you have the Looting enchantment on a diamond sword as it will increase your chances of getting Ender Pearls. Endermen are found in the Overworld in groups of 1-4. They do spawn in the Nether, but at a very rare chance, in groups of 4. They spawn in light levels of 7 or less. Be careful when killing the Enderman, because they're powerful enough to kill you."

      "content": "Craft eyes of ender. Eyes of ender have the ability to locate end portals, and to activate them. You'll usually need at least 11 eyes of ender for this, often more. Craft them using these recipes: [4] X Research source Place a blaze rod in the crafting area to turn it into 2 blaze powders. Place a blaze powder and an ender pearl anywhere in the crafting area to make an eye of ender. [5] X Research source"

It will float up into the air, then travel a short distance horizontally in the direction of the nearest stronghold. (All end portals are found inside strongholds.) [6] X Research source In the Computer version of Minecraft, the closest strongholds are over 1407 locks away from the world's origin point. [7] X Research source Get to at least this distance before using any eyes of ender. The eye of ender will leave a faint purple trail behind as it moves, so you can follow it even if you lose sight of it. The eye of ender will only work in the Overworld, not the Nether."

To avoid wasting eyes of ender, walk at least 100 blocks before using an eye again. [9] X Research source Try to walk in the straightest line possible. If you keep your cursor on the eye as it floats, the direction you're pointed in should be perfect. Check your coordinates and keep the Facing as steady as you can."

The end portal is on top of the platform, with a border of green squares. Be prepared to fight silverfish on the stairway. [12] X Research source On Java Edition, every stronghold has a portal room. Only some strongholds have a portal room on Bedrock Edition. [13] X Research source Strongholds can have many rooms, which can sometimes be hidden behind walls. If you only find dead ends, dig around the surrounding area to find more rooms. [14] X Research source There's a small chance that another structure (such as a mineshaft) breaks into the portal room. If it destroys the portal, that portal is not usable and you will need to find another stronghold to get to the end."

To activate it, put an eye of ender into each of the 12 green squares (ender portal frames) around the portal. The portal usually spawns with a couple eyes of ender already attached, so you usually don't need to make all 12 yourself. [15] X Research source There’s about a 10% chance that a square will have an eye of ender in it already, so usually there will be one or two you don’t have to worry about."

Finding the intersection of the lines takes some trigonometry, but there are several online tools that will do the math for you. Try this one , or search online for \"minecraft stronghold locator.\" The tool should give you the x and z coordinates of the nearest stronghold. [20] X Research source Since the Computer edition has many strongholds, there's a small chance that the two eyes were pointing to different ones.

If you can't find an online tool, you can calculate the coordinates using these formulas: [21] X Research source Label one group of coordinates X 0 , Z 0 , and F 0 and the other group X 1 , Z 1 , and F 1 . If F 0 > -90, add 90 to get DEG 0 . If F 0 < -90, add 450 instead. Repeat with F 1 to get DEG 1 . This sets the f-values to between 0 and 360 degrees. Use a calculator to find S 0 = tan ⁡ ( D E G 0 ) {\\displaystyle S_{0}=\\tan(DEG_{0})} and S 1 = tan ⁡ ( D E G 1 ) {\\displaystyle S_{1}=\\tan(DEG_{1})} . Set the calculator to degrees, not radians.

[28] X Research source This is why it’s important to be prepared to fight the ender dragon once you travel through the portal. If you aren’t prepared, you’ll probably lose your items. If you want to play with friends from different devices, you can create servers to play with them. [29] X Research source For example, you can use a Minecraft pocket edition server .
