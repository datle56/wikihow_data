      "content": "The steam from a hot shower can help reduce coughing. Get in the shower and turn it on hot enough to generate steam without burning yourself. Make sure the bathroom door is closed to keep all the steam in. Feel free to do this for as long as is comfortable or multiple times a day. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Steam can also help make a dry cough more productive. If you feel like the steam loosens some mucus in your chest, try to cough it up to get rid of it. You can also just turn the shower on really hot and sit or stand in the bathroom breathing in the steam for a few minutes. All kinds of warm, moist air help relieve dry coughs. Dry coughs are irritated by cold, dry air."

Or, try a mixture of hot water, 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of honey. Warm herbal tea is a good option too. However, avoid black tea because the caffeine it contains can make you feel dehydrated. Hot broths, such as bone broth or chicken broth, can also help.
