      "content": "Lie face-up with your arms at your sides. Lay on a yoga mat and fully extend your legs with your toes pointing upward. Press your palms firmly into the floor to create stability. [1] X Research source If you don’t feel stable when you lift your feet, modify the exercise by sliding your hands face-down beneath your buttocks to anchor your arms closer to your body. [2] X Research source Relax your shoulders and neck to minimize the tension in your upper body. Stretching out on a lightly cushioned surface like a yoga mat or a carpeted section of the floor can make performing the exercise more comfortable."

      "content": "Bend your knees and draw them in toward your chest. Lift your feet and bend your knees into a 90-degree angle with your thighs perpendicular to the floor. Inhale as you contract your lower abdomen and bring your bent knees inward towards your chest. [3] X Research source If this exercise is too difficult, bend your knees a little bit more. Make sure your hips and butt are firmly rooted to the floor. They’ll act as a hinge for your thighs to swivel over."

      "title": "Lift your hips up off the mat, keeping your knees bent.",
      "content": "Lift your hips up off the mat, keeping your knees bent. When your knees are close to your face, push your hips up until your lower back barely lifts off the ground. Squeeze your abs at the top. Keep your head straight and your shoulders and neck relaxed. [4] X Research source This extra lift increases the overall range of motion, making the crunch more effective. If you struggle to lift your hips up, skip this step during your workout. Try to avoid rocking into the movement or extending your back too forcefully. You’re just looking for a tight vertical tilt to briefly engage your middle and upper abs."

      "title": "Lower your hips to the mat and return to the starting position.",
      "content": "Lower your hips to the mat and return to the starting position. Let your legs and hips come down in a slow, controlled manner, stopping when your thighs are perpendicular to the floor. Reverse the motion of your legs and raise your knees again to start the next repetition. You’ve just completed your first reverse crunch! [5] X Research source When you return to the starting position, take a split second to steady yourself and neutralize any momentum you’ve built up before moving into the next reverse crunch. Pausing momentarily will also give you a chance to catch your breath and assess your technique."

      "title": "Do 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.",
      "content": "Do 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. If you’re new to the world of reverse crunches, stick to only three sets of 10-15 reps. A rep (or repetition) is a single repetition of an exercise, while a set is a group of repetitions. In this case, you want to complete three groups of 10-15 reverse crunches, with 30-60 seconds of rest in between each rep. As you feel more comfortable with the exercise and gain more strength, increase the number of repetitions or the number of sets you perform. [6] X Research source If 10 to 15 is too many to start out with, try doing 8 each time until your abs get stronger. To minimize the chance of injury, try to put form above all else. Keep your movements slow and controlled, and breathe deeply as you move through the exercise."

It also works the hip flexors, the muscles responsible for lifting your legs towards your body. [7] X Research source Reverse crunches teach your body to transfer the energy and effort from your core to your legs and the other parts of your body, improving your ability to lift weight. This exercise may also strengthen your internal and external obliques, or the “side abs” from your hips to your ribs. [8] X Research source"

This is because you aren’t twisting or moving your spine to work your ab muscles. [14] X Research source Reverse crunches zero in on the bottom part of your abs, while regular crunches focus on the top and may risk neck pain if you move too quickly."

      "content": "Place both of your hands behind your head to increase the difficulty. Work your abs harder by placing your hands flat on the back of your head with your elbows tucked in. This will increase the pressure on your abs while supporting your head. [15] X Research source By comparison, placing your hands under your lower back may cause less ab involvement because it increases the arch in your back. [16] X Research source"

Bend your knees 90 degrees and pull them toward your chest. When you lift your hips, point your toes straight up toward the ceiling so your calves are perpendicular to the floor. [17] X Research source If this is too intense, try to straighten your legs so your feet are further than 90 degrees away from your butt."

Once you get to the point where you can do 10 to 15 reps with ease, gradually work your way up to 20 reps with 30 to 60 seconds of rest in between. Keep working until you get up to 3 sets. [18] X Research source The number of sets you do depends on your goals and the way the rest of your workout is structured. If your workout has a lot of other ab workouts, you may want to stick to 3 sets so you don’t overwork your core. If your goal is to get a 6-pack, Ajani says you can do crunches “one or two times per week, but you can probably see more progress with like five or six times per week.”"

Hold onto the object so your arms are completely outstretched. Bend your knees, then pull them toward your chest, curling your pelvis off the floor. [19] X Research source A decline bench with variable height settings can allow you to make the movement slightly easier if you're fatigued or struggling to make it through a full range of motion. Performing reverse crunches on a decline forces you to engage the muscles of your lower abs even more while taking the burden off your hip flexors."

Stay at the top of the pose for a few seconds, then drop down into the starting position as you breathe out. [21] X Research source After you do 5 repetitions, switch sides. As you bend upward, Thierot says to “think about pulling your stomach in.” In addition, “keep your head neutral and, if anything, lean in the other direction. Squeezing at the top [also] definitely makes it more effective.”"
