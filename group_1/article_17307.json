      "content": "Answer the questions you know the answers to first. Answer the questions that you’re certain of before you attempt others to be sure that you receive the marks allotted for these questions; this way, you avoid the regret of losing marks over time restraints. Try starting with a longer question that holds more weight, then move on to smaller questions that you are also sure about. Completing these questions correctly will help build your confidence for the rest of the exam.

      "content": "Avoid taking breaks and leaving early. Taking unnecessary breaks will only eat up your limited exam time; make sure you use the washroom, fill your water bottle, and so on, before you enter the examination room or hall. Do your best to focus, and avoid letting your mind wander. If you are finished or convinced that you can’t answer anymore questions, stay and review your exam instead of leaving. Attempting to address questions you don’t know the answer to may leave you with extra marks, while leaving them blank will guarantee you get nothing."

      "content": "Keep a close watch on the time. Check your watch or the nearest clock periodically to keep track of how much of the exam remains; to avoid looking up too often, check only when you finish a question or turn a page. If this is too distracting, take off your watch (or pull out your cellphone, if allowed) and place it directly in front of you. Note how long you are spending on each question and try to stick to the number of minutes you budgeted for each question; if you are taking too long on a question, flag it for later and move on."
