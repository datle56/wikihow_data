Before you can deposit a check with Cash App, a few requirements must be met: The check is made out to you, the same person that's on the Cash App account, or jointly, with an approved person. The check is payable in US Dollars. Since the Cash App works with US financial institutions, the money in the check must be in US currency. The check has been properly signed by the person or company issuing the check. The check equals or is less than your deposit limit. (For every Cash App account, each check has a limit of $3,500 with a total limit of $7,500 per month, and the app will tell you how much you have left before you reach your monthly limit). The check hasn't expired. There's usually a 90-day limit on checks. The check hasn't been deposited already. The check is unaltered. You have signed the check and written \"Cash App Deposit\" under your signature."
