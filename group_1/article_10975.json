Legs, arms, back, neck, nose and ear, and genital hair including between the crack of your bum this is called a Brazilian or Hollywood wax where you will be waxed on the shaft and base of your penis, scrotum and anus.

      "content": "Dress in a feminine fashion. [1] X Research source Attire is very important to achieve a feminine look, feminine fashion, is categorised more by color and by fit. Colors such as pink, lilac, and yellow are feminine colours and look great as underwear. For underwear avoid skimpy looking underwear such as g-strings and thongs, but adopt a more conservative image such as full brief, cheeky or bikini style. Don't forget to also have on your panties lots of feminine lace and dainty bows to complete the look. With underwear ALWAYS, AND I MEAN ALWAYS hand wash your bras and panties then hang them outside to dry. [2] X Research source For night wear, a pair of pretty panties and a lacy nightdress or baby doll will look so feminine yet so dainty, ensure that the panties and nightdress match and have lots of lace and bows to achieve your feminine appearance."

For tops avoid loose fitting items as they will decrease your bust and curvaceous shape."
