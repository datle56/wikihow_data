      "content": "Use purple shampoo and conditioner for gold- or yellow-toned patches. These products gradually tone areas that don’t mesh with the rest of your hair. It’ll take a few washes before you notice the difference, but keep at it, and you’ll see positive results. Apply the shampoo and conditioner 2-3 times a week whenever you wash your hair. [1] X Research source Toner doesn’t work on areas that you missed during the bleaching process; it only works on spots that received the bleach but just didn’t come out the right tone. So, if your natural (or pre-bleach) hair color is showing through anywhere, you’ll need to first spot-treat those sections with a bleach treatment."

      "content": "Calm down areas of warmer color with a toner application . A toner application is applied to your entire head and follows the same steps as a bleach application. If you did a bleach application at home, chances are your kit came with a post-bleach toner, too. Even if you already used toner after you bleached your hair, you can do a second round to even out discolored sections. [4] X Research source Always read the box and follow the instructions given. In general, leave the toner on your hair for 20 minutes max. Keep an eye on your hair and remove the toner when it looks like it’s evening out. [5] X Research source Toner gets rid of warm tones, so it’s incredibly helpful for orange, red, or yellow splotches. It’s also a less damaging process than bleaching your hair a second time, which is great."

      "content": "Wait 3-4 weeks before bleaching your hair a second time. It’s important to wait between bleach jobs so that you damage your hair as little as possible. You absolutely should not apply a second bleach job soon after the first one. [6] X Research source Divide your hair into sections when you apply the second round of bleach.

      "content": "Treat the spots you missed with targeted bleach applications. This process is helpful if there are patches of hair that you missed during the original bleach application. It’s a little risky because there’s a chance the newly-bleached hair won’t perfectly match the rest of your locks. It’s best to use this method for splotchy areas in less-visible parts of your hair, like under the top layer or in the back. Apply the bleach to those sections only, wait the same amount of time you did for the original bleach job, then rinse the bleach out. [8] X Research source If you think you want to use this method but feel nervous, try it out on a small area first to see how it goes. If it doesn’t work as well as you hoped, you can try something else with little harm done. This can be pretty time-consuming, as you'll have to weave out all the hair pieces that aren't light enough.

Wet your hair, then apply the bleach bath from the ends to your roots. Cover your hair with a shower cap for 15 minutes before washing and conditioning your hair just like you normally would. [10] X Research source A bleach bath is less aggressive than actually bleaching your hair a second time, but it still involves a lot of chemicals, so use caution if your hair is dry or damaged. Developer comes in different increments. The higher the developer, the harsher it’ll be on your hair. Use a 10-volume developer for the least abrasive option."

      "content": "Cover the splotchy bleach job with a darker hair dye for quick results. If your bleach job is so bad that you literally can’t imagine leaving your home, your best bet may be to simply cover it with a darker shade of hair dye. Take a look at the darkest patch on your head and go a shade darker, so it covers everything evenly. [11] X Research source For example, if your roots are orange-ish while the rest of your hair is blonde, choose a medium or dark brown to cover the orange. You won’t have the blonde hair you were hoping for, but hopefully, the new color can get you through until you can try bleaching your hair again."

On bleached hair, that can make already-damaged hair that much more vulnerable to frizz and breakage. If your hair isn’t too greasy or dirty, just wash your roots and ignore the rest of your hair. This targets the area that needs cleaned but doesn’t risk drying out the rest of your locks. Speaking of shampooing, arrange your hair-washing schedule so you’re sudsing up just 2 times a week. The less you wash, the less you’ll dry out your hair. [14] X Research source"

[17] X Research source Wrap your hair in a warm towel while the mask is doing its work—the heat will help the healing ingredients penetrate your hair more efficiently.
