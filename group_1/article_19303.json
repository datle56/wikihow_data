      "content": "Heed the scouts. The first sign of ants in your kitchen is a warning to you. Scout ants are wandering ants, either singular or relatively few in number. They investigate your kitchen for food and supplies. If these ants return to the nest to inform the other ants, more will be on the way. [2] X Research source Waste no time: Cleaning your kitchen Sealing all food and removing all sources of sticky, sweet, greasy, and meaty foods from their access. Spread Diatomaceous Earth, some what heavily, along all of the edges (entry points) of the room. This will cut the exoskeleton of the ant, causing it to dry up and die in a matter of hours."

Wipe down all of your cupboard, benchtop, and counter surfaces with vinegar . Vinegar not only cleans and disinfects, it is also an ants deterrent. Remove all sources of garbage and keep the kitchen bin shut tightly. Rinse all recyclable containers before putting them into storage. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sweep and vacuum the kitchen area daily. Food that's fallen on your floor or been lost in your kitchen's nooks and crannies will be an open invitation to ants. Crumbs and bits of food that have gotten caught in kitchen area rugs will attract ants in the same way. If you're prone to forgetting to sweep and vacuum your kitchen area, you might want to try getting into the habit of doing it at the same time every day, like after breakfast or dinner."

Place your honey jar and any other sugary ant favorites inside a bowl of water. For more details on the bowl of water technique, check out How to keep ants out of honey and How to keep ants away from cat food ."

      "title": "Seal all food items in containers.",
      "content": "Seal all food items in containers. Use airtight containers or similar ant-proof containers for food storage. Be relentless with this for 3 to 7 days. The ants, having nothing to eat, will go elsewhere. This works because the ants are following the chemical trails left by other ants, who did find food. [4] X Research source You may also need to seal fragrant items such as cleaning powders, deodorants, and the like in case these attract the ants' initial attention. Be alert to any congregations of ants around non-food sources."

      "content": "Identify ant access points. While you clean your kitchen and get on ant scout patrol, do some scouting work of your own. Can you tell where the ants are entering the house? Follow the first ants to see where they're entering and leaving. Popular routs of ingress for ants include things like gaps in the woodwork, cracks in cement, vents, screens, cracks in the floorboards, and so on. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Seal all entrance holes with silicone caulk . Alternatively, you can use putty, glue or plaster. Temporary methods of blocking ant access to your home include petroleum jelly or poster tack. If you use a temporary sealant (such as poster tack), only use this until you can purchase a more permanent solution, as it will deteriorate over time and the gap will open again.

      "content": "Arm yourself with a spray bottle of soapy water . Soapy water will both kill ants and destroy their chemical trail. This will prevent more ants from following in their tracks. [7] X Research source This cheap and easy method consists simply of: Putting one teaspoon of liquid dish soap into a spray bottle and filling it with water. Add mint oil, citrus peels, or citrus rind oil to make this spray extra potent. [8] X Research source Spritzing the ants you see with the solution in your spray bottle."

      "content": "Put up defensive barriers. Many of the products that form these natural ant barriers are probably already in your kitchen; they just need to be deployed properly. A barrier doesn't need to be wider than a Â¼ of an inch (6.35mm) but it must form an unbroken line. [9] X Research source Use barriers on places like sills, floors, counters, and around ant access points. Some of the items with which you can form barriers include: [10] X Research source Powdered charcoal A line of chalk Turmeric Cinnamon Citrus oil Black pepper, cayenne pepper, or red chili pepper. Petroleum jelly (great for doors and windows) Baby powder Powdered cleanser White vinegar and water Desiccating dusts (such as diatomaceous earth or silica aerogel)"

      "content": "Sprinkle around deterring odors. Ants dislike various scents. Some of these include peppermint, camphor, and garlic. [11] X Research source These can be used fresh or in oil form as a deterrent for ants in an area of your home. Use camphor with caution, as it is poisonous to humans and animals. The great thing about these fragrant deterrents is that your own preferences for scent can be used to improve the overall smell of your household odors. Sprinkle crushed mint leaves in ant infested rooms and grow mint near the entrance areas. Dried peppermint is also effective. [12] X Research source Rub a raw clove of garlic over ant trails and entrances. Sprinkle lavender oil in ant afflicted areas and grow lavender near their entrances. Spread some oil of clove in ant zones or crush cloves and sprinkle it as a barrier."

It's also pet safe, making this a great option if you have animals. Sprinkle Splenda over the trails of any ants you see. Once the ants consume the Splenda, they should die shortly after the fact. Be sure to replenish your Splenda as necessary."

      "content": "Use coffee grounds. Spread coffee grounds on ant hills and along your house foundation. This safe material confuses the worker ants because they lose their scent trails. This causes the hatched young in the ant colonies to have no food and starve. Be persistent and patient with your use of grounds. It may take a season before you start noticing an effect. It is important to reapply grounds every year, at minimum. Refreshing grounds more frequently will have a stronger, more immediate effect."

Spread a thin line of this liquid along area where ants are coming in. This technique is a great solution for dealing with ants that are invading windowsills."

      "content": "Create your own ant baits with boric acid and maple syrup. You can buy ant baits, but those will likely be chemical preparations that don't fit well with natural attempts to control ants in the home. It's easy to make your own ant baits. A particularly effective one is made with boric acid. Boric acid and sodium borate salts are naturally found in minerals like sassolite. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source When ants walk in or over boric acid, they ingest it and die. Boric acid is poisonous and should not be ingested or come in contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Handle it with gloves. [16] X Research source A sample boric acid bait could be made with boric acid and maple syrup. Drizzle a spoonful of syrup on a plate or saucer. Sprinkle this liberally with boric acid. Use a skewer, toothpick, or cotton swab to distribute the acid evenly through the syrup. Place your boric acid bait wherever the ants are frequenting. Keep it out of the reach of children or pets. This method can take a week to take effect. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Use food against ants. There are many foods ants are unable to digest. These methods are effective, though you might have to clean up dead ants after the fact. Spread the following bait foods where the ants are appearing: Corn meal. This method is especially great around pets or children, as cornmeal itself is not poisonous. Cream of wheat (farina). Spread this raw where there are ants. It will expand in their stomachs, killing them. Coffee grounds. Ants are sensitive to caffeine. Leave used coffee grounds where the ants will carry it home and eat it. This method takes a few weeks for results."

Piles of broken wings and ants with longer than average bodies are indications of carpenters. You may also see fecal pellets (which look like sawdust) and they can sometimes be heard rustling in the walls. Some ways to deal with them include: [18] X Research source Baiting them. They like sugar, so you can turn this against them. Use the boric acid method described previously. Vacuuming their nests out of infested walls, if possible. Calling an exterminator. Professionals can drill holes in the wall and blow in diatomaceous earth, silica aerogel, or boric acid inside to eliminate the infestation. Pyrethrin spray can also be used."
