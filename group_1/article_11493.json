      "content": "Start with a simple bounce by using your knees. Bend your knees, bringing your whole body a bit lower to the floor. Unbend your knees, moving your body back upwards. Repeat this movement up and down, maybe adding a head bounce to it as you do. Bend your knees down on the downbeat and up on the upbeat. [2] X Research source The downbeat is likely what you think of as the main beat. The upbeat is between downbeats. So if you've heard a dance count \"5, 6, 7, 8,\" the numbers are the downbeat."

As you step out, bring your body upright, then dip down again as you bring your other leg over. Straighten back up when your foot does the \"touch\" motion. [4] X Research source Don't exaggerate the dipping too much. It's just supposed to be a little dip. This move just creates a light bouncing motion, which you can do in time with the music."

Avoid accidentally hitting people with your arms and elbows, for instance, by keeping your dance moves under control. Keep in mind that you're packed in with a crowd of people.
