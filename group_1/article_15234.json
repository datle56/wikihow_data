      "content": "Identify the shade “level” of your hair. Hair levels are judged on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being black and 10 being the lightest blonde. As a reference point, level 5 is considered to be light brown. Examine your current hair color and rate it based on this scale. Level charts can help you determine your level if you still aren’t sure. Type “shade range hair level” into a search engine to bring up the info you need."

      "content": "Choose a color 1-2 shades from your current color if it’s already brown. Compare you current hair color to the color on the box to find a color that is within 2 shades of your current hair color. This will help to ensure that your results look more natural. Also, keep in mind that you may want to bleach your hair first if it’s black or very dark brown. [1] X Research source If you're dyeing your hair brown from a lighter color, you may need to use a medium-tone filler color to prevent your hair from turning muddy or brown."

      "content": "Identify the colors you wear most often to determine your skin tone . Light brown hair dyes come in warm and cool tones, and one might work better for you than the other depending on your skin tone. For example, if you have warm skin tone, then a warm-toned light brown dye would probably work best. However, if you have a cool skin tone, then a cool-toned light brown would best compliment your skin tone. The items in your closet can help you to decide which tones look best on you if you’re unsure. [3] X Research source For example, you may want to go for a warm shade of light brown, such as honey or golden, if you wear a lot of warm colors, such as red, yellow, orange, and brown. Or, you may want to opt for a cool shade of light brown, such as ash, if you wear a lot of blue, lavender, pink, and grey. Work with a hair stylist to determine what hair color would look best with your skin tone."

Get everything together that you will need to dye your hair and place newspaper over your bathroom counter and floor to protect it from any dye that might drip down. Put on an old T-shirt, a hairdresser’s cape, or a towel around your shoulders to protect your clothing. Then, put gloves on your hands to protect them from the dye. Some other items you might want to have out include: [4] X Research source Lip balm or petroleum jelly to apply around your hair line. Makeup remover wipes or a damp washcloth to remove any hair color that gets on your skin. A hair color application brush to make it easier to distribute the color."

      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 or more sections. Use a comb to part your hair down the center going from the crown down to the nape of your neck. Then, divide those sections in half by making a part that goes from ear-to-ear across the top of your head. Use hair clips to keep the sections in place as you work. [5] X Research source If your hair is thick or long, divide each of the 4 sections in half again."

Use your gloved fingers or a color application brush to “paint” the mixture onto each section of your hair going from the roots to the tips. Make sure you saturate each section of your hair with the dye to avoid a patchy appearance. Continue until all of your hair is saturated with the dye. [6] X Research source Try using 2 mirrors to make it easier to see the back of your head while you dye your hair. Stand in front of a mounted mirror, such in your bathroom, and use a handheld mirror to look at the back of your head."

After applying the dye, you will be able to see the color develop gradually to your desired shade of light brown. Set a timer for the amount of time indicated by the dye instructions to avoid leaving it on for too little or too much time. [8] X Research source Check the dye's instructions for maximum set time, which is usually 30 minutes. Dyes stop developing after the max time elapses. Leaving it on past that time will not do anything. [9] X Research source"

Do not shampoo your hair after rinsing it out. However, if your dye kit came with a conditioning packet, you may apply the conditioner to your hair, leave it in for 3-5 minutes, and then rinse it out with cool water to help seal the hair cuticle and lock in your color.

      "content": "Use a clarifying shampoo if the color turned out darker than you wanted. If your color did not yield the desired shade of light brown and you ended up with a medium or dark brown instead, using a clarifying shampoo right after dyeing your hair may help to lift some of the color and give you the desired shade. Shampoo your hair as you normally would with the clarifying shampoo, rinse thoroughly with warm water, and then condition your hair and rinse with cool water to close your hair cuticle. [11] X Research source You can purchase a clarifying shampoo in the beauty section of a drug or grocery store."

      "content": "Wait at least 2 weeks to dye your hair again if it’s not dark enough. This is more likely if you bleached your hair before dyeing it or if you opted for a dye color that was too light. If your hair color turned out lighter than the box shade, then you may be tempted to dye it again right away. However, it is best to wait for at least 2 weeks before re-dying your hair. This will help to prevent damage to your hair from over-treating it. [12] X Research source You may want to select a darker shade to get the desired color of brown. If a second dye job does not result in the desired shade of light brown, see a hair stylist! Don’t dye it a third time."

      "content": "Shampoo and wet your hair as little as possible to protect the color. Water alone causes color to fade after you dye it, but certain shampoo can also fade your color more quickly than others. For maximum protection against fading, use a color-protecting shampoo, such as one that is sulfate-free, and only shampoo your hair 2 times per week. Wear a shower cap to prevent your hair from getting wet and use dry shampoo to freshen up your hair between washes. [13] X Research source Make sure to use a color protecting conditioner every time you shampoo your hair as well. When you do wash or rinse your hair, use cool water to prevent the color from bleeding."
