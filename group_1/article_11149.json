      "content": "Brush the wig to remove all the tangles before curling it. It's best to use a wig brush, which is designed to remove tangles from wigs. Move the wig brush through the wig, starting at the lower end of the strands and moving up the length of the hair as you brush. [1] X Research source If you don't have a wig brush, use a wide-tooth comb, which will detangle the hair more easily than a hair brush or a comb with closer-set teeth."

      "content": "Wrap a small section of hair around one roller at a time. The section should be no bigger than 2 inches (5.1 cm). Roll it all the way up to the root while keeping the hair as neat as possible. Clip the roller in place using the roller’s latch. Continue this for each section of hair in that bottom track of hair until it’s all rolled up. Keep the curls as neat as possible so you get a clean ringlet look when you unroll it. If the roller doesn’t stay in place, re-roll the hair tighter. Repeat with the rest of the sectioned off hair until it’s secured in curlers."

      "content": "Apply heat to the rollers with a blow dryer, if your wig is natural hair. Turn the heat setting on warm and airflow on high. Hold the blow dryer on each roller for no longer than 60 seconds. If you use too much heat, the curls will look messy with stray hairs sticking out. If your wig is made of synthetic hair, DO NOT apply heat to it. The heat will melt synthetic hair, ruining your wig."

      "content": "Place your wig on your head or a mannequin head. You can curl your wig while it's in place on your head, if you like. This allows you to create exactly the style you want. However, it might be easier to curl the wig on a mannequin head, especially when you're styling the back of it."

      "title": "Heat the curling iron.",
      "content": "Heat the curling iron. A good heat setting to start with on a curling iron is 180 °F (82 °C), because it’s low enough where it won’t cause damage, but it still curls the hair. Do a heat test on a small patch of the wig at the base of neck or an under layer, because this is a discrete place where no one will notice any damage. Avoid hair that goes around the face or from a top layer. If the curling iron is too hot, the wig will either frizz out or melt. [2] X Research source Read the label of all wigs or synthetic hair to see if it can tolerate heat."

      "content": "Comb out the wig so it’s free of tangles. It’s much easier to curl hair when it’s tangle free. To brush it, use a wig brush or wide-tooth comb, which will detangle hair a lot easier than a hair brush or a comb with closer-set teeth. Move the wig brush or comb through the wig starting at the lower end of the strands and move up the length of the hair as you comb. [3] X Research source You can also soak your wig in a bowl of cold water and 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of shampoo to detangle it. This alternative can also clean the synthetic fibers. Don’t stretch, pull, or rub the wig against itself, as this can tangle it further. Just swirl it around the bowl. When you empty the bowl, refill it with cold water and conditioner and repeat the swirling process."

Some curling irons require you to wrap the section of hair starting at the top or bottom of the hair, depending on whether you’re using a curling wand or a curling iron with tongs. [6] X Research source Wands come with a protective glove for your hand, because you have to hold the hair in place on it. Curling irons with tongs will hold hair in place once it’s secured in the metal grip of the iron."

If you don’t have wooden dowel rods, use another heat-safe tool, such as a wooden spoon. You can also use perm rods to curl the wig, because they have rubber bands to stay secure in the hair.

If you want to speed up the process, use a blow dryer, but keep it on the lowest heat setting. If your wig is made of synthetic materials, only use the lowest heat setting and be cautious, as you can damage the wig. For a natural hair wig, you can usually use a higher heat setting on your blow dryer without damaging the wig. You can also hang the wig on a wire with clothespins to let it dry.
