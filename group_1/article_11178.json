      "content": "Place the cable in the cable guide of the cutter. Under the blade of the cable cutters, you'll see an open space that should be about the width of the cable. This is where you insert the cable so that the blade can come down and cut it. [4] X Research source www.commscope.com/Docs/Interlocking_Armor_Fiber_Optic_II.pdf"

Line up the mark that's 6 in (15 cm) from your measurement mark with the handle of the cutters. [5] X Research source www.commscope.com/Docs/Interlocking_Armor_Fiber_Optic_II.pdf Some blade cutters will have small arrows above the cable guide to show you where to line up your mark. If your cutters have this arrow, line up your mark using it."

Once your cable is in the cable guide and lined up, turn the screw to the right until it pushes up against the bottom of the cable and secures it in the guide.
