The angle between 2 vectors is where the tails of 2 vectors, or line segments, meet. [1] X Research source Each vector has a magnitude, or length, and a direction that it’s heading. So, to find the angle between 2 vectors, you use the above formula where: [2] X Research source θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } is the angle between the vectors. c o s − 1 {\\displaystyle cos^{-1}} is the inverse of cosine, or the arc cos. u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} • v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} is the dot product of vector u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} and v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} . || u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} || || v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} || is the magnitude of vector u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} and v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} ."

      "content": "Identify the vectors’ coordinates in your math problem. Most math problems give you the dimensional coordinates of each vector, which are sometimes also called components. You use each vector’s coordinates to find their magnitudes and combined dot product. If your math problem already gives the vectors’ magnitudes, skip the magnitude step below. [3] X Research source For example, find the angle between vector u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} and vector v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} . Vector u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} has coordinates at (2, 2) and vector v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} has coordinates at (0, 3). Sometimes, vectors are written as u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} = 2 i + 2 j and v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} = 0 i + 3 j . While our example uses two-dimensional vectors, finding the angle between 3-dimensional vectors follows the same steps."

      "content": "Calculate the magnitude of each vector. Picture a right triangle drawn from the vector's x-component, its y-component, and the vector itself. The vector forms the hypotenuse of the triangle, so to find its magnitude, simply use the Pythagorean theorem . Just plug each vector’s coordinates into the theorem. [4] X Research source In the Pythagorean theorem of a 2 + b 2 + c 2 , the vector’s magnitude is denoted by c. So, just rewrite the equation to isolate the magnitude on one side: || u || = √(u 1 2 + u 2 2 ) with u 1 2 + u 2 2 being the vector’s x and y coordinates. Using our example, find the magnitudes for vector u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} at (2, 2) and vector v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} at (0, 3). Insert u → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {u}}} coordinates into the theorem: √2 2 + 2 2 = √8 = 2√2. So, || u || = 2√2. Find v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} magnitude: √0 2 + 3 2 = √9. So, || v → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {v}}} || = 3. If a vector is 3-dimensional or has more than 2 components, simply continue adding +u 3 2 + u 4 2 + … to the Pythagorean Theorem."
