Make your fold so that the edge of the triangle that's closest to the center of the rectangle moves up so that it's parallel to the long side of the rectangle. If you do this with both triangles, you will create something that looks like an \"S\" turned 90 degrees counterclockwise. If you fold the triangles inward, you will get a rectangle, and this is wrong."
