      "title": "Select a size based on your hair’s strength and the look you want.",
      "content": "Select a size based on your hair’s strength and the look you want. There are 3 basic braid sizes for this look—micro, normal, and jumbo. Normal-sized braids are approximately the width of a pencil, so if you want jumbo braids, you can go with any size larger than that. Make your choice based on the current condition of your hair and the look you’re trying to create. The larger you make your jumbo braids, the heavier they will be. If your hair isn’t in the best condition right now, it's best to keep your jumbo braids on the smaller side of the spectrum. Micro braids are anything thinner than the width of a pencil. Like jumbo braids, micro braids can also vary in size slightly."

      "title": "Choose a braid length based on the hairstyles you want to create.",
      "content": "Choose a braid length based on the hairstyles you want to create. If your natural hair is already your ideal length, you’re all set. If you want your braids to be longer or thicker than your natural hair, you’ll need to purchase hair extensions. Human hair extensions are the best choice, but they’re also the most expensive option. Make your decision based on what you can afford. For example, waist-length box braids are a popular look, but most people don’t have waist-length hair naturally! You'll need extensions for this look. Bob-length box braids are a popular style choice, as well. Depending on the length of your hair, you may not need extensions for this look. Remember to factor in your hair's strength. The longer the braids are, the heavier they’ll be."

      "title": "Buy hair extensions that match the current texture of your hair, if needed.",
      "content": "Buy hair extensions that match the current texture of your hair, if needed. If your hair is relaxed, remember to buy extensions that are straight and silky so that they can be woven seamlessly into your natural hair. If your hair is thick and coarse, or if you want a kinkier, more undone look, make sure your extensions have a similar texture. [1] X Research source Choose weft bundles that are similar to the braid size you're going for, since you'll be using 1 weft bundle per braid. You will add the extensions during the braiding process, so if you have extensions currently installed, you'll need to take them out and start fresh with new ones. You may want to examine your hair and the extensions side by side to make sure the textures match before you buy anything. For a fun look, consider hair extensions in an eye-catching color like pink or blue. Make these decisions before you start braiding for the best results."

      "title": "Wash and condition your hair",
      "content": "Wash and condition your hair as you normally would. It’s important to shampoo your hair within 24 hours before you install your braids so that you start off with a clean base. Use a moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to prevent dry hair, since brittle strands are prone to damage during the braiding process. Then, towel dry your hair gently to get rid of excess water. [2] X Research source When you're shopping for shampoo and conditioner, check the label to find options that contain hydrating natural oils like coconut or argan oil. If you want extra hydration, consider doing a hot oil or deep conditioning treatment right before you shampoo and condition your hair. [3] X Research source"

Apply the leave-in conditioner from root to tip, concentrating on the ends the most. Then, start combing your hair out, starting at the ends, and slowly work your way up to the roots until you’ve removed all knots and tangles. [4] X Research source Work slowly and in small sections as you detangle, taking care to be as gentle as you can with your hair."

If you have relaxed hair and you’re trying to create a straight, silky look with your braids, it helps to blow dry your hair first. [5] X Research source Be sure to apply a heat protectant and use the lowest heat setting to prevent hair damage. If desired, apply a silkening serum to dried hair to tame fly-aways and control frizz."

Then, divide the hair from ear to ear across the crown of your head to create a total of 4 sections, or quadrants. Leave one of the front sections loose and clip the other 3 sections out of the way for now. [6] X Research source Always section your hair beforehand so it's easier to work with.

Use the rattail comb to create clean parts and aim for sections that are uniform in size. [8] X Research source It can help to imagine the hair in columns or in a grid when you’re sectioning it off."

      "content": "Refine the sections with hair wax and tie each one off with an elastic. For a super clean look, perfect the sections and create clean edges by applying a little wax or gel to each section of hair separately. Twist the hair a little as you apply the wax or gel from root to tip. Then, wrap a hair elastic around the end of each section so they stay separated from each other while you work. Use the product sparingly, since applying too much can cause problems with buildup later on! Some people prefer to skip the product because of this reason, but it’s up to you. [9] X Research source"

Complete a regular braid by crossing the right section over the middle section, then crossing the left section over the middle section, and continuing to cross the right and left sections over the middle section until you reach the tips of your hair. Braid the hair firmly but don't pull on it or create tension at the scalp. [12] X Research source Avoid braiding your hair too tightly, since this can cause scalp pain and irritation later on. If the edges or your scalp feel tight or sore, the braids are too tight. If your braids end up being too tight despite your best efforts, don't worry—there are ways you can loosen them . If your braids tend to unravel, secure the ends with a hair elastic until you seal them."

Briefly dip the ends of your braids in the water—it will melt the extension hair just enough to fuse them together so your braids won't come unraveled. If you secured your ends with hair elastics, take the elastics out before you dip your ends so you don't burn the elastic into your hair as well. Some people also burn the ends quickly with a lighter to seal them. If you’ve used this technique before and feel comfortable with it, feel free to use it for this."
