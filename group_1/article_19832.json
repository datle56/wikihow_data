However, if you haven't spoken to him to get your previous Pokédex completion rewards, you'll have to claim those before you can get the Shiny Charm. Once you have the Shiny Charm, you have a permanent passive buff that increases your chance of finding shiny Pokémon. You don't need to activate or equip the charm at all to use it."

To connect Scarlet/Violet to HOME, open HOME, select Pokémon on the home screen, and then select the Scarlet or Violet tile. HOME will ask if you want to connect this game; select Yes to connect.

If you have Pokémon stored in your HOME that can be transferred to Scarlet/Violet, they will satisfy the catching requirement for your Paldea Pokédex. If you have both copies of Scarlet and Violet, you can use HOME to transfer version exclusives over without needing to trade with another user. If you have all of the Pokémon in the Paldea Pokédex in your HOME and transfer them into a new game of Scarlet/Violet, the earliest you can get the Shiny Charm is right after you get Koraidon or Miraidon, according to users on Reddit.
