      "content": "Know what Pokémon types Charmeleon is weak against. This is very important when you're trying to evolve Charmeleon. As a Fire-type Pokémon, it is weak against Ground and Rock-types, such as Onix and Dugtrio, and Water-types, like Squirtle and Gyarados. Charmeleon will take twice the damage from these types as it normally gets from other types. If you use Charmeleon against these Pokémon, you'll have a hard time winning, thus reducing the experience points (XP) you can gain for every battle."
