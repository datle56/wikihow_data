      "content": "Share a cringey-gross pickup line to make them laugh. Some cringey pickup lines are just plain disgusting. Only use them if you’re supremely confident in your rizz . If not, Keegan says to forget a line and ask them a question based on observation. For example, if they’re carrying a book, say something like, “Hey, I was thinking about reading that book. What do you think of it?” If you want to go for the gross-out, try one of these: “You must be a booger because I would pick you first.” “Did you just fart? Because you blow me away!” “You must be jelly. Because jam does not shake like that!” “My love for you is like diarrhea. I just can't hold it in.” “Your eyes are as blue as toilet water.” “Are you poop? Because even when you’re far away, I can smell you.” “Just like I never play with garbage, I promise you that I will never play with your heart.” “I'd drink your bathwater.” “I just pee’d in my bed.

      "content": "Cautiously use lines that are cringey to the point of insulting. There’s a weird sub-set of pickup lines that try so hard to be clever that they actually insult the person you’re trying to pick up. These lines can work if the other person has the right sense of humor. If they don’t, you might strike out big time. If you think these lines are funny and want the type of person who won’t be offended by them, go ahead and shoot your shot! “Are you trash? Because I want to take you out.” “You must be a dog because you look fetching.” “You remind me of my brother/sister.” “Are you a fire alarm? Because you are really loud and annoying!” “Hey, you dropped something. My standards.” “Did you fall from heaven? Because so did Satan.” “You look a lot like my next bad decision.” “Are you pi? Because you're being irrational, and this conversation is going in circles.” “This must be puppy love I’m feeling toward you! You remind me of my dog.” “The more I drink, the more good-looking you get.” “Are you crippling depression and anxiety? Because you haunt me at every waking hour.” “Are you a piece of trash? Because as someone who cares deeply about the environment, I’m obligated to pick you up.” “Whenever I see kites flying in the sky, I think of you. Just like them, you’re only beautiful at a distance.” “I can’t help but gravitate toward you. It must be your incredible mass that’s creating the gravitational pull.” “You’re like a low-life bandit. I’ll give you everything, so please don’t hurt me.”"
