As you step back with your foot, lift up your other foot that’s in front of you. Then place your front foot back down and step back into your starting position. Your upper body should feel like it’s rocking backward, then forward. [1] X Research source For example, to do a rock step with your right foot, step back with your right foot and lift your left foot (which hasn’t moved from your starting position) a few inches above the ground. Then put your left foot back down and step back into your starting position."
