You can make your chain as long or as short as you would like it to be as long as it is a multiple of five. For example, you could make a chain of 25, 50, or 100 stitches. To chain , yarn over twice, and pull the first loop through the second loop. Yarn over your hook again and pull through. Repeat until your chain is the desired length. [1] X Research source"
