      "content": "This error means the computer can't communicate with the printer. Here are some specific causes for the error: Faulty drivers. Sometimes manufacturers rush to patch security exploits and release a driver that has unresolved bugs or glitches. The fix for this is rolling back your driver to the previous version. Outdated drivers. Old drivers eventually stop working. The best fix is to update them and make sure they stay updated. Corrupted drivers. Malware, hardware bugs, unexpected shutdowns, or other software can corrupt your drivers. The fix for this is to get rid of any malware, and reinstall the driver. Outdated operating system. Just like old drivers can be incompatible with a newer OS, the opposite is the same. Make sure you're using the latest version of your operating system to avoid getting these errors. Windows updates. Sometimes these updates can change how your system works, including your printer. The best fix in this case is uninstalling the Windows update until the printer updates. Incorrect installation. It's easy to install the wrong driver when you're doing it manually. Or maybe you do have the right driver, but you installed it incorrectly. The best fix for this is to try again or let your OS install the driver for you."
