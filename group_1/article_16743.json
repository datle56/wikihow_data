      "content": "Make an iron pickaxe or better . You will need an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe in order to mine gold ore. [1] X Research source You will need 2 sticks and 3 iron or diamonds in order to make a pickaxe. Open a crafting table and place the 2 sticks on top of each other starting at the bottom of the middle column. Then, fill the top row with the iron or diamonds. An iron or diamond pick is pretty much all you need to mine gold, since getting a netherite pickaxe is way more difficult: you will need to go to the nether, find 4 pieces of ancient debris and mine them with a diamond pickaxe, smelt the ancient debris in a furnace (to get the netherite scraps), combine the scraps with gold ingots to make a netherite ingot, and finally upgrade the diamond pickaxe using a smithing table."

      "content": "Dig down to Y-level 32 or below. Hold your pickaxe, face the block you want to mine, and hold right click until it breaks. Make sure you mine down at an angle, making a staircase like formation as you go, as this will prevent you from falling into caves or lava. If you're playing on Pocket Edition, tap and hold on the block to break it. If you're playing on a console or with a controller, hold the right trigger. If you're going through caves instead, make sure to leave a trail of torches behind you. This will help you find your way back out. However, in version 1.18 and above, gold is less likely to generate when exposed to air, so going caving for gold is less likely to turn up much. You can also stand in the middle of two blocks and alternate breaking each one. However, you'll have to pillar back up or use ladders later."

You can check your current altitude by pressing F3 on Java Edition, checking a map in the console edition, or enabling the “Show Coordinates” world option in Bedrock Edition. The Y-coordinate tells you your altitude. Here are the best layers to look for gold: [3] X Research source Layer 28 is the highest and usually safest layer where you'll find the maximum amount of gold pre-1.18. Pre-1.18, layers 11–13 are the best places to look for gold and diamonds at the same time. Try to avoid digging below layer 10, where lava becomes much more common. In version 1.18 and higher, gold is most commonly found at Y-level -16, with gold becoming less common toward either end of its range."

Gold ore typically spawns in groups of four to eight blocks. [4] X Research source This means you'll find almost all of the gold if you keep three solid blocks between each tunnel. To find every single gold block, keep two solid blocks between each tunnel. However, this is a much slower method."

When you find some, hold your pickaxe, face the ore, and hold right click until it breaks. When it breaks, it will drop a piece of raw gold. If you're playing on version 1.16 or below, or using a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch, it will drop a block of gold ore. If you're playing on Pocket Edition, tap and hold on the block to break it.

If you are playing on Java Edition, have cheats enabled on your world and are having a hard time finding a badlands biome, you can use commands to find one.

Some chests in villages may contain gold ingots as loot, especially the blacksmith’s chest. Pick a direction and start traveling until you find a village. It may take you a while to find one, so bring plenty of supplies like food, blocks, tools, and armor. When you find a village, check inside all the homes for any chests. Open the chests and take any gold ingots and other loot you want. Finding a village is beneficial because villages provide access to free items.

Swim around the shipwreck and check all the rooms and chests. Take any gold ingots, buried treasure maps, and other loot you want. Buried treasure maps will lead you to buried treasure chests which can have gold ingots in them. Use the buried treasure map to find buried treasure. Hold the map in your hand and look for the white dot on it that indicates you. Determine what direction you need to go in to get to the red X on the map and start traveling in that direction.

Get inside the temple and locate the orange and blue terracotta inside on the floor. Below is the treasure room. Break one of the outside orange blocks and make sure there is a block beneath it before digging down more. Dig until you reach the bottom of the treasure room.

On one side, there will be a wall with 3 levers. You can pull the levers and, if the correct combination is pulled, a block upstairs will be moved that will lead to a chest that can contain gold ingots and other useful loot. On the other side, there will be a corridor with some arrow traps. Look on the floor for pieces of string and tripwires. Break the tripwires to deactivate the trap.

The easiest way to find a woodland mansion is by trading with a cartographer villager for a woodland explorer map and using the map to find one. You could also explore dark oak forest biomes until you find a giant, dark oak and cobblestone mansion. Woodland mansions are very dangerous, so be sure to bring plenty of supplies including food, blocks, torches, tools, good weapons and armor.

Enderpearls can be obtained by killing endermen(as well as bartering with piglins and trading with Expert-level cleric villagers), and blaze powder can be obtained by killing blazes and turning their rods into powder. Use the eyes of ender so they fly into the air. They will travel for a short distance then fall back down to the ground. Keep going in the direction they went in and periodically use another eye to make sure you're on the right path. When the eyes go underground, start digging down until you find stone bricks.

Bring your best armor and weapons, and any healing or positive effect potions you have. Kill the Ender dragon. First, you'll need to destroy the end crystals that are on top of the obsidian pillars. You can shoot at them or build up and punch them to destroy them. Once all are destroyed, you can begin to damage the Ender dragon by shooting it or hitting it with a weapon. Once the dragon dies, some small bedrock portals will spawn around the main island. You can build up to them and throw an enderpearl into the portal, this will take you to the outer End islands. Explore the outer End islands and look for End cities. End cities are very large, so they'll be fairly easy to spot from afar. They are made of purple purpur blocks and endstone bricks.
