      "content": "Know what constitutes domestic violence. Domestic violence (DV) is defined by the United States Department of Justice as having many possible manifestations, all of which are patterns of violence that are used by one person to gain and keep power over someone else using actions or threats of actions that scare, force, coerce, hurt, or embarrass someone. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Department of Justice Official website of the U.S. Department of Justice Go to source You can learn about the specific types of domestic violence classified by the US government at www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence, which include: Physical Abuse: This type of domestic abuse involves one person hurting or threatening to hurt someone else, and it can range from what might seem like obvious abusive behaviors like punching to more subtle behaviors like pulling, pushing, forcing someone to drink or do drugs, or refusing to allow someone access to medicine they might need. Any other behavior that hurts the body of someone else can also be physical abuse. Sexual Abuse: This type of domestic abuse involves one person forcing or attempting to force or coerce sexual behavior or touch from another person. This might involve unwanted touching of the genitals or breasts, unwanted sex of any type (anal, oral, or vaginal, within a marriage relationship or not), or sexually demeaning or humiliating someone. Emotional Abuse: This type of domestic abuse involves one person belittling another person by damaging their self-esteem or sense of worth. It can take many forms, but some of the most common involve talking in a belittling way about someone (alone or in public), constantly criticizing someone's efforts, calling someone names or cursing at someone, or purposefully trying to turn someone's family, friends, or children against them. Economic Abuse: This type of domestic abuse involves one person attempting to make another person financially dependent on themselves. It can involve refusing access to money or bank accounts, not sharing information about finances, or not allowing someone to attend work or school so that they cannot become self sufficient. Psychological Abuse: This type of domestic abuse involves trying to control someone by using means of fear, intimidation, or threats. Psychological abuse can involve isolating someone from family or friends, threatening self harm or harm to others, destroying property or pets (especially things the abused person loves), and \"gaslighting,\" a process that involves gradually convincing the victim that she is crazy and deserves the abuse."

Abuse is about power and control over a victim, often manifesting when an abuser feels a lack of power in other areas of his or her life or desires to take power away from their victim. [3] X Research source While abuse happens in many ways and for many reasons, it always has a few features in common: It is never justified. Abusers always have an excuse or a reason for the things that they do, but no matter what they say, there is never a valid reason to abuse another person. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source It is never the victim's fault. Many abusers will say that the victim was \"asking for it\" or that the victim's behavior needed to be punished. These are just excuses for the abuser's behavior, and they are not true: no one deserves to be abused.

[8] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. Abusers can go long stretches between episodes of abuse, and be loving and attentive when they are not abusing. Because of this, some victims might feel unsure if they are truly experiencing DV. Regardless of how frequently someone might make you feel scared or in danger, if they do make you feel that way, you are in an abusive relationship. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Not all abusive relationships start out that way, and sometimes it can take months or years before an abuser begins his or her violent behavior. Sometimes, controlling and manipulative behaviors develop so gradually that the victim might not be able to pinpoint when the relationship took a turn for the worse and became \"violent.\" Abuse looks different in every violent relationship. Some abusers never lay their hands on their victim, but instead use psychological tactics to make their victim feel dependent and worthless.

[21] X Research source Model a healthy relationship. It is impossible to teach children how to prevent domestic violence in their own future homes unless you can model that type of relationship for them. If you are in a violent relationship, it is important that you make a safety plan and leave, not only for your safety and your children's safety, but in order to model healthy relationships for your children. Teach your children about respect and consent. Teach your children that healthy relationships do not involve pressure, force, or coercion, and that if someone loves them, they will never try to make them do something they are not comfortable with. Respect their boundaries beginning at an early age. For example, if your young child does not want a hug from Grandma, do not force her, because you are teaching her that she does not have control over who she is affectionate with. Help your children develop a healthy level of self-esteem. Abusers often abuse because they want to feel powerful and in control, and so they belittle their victims and take away their victim's feelings of self-worth.

A relationship that is unbalanced, where one partner has more power than the other partner, is more likely to become abusive. Instead, teach children that both partners (no matter the gender) should have equal power in a loving relationship, and that decisions should be made through team work and compromise rather than pressure or one person deciding for the other."
