      "content": "The USB port may be faulty or inadequate. If the device works when connecting to a different USB port, this indicates the problem is with the USB port. If the device does work using a different USB port, try connecting a different device to the port to see if any other devices work using that port. If no devices work or charge from the USB port, there is likely a problem with the USB port. Some devices require high-speed USB ports in order to function. For example, if you connect an external hard drive or a 4K webcam to a USB 2.0 port, that port won’t be able to provide enough data transfer speed for the device to function. You’ll need to connect to a high-speed USB port . Look for a USB port that says “SS” or the transfer speed (i.e. 10 Gbps, or 40 Gbps) next to the port. If your computer has a USB-C port, you may be able to use that, although you will need an adapter if your device doesn't have a USB-C cable. You may also need a USB cable that supports high-speed data transfer ."
