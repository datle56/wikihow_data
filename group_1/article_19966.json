While there are many apps and websites that claim there are sneaky ways to get Tinder Gold for free, the only tried-and-true method for doing so is to sign up for a free trial of the service. A free Tinder Gold trial is not always available, but keep a look out for notifications in the app , as well as emails from Tinder. Tinder occasionally offers free trial codes to users that they can share with friends. Ask your friends to tell you if they receive a free trial code so you can test out the service!"

      "content": "Get somebody to buy you a gift subscription. When you sign up for Tinder Gold on your phone or tablet, Tinder charges the subscription rate to your Play Store (Android) or App Store (iPhone/iPad) account. If someone were to buy you a Google Play or App Store gift card that's large enough to cover the cost of a Tinder Gold membership, you can apply the gift card to your Google Play or App Store account and use it to pay for the membership."

      "title": "Apps that claim to give you free Tinder Gold don't work.",
      "content": "Apps that claim to give you free Tinder Gold don't work. Not even the ones you see advertised all over YouTube like Tinder++. These apps are full of ads and are designed to get you to download other apps so the developer can make money. Installing a \"free Tinder Gold\" app is more likely to give you malware and incessant ads instead of unblurred photos of the people who like you."

      "title": "Sign up on the web instead of the mobile app.",
      "content": "Sign up on the web instead of the mobile app. Some Tinder users have noticed that the price they are quoted to sign up for Tinder Gold is several dollars cheaper when they try to sign up at Tinder.com on a computer rather than using their phones.

      "title": "Look for a promo code.",
      "content": "Look for a promo code. Tinder occasionally offers discounts to Tinder Gold, which you'll usually find on coupon websites. Search the web for \"Tinder Gold\" and \"Promo Code\" occasionally to check out available discounts, or keep your eye on your email inbox for promotional messages from Tinder. You can also search for \"Tinder Gold Promo\" and \"Reddit\" to see if any Redditors have codes they want to share. Don't provide any personal information in exchange for a promo code. If a website claims you need to create an account with them to get a promo code, it's a scam."

      "content": "Choose a 6-month or 1-year subscription instead of month-to-month. Tinder charges more if you pay monthly than if you were to subscribe for a longer period of time. Gold prices start at $14.99/month if you want to pay monthly, but only at $5 per month ($59.99) if you pay all at once. Since prices are based on age, these are low estimates."
