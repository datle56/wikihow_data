You don’t want to stare directly at the dog or make prolonged eye contact. Instead, keep your gaze directed to one side of the dog. It’s also good to crouch down to make yourself smaller but not to get down on your hands and knees since this puts you in a vulnerable position if the dog should attack."

      "title": "Let them approach you.",
      "content": "Let them approach you. Instead of going the whole way to the dog, stop at least 10 feet short of where they are. This allows the dog to approach you on their own initiative. Stay still and crouching while not making direct eye contact. Speak to them in a calm, friendly voice to encourage them to come."

      "title": "Offer your hand.",
      "content": "Offer your hand. If the stray shows interest by moving towards you, slowly put your hand out with your palm down for them to smell. This a way for them to greet and identify you. Do not make any sudden movements or try to pet them. Just stay still and let the stray have a good sniff. Once they’ve had a good sniff, you can try reaching out to touch the dog. Don’t start by trying to stroke their head; instead, lightly place your hand on the side of their neck."

      "content": "Bring the dog food regularly. If you notice that the stray hangs out in a particular place, bring a dish of food there at the same time each day. Put the bowl on the ground, and walk away from it so that the stray will feel that it’s safe to approach. [5] X Research source A dry dog kibble will often work fine for a hungry animal. However, if you want to be sure to attract them, you may want to add something that’s irresistibly smelly, like leftover meat or some wet dog food. Food is the best way of establishing trust since it establishes you as a provider."

      "content": "Slowly work your way closer to the feeding site. At first, you want to leave the dog to eat the food on their own. Then, see if the dog will eat if you stay and watch from a distance. Each day, move gradually closer to where the dish is located while they eat until you’re standing next to them.

Give them time to adjust, and go back to standing next to them for that day if they resist what you’re offering a few times. Once they eat kibble from your hand, consider giving them treats the same way as a reward. If you keep the treats in your pocket, they’ll have your scent on them, which will help further establish trust with the dog."

      "content": "Evaluate the dog’s behavior. Before you try to gain a dog’s trust, take time to observe them. Watch their behavior from a safe distance. If they seem fearful, aggressive, erratic, or sickly, even from far away, it’s best not to approach them. Instead, contact your local animal control to notify them of the situation. Some tell-tale warning signs include unusual gaits or movements, excessive salivation, skittish or predatory behavior, intense tracking of you or other animals at a distance, howling, barking, snapping, or growling at distant people or animals."

If you think a stray might be rabid, contact your local animal control immediately.

      "content": "Keep other pets out of the mix. When you’re trying to gain the trust of a stray dog, it’s best not to involve other animals in the situation. Strays are skittish and unpredictable, so you want to limit their social interactions and keep them as simple and controlled as possible. For example, bringing your own dog to meet the stray can put both at risk while compromising the trust you’ve built with the stray. If you do end up trying to help the stray dog, it’s still a good idea to keep them apart from your other animals until you’re sure that they’ve been vaccinated."

      "content": "Slip a leash on the dog. Once you have gained dog’s trust, it’s time to figure out if you can help it. Start by using a slip lead to secure the stray, so you can guide them away. Slip leads are convenient because they require no collar. You simply put the loop at the end of it over the dog’s head and tighten the slide on the rope so that it won’t slip off. If the dog has a collar, you can use a normal leash."

      "content": "Check for identification. Don’t assume that the stray is ownerless; they might be a lost dog. Look for tags (if they’re wearing a collar), a tattoo, or a microchip to see if you can locate their family. Tattoos are generally located on the inner ear or leg. Go to a vet to scan the dog to see if they have been microchipped."

Include a partial description of the dog, where you found them, and your contact information. You don’t want to provide too much information about the dog in the ads. Responders should be able to give a detailed description of their missing dog; otherwise, they’re probably not the true owners. Be sure to distribute posters to local vet offices, pet stores, and animal rescues. While you’re doing so, show a photo of the stray to employees to see if they recognize it."

They also have resources available if you decide that you would like to foster the dog yourself."
