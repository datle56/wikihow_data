      "content": "Use quarter round that’s already close to the length of your room. Quarter round is available in 8 ft (2.4 m) and 16 ft (4.9 m) lengths. Measure the room where you’re installing the quarter round, then select pieces that closely match the length of the walls. For most rooms, 8 ft (2.4 m) quarter round is easier to work with, but for very large rooms, you might prefer 16 ft (4.9 m) lengths. Quarter round is available at most home improvement stores. You can also buy flexible plastic quarter round online."

      "content": "Determine the angle and direction of each cut. Each piece of quarter round will end at either a joint, a corner, or a door jamb. Quarter round will always be cut at an angle, usually 45 degrees. If you need to make a joint—or join two pieces of quarter round along the same wall—cut both pieces at 45-degree angles in the same direction (meaning both angled to the left, or both to the right). The cuts should fit together to form a flat line against the wall. Most corners will be 90-degree angles. For these, cut corner pieces at 45-degree angles in opposite directions (one to the left and one to the right, so that they fit together). For corners that are very different from 90 degrees, measure the angle with a protractor and divide this number by 2 to determine the angle of your cuts. If your quarter round will end at an obstruction, cut at a 45-degree angle and attach a quarter round return."

Tuttle says that the best way to cut wood quarter round is to “use a small saw, like a cordless trim saw.” [2] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 17 February 2022. Slide the quarter round into a miter box and use the pins to secure it. Steady the miter box with your non-dominant hand, and hold the trim saw in your dominant hand at the angle you want to cut it. Apply pressure with the saw, moving it back and forth over the quarter round until your cut is finished. [3] X Research source When you’re using the saw, wear gloves and protective eyewear , and always exercise caution."

      "content": "Cope the quarter round to avoid gaps in odd corners. To cope quarter round , miter it like you normally would, but leave one piece about 1 in (2.5 cm) longer than the wall measurement. Take that piece and cut out a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece on the back of the quarter round along the edge where the two pieces will meet. Cut as close to the front of the wood as you can, but don’t cut the part of the wood that you’ll see when the quarter round is installed. [5] X Research source When you install the quarter round, install the non-coped piece first, then fit the coped piece over it to create a tight seam. Coping can be a good option when you need to fit quarter round against curved moulding. If coping seems too difficult, or if there’s still a gap even after you tried coping the wood, you can just fill in any gaps with caulk."

Use your saw to make a 45-degree cut, angled in the opposite direction (if your previous cut in the quarter round was angled to the left, this one will angle to the right). Change the angle of your saw and make a straight cut about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) away from your angle cut. You should end up with an end cap that is flat on one side and a 45-degree angle on the other side. [8] X Research source"
