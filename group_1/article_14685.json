      "title": "Go for a nerdy dress or skirt.",
      "content": "Go for a nerdy dress or skirt. People often feel they cannot be feminine and nerdy. However, this is not true. Many nerd girls enjoy a nice dress or skirt that meshes well with the nerd style. [1] X Research source Mini-dresses often look like something out of a superhero movie. If you feel comfortable with a shorter, more revealing dress, this can look great in a nerd costume. Bright colors often come off as somewhat quirky or nerdy, so don't hesitate to pick an outfit that draws attention to yourself. A lot of nerds enjoy skirts as well. Colorful, pattern skirts can work well in a nerdy ensemble. Many nerd girls enjoy wearing frilly tutus, which are odd enough to fit with the offbeat nature of the nerdy aesthetic. You can also go for a plaid skirt, as this is example of a school girl uniform."

      "title": "Try suspenders.",
      "content": "Try suspenders. If you're wearing pants as part of your costume, suspenders can solidify the nerdy look. Purchase a pair of suspenders at a local clothing store, strap them onto your pants, and then hoist them over your shoulders. Brightly colored suspenders can help. Many people associate nerdiness with a somewhat messy style, so dramatically mismatched suspenders may help with the look. For example, you could wear pink suspenders over a red shirt. Tighten the suspenders so they hoist your pants and shorts up high. This further contributes to the nerdy look."

      "content": "Select appropriate footwear. You want to make sure your feet are also looking nerdy. There is no set type of footwear for nerd girls, but you have a variety of options depending on the rest of your look. [3] X Research source If you're wearing a dress or skirt, gladiator-like boots with a large ankle can help. You can also go for something like Doc Martens. Such boots may remind people of superheroes like Wonder Woman. Converse shoes are also popular in nerd culture.

      "content": "Try a button up shirt with high waisted shorts. If you want to go for a somewhat tomboyish nerdy look, try wearing a large button shirt and high waisted shorts. If you're using suspenders, you can use these to pull the shorts up even further. This can create an awkward, nerdy look. [4] X Research source It's a good idea to go for a loose-fitting shirt. This contributes to the somewhat messy, unflattering appearance one associates with nerd culture. Opt for a shirt a few sizes larger than what you regularly wear."

For example, go for a purple button up shirt with orange shorts. Patterns can also help, especially if you go for a variety of different types of patterns. Wear a polka dot t-shirt with a striped skirt, for example."

      "content": "Wear a large pair of glasses. If you want to be a nerd, glasses are key to solidify your look. You don't have to wear your own glasses. In fact, if you're going to a costume party, it's a good idea to wear contacts to prevent your glasses from being knocked off or broken. You can easily make a pair of fake nerd glasses with a cheap pair of sunglasses. [5] X Research source Purchase a thick-rimmed pair of sunglasses from a local thrift store or gas station. The bigger they are, the nerdier they'll look. When you get home, pop out the lenses. You can wear these glasses to help with your nerdy look. You can also put a piece of masking tape in the middle of the glasses. Broken glasses are one of the many stereotypes people have of nerds."

A tote bag in the theme of a nerdy TV show can help with the nerd look. For example, a Doctor Who tote bag with an image of the TARDIS on it can really make you look nerdy."
