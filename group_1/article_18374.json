My dog won’t eat or drink anything. Can I schedule an appointment with you? Congratulations, you just won the Powerball! You need to provide me with your name, number, address, and social security number to claim your prize. Thanks for signing up for the Spongebob Squarepants fan club! We’ll send you updates on what’s happening in the Bikini Bottom every hour. To opt out of these messages, reply STOP. My name is Dan Johnson, and I wanted to let you know that I came to your restaurant last night and got food poisoning. I threw up all over my couch, and I would like you to pay for a new one."

It’s an easy way to make them laugh and give you two something to talk about during class. I don't have enough brain cells to go to school tomorrow. If I got a penny every time someone asked me my major, I’d be rich. Group assignments helped me understand why Batman works alone. Every time I see the word “explain” on an exam, I die a little bit inside. If TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram were school subjects, I would have a 4.0."

Highlighting your shared interests is the best way to bond with them and lighten up a dull conversation. [3] X Research source I’m on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it. Friends buy you lunch. Best friends eat your lunch. If it’s true that you are what you eat, I’m a chocolate cake. You know what they say…a hamburger a day keeps the doctor away. I decided to start my journey of self-improvement but ended up at the fridge🤦"

It’s an excellent way to bond over a shared experience, and find humor in your situation! [5] X Research source Love is really blind because it can’t see me at all. The secret to a good relationship is not having one. Not me curving any guy that I make eye contact with. Do I have a date this Valentine’s Day? Yes, his name is February 14th. My life is like a romantic comedy except there’s no romance, and it’s just me laughing at my own jokes."

Send your friend a playful message a few hours later to lighten the mood and let them know you’re still waiting to hear back from them. Just remember to avoid double (or triple) texting so you don’t come off as clingy! [6] X Research source I really hope you’re writing me an essay🙄 Hey, I lost my phone. Can you call it for me? My last text must have really left you speechless🤩 I guess you took a trip to Mars last week. How were things? OMG, can you slow down? Your replies are so fast, I can’t keep up."

Only 55 more years till retirement!! Here’s to another year of questionable life decisions! Older? For sure. Wiser? Not that much. Happy birthday bro!"

Being upfront about your feelings is the best way to express interest and make your crush feel flattered. [7] X Research source Do you work at Starbucks? Because I like you a latte. If you were a song, you’d be the best track on the album. I’d say bless you, but it looks like you already have been. Hey, you’re pretty, and I’m cute. Together, we’d be pretty cute. Are you an electrician? Because you’re definitely lighting up my night. When I send your picture to my group chat, which one do you want me to use?"
