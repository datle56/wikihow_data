      "title": "Gather the hair at the top of your head.",
      "content": "Gather the hair at the top of your head. The section needs to start at your forehead and go back towards your crown. It needs to be the same width as your eyebrows at the front, and end in a U-shaped curve in the back, rather than a V-shaped point. [1] X Research source Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create neat and even parts. This method works the best with jaw-length hair. You may also be able to do this method with an undercut or a side fade, however."

      "title": "Tie or clip off the top section off.",
      "content": "Tie or clip off the top section off. You can twist it into a bun or secure it with a hair clip. Don't worry about being too precise or neat; you will be returning to this section shortly. [2] X Research source If you have an undercut or a fade, simply gather all the long hair at the top of your hair."

      "title": "Clip the hair at the sides of your head out of the way.",
      "content": "Clip the hair at the sides of your head out of the way. Gather the hair at your temples, just in front of your ears. Pull the hair behind your ears, and secure it with clips. The hair should run horizontally against the side of your head. [3] X Research source If you have an undercut or fade, you can skip this step; your hair is already short on the sides."

      "content": "Undo the top part of your hair and mist it with a texturizing spray. Be sure that you mist the top, sides, and underside, focusing on the roots. At this point, it would also be a good idea to apply a heat-protection spray. [4] X Research source"

Insert a flat or concentrator nozzle onto your hairdryer. Aim the nozzle at your roots and point it upwards towards your forehead. Blow dry the misted hair while lifting it upwards at the roots. You should see your quiff starting to take form. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Straighten the outer portions of the hair.",
      "content": "Straighten the outer portions of the hair. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to gather a thin section of hair from your front hairline, spanning from eyebrow to eyebrow. Hold the section straight above your head and straighten it upwards. Gently lay the section against the quiff. [7] X Research source If you don't have a hair straightener, you may be able to use a curling iron with a wide barrel. Repeat this step for the sides of the quiff; only gather a thin section from the side parts."

      "title": "Apply a texturizing powder or dry shampoo to the quiff.",
      "content": "Apply a texturizing powder or dry shampoo to the quiff. Shake the powder onto the top, front, and sides of the quiff. Lift parts of the quiff away, and shake the powder inside as well. Work the powder into the quiff with your fingers. [8] X Research source You can also try using a texturizing mousse for this step instead. If you have thick, coarse hair, you may not need to do this step at all."

Push down on the hair at the back of your crown, then slide your hand forward, causing the hair to bunch up. Spray the hair with hairspray. [9] X Research source If you're having difficulty shaping the quiff, take a little bit of pomade into your hand, and apply it to your hair before you try shaping it again."

If your hair doesn't hold, you can lightly mist it with more hairspray. [10] X Research source If you have an undercut or fade, you can skip this step. Your hair should be short enough on the sides to not need any support."

      "content": "Brush back your hair. You can do this with a comb, a brush, or even your fingers. The goal is to gather your hair away from your front hairline and eliminate your part. This method works the best on hair that's at least shoulder-length. If you can pull your hair back into a half-up, half-down ponytail, you can do this method."

It should come to a point at the top-center of your head, about where your ears are. Have the section end in a straight, horizontal line or a soft curve, not a V-shaped point. [12] X Research source Don't gather all of the hair at the top of your head just yet; you'll be adding more hair to this section later. Use the handle of rat-tail comb to create neat, even parts."

It would be easier to do this with a special backcombing brush, but you can use a regular comb instead as well. Spray the section with texturizing hairspray between each backcombing. [13] X Research source If you have curly hair, you can put your hair into hot rollers instead of backcombing. Roll your hair backwards and away from your face, and leave them in for 15 minutes.

This may look a little too stark for your hair length. Conceal it by taking thin strands of hair from below the part (where the quiff starts), backcombing them, and adding them to the quiff.

      "title": "Consider crimping the section you gathered.",
      "content": "Consider crimping the section you gathered. While it is possible to get a quiff without any crimping, this will really amp up the volume. Split you hair in half horizontally, and crimp only the back section—not the front. This way, the bumpy texture won't be visible in the end. [20] X Research source Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair before crimping it. Brush you hair out after crimping it. This will make it softer and fluffier."
