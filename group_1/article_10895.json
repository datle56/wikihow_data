    {
      "title": "Play a straightforward warrior.",
      "content": "Play a straightforward warrior. Do you feel like playing a straightforward, melee, damage-dealing character? If so, you have two main options. Also, check out the next step below these for more versatile options that are still focused on melee combat. The Nord is a great option for a first character. You'll be skilled at two-handed weapons, will get more money for selling loot, and have a Light Armor bonus and racial abilities that keeps you mobile and able to survive the early game. [1] X Research source The Orc is phenomenal at surviving damage, and dealing damage in melee. With immediate access to Orc stores and trainers, bonuses to crafting armor and weapons, and bonuses to both one-handed and two-handed weapons, you'll have many options to choose from. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a thief.",
      "content": "Create a thief. If you enjoy playing sneaky characters, but want to specialize in stealing and exploration more than combat, make an Argonian or a Khajiit . The higher starting Lockpicking and Pickpocket skills are particularly useful at the beginning of the game, since improving them at a reasonable pace requires succeeding on the attempts in the first place. [3] X Research source Argonians have a better Lockpicking bonus, a Light Armor bonus, and a racial ability that regenerates health once per day. All of these will make life as a low-level sneaky character a bit easier. The Khajiit have a better unarmed damage bonus, a better Sneak bonus, an Archery bonus, and tend to be more versatile. Pick this if you are not fully committed to the thief archetype, or you want to be a well-rounded combat character as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make an assassin or archer.",
      "content": "Make an assassin or archer. Sneaky characters who are also good at combat prefer bonuses to Sneak, Archery, Alchemy, and Light Armor. The Khajiit and Wood Elf are excellent options, while the Dark Elf is a fine choice if you'd also like to dabble in Magic. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Play as a mage.",
      "content": "Play as a mage. There are several different types of magic, but you don't need to pick just one. High Elves have bonuses to all five, plus large bonuses to Magicka (the energy or mana used to cast spells). They are great for an overall mage character build and are a good starting race for newcomers. [5] X Research source Bretons are versatile mages as well, though especially excellent at Conjuration. Bretons also specialize in more magic and sword gameplay, as they often specialize in skills that aid you in battle. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a more complex character.",
      "content": "Choose a more complex character. Dark Elves have bonuses to offensive magic and stealth, and can be played as mage-assassins or mage-thieves. They are also great for the overall adventurer as they specialize in multiple skills. [7] X Research source Imperials are quite strong at both melee combat and magic, especially healing magic. Imperials are very charismatic and are great for a merchant, or just an over all charismatic character. Imperials have a bonus in the speech skill which is a major benefit to thieves, merchants, and assassins. Finally, Redguards are the best at using one-handed weapons, but have fairly unfocused bonuses in general. Consider playing a Redguard if you want to try out several styles of play right off the bat, but don't expect to be too powerful at any one task. Redguards are good for one-handed and sword and shield users. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Know which racial abilities are the most powerful.",
      "content": "Know which racial abilities are the most powerful. If you're having trouble deciding, you might want to pick a race with abilities that remain powerful throughout the game. Here are the few abilities that will still feel useful even when you're a high-level adventurer: The Orc's berserk ability and the Breton's magic resistance are probably the most powerful and versatile options. [9] X Research source The Imperial and Nord active abilities remain unique and effective, though somewhat narrow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about convenience.",
      "content": "Think about convenience. Some abilities aren't that powerful, but occur often enough to save you significant preparation or healing time. The Dark Elf's fire resistance ends up being relevant more often than most other racial resistances, for instance. [10] X Research source The Wood Elf's resistance to poison and disease is not at all necessary, but it does save you time micromanaging potions and temple visits. (Redguards and Argonians receive 1/2 of this ability each.) While the Argonians' water breathing and the Khajiit's night vision sound like they would open up unique exploration options, it turns out these are rarely useful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't over-think other racial bonuses.",
      "content": "Don't over-think other racial bonuses. Your racial skill bonuses and abilities will be useful as a low-level character, making some play styles much easier than others. However, as you train skills and gain perks, your race will matter less and less. In general, once you've narrowed your choice down to a few options, there's little harm in picking the race that appeals to you on a visual or story basis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your character's sex.",
      "content": "Choose your character's sex. Your character's sex has only minor effects on gameplay. Some quests and perks give bonuses to interactions with the opposite sex, such as cheaper store prices or higher damage. [11] X Research source Female characters are rumored to move at a slightly slower pace, but this is difficult to notice. Romance and marriage options are not affected by sex. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about story or dialogue.",
      "content": "Think about story or dialogue. Your character's race and sex will change NPC dialogue, but this rarely changes the fundamentals of a quest or conversation. Unless you have played other Elder Scrolls games and have an idea of which race you'd like to identify as, there's no real reason to pick one race over another for your first character. Of course, even new players often have a preferred race based on first impressions, and choosing a race you like may make the game more enjoyable. If you make additional characters, consider choosing a variety of races, and both sexes, so you have a chance to explore alternate dialogue."

    {
      "title": "Understand how \"class\" works.",
      "content": "Understand how \"class\" works. If you've played earlier Elder Scrolls games, or almost any other roleplaying game, you might be wondering why there's no class option. In Skyrim, all your actions improve as you perform them. For instance, when you successfully pickpocket someone, your Pickpocket skill improves. Other customization comes through the \"perks\" system, but neither of these methods of advancement are restricted by decisions made at character creation. Early on in the game, you'll be introduced to Standing Stones. While the first ones you see sound similar to classes (Thief, Mage, or Warrior), you will be able to switch between them as many times as you like. [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Plan out your build.",
      "content": "Plan out your build. If you'd like to delve into the mechanics of Skyrim characters, you can plan out your entire character before you create him or her. This is only recommended for people who get most of their gameplay enjoyment from optimization, or for experienced Skyrim players. Try searching for character builds online, or plan out your own using SkyrimCalculator."
