      "content": "Choose an NFL game to watch (and drink) with friends. There are close to 300 NFL games per regular 18-week season, so take your pick of any game (preferably one that you or a good portion of your friends will enjoy watching, like one that features your favorite team or has some really excellent players). Besides that, all you need is a big screen to watch the game on and enough drinks for everyone who’s playing! [1] X Research source Choose a team to support for the drinking game (it’s OK if it’s not your actual favorite team—you can still root for your home team IRL). Then, decide whether to play as individuals or 2 even teams: As individuals, everyone will take a sip whenever a player on the team they chose does something on the “Take a drink when…” list. As teams, you’ll alternate who takes sips from the actions on the list, meaning each person drinks less overall. Tip: You can drink anything you like (it doesn’t even have to be alcoholic!), but try a cheap light beer to start. You’ll be able to go through a lot of it without making yourself as drunk or potentially sick as wine or liquor."

These rules aren’t set in stone—feel free to remove rules you don’t like and replace them with your own house rules: [2] X Research source Take 1 sip when… The other team scores. A player you’ve wagered on punts. The other team gets a first down. Your team loses yards after a play. Your team gets a 5-yard penalty. The camera shows a celebrity in the audience. A player kisses their fingers and points up at the sky. Take 2 sips when… Your quarterback’s throw gets intercepted. Your quarterback gets sacked. Your team misses a field goal. A player gets penalized for any reason. There’s a car commercial. Take 3 sips when… A player on your team gets injured. The other team gains 20+ yards from an offensive play. There’s a play review.

The Super Bowl is the biggest sports event of the year, so naturally, the Super Bowl drinking game is a bit more intense than your average regular season game. So, grab plenty of your drink of choice, turn up the volume, and get ready to drink! As always, feel free to adjust the rules to your liking—the halftime show and commercials are always full of surprises at the Super Bowl, so these could make for some hilarious and unique house rules. [3] X Research source Take 1 sip when… The other team gets a 1st down. Your team gets a penalty flag. Your team loses an interception. The announcer mentions Super Bowl rings. Someone on your team dances after a touchdown. There’s a beer commercial. Take 2 sips when… The other team gets a touchdown. The other makes a 20-yard play. The other team makes a field goal. Your quarterback is sacked. The other team’s mascot is on screen. A celebrity in the audience is shown on screen. There’s a safety. A Doritos commercial airs (or any popular food/beverage of your choice). A GoDaddy commercial airs (or any popular product you choose). Take 3 sips when… Your team misses a field goal. A surprise guest appears in the half-time show. The announcers bring up US politics or politicians. Your team fumbles. Your team gets a 15-yard penalty. Your team loses the coin toss. Take 4 sips (or finish your drink) when… The other team scores a 40+ yard touchdown. Your team loses the Super Bowl. Your coach is caught swearing or melting down on camera.

Many challenges can last more than 3 minutes, meaning you might have to basically finish an entire drink (depending on how many people are watching the game). Remember to pace yourself and have snacks nearby in case you start to feel a little too tipsy or sick. There’s nothing wrong with spacing your sips out over a longer period of time or sitting out a round if you’re not feeling well. It’s better to enjoy the game and get heckled a little bit than to get too drunk and not remember the final touchdown!"

[7] X Research source Optional rule: If the penalty results in a first down, double the amount of drinks everyone takes. Keep in mind that this game could get you pretty drunk pretty fast, especially if there’s a team that’s playing a sloppy game. Have a designated driver on hand or plan to spend the night at your friend’s place if this one gets a little wild!"

[8] X Research source This gives you more control over how much you drink and what to look for in the game because you can make any rules you like! For example: For a player, take a sip when they do something like: Their signature touchdown dance. Fumble the ball (again!?). Mentions their family, mentor, or God in an interview clip. For an announcer, take a sip when they do something like: Say a word you don’t know. Give an analysis or state an opinion you don’t agree with. Say anything that annoys you. For a coach, take a sip when they do something like: Curse or make aggressive gestures at someone. Talk about how great a specific player is. Wear a signature hat, hoodie, or jacket on screen."

If you have a TV with a large screen, rearrange your furniture to angle toward it and set up additional folding chairs (or bring in chairs and ottomans from other rooms) so everyone who’s coming gets a seat. Or, if you have a nice outdoor space like a yard or patio, consider setting up a projector and streaming the game outside! You can buy or make a screen to project onto, or even use the side of your house or garage (assuming there are no windows or other features to obstruct the image)."

You don’t have to exclude your non-fanatic friends from a football-watching party—they can still enjoy themselves and contribute to the atmosphere, even if they’re not die-hard fans (or even know the rules of the game). Braff emphasizes “You gotta have people who want to be there. They may not necessarily love football, but they have to just love the festivity of it all coming together…It’s fun!” Of course, it’s a plus when your attendees are invested in the game or a specific team. Braff adds, “It’s fun when people have teams they’re loyal to…[or are] in jerseys or gear or merchandise from [their] team.” If you can, plan a party for a game that you and your friends have stakes in. It might just be your favorite team playing, or even a game that has ramifications for your Fantasy Football League."

If you’re not sure what to prepare, go for the classics. She adds, “People love wings. People love nachos. People love good beer. [The food] doesn’t always have to be super traditional, but sometimes, people want to see the classics there, like buffalo wings and things like that.” If you know you have diverse tastes coming (meat lovers, vegetarians, picky eaters, folks with allergies, etc.), Braff recommends “trying to find out what your guests want as well. A good way to start is to take a poll and see what people’s tastes are or what they’re expecting.” Just text your invitees and see what they’d like! You can also make it a potluck party and request each person bring a dish to share. That way, everyone has at least one thing they know they’ll enjoy."
