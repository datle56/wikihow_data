      "content": "Give another Pokémon in your party an Exp. Share. This item allows Gabite to gain experience even when it's not in battle. Whenever the Pokémon that is holding the Exp. Share gains experience, Gabite will gain some as well (as long as they're both in your party)."

      "title": "Use Gabite in battle against high-level Pokémon.",
      "content": "Use Gabite in battle against high-level Pokémon. The best way to gain experience for Gabite is to simply use it in battle as much as possible. You'll get more experience for fighting tougher enemies."

      "title": "Fight enemies that are weak to your attacks.",
      "content": "Fight enemies that are weak to your attacks. If you're trying to power-level your Gabite, you'll do it most efficiently if you're fighting high-level enemies that are weak to its attacks. This will let you mow through more enemies in less time, gaining lots of experience. Gabite has a lot of Ground moves which are highly effective against Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel Pokémon. Gabite's Dragon moves are effective against most other types, making them powerful moves to use when leveling. Avoid fighting Steel and Fairy Pokémon, as Dragon attacks are weak or completely useless against them."

      "content": "Use Rare Candy to gain a level or two. Giving a Gabite a Rare Candy will raise it one level immediately. This can be useful for getting the last level before evolving."

      "title": "Receive a traded Gabite for better leveling.",
      "content": "Receive a traded Gabite for better leveling. Gabites received via trade will gain 1.5x the regular experience, which will significantly boost your evolution speed. If you can get a Gabite from another country or language, it will gain 1.7x the normal amount of experience. [2] X Research source You can't trade a Gabite to someone and then have them trade it back. The Gabite must have been caught on a different system."

      "title": "Consider canceling the evolution for one level.",
      "content": "Consider canceling the evolution for one level. You may want to prevent Gabite from evolving until after it learns Dragon Rush at level 49. It will take Garchomp until Level 55 to learn this move. [3] X Research source To cancel an evolution, press and hold B while the Gabite is evolving. This will cancel the evolution and prevent it from turning into Garchomp. Once the Gabite reaches Level 49, it will learn Dragon Rush and then try to evolve again. You can now let it safely evolve, as there are no more moves that Gabite will learn, and Dragon Rush is a very powerful move to have for your new Garchomp that it normally wouldn't learn for another seven levels."
