[2] X Research source The vanishing points are two points that are on the horizon line. A vanishing point is a point where parallel lines appear to converge, creating the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality."

      "content": "Draw a vertical line perpendicular to the horizon line. This line is the first corner of the house and the corner closest to you in perspective view. When drawing the wall, establish a scale , so that this line can be used to scale the rest of your house. For example, if the initial line is scaled to 1 foot =½ inch, every wall will be set to that scale. If you want your walls to be 10 feet tall, the initial line should be 5 inches tall at the 1 foot =½ inch scale. Place this vertical line near the halfway point between your horizon line. Your line should be about 5 ½ - 6 scaled feet below the horizon line to represent your eye level. This will make the perspective more accurate."
