      "content": "Calculate the perimeter of one base. The base is a triangle, so it will have three sides. The area of the perimeter of a triangle is Perimeter = a + b + c {\\displaystyle {\\text{Perimeter}}=a+b+c} , where a {\\displaystyle a} , b {\\displaystyle b} , and c {\\displaystyle c} are the length of each side of the triangle. [4] X Research source It doesn’t matter which base you use to calculate, because the two bases of a prism are congruent. For example, if the base has three sides measuring 6 cm, 5 cm, and 4 cm, to calculate the perimeter, you would add up all three sides: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 {\\displaystyle 6+5+4=15} . So, the perimeter of one base is 15 cm."

      "content": "Plug the height of the prism into the lateral area formula. The height of the prism is the same as the length of the side of any lateral face that is not connected to the base. Usually (but not always) this will be the longer side of the lateral face. For example, if the height of the prism is 9 cm, your formula will look like this: L = 15 ( 9 ) {\\displaystyle L=15(9)} ."

      "content": "Multiply the perimeter of one base with the height of the prism. The result will give you, in square units, the lateral surface area of the prism. This is the first value you need to find the total surface area of the prism, so set this value aside while you calculate the area of the base. [5] X Research source For example, 15 ( 9 ) = 135 {\\displaystyle 15(9)=135} , So, the lateral surface area of the prism is 135 square centimeters."

The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1 2 b h {\\displaystyle A={\\frac {1}{2}}bh} , where A {\\displaystyle A} equals the area of the triangle, b {\\displaystyle b} equals the base of the triangle, and h {\\displaystyle h} equals the height of the triangle. [6] X Research source This is the most common way to calculate the area of a triangle. If you don’t know the height of the triangle, you can also calculate the area using the length of the triangle’s three sides. You only need to find the area of one base, since the two bases of a prism are congruent, and will therefore have the same area."
