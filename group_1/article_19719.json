Sit close to the vaporizer or humidifier and breathe in deeply. [1] X Research source Humidifiers are especially useful at night, so you can also place the humidifier near your bed. This can help thin secretions, which will make it easier to cough them out. Take care to breathe in slowly since deep breaths can cause you to start coughing. You can also try a cool mist humidifier for warmer months. These are also safer for use with children."

      "content": "Listen for whooping cough. Whooping cough is characterized by fits of uncontrolled violent coughs which make it very hard to breathe. When you finally do feel like you can breathe, the breath often sounds like a \"whoop.\" Whooping cough is caused by a bacterium and is more common now because of decreased immunization rates, effectiveness of newer vaccines, and new bacterial strains of the disease. It's important to treat whooping cough early because it's highly contagious. If you're unsure what whooping cough sounds like, you can easily search for a recording of the \"whoop.\" [4] X Research source However, sometimes whopping cough is just a cough that lasts for a few weeks. Talk to your doctor right away if you think that you or your child might have whooping cough."

      "title": "Consider the cause of your cough.",
      "content": "Consider the cause of your cough. Coughs are caused by a variety of conditions. You might have an upper-respiratory infection which can irritate your nose or sinuses, causing cough. This also makes it likely that increased mucus can drip down the back of your throat and irritate it, causing coughing. This is called post-nasal drip. If the infection gets into your lungs, it can cause pneumonia, which can be more serious. You might cough if you breathe in an allergy or asthma trigger like allergens or dust. Or, you might cough if you inhale a foreign object. Keep in mind that some medications, especially some blood pressure drugs, can cause cough. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may cause you to cough when stomach acid flows back into and irritates your esophagus. Chronic bronchitis is another main cause of coughing that is commonly caused by smoking. The network of tubes (bronchioles) are inflamed and irritated. If you have a dry, deep and persistent cough, it may be caused by congestive heart failure or rarely, lung cancer."

Depending on the cause of your cough, your doctor might recommend that you take an OTC medication like antihistamines, pain relievers, or anti-asthma medications. Take care to read the medication's label for proper dosing and only take medications that specifically address your symptoms. For example, if your only symptom is a cough, you don't need a decongestant or antihistamine. Avoid using any medication for more than seven days, unless your doctor has instructed you to do so. Contact your child's doctor for medication recommendations. You may be able to give your child an over-the-counter medication, but it is best to consult your doctor first for specific recommendations."
