This is a little trickier to calculate than the perimeter. [4] X Research source The formula for calculating the length of the apothem is this: the length of the side ( s ) divided by 2 times the tangent (tan) of 180 degrees divided by the number of sides ( n )."

      "content": "Know the correct formula. The area of any regular polygon is given by the formula: Area = ( a x p )/2 , where a is the length of the apothem and p is the perimeter of the polygon. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Plug the values of a and p in the formula and get the area.",
      "content": "Plug the values of a and p in the formula and get the area. As an example, let's use a hexagon (6 sides) with a side ( s ) length of 10. [6] X Research source The perimeter is 6 x 10 ( n x s ), equal to 60 (so p = 60). The apothem is calculated by its own formula, by plugging in 6 and 10 for n and s . The result of 2tan(180/6) is 1.1547, and then 10 divided by 1.1547 is equal to 8.66. The area of the polygon is Area = a x p / 2, or 8.66 multiplied by 60 divided by 2. The solution is an area of 259.8 units. Note as well, there are no parenthesis in the \"Area\" equation, so 8.66 divided by 2 multiplied by 60, will give you the same result, just as 60 divided by 2 multiplied by 8.66 will give you the same result."

      "content": "See the similarities. Again, the formula for a regular polygon is 1/2 times the apothem multiplied by the perimeter. The perimeter is just the length of one side multiplied the by the number of sides ( n ); for a regular polygon, n also represents the number of triangles that make up the figure. The formula, then, is nothing more than the area of a triangle multiplied by the number of triangles in the polygon. [9] X Research source"
