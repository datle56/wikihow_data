For Safari, go to Preferences > Default Search Engine and select your preferred search engine, like Google.

For Firefox, go to Preferences and change the \"Show your home page\" settings under \"Startup.\" Replace the UltraSearch Engine URL, then click Search in the panel on the left. Under \"Default Search Engine,\" choose a search engine and click Remove next to any that you don't want. If you're getting an error that your profile doesn't have administrative privileges to do this, then you need to delete any profiles that UltraSearch Engine may have created. In that case, quit any running applications and open \"System Preferences\" (click the Apple icon in the menu bar or tap the icon in the Dock). Click Profiles , then look for any suspicious profiles that you didn't create (they can be called UltraSearch Engine or AdminPrefs). Click that profile to select it, then click the - button at the bottom of the panel. With that profile deleted, you'll be able to make any browser changes that you were unable to complete."
