      "content": "Store your items in a chest. Make a chest out of eight wooden planks. Place the chest on the ground, then move all valuable items from your inventory into the chest. If your inventory is nearly full, you'll need two chests to store all items. In single player, place the chest somewhere obvious, such as on the top of a hill. In multiplayer, hide the chest underground to hide it from other players. Mark the land above it with a torch so you know where to dig later. If you have OP rights (Cheats), you can also use the command /gamerule keepInventory true to protect your inventory."

(If that doesn't work, press Fn + F3 .) In Minecraft for Xbox or PlayStation, make a map , equip it and use it. There is a way to find coordinates in Minecraft Pocket Edition. Go into game settings and scroll down until you find the 'Show Coordinates' button. Slide the button across and there should be 3 sets of numbers at the top of your screen when you return back."

Pick up your items, and walk back to your spawn point using the same method. X and Z are the North/South and East/West coordinates. Get these right first. The Y value tells you how far you are above or below sea level. You can usually ignore this unless you died underground or on a steep mountain slope."

Mine iron with a stone pickaxe. Iron can be found at ground level, but is much more common lower down. [3] X Research source Make a furnace and use it to smelt the iron ore into iron ingots. Craft the iron and flint together to make flint and steel. Use the flint and steel to set fire to the top of any solid block, or the side of flammable blocks such as wood.

Craft a bed from 3 wool blocks of the same color and three planks of the same type, then try to sleep in it in the Nether Realm.

Create an End Portal by placing an Eye of Ender in each of the twelve portal frames. You can find this item in the \"Miscellaneous\" section.
