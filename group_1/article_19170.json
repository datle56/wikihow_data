Pick a day coming up (be sure to give ample time for people to plan ahead) and treat yourself to a party. Some tips for a great post-birthday bash: Invite as many or as little people as you feel comfortable; you control the guest list! If you’re going out, pick a favorite restaurant you already love or, if you’re feeling adventurous, go to a new place you’ve been wanting to try. If you’re staying in, buy or make food and decorations to highlight the birthday theme, or consider incorporating a nontraditional theme, like a favorite era or trend, to liven it up further. Buy or make a cake to make it feel like a real birthday celebration!"

During your birthday redo, make sure to do things on that day (or week!) that you will enjoy. This won’t fix your bad birthday completely, but treating yourself can help ease the sting in the meantime. Buy yourself a present you were hoping to get but did not. Rent a favorite movie and order takeout from your favorite restaurant. Invite some friends over or have a solo DIY spa day."

For some people, birthdays are a time when we worry so much about the big day before it happens that we experience the disappointment as though it has already occurred. [2] X Research source Leading up to your birthday, consider whether you were: Focusing on what you were worried would not happen. If you were so worried about what gifts you would or wouldn’t get, or whether or not someone special would call on your birthday, you have worked yourself up so much before your birthday even started. This type of thinking causes so much anxiety about birthday expectations that having any fun is an uphill battle. Looking forward to what could happen. Rather than worrying about what won’t happen, this type of thinking is much more hopeful about all of the upcoming possibilities. Instead of looking towards the future with anxiety about what might not happen, you were looking forward to your birthday with feelings of excitement and anticipation."

      "content": "Consider what your expectations were. Birthday expectations, the anticipations for the day that often lead to a disappointing, bad birthday, typically fall into one of the following categories: [3] X Research source Expectations of the birthday celebrations themselves. Because many of us expect birthdays to be a big deal, a full day when you are showered with gifts and attention, when this level of hype is not met, the overall feeling for the day is that it was a big letdown. We focus so much on what the birthday should be that we don’t enjoy what it is . Expectations of where and what our life should be. Birthdays come once a year and are a prime time to reflect on the past year and consider the future. For some, this means coming to terms with the inaccuracy of the timeline of goals we devise for ourselves. These expectations are often harder to deal with, and can definitely sour a birthday."

Especially since everything is posted on social media, even small rejections, like not many people writing “Happy birthday!” on your wall, can feel intensely hurtful. Try to remember that anyone reaching out in any manner is a wonderful gesture; it’s not a competition for the most postings or likes. Are you worried about outstanding goals? If expectations of where your life should be are causing your bad mood, reflect on when and why you came up with that goal in the first place. Comparing yourself to others is never a good idea, and maybe the goals you made for yourself when you were younger no longer match what you really want for yourself now. Are you brooding over one particular person not wishing you well on your birthday? Perhaps an ex or a crush didn’t reach out on your birthday, which can sting. Instead of thinking about the one person who didn’t call, think about those who did. Reread the cards or wall posts you received, and redirect your thinking."

What do you think?” This is a subtle, but non-passive-aggressive, way of indicating that you enjoyed the birthday activities thus far but were also hoping for a little more fun before the day is over."
