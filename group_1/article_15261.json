      "content": "Make sure the charging cable for your vacuum isn't damaged. Make sure you look at the cable, the adapter that plugs into the wall, and the end of the cable that plugs into the vacuum. If your charging cable is damaged, don't plug in your vacuum to charge, as this could cause shocks or electrical damage. If your vacuum's charging cable is inside of a charging unit (such as a wall-mounted charger), try removing the cable and plugging it directly into the vacuum. If your vacuum begins to charge, the issue is likely with the charging unit itself. Even if the charger doesn't look damaged, it may have been faulty from the start or died unexpectedly. If you have access to another Dyson charger, try it with your vacuum to see if it works. If not, consider purchasing one—if it turns out that the charger is not the issue, you can try to return the charger as a gently used item to the retailer you bought it from."

      "content": "Ensure the wall socket is working. If your socket is connected to a wall switch, make sure the socket is switched on. If the wall socket has TEST and RESET buttons, make sure the RESET button didn't pop out—and if it did, press the button to make sure the socket is operational. If you've made sure the wall socket should be getting power, plug something into the socket that you know works (i.e. a phone charger plugged into your phone). If this item doesn't work as intended once plugged in, the issue is likely not with your vacuum. Alternatively, try plugging the Dyson into another outlet that you know works. If you see the vacuum begin to charge (usually with battery indicator lights somewhere on the unit near the battery) then the issue likely does not lie with your vacuum."

      "content": "Look at the age of your vacuum's battery. If your vacuum is a few years old and you've never gotten it a new battery, there's a good chance the battery is simply just too old. Batteries degrade over time, and this degradation can be unpredictable. Dyson has a two-year warranty on their cordless vacuums, and this warranty includes the battery. While you don't need to replace your Dyson battery every two years, if you notice that your vacuum isn't holding a charge and the battery is over two years old, it's a good sign that your battery is just old and needs a routine replacement."

      "title": "Make sure the battery isn't extremely depleted.",
      "content": "Make sure the battery isn't extremely depleted. If your Dyson's battery is fully dead, it may not show an indicator that it's charging right away. Plug the vacuum in or set it on its charger for 10 to 15 minutes and check back to see if the indicator lights have turned on. If not, and you've already ruled out an issue with your charger, you may need to replace the battery."

      "title": "Make sure your vacuum has a genuine Dyson battery.",
      "content": "Make sure your vacuum has a genuine Dyson battery. If you bought a replacement battery for your Dyson or you bought your vacuum second hand, check to see if the battery is a genuine Dyson product. Dyson warns against using third-party batteries as these products aren't checked as vigorously as Dyson batteries are, so they may not last as long or work as well as a Dyson battery. Using a non-Dyson battery in your vacuum also isn't covered under warranty, and it may render your warranty invalid if something were to happen to your vacuum because of the third-party battery. [1] X Research source To check your vacuum's battery, look at the label on the vacuum's battery pack. If the battery's label has Dyson branding (stylized as all lowercase \"dyson\") it's a genuine product."

      "title": "Look for a blockage in your vacuum.",
      "content": "Look for a blockage in your vacuum. If your vacuum's airway is blocked, its power will cut out for safety reasons. If you keep trying to use the vacuum despite a blockage, the vacuum won't turn on until the blockage is removed . This can make it seem like your Dyson isn't working or charging anymore. Check the vacuum head/brush, tube, filter, and canister for a blockage. If you see one, remove it before trying to use your vacuum again. If there's a blockage, your vacuum will display a blockage indicator—either on the LCD screen or as a light that looks like a p-trap pipe."

      "title": "All Dyson vacuums have battery indicator lights.",
      "content": "All Dyson vacuums have battery indicator lights. These indicator lights are fairly standard across their vacuum models, so you can use these lights to easily determine if your Dyson's battery is the reason it's not charging. If you see a solid or flashing amber light, your Dyson won't charge because it's in extreme temperatures (either too hot or too cold). Dyson recommends storing your vacuum between 64 °F (18 °C) and 82 °F (28 °C), but says can use and charge your Dyson when the ambient temperature is 50 °F (10 °C) to 86 °F (30 °C). If you see a red light that flashes more than 12 times, this indicates that your battery is faulty. If you see these lights, you should contact Dyson directly for support. Go to Dyson's support page here and select your vacuum model to get started."

      "title": "Take care of your Dyson vacuum's battery to maximize its life.",
      "content": "Take care of your Dyson vacuum's battery to maximize its life. As stated above, battery life is somewhat unpredictable. However, there are a number of things you can do to ensure your Dyson's battery will have the longest life possible. We've listed them below: [2] X Research source Only use your vacuum's maximum power mode when you really need it. Your Dyson's \"Boost\" or \"Max\" mode is best used in short bursts due to how intensive it is on the battery. For everyday cleaning, use one of the lighter modes. Don't use your vacuum in extreme temperatures, if you can help it. Not only does very hot or very cold weather make your Dyson not work properly, it can speed up the battery's degradation. This includes overheating due to lengthy periods of use. If you have a big vacuuming job, tackle it in small bursts so your vacuum doesn't get too hot and power down until its temperature is regulated. Let the battery run down to empty from time to time. At least once a month, allow your Dyson's battery to become fully empty. This allows the battery to discharge fully, which Dyson says is best for the life of your battery in the long-term."
