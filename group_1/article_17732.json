      "title": "Gather two large, heavy objects.",
      "content": "Gather two large, heavy objects. These objects need to be wide enough to cover the entirety of the record. They need to be heavy enough to put pressure on the record without warping it further. Two large books are best for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the warped record between the objects.",
      "content": "Place the warped record between the objects. Put the first object on a flat surface, such as a table. Put the record atop the object, followed by your second heavy object. Make sure the objects cover as much of the record as possible; if any part sticks out, they may be warped. Before you place the record between the two objects, ensure it is clean. The last thing you want is a grain of sand grinding a scratch into your record."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare to wait for a few days.",
      "content": "Prepare to wait for a few days. This is perhaps the longest method you’ll use. You’re relying on constant, gradual pressure to un-warp your record, and this will take some time. Prepare to wait for days, maybe even weeks for the record to un-warp."

    {
      "title": "Place the record between two sheets of glass.",
      "content": "Place the record between two sheets of glass. Center the record atop the first pane of glass. Take the second sheet and place it on top of the record, essentially sandwiching the record between the glass panes. It’ll be easier to pick up the glass sheets afterwards if you leave one of their corners hanging off of the table as you set it up."

    {
      "title": "Preheat the oven to about 175 °F (79 °C) and place the record inside.",
      "content": "Preheat the oven to about 175 °F (79 °C) and place the record inside. [1] X Research source Depending on your oven, preheating should take between 10-15 minutes. Once the oven has reached the right temperature, carefully slide the record and glass combination onto the oven rack. Don’t push the glass too far into the oven; this will make it easier to retrieve later. Make sure the glass is at room temperature before putting it in the oven, otherwise it might shatter. [2] X Research source Use oven mitts to avoid possible burns."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the record sit in the oven for no longer than 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the record sit in the oven for no longer than 3 minutes. Any longer than this and the record could melt. Keep a close eye on the record as it warms. If you notice any strange smells or noises, remove the record quickly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the glass and record from the oven.",
      "content": "Remove the glass and record from the oven. Use oven mitts as the glass will be hot to the touch. Place the glass panes on a flat surface, such as a table or countertop. To avoid damage to your surface, you may want to place a potholder, towel, or cutting board between it and the glass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a heavy object in the center of the glass pane, over the record.",
      "content": "Place a heavy object in the center of the glass pane, over the record. This constant pressure, combined with the heat, is what will help repair the record. Leave the object on the glass pane until it cools. Once the glass has cooled, you can remove the record."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the record carefully.",
      "content": "Inspect the record carefully. If the record still shows significant warping, try repeating the above steps until it has been fixed. Otherwise, try placing it in a record player to see if you’ve been able to repair the damage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store your records away from direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Store your records away from direct sunlight. Leaving them in sunlight or heat can cause warping. Keep the records away from windows and heating. You’ll also want to make sure you don’t leave your records in a vehicle on a hot day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid stacking your records.",
      "content": "Avoid stacking your records. Vinyl records are relatively heavy, and stacking them atop each other puts significant pressure on the records at the bottom of the pile. This can cause them to get warped, scratched and scuffed. Make sure you store your records vertically to avoid this pressure. Cube shelves works great for storing vinyl records."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your records away from humidity.",
      "content": "Keep your records away from humidity. While most people typically store their records in a basement, the typical humidity in these spaces will likely warp the records. Try to find a space you can use that isn’t overly humid. If a basement is your only choice, you should consider installing a dehumidifier to provide a safe place to store your records."
