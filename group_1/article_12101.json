      "content": "Keep the peels on potatoes to reap the nutritional benefits. Potato peels are full of fiber, which helps boost your digestive health. So, leave the peels on regardless of the type of potato you’re eating and the dish you’re making to add extra fiber content into your diet. [1] X Research source Potato peels also contain a good source of iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin B, and vitamin C. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you can’t stomach the texture of potato peels, don’t worry! The flesh of the potato is full of beneficial vitamins like vitamin C and potassium. Note : Wash your potatoes under lukewarm water and scrub the skin with a vegetable brush , regardless if you’re removing the peel or not. This gets rid of dirt, bacteria, and pesticide residue. Then, cut off any scabs, sprouts, green spots, or bruises. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source"

      "content": "Leave the peels on if you're cooking waxy or new potatoes. Waxy potatoes, such as yellow or red potatoes, have thinner peels and more flavorful flesh. Small new potatoes, which are the first of the season, are flavorful and usually too small to peel easily. Keep the peels on these spuds since they don’t typically get in the way of the texture or flavor of your dish. [4] X Research source New potatoes are great when prepared simply. Roast the tiny potatoes or steam them to preserve their delicious flavor."

      "content": "Leave the peels on to add a rustic texture to soups or chowders. Thick soup, creamy chowders, and chunky stews typically have a heartier texture if you leave the peels on the potatoes. To make the dishes easier to eat, keep the potatoes about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size or smaller. [7] X Research source When making creamy soups , opt for starchy potatoes that break apart easily, like Russet, Yukon Gold, and yellow potatoes. For thick stews and chowders, go for potatoes that hold their shape better, like red, purple, and fingerling spuds. [8] X Research source If you use potatoes with thicker peels, like Russets, cut them into even smaller pieces so you don't get large bites of skin."

      "content": "Avoid peeling potatoes if you're trying to save time in the kitchen. If you're in a time crunch, peeling your potatoes is an extra step that can add to your cooking time. If you and your guests don’t mind the texture of peels, use any potato to make your dish. Or, choose a waxy or new potato with thin skins that are less noticeable. [10] X Research source As always, make sure you clean your potatoes and trim away blemishes with a small paring knife before you cook them."

      "title": "Remove any green skin on potatoes.",
      "content": "Remove any green skin on potatoes. Potatoes can start to turn green if they’re exposed to light for a long time. This indicates that the potato is producing solanine, which can be toxic and make the potato taste bitter. Simply peel the potato or cut off any small spots of green before cooking your spuds. [11] X Research source Warning : Do not serve green potatoes to children, even if you cut off the green spots. Children are more susceptible to the toxin. If the potato is covered in green spots, throw it out. To prevent green spots from forming, store your potatoes in a cool, dark, and dry place that gets good air circulation."

      "title": "Remove the peel if you're cooking floury potatoes.",
      "content": "Remove the peel if you're cooking floury potatoes. Floury or starchy potatoes like Russet and white potatoes tend to have a thicker peel. If these spuds have a chewy or firm texture that’s too much for you, simply peel off the skin whether you’re boiling, roasting, mashing them, or adding them to soup. [12] X Research source Compost the potato skins or throw them away if you’re not using them."

      "content": "Strip the skins if you're blending the potatoes into a soup. If you’re after smooth, velvety stews and chowders with an even consistency, peel your potatoes. Removing the skins also ensures you get the silkiest consistency when you make a vichyssoise or bisque. [15] X Research source If you don’t like the texture of potatoes in soup even when the peels are off, purée them. This gets rid of any chunky pieces of potato."
