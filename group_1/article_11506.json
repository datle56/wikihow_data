      "content": "Just jump into an interaction and start. When you enter a party or a club, don't waste time. - Just start doing what you intended. This is a crucial step; the more you delay, the harder it would get. So just as you enter the club, push yourself to begin, even if every fiber in your body is against it. You will realize that your mental state prior to pushing yourself was irrational and feel better instantly. Some of the ways to do that are: Start talking to people around you. Jump on the floor and dance alone for a while until you feel more relaxed."

      "content": "Go to her. Approach her in a way that she sees you coming and start dancing with her, without touching. This will tell if she is down to dance and comfortable with you. There is another dominant way to do it and if done properly then you can skip a lot of steps in between. Go and grab her waist. Approach her from side or front, say something like 'Hi, you look adorable' and grab her waist. Don't have a firm grasp, it will sub-communicate that you are too drunk and doing it because of the 'liquid courage'. Don't have a loose grasp either as this will tell that you are unsure and creepy. Keep a balance. This requires a lot of confidence which says that you believe in your core that 'you deserve and are worthy to dance with her and even if she doesn't want to, it would not be a big deal for you'. If she feels uncomfortable after this move, back off and go slow, if she is still dancing besides you, or move on to the next one if she is gone."
