      "content": "Stay out of the sun. As much as you can, try to stay out of direct sunlight, especially during the hours between 10am and 4pm. This is when the sun’s rays are the strongest. [1] X Research source If you have to go out in the sun, try to carry a parasol to create some shade for yourself. If you are sitting outside, try to sit somewhere that is shaded and out of the sun."

      "title": "Wear high SPF sunscreens.",
      "content": "Wear high SPF sunscreens. Even if you don’t expect to be in the sun, apply a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 each day. You should also do this when it is overcast, as it is possible for the sun’s rays to penetrate clouds, even if you don’t realize it. [2] X Research source Apply the sunscreen to any part of your skin that will be exposed. Don’t forget the tops of your ears, and the back of your neck! If you are worried that sunscreen will make your face greasy, try looking for a sunscreen that is specifically formulated for the face. These might have a lower SPF, but won’t be greasy. If you are worried about breaking out, look for sunscreens that are non-comedogenic."

      "title": "Wear a hat.",
      "content": "Wear a hat. Wearing a hat can protect the sensitive skin on your face, your ears, and your neck. Choosing a hat that has a brim all the way around will help protect the skin on the back of you neck, and it will also cover your ears. [3] X Research source Wearing a hat can be very fashionable as well. You can even make it part of your own unique style if you wear a hat all of the time. Although it won’t help keep your skin pale, wearing sunglasses will also protect your eyes from sun damage."

      "title": "Keep your skin covered.",
      "content": "Keep your skin covered. If it is a very sunny day, try to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. This will keep your skin from burning or tanning. If it is also hot, try to choose light fabrics so that you don’t overheat. [4] X Research source Long maxi dresses will look summery, keep you cool, and keep your legs covered. You can wear a light cardigan to keep your shoulders and arms covered."

      "title": "Make a skin bleach.",
      "content": "Make a skin bleach. If you want to lighten your skin you can make a natural skin bleach using a slice of lemon, a cup of milk, and 2 or 3 teaspoons of natural yogurt. You can smear this mixture on your skin and leave it on for up to half an hour. [5] X Research source Remove the mixture from your skin immediately if you experience any burning or itching. To make the mixture allow the lemon slice to soak in the milk for a few hours. After that, remove the lemon slice and add yogurt, a teaspoon at a time, until the mixture has a thick consistency that you can apply on your skin like you would a face mask."

      "title": "Use a commercial skin lightener.",
      "content": "Use a commercial skin lightener. You may be able to purchase an over-the-counter skin lightener that you can use to make your skin appear lighter. In some cases, you may be able to talk to your doctor about a prescription-strength skin lightener. If you do purchase an over-the-counter product be sure that it does not contain mercury, and only has 2% hydroquinone for best results. It is important that you follow the instructions provided with the cream very carefully to avoid causing damage to your skin. Be aware that using a skin lightening cream comes with its own risks. In many skin lightening products, the active ingredient is mercury. If you use too much of the cream, or if you use it too often, you could be poisoned by the mercury. Skin lighteners may also contain steroids, which can cause long-term health problems if used in excess. Many skin lighteners also use hydroquinone, which can cause unwanted skin discoloration if used improperly."

      "title": "Wash your face",
      "content": "Wash your face day and night. Unless your skin is very dry, you can wash your face in the morning and just before you go to bed at night with a gentle cleanser. [6] X Research source This will help you get rid of any dirt and other bacteria that has accumulated on your skin, and which could clog your pores. When washing your face, use lukewarm water to wet your face, apply a small amount of cleanser to your hands, and gently massage your skin using circular motions. [7] X Research source Be sure to rinse your skin carefully, using lukewarm running water. When you are finished pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Don’t rub your skin dry as this can cause irritation. Be sure to choose a cleanser that is fragrance-free (which might irritate your skin), free from parabens (which are toxic), and soap (which can be drying for the skin)."

      "title": "Use a good moisturizer.",
      "content": "Use a good moisturizer. Choose a daily moisturizer that has an SPF. In order to avoid potential irritation, look for gentle moisturizers that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic. You should apply moisturizer just after you’ve washed your face. Use a quarter-sized amount so that you don’t overdo it, and apply the moisturizer from the center of your face and gently sweep it outwards. [8] X Research source If you want to, you can look for a night time moisturizer (that doesn’t have an SPF), and will usually be a bit thicker and more heavy duty than the date time moisturizer. Again, be sure to look for gentle moisturizers that are fragrance-free and non-comedogenic."

      "content": "Don’t pick at your skin. Picking at your skin will result in redness, irritation, and even pimples. Do your best to keep your hands off of your face as much as possible throughout the day. When you touch your face, you are spreading the bacteria and germs that are on your hands to your face. [9] X Research source If you find that you have a pimple, leave it alone. You can dab a bit of salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or tea tree oil on the pimple, but don’t pop it. This could cause scarring and redness."

      "content": "Use makeup. If you want to, you can use makeup to make your skin look more luminous. You can also use dark makeup (e.g. black eyeliner, black mascara, and a darker lipstick) to enhance the contrast of your skin and your makeup. [10] X Research source If you want your skin to look luminous, don’t go too heavy on the foundation. Too much foundation can look your skin look flat and greasy. Having dark hair can also enhance your pale skin."

      "content": "Eat healthily. Sticking to a healthy diet has effects on your body both inside and out. To keep your skin looking great, try to cut out junk food as much as possible. Stick to eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and healthy fats such as salmon and avocado. This doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the occasional treat, but make sure that you enjoy those treats in moderation."

      "content": "Drink plenty of water. You may not realize it, but your skin is an organ just like your heart and lungs. This means that it is made up of cells. These cells are made of water. This is why you need to drink plenty of water. If you aren’t getting enough water, your skin will feel tight and flaky. [11] X Trustworthy Source University of Wisconsin Health Integrated healthcare system of the University of Wisconsin focused on treating and providing support to patients and public health initiatives Go to source The water that you drink is usually sent to all of your other organs before it is sent to your skin, which is why you have to use moisturizers to keep your skin supple. If you don’t enjoy drinking plain water, try making flavored water using things like lemons, oranges, cucumbers, or strawberries. This will make the water taste great without the sugar and calories of soda."

      "content": "Exfoliate your skin. Most drugstores sell exfoliating scrubs designed specifically for the skin on your body. You can also make your own salt scrub at home using just salt and an oil (e.g. coconut oil or olive oil). [12] X Research source When you exfoliate your skin, it’s easiest to do it in the shower. Wet your skin first. Scoop out a handful of scrub, and rub your hands in circular motions all over your body. You don’t need to exfoliate more than once per week. Over exfoliating can cause irritation and redness."

If you have sensitive skin, it is a good idea to stick to moisturizers that are fragrance-free. [13] X Research source Try out moisturizers to find one that you like. Apply moisturizer just after you get out of the shower or bath when your pores are the most open. This will allow your skin to absorb maximum moisture. [14] X Research source"
