      "content": "Prepare a papaya and other fruit. Wash a ripe papaya, slice it in half lengthwise, discard the seeds and slice off the skin. Cut the papaya into a few large pieces. A papaya smoothie is delicious on its own, but you can also choose to make it with other fruit. Consider these options: Fresh or frozen blueberries. Blueberries have a lot of antioxidants and paired with papaya they would make a powerfully healthy smoothie. Kiwi and avocado. The kiwi offsets the papaya's sweetness with its bright flavor, and avocado makes for an especially creamy smoothie. Spinach or kale. Making a \"green\" smoothie is a great way to get a serving of vegetables at breakfast. Papaya is so sweet and flavorful that you won't be able to taste the greens."
