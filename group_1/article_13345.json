When pressing, you might feel a bit of soreness or pain, but it should be a balance between pain and pleasure. Some points will feel tense; others will feel sore or ache when you press them. If you feel extreme or increasing pain, gradually decrease the pressure until you feel a balance of pain and pleasure. Do not think of acupressure as increasing your endurance to pain. If something is so painful it's too uncomfortable or excruciating, then stop. [12] X Research source"
