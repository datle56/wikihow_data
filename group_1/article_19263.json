If you’re going out to eat and you aren’t familiar with the restaurant, check the restaurant’s Yelp page to see their “attire” and “ambiance” info. This will tell you if the restaurant is casual, fancy, or somewhere in between. If you’re going to be doing an activity, like having a picnic, seeing a movie, or going to a concert, make sure you’re dressed appropriately. It only takes common sense. [2] X Research source A miniskirt and high heels might make you feel glamorous, but they aren’t appropriate for go-karting or bowling. Use your common sense to dress in a way that’s fitting for the occasion and don't be the girl who has to sit out because of her heels. If you’re stumped on outfit ideas, Pinterest can be a great resource. Type in “outfit” and whatever activity you’re doing, and you can see a gallery of outfits that other people might wear. Or just Google it. Simple and easy. Add a splash of color."

Your date might not remember the exact outfit you wear on your date, but if you’re wearing something that makes you feel poised and gorgeous, they will absolutely remember your confidence! Alternatively, your date will likely remember if you’re tugging and fidgeting with your outfit all night, appearing insecure and uncomfortable. [3] X Research source It can be fun to buy a whole new outfit for a date, but you must make sure that it fits properly and comfortably before you head out on your date. When in doubt, wear your “go-to” favorite outfit. If you have a get-up that makes you feel awesome and is appropriate for the date, wear it!"

      "content": "Give your clothes a test run. This is particularly important if you’re wearing something new or going on a date with activity. If you’re going bowling and you discover that you can’t really move your arms in a tight shirt, that’s good to find out beforehand. If you’re seeing a movie and the jeans you picked out are miserably uncomfortable to sit in for long periods of time, find something else. By trying on your outfit beforehand, you ensure that it fits well, it’s comfortable, it looks great, and it’ll work for the specific date environment. Nothing is more stressful than having to find a new outfit five minutes before your date arrives! Set yourself up for success."

This step might not be necessary depending on where you live, but if you live in an area with temperamental weather, it’s very important! If you picked out a sundress and neglected to notice a cold front and thunderstorm moving in, you’re going to be one miserable date by the end of the night. The biggest thing you should remember when picking out an outfit for a date is simply that the outfit is not the star of the show. You are! Your clothing should fit the occasion and the weather so that it isn’t a distraction on your date. You want to spend your time having fun with your date, not worrying about your outfit. That is why planning ahead is key– get the worrying out of the way before your date begins."

Minimize the grease by shampooing it in the shower that day or spraying it with some dry shampoo. Comb it and try to keep it out of your face. Your date will probably be distracted if greasy strands of hair are hanging over your eyes. Let them focus on you, not your hair."

Use your makeup to enhance your natural beauty, not create an entirely new face. It can be tempting to go all out when you’re excited for a date, but try to keep your makeup soft and natural. [5] X Research source Your date already asked you out, so clearly they like your face the way it is! That said, makeup is only a fun addition to your look, but it isn’t absolutely necessary. If you don’t wear makeup regularly and don’t find it necessary, skip it! Don’t feel pressure to wear makeup simply because you’re going on a date."

It’s fun to experiment with new lipsticks and eye shadows, but probably not before a big date. Instead, use the products you use on a day-to-day basis so that you know how to apply it all properly and can ensure that you’ll like the way you look. If you are eager to use a new product, just give it a test run before your date. That will ensure you know how to apply it properly and you love the way it looks."

Bring some small products in your purse so that you can touch it up a little bit whenever you head to the bathroom. If you aren’t concerned with your makeup wearing off, you can certainly skip this step. The only thing that matters is that you feel confident and gorgeous for the entirety of the date."

Don’t worry about planning every word you’re going to say to your date, because that’s completely unrealistic. However, it can be helpful to have a few conversation topics tucked away in the back of your mind in case there is a lull in the conversation. For example, you can plan to ask them about their family, their classes, or one of their hobbies. You might not need or want to discuss these topics once the date starts, but it can help calm your nerves by having them prepared."

If you’re sitting in silence, anxious about how the date is going to go, you may appear nervous and uncomfortable once the date begins.
