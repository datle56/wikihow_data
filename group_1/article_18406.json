      "content": "Get to Monad. Monad is a great place to level up, but it's only available once you've reached the top floor of the Adamah Block, floors 215–254 of Tartarus. It's recommended that you be at least level 60 before you enter Monad. Winning one battle in Monad at level 65 can boost your level up to 72 in an instant. In Persona 3 FES, you will need to defeat the Reaper at the top of Tartarus in order to unlock access to Monad. It is immediately available if you start New Game+ mode in Persona 3 FES.
