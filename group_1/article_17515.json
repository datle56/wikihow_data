      "content": "Add a couch cushion support below the cushion. Cushion supports are solid pieces that fit between your couch and the cushions to raise sagged areas. Simply take the cushions off of your couch, fit the cushion supports on your sofa’s frame, and then put the cushions back on so they’re firm when you sit down. Gorilla Grip Support Boards have multiple plywood boards that fold out to cover the entire area under your cushions so they’re firmer. Amazon Rating: 4.6/5 stars Joewuzun cushion supports are made from high-foam and are sized for individual cushions if only one of yours is sagging. Amazon Rating: 4.6/5 stars Stratiform cushion supports are individually sized and have a curved top for extra support in the middle of your couch cushion. Amazon Rating: 4.0/5 stars"

      "content": "Cut plywood to fit under your cushions. Take the cushions off of your couch and measure the space underneath them. Cut plywood out to the same size and lay it flat on your couch. Then, just place the cushions back on top. The additional plywood prevents your cushions from sagging when you sit down. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place blankets or pillows under the cushion for a quick DIY fix. If you have some extra pillows and blankets, tuck them under the cushions at the lowest points where they’re sagging. Not only will they give your cushion extra support, but they’ll be easy to access if you need them."

      "title": "Use a sofa topper above the cushion for a temporary fix.",
      "content": "Use a sofa topper above the cushion for a temporary fix. A sofa topper is a layer of foam or extra padding that sits on top of your cushions. Simply roll the sofa topper out over any sagging cushions before you sit down. [2] X Research source Try to find a sofa topper that matches the color of your couch so it blends in better. Alternatively, put a sofa cover over the couch and topper so no one can see it."

      "title": "Unzip your cushion covers to inspect the filling.",
      "content": "Unzip your cushion covers to inspect the filling. Most cushions have zippers along one of the edges so you can access the foam padding or stuffing inside. Take your cushions off of your sofa and look for the zipper to undo it. Even if your cushions are attached to your sofa, they’ll usually have a zipper or opening hidden along one of the edges or on the backside of the cushion. If your cushion doesn’t have a zipper at all, then you may use a thread ripper to open one of the seams. However, if you aren’t sure how to sew your cushion back together, you may want to hire an upholsterer to fix your cushions instead."

      "title": "Add in foam inserts if your cushions are worn down.",
      "content": "Add in foam inserts if your cushions are worn down. Tlapa says, “If the couch cushions are foam, then you can buy new pieces of foam core and cut them to size to replace the insides.” Take out the old foam inserts from your cushions and measure their dimensions. Use a serrated knife to cut a layer of upholstery foam down to the correct size. Place the foam on top of your old cushion and slide it back into the cushion cover. Then, sit down and test its firmness. [3] X Research source If the cushions still sag and the new insert doesn’t offer enough support, unzip them and add another layer of foam inside. If your original cushions are completely worn down, then replace them entirely."

      "title": "Use polyfill in cushions that have loose stuffing.",
      "content": "Use polyfill in cushions that have loose stuffing. Polyfill is loose polyester stuffing that feels softer but still adds extra support to your cushions. Take handfuls of the polyfill and push them inside of your cushions to fill in any low or sagging spots. Keep packing in more polyfill until the cushions feel firm again, and then zip them up. [4] X Research source Polyfill is usually the standard filling for the back cushions on your sofa, but the seat cushions may also use it. If you open your cushion and see feathers instead of fiber stuffing, then use down feathers to refill it."

      "title": "Add batting inside your cushions for extra firmness.",
      "content": "Add batting inside your cushions for extra firmness. Batting is usually used inside quilts, but it also adds extra cushioning when your sofa starts to sag. Take out the foam inserts and wrap them in a layer or two of batting. Put the inserts back in and test their firmness. If they still feel like they’re sagging or soft, then add another layer of batting. [5] X Research source Use craft glue or spray adhesive to attach the batting to the foam."

    {
      "title": "Flip your couch cushions when they start to sag.",
      "content": "Flip your couch cushions when they start to sag. If you notice that your cushions are starting to sag, flip them over so the bottom sides are now face-up. That way, you won’t be sitting on the worn down area and making it sag even more. [6] X Research source If your cushion covers have a different fabric on the bottom, like if you have a leather sofa with a fabric vent panel on the bottom, then take the cover off, flip the actual cushion over, and slide the cover back on so the same side is face-up."

      "title": "Beat cushions that have loose stuffing or feathers.",
      "content": "Beat cushions that have loose stuffing or feathers. Loose filling and feathers can get compacted over time, which makes your cushions sag or look lumpy. Stand your cushions up on one of the edges, and repeatedly hit the top and bottom of it to fluff the stuffing. Once it’s evenly distributed inside your cushion, put it back on your couch.

      "title": "Rotate between different cushions when you sit down.",
      "content": "Rotate between different cushions when you sit down. Rather than sitting in the same spot on your couch, switch up your position so you don’t wear down the same cushion. Alternatively, switch the cushions around on your couch so you can sit in the same spot but use different cushions. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Repair any structural issues on your couch’s frame.",
      "content": "Repair any structural issues on your couch’s frame. If you notice that your sofa has a low spot or is sagging even after fixing the cushions, then there may be an issue with the actual frame or couch springs. Inspect your couch for any damage underneath the cushions to see where you need to make repairs. To check for broken springs or slats, turn your couch upside-down and remove the staples on the bottom cover. When you remove the cover, look for any wood pieces that are cracked or damaged. Then, check the springs to see if they’re stretched out or sagging. For damaged wood, cut a new piece of wood to the same size. Remove the old piece and attach the new wood to your couch. [9] X Research source For stretched springs, use a pair of pliers to pinch the coils closer together to make them tighter again. Alternatively, place a piece of plywood under the springs so they don’t stretch or sag when you sit down. [10] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable taking apart or repairing your couch, then contact a professional upholsterer to do it for you."

      "content": "Can couch cushions be repaired if they have visible indents? Yes, cushions with indents just need some extra stuffing added or they need their foam inserts replaced. Once you fill or replace the cushions, the indents will disappear. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "How often should you flip and rotate couch cushions?",
      "content": "How often should you flip and rotate couch cushions? Flip your cushions about once a month. If you’re using your couch and sitting in the same spot every day, then flip your cushions every 2 weeks instead. If you’re not sitting on the cushions regularly, then it’s okay to flip and rotate them every 3 months. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "How do you fix sagging couch cushions that are attached? Most attached sofa cushions still have a zipper so you can access the foam or stuffing inside. Search for a hidden zipper on the underside or back of the cushion. If you’re not able to find one, then it may be best to hire a pro to fix your cushions instead."

An upholsterer will be able to remove or access the cushions more easily, and will make seamless repairs when they’re finished."
