      "content": "Find how many milligrams are in a pill of Benadryl. Different stores will sell Benadryl at different concentrations. Read the label to determine how many milligrams of diphenhydramine a single pill of Benadryl contains. It’s common for Benadryl tablets to contain 25 mg, but some may contain a higher or lower amount. If you need to obtain Benadryl, it should be available at any drug store, pharmacy, or supermarket. Benadryl is sold over the counter, so you won’t need a prescription (for yourself or your dog.) Make sure that you check the ingredients and purchase the version that ONLY contains diphenhydramine in it. Other formulations will include other ingredients that may harm your dog."

      "title": "Administer 1 milligram per pound of body weight.",
      "content": "Administer 1 milligram per pound of body weight. This is the general rule of thumb when giving Benadryl to a dog. Since dogs can be many different weights, you need to know your dog’s weight before administering the medication. For example, if you have a dog weighing 40 pounds, administer 40 mg of Benadryl. Make sure to consult with your veterinarian before calculating the dose your dog needs. You’ll likely need to break Benadryl tablets apart and estimate how many milligrams are in each."

      "content": "Administer Benadryl two to three times a day. To successfully counteract your dog’s allergy symptoms, you can give the dog Benadryl every 8 to 12 hours. Monitor your dog once you’ve administered Benadryl the first or second time: if its symptoms vanish, you don’t need to give a subsequent dose. All of the doses should be the same size. Do not give your dog different level dosages of Benadryl throughout the day."

      "content": "Give the dog Benadryl before it’s exposed to an allergen. Like most antihistamines, Benadryl works most successfully as a preventative drug. If you know that your dog is allergic to something (e.g. a specific type of grass), give the Benadryl before exposing your dog to the allergen. This will prevent your dog from experiencing allergy symptoms. [2] X Research source"
