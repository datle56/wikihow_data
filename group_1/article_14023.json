      "content": "Yes, Macs come with several anti-malware tools. According to Apple, macOS has three built-in layers of anti-malware security. These layers work together to prevent malware from getting into your Mac in the first place—and, if it does, to contain it before it does too much damage. [2] X Research source The first layer of protection prevents malware from being distributed through the App Store. Developers who want to distribute their apps in the App Store are required to submit their apps for scanning and Notarisation by Apple. Your Mac also uses a combination of tools called Gatekeeper, Notarisation, and XProtect to block malware from running on your computer. If malware does manage to get through the first two layers of security, your Mac’s XProtect tool will attempt to fix the infection and remove the malware."
