When you empathize with someone, you put yourself in their position so you can relate to them better, show them compassion, and do your best to help them. You can empathize with anyone, whether it's a partner or the stranger serving your coffee at a local cafe. There are 2 main types of empathy: [1] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Affective (or emotional) empathy enables you to feel and mirror someone else's emotions.

Sympathy refers to showing sorrow or pity for someone else, whereas empathy is the ability to understand and actively share someone else's feelings. Sympathy isn't as helpful when you want to forge a real connection with someone because it doesn't involve seeing things from their perspective—whereas empathy does. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen to other people and give them your full focus. Practice active listening when you talk to other people, and begin conversations with the intention of learning from them. Don't interrupt or spend the whole conversation distracted crafting your responses. It's important to stay in the moment and genuinely listen if you want to empathize and relate to someone.

Go to source Maintain eye contact with the other person and fully face them while they talk. Smile and nod so they know you're engaged with the conversation. Offer a few short verbal affirmations to show them you're listening. Say things like, \"Mmhm,\" \"Go on!\" or \"I understand.\" Be careful not to speak over the other person—wait for a pause before talking."

      "content": "Imagine yourself in someone else's shoes. The best way to understand someone else's perspective is to pretend you're them for a moment. When listening to someone, consider their life and the problems they face. Then, think about how you might feel if you were in their position. What would you do? What emotions would you have? In time, you'll start feeling what the other person is feeling. [4] X Research source If someone gets upset over something you said, for example, stop and think about it. Is there an aspect of their background that explains why they're mad? Would you be upset if someone said that to you? When you feel the other person's emotions like they're your own, it's easier to understand and relate to them."

      "content": "Acknowledge the other person's feelings and offer emotional support. When someone confides their feelings to you, they usually seek validation and compassion. Think about how they must feel and then verbally acknowledge those feelings. Follow up by showing concern and support; ask them how they're doing or if there's anything you can do to help. [5] X Research source A good verbal acknowledgment could be, \"I'm sorry you're going through this,\" or \"That sounds really challenging!\" React based on what they tell you, and show them you understand how they feel. Show interest by saying something like, \"How are you feeling?\" or \"What has that been like for you?\" If they describe a problem, you could add, \"Can I help?\" or \"Let me know if there's anything I can do!\" Offer support and encouragement. You could say, \"I'm so proud of you, and I'm here for you no matter what,\" or \"I'm happy to listen to you anytime. What do you need right now?\""

Maintain a nonjudgmental attitude in your daily interactions and do your best to consider where other people are coming from. When you approach them with no judgment, you’ll feel more open to hearing their perspective (even if you decide you don’t agree with it). [6] X Research source If you feel like you don’t want to be around someone or you don’t like them, ask yourself why. Get to know them a bit more and put yourself in their shoes. Empathy will help you connect and relate to them. Remember that even if you don't agree with someone, you can still empathize. And after getting to know them better, you might find reasons to change your mind about the person. It's normal to slip up every now and again. Press pause if you start thinking about a disagreement or feeling critical about someone's choices. Return your attention to them and focus solely on listening."

If you sit next to someone on a bus, start a conversation instead of reading a book! Try getting to know a neighbor or colleague you see often but rarely speak to.

To understand someone else's emotions, you must first understand your own. Start expressing your emotions rather than repressing or ignoring them. [8] X Expert Source Annie Lin, MBA Life & Career Coach Expert Interview. 25 November 2019. Take time daily to reflect on your feelings and work through negative emotions so you can move past them. Pay special attention to body signals that indicate how you feel. For example, a knot in your stomach is a sign of nervousness. If your body is tense and your jaw is clenched, you could be stressed or frustrated. Your thoughts can also tell you how you’re feeling. For instance, if you’re thinking, “That’s not fair,” you might feel angry or upset. If you think, “This could be fun!” you’re likely excited or hopeful. Find a healthy outlet for negative emotions like anger and sadness, even if you just need to cry for a while . Try writing in a journal and talk to a trusted confidante as well. It's more fun to distract yourself with TV or games than think about sad things, but that prevents you from understanding your own emotions—or expressing them to someone else."

Get in the habit of telling your loved ones and friends how you really feel instead of brushing away your own feelings by saying, \"I'm fine.\" Then, start vocalizing your needs. Tell them when you need help, support, or a sympathetic ear.

Ease into vulnerability by asking your partner for a small, easy favor or telling your friend one emotional detail about your day."

Being empathetic is about experiencing what someone else is feeling. It doesn't have to be something you've felt before.
