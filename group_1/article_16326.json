      "content": "Recognize the benefits of short naps. Falling asleep for even just 10 minutes can help improve your energy, concentration, memory, and focus. Indeed, napping should be considered an asset in improving productivity. Consider building naptime explicitly into your schedule so that you can maximize your potential at work or school. Taking a longer nap is not recommended, since it increases your likelihood of being noticed without providing the maximum benefit. Try to keep your naps to just a few minutes in length when you are at work or school."

      "content": "Find a secret place to nap. In an ideal scenario, you will be able to nap in complete privacy, so that your colleagues and bosses do not realize that you are napping. Find an out-of-the-way location where you can stretch out and close your eyes for just a few minutes. If you can, see if you might be able to nap in the following places: Your office Your car A bathroom A seldom-used storage room"

      "title": "Sit in the back of the room.",
      "content": "Sit in the back of the room. You don't always have the option of napping in private. If you have to go to work or school exhausted, try to get a seat toward the back of the room, away from the speaker or teacher. Give yourself some space to rest without getting caught. As long as you remain at the back of the room, it is unlikely that someone will notice that your eyes are closed."

      "content": "Wear sunglasses. If you feel yourself begin to nod off at work or school, put on a pair of sunglasses. Not only will you be able to sleep more effectively in a dark environment, but it will be less likely that you will be noticed. Nobody will realize that your eyes are closed. [3] X Research source If you do not have a pair of sunglasses, consider wearing a hat or cap that you can pull over your eyes during key moments."

      "title": "Maintain good posture.",
      "content": "Maintain good posture. One of the giveaways that you are sleeping isn't your eyes at all: it is your body language. A slumped posture with a slack jaw, open palms, and open mouth is much more likely to draw attention to your nap than your eyes. When you fall asleep in public, rest your elbow on the desk in front of you and bend your arm 90 degrees. Then prop your head up on your closed fist. This will help keep your head upright and will disguise your nap. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Find an ally. If you are forced to nap among your colleagues or fellow students, enlist a friend who can assist you if you are in danger of being noticed. Your ally might wake you up if your name is called or nudge you when everybody is moving their seats. Be sure to return the favor if your ally also wants to take a secret nap every now and again."

      "content": "Recognize the power and danger of microsleeping. Microsleep is a condition when your brain falls asleep while you are in the middle of a task such as driving or working. Your eyes might remain open during this period even though your brain is not functioning normally. This condition can be powerful, since nobody will realize that you are asleep, and your eyes might indeed remain open. However, this is also a dangerous condition, especially if you are driving a vehicle or operating machinery. If you find yourself losing a few minutes of time, you might be experiencing microsleeps. [5] X Research source Microsleeps are more likely to occur if you experience a prolonged period of poor sleep. They are also more common among those who work second or third shifts. You cannot intentionally microsleep; they are caused by chronic sleeplessness and exhaustion."

      "content": "Recognize that meditation can mimic, but not fully replace, sleep. Moreover, meditation can allow your brain to cycle between beta waves (when you are awake) and alpha waves (the stage that immediately precedes sleep). [6] X Research source By meditating, you are not replacing your sleep cycle. However, you are giving your brain the rest periods it needs in order to be fully awake during your beta cycles. Only 10-15 minutes of meditation can provide this positive, sleep-like benefit. [7] X Research source Those who meditate regularly do not need to sleep as often as those who do not meditate. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is one of the reasons why many people find it easy to fall asleep immediately after meditating: your brain is primed to fall asleep. Meditation is not the same thing as sleep, however. [9] X Research source Meditation can also be used to correct sleep disturbances for this reason."

However, there are methods for meditating that do not require you to close off your vision. Indeed, some people report feeling particularly rejuvenated and refreshed after an open-eye meditation experience. [10] X Research source This type of meditation is particularly useful for those who have to integrate meditation into their public transit commute, workday, or school day: you can meditate without being noticed. All you need is a place to sit and a few minutes of time in which you can meditate."

When you become more advanced, you will be able to meditate in the middle of a busy classroom. But to begin with, try a dimly lit space in your home. Close the blinds and turn off your devices in order to eliminate as many distractions as possible."

      "content": "Get comfortable. Keep your back upright but loose. Sit comfortably. Many people enjoy sitting in the lotus position to meditate. However, you are free to meditate in whatever way keeps your body relaxed. Just be sure that you maintain a good, non-slumping posture. You can sit on a chair, kneel, or even lie down if you prefer. Keep your hands loose and open, resting in your lap. Some people find that incense or scented candles can help them relax and focus. Feel free to try this as you begin to practice open-eye meditation."

      "content": "Practice focusing on two sets of objects at once. You will not be able to meditate with open eyes right away. To build up your open-eye meditation skills, begin by practicing having each of your eyes focus on a different object. Choose one object to your left to focus on and one object on your right to focus on. Try to maintain this dual focus for as long as you can, even if it's just a few seconds. Your brain will be so focused on the visual information that all other distractions and mental noise will begin to disappear, allowing you to achieve a restful, relaxed meditative state. Gradually increase the time you spend focusing on these two sets of objects. If you want to challenge yourself, you might also try turning your head while keeping the image of these two objects in your mind. Soon you will begin noticing other objects in the room that are in front of you. Be aware of these objects, but do not let them distract you. For example, you might be awed by a beautiful beam of light in your home. However, you do not want to think about the dusty shelf you have to clean that you just saw. Dismiss such worries from your mind."

      "content": "Breathe deeply. Once you have gotten used to focusing on two sets of objects at once, begin to integrate deep breathing exercises into your meditation. Breathe in through your nose for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, and then release slowly through your mouth. While you might have to explicitly time yourself as a beginner, your goal is to make deep breathing automatic eventually so that you no longer have to \"count\" inside your head."

Once you have mastered the art of open-eye meditation in a calm, controlled environment, you can begin to bring it into your daily life. It will be challenging to do so at first, but you must be patient and forgiving with yourself. Let your body be a source of calmness and relaxation even while the world around you is chaotic and distracting. Soon, you will be able to achieve a restful, focused state with your eyes open when you are at work, school, or on the bus."

However, there are other ways to achieve a sense of awareness and consciousness while sleeping: this is known as lucid dreaming . A lucid dream is when a dreamer becomes suddenly aware that he or she is dreaming. The dreamer can then gain control of the dream world and be fully conscious during sleep. [11] X Research source"
