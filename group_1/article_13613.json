      "title": "Form an inverted “v” shape with your feet.",
      "content": "Form an inverted “v” shape with your feet. Stand still in your skates, keep your toes together, and spread your heels apart. Balance your weight evenly on each leg and bend your knees slightly so you’re in a good skating position. [1] X Research source Don’t lock out your knees."

      "title": "Apply pressure with the toe of your right skate and lift your left foot.",
      "content": "Apply pressure with the toe of your right skate and lift your left foot. To start moving backward, push off of your right toe while you raise your left skate. Keep your core tight so you’re stable and balanced. [2] X Research source If you’re not comfortable pushing off of the toe of your skate, start by pushing off of a wall."

      "title": "Drop your left foot and apply pressure to left toe.",
      "content": "Drop your left foot and apply pressure to left toe. Once you start to move backward, reverse the process. Drop your left skate back to the ground and push off of the toe of your left foot as you simultaneously raise your right skate slightly. [3] X Research source Don’t look down or it will shift your weight forward and make it more difficult to skate backward. Shift your body weight from one skate to the other as you push."

      "title": "Look over your shoulder to look behind you.",
      "content": "Look over your shoulder to look behind you. You need to look behind you every now and then to avoid running into something or tripping, so glance over your shoulder to see what is behind you as you skate backward. Don’t lean back or turn your whole body to look behind you or you could lose your balance and fall. Practice slowly at first so you get used to looking behind you while you move backward."

      "title": "Push harder and increase the length of your stride to move faster.",
      "content": "Push harder and increase the length of your stride to move faster. When you get more comfortable skating backward, pick up the speed by pushing harder from your toe and increasing your stroke to generate more of a push. Don’t be afraid to fall! It may happen once or twice while you get the hang of it."

      "title": "Get to a comfortable gliding speed.",
      "content": "Get to a comfortable gliding speed. Take a few strides to reach a comfortable gliding speed before you try to jump so you’re better balanced and stable on your skates. It’s much harder to jump while you’re standing still in skates and if you’re moving too fast, you may be unstable and could fall and injure yourself. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring both of your skates together.",
      "content": "Bring both of your skates together. To prepare for your jump, bring your skates together so they’re parallel to one another as you glide. Tighten your core so you're strong and stable on your skates. [5] X Research source Extend your arms out to your side to help you balance if you need it."

      "content": "Squat down and jump straight up. With your feet together, bend your knees to squat down and jump straight up. Bend your knees slightly as you land to help absorb the impact and keep you stable when you land from the jump.

      "title": "Repeat the two motions over and over.",
      "content": "Repeat the two motions over and over. For a toe jam to look good, you need to practice the movements until you can do them in a smooth and fluid motion. Start slow and pick up the speed of the motion as you get better and more confident at performing it. [10] X Research source"

Hold it for at least 3 seconds, then place your foot back on the ground and try it on the other side. Learning how to balance on one skate is an important skill to have if you want to try more complex tricks on roller skates. [11] X Research source Try balancing on one skate while you’re gliding as well."

      "content": "Try doing the moonwalk while skating backward. Once you feel comfortable skating backward, try doing the moonwalk to add a little flair to the movement. Start with the wheels of one skate on the ground and the toe stopper of the other propped up to hold you in position. Push off with the toe stopper and glide backward on the other skate. Then switch the positions so that the skate that was previously propped up is flat and the other skate is propped up and repeat the motion. Alternate the positions back and forth to imitate the moonwalk dance. Start by practicing slowly and then perform it at your own speed once you feel more comfortable."

As you glide, balance on one foot, transfer your weight to the toe of the foot on the ground, then rotate your heel around so that you end up skating backward on one foot. Place your other foot back on the ground for stability as you skate backward. [12] X Research source Perform the trick again while you skate backward to turn back around. Hold your arms out to help you balance."
