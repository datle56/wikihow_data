      "content": "Button or zip up your cardigan. Before you start folding your cardigan, securely fasten the front closures. This will help you fold the cardigan more neatly and easily. [1] X Research source If the cardigan has buttons, make sure to fasten all of them. If it’s a zippered cardigan, pull the zipper up all the way and lay the zipper pull flat."

      "content": "Lay the cardigan front down on a flat surface. Once your cardigan is closed, spread it out neatly on a flat surface, such as a table or counter. Keep the front of the cardigan facing down and the sleeves out to the sides. [2] X Research source Take a moment to smooth the cardigan out to get rid of bumps, bulges, or wrinkles."

      "title": "Fold over one side of the cardigan a third of the way.",
      "content": "Fold over one side of the cardigan a third of the way. Take one of the shoulders and fold it inward toward the center of the cardigan, then continue the fold all the way down to the hemline. Make the fold at around one third of the width of the cardigan. [3] X Research source Smooth out the folded edge to get rid of any bumps or bulges."

      "title": "Place the sleeve parallel to the folded side.",
      "content": "Place the sleeve parallel to the folded side. After you’ve made a lengthwise fold along one side of the cardigan, take the sleeve on that side and fold it down along the edge of your first fold. Adjust the sleeve so that the cuff doesn’t extend past the bottom of the hem. [4] X Research source Try to make the outer edge of the sleeve line up with the outer edge of your fold. Smooth out the sleeve after you make the fold."

    {
      "title": "Repeat your folds on the other side.",
      "content": "Repeat your folds on the other side. Fold the opposite side of the cardigan inward toward the middle, then fold the sleeve over on that side. After you make this fold, the sleeves will overlap slightly in the middle of the cardigan. [5] X Research source Look over your cardigan to make sure both sleeves are neatly lined up along the sides and smooth out any bulges."

      "title": "Bring the hem of the cardigan up to meet the neckline.",
      "content": "Bring the hem of the cardigan up to meet the neckline. Finish up by grabbing the bottom hem and folding the cardigan in half so that the hem meets the neckline. Then, turn the cardigan over so that it is face up. You should have a flat, neatly folded rectangle. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay your closed cardigan face down on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Lay your closed cardigan face down on a flat surface. Button or zip up your cardigan and spread it out in front of you on a flat surface, like a counter or tabletop. Keep the front of the cardigan facing down, since you’ll be making folds along the back. [8] X Research source Put the cardigan down so that the top is closest to you. The easiest way to do this is to hold the garment up so it faces you before laying it down."

      "content": "Visualize a line going down the middle of the cardigan. Smooth the cardigan out so it’s nice and flat, with the sleeves out to the sides. Picture a line cutting it in half down the center from neck to hemline. You’ll be making your folds along this line. [9] X Research source You might find it helpful to “cut” down the middle of the cardigan with the side of your hand to make a slight visible indentation along the center line."

The sleeve should be sticking out away from the cardigan. [11] X Research source This will make it easier to fold the sleeve down so it stays neatly inside the folded cardigan."

      "content": "Make a fold in the sleeve so that it’s parallel to the center line. Take the sleeve on the side you just folded and fold it back in and then downward, toward the bottom hemline. The inner edge of the sleeve should be parallel to the center line of the cardigan. [12] X Research source There should be a diagonal line at the top of the sleeve from around the center of the neckline to the outer edge of your first fold."
