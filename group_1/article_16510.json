[1] X Expert Source Tsahi Shemesh Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 17 September 2019. We know that you don't want to seem lame to others, but if the person only likes you for being tough then they don't really like you at all. They aren't your true friends and they never could be. [2] X Research source day.com/us/blog/counseling-keys/201704/communicating-through-conflict Fighting can have lots of bad consequences for you. If you really, seriously hurt the other person, even if they started the fight, you could go to jail or get in trouble with the police. This can happen even by accident, so it's better to steer away if you can."

      "content": "Plan to have the fight outside the school grounds. Fighting on school grounds could further increase your chances of getting suspended or even expelled. However it's important to note that even if you choose to fight away from the school, you are still very likely to get into trouble with your school for fighting as it is an unacceptable way to behave and solve a problem."

      "title": "Wear proper clothing if you know you're going to be in a fight.",
      "content": "Wear proper clothing if you know you're going to be in a fight. Wear something underneath your shirt, so that if the first shirt rips you will have something on. Wear leggings or athletic shorts. It can be tough to move in tight jeans and leggings are harder to get a hold of. If you're wearing a weave/wig, make sure it's fixed tightly. If it's not tight then your opponent will probably pull your weave. If you do lose a piece of clothing, just keep fighting. Embarrassment is one thing, getting beat up is quite another. If possible, you can remove your shoes. Fighting barefoot can give you an advantage on some surfaces like grass where you may run faster without shoes."

      "title": "Chances are if the other person is a good fighter, their friends will jump in, so you need some to do the same.",
      "content": "Chances are if the other person is a good fighter, their friends will jump in, so you need some to do the same. This can keep you from getting seriously hurt. With a few friends in tow, the fight will probably stay smaller, since no one will let it get really out of control. Make sure to tell your friends that you want to keep the fighting to a minimum. They're only there to protect you! Make sure you have people with you just in case anyone decides to jump in during the fight. Being outnumbered can increase the likelihood of you getting seriously hurt."

If you hold your ground and don't say anything too angering, you might not have to fight at all. [3] X Research source Try using dialogue (talking) to shut the fight down. Say something like, \"I'm tired of all this arguing. It's not going to change anything. Can't we just stay out of each others way?\" or \"Is this really going to fix this problem? I want us both to walk away happy.\" [4] X Expert Source Tsahi Shemesh Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 17 September 2019."

      "content": "While they're talking, stay calm and assess how you think they are vulnerable. If they are shorter - bear down on them. If they're taller go for their legs and their midsection. If they have long hair grab a handful and pull their head down so they can't see. [5] X Research source If you're fighting with a girl, try to grab her by her hair, throw her over your shoulder (if you are strong enough), and beat her up. Getting girls by the hair is very effective because they usually want to keep their hair, so they'll follow your grip. If someone pulls your hair don't back up, but go towards them. If they are smaller, go for a tackle where you'll end up on top. If they are stronger or taller, then go for their crotch."

      "content": "You want to get your attacker onto the ground to try to bring the fight to an end. The best way to do this is to use your own body against them. Grab their pinky, and pull it back towards their elbow. Their arm will follow. Guide the arm so that it goes behind their back and then push them down to the ground. Place your knee at the center of their back and hold their arm in place until they calm down."

      "content": "If they have a weapon, do a roundhouse kick aiming for their hand. It will knock the weapon out of their hand, and their hand will be too hurt for them to pick it up again. You can then proceed to throw/kick the weapon out of their reach. It's also a good idea to carry pepper spray with you in case more fights do happen."

      "title": "Sometimes you have to think smarter.",
      "content": "Sometimes you have to think smarter. In many fights, you'll have to use your smarts to save yourself, rather than being impulsive and trying everything to win the fight. Try using one of these tricks to defend yourself from your attacker: Always have your back facing the wall, if possible, so no one can sneak up on you. Block your face in order to avoid your facial features from being harmed whilst fighting. Make sure your hair is arranged so your opponent has nothing to grab. If you have long hair, put it in a bun in the middle of your head out of reach. Never let them get too close. If you have that feeling something is about to go down, or that they are about to hit you, then go ahead and hit. Alternatively let them hit you first, if you fear getting into trouble. If you want them to fall, lock legs with them and drive your knees upward. When they punch, you can duck down and kick them in the legs."
