I have studied many of your findings during my undergraduate program and find your reintegration of Freud’s psychoanalysis theory beyond fascinating. I have done extensive research on psychoanalysis during my time at the University of Florida—even going so far as to conduct my own studies to better understand the human personality. The study I am currently developing is titled the Ego Project and is what I will be bringing with me to California. After exploring many graduate programs, your research aligns closest to mine, yet explores theories I have failed to question.I would love to meet with you virtually or in person when your schedule allows to discuss possible research opportunities within your program. I have attached my resume and project to this email, and would be more than happy to answer any and all questions. I look forward to hearing from you.Best,Zach Wallace(000) 777-8888"

I am the highest-ranking sophomore in the biology department and am taking numerous classes on molecular structure.I know you are very busy, and I would appreciate even the briefest moment of your time to discuss any upcoming research opportunities in your lab. I am available via phone or Zoom during your office hours Monday and Thursday.I have attached my resume and research project to this email.

I am applying to the PURM program and am very interested in your work. Your theory on the evolution and prevalence of knighthood within Medieval romance is fascinating and thought-provoking. I would love to discuss it in depth with you in relation to my own findings. As an undergraduate focusing on Medieval and Renaissance literature, I have worked on several research projects and presentations. My most recent project has been my Capstone presentation, where I argued the importance of Edmund Spenser’s female figures. I hope to expand this project by exploring the allegorical relationships between Spenser’s knights and damsels in distress while focusing on the parallels between Britomart and Florimell.I would love to meet with you to discuss your groundbreaking research at your earliest convenience.Thank you,Allie Springer(000) 123-4567"
