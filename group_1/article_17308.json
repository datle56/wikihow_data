If you plan to use the tail to whip stitch the crochet project to another piece (like when you’re attaching granny squares ), measure the edge you want to sew and multiply it by 3 to get the length of the tail. For example, if the edge of your project is 3”, leave a 9” tail."

Yarn over the hook with the new yarn, and then pull it through the loop on your hook. [12] X Research source Yarn over a second time and pull through the loop on your hook again. Congratulations! Your new yarn is joined to your project. You can continue with the pattern you’re following."
