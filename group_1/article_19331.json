The bed bugs won’t be able to climb out of these bags after you suck them up. For an extra thorough clean, vacuum around the other parts of your room, like the walls, moldings, trim, and vents. Even your dresser drawers can benefit from a good vacuuming! Dump your vacuum bag or bagless vacuum contents in a sturdy plastic bag. Then, tape the bag shut and toss it in the trash.

[18] X Research source Bed bug dung commonly pops up around mattress seams, mattress tags, baseboards, ceiling/wall seams, and power outlets. You might also spot them behind your bed’s headboard, along the very edge of your rug or carpet, or along the seam of a curtain, around the rod. Bed bugs often group up together after having a meal—these gatherings are known as “aggregations.” Aggregation spots are often filled with adult bed bugs, nymphs, eggs, dung, and molted skins."
