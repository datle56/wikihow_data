In most cases, the setting for Turbo Boost will be in a menu called CPU Specifications , CPU Features , Advanced Core Features , or something similar. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate the BIOS, and press ↵ Enter to make your selections. Press Esc to go back a screen. While the BIOS menu options may differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, this process is the same for Intel’s i5, i7, and i9 chips. Struggling to find the right menu options in your BIOS? Some motherboard manufacturers make things a little confusing in their BIOS. You can find a list of all user guides for all Intel-supported motherboards here ."

Turbo Boost automatically adjusts the clock speed (how fast your CPU can perform tasks) of your CPU based on how much work is being performed. Turbo Boost will allow the CPU to work beyond its normal parameters when running memory-intensive programs or completing complex tasks. So long as this doesn’t cause your PC to overheat, this is no big deal. [1] X Research source How do I know if my PC is overheating? Download a program like Core Temp for free. It’ll monitor the temperature of your CPU and GPU. What is considered too hot for a CPU? It depends on the wattage and clock speed of your CPU, but generally speaking, your CPU should not reach or exceed 80–90 °C (176–194 °F). Anything around 40–50 °C (104–122 °F) is considered “normal” while 35–40 °C (95–104 °F) is perceived as ideal. [2] X Research source"
