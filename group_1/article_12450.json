These are technically not retweets and the process of removing them is the same as it would be for a regular tweet, so what follows is an explanation of how to delete tweets from your X profile."

You cannot delete retweets from others from your timeline, so your only recourse, should it become a problem, is to selectively turn off retweets from specific users. Also, there is no method for bulk blocking of retweets. You have to deal with each user individually. To reduce the clutter, visit the home page of the users that you follow. You will still see the user's original tweets. Note that this is not retroactive: all previous retweets will remain on your timeline. [1] X Research source"
