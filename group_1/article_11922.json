      "content": "Put your friend at ease. Tell your friend, \"I love and support you.\" When your friend comes out to you, they may be nervous that you will reject them after you hear the news. Be an ally and quickly assure your friend that you love them and that, while the news may be surprising, it does not change your relationship together. That said, you may need some time to digest the news in order to come to terms with it. Tell your friend if that is the case, but be very nice about it. Try saying, \"I am very surprised by the news but I love you and I just need a little time to process it.\" Remember they may be very sensitive at the moment."

      "title": "Don't tell other people.",
      "content": "Don't tell other people. It is important to respect your friend's privacy and not spread the word around your friend group and beyond. Instead, you should let your friend tell who they want to. Coming out can be scary and intense, and you should leave that job up to your friend. Try asking your friend \"Who have you come out to?\" If you want to talk about your friend to a parent or guardian, try asking \"Would you be okay with me mentioning that you're gay to my parents if it came up, or would you prefer that I keep it quiet?\""

The fact that you're trying to overcome this shows that you are a good friend. Did you have romantic feelings for your friend? If your friend likes people of your sex, you are now free to ask them out! If your sexual orientations aren't compatible, it may be hard to take.

      "content": "Make your position clear on the issue of LGBT+ rights. Maybe you're over the moon and you'll not only march in gay pride parades, but you want to organise some right now! Let your friend know that. However, if you aren't as accepting, you will need to have a potentially uncomfortable conversation with your friend. Your friend probably has a good idea of where you stand. However, if you have never discussed your negative feelings about their orientation, let them know gently. Let them know you're happy they told you and you're supportive of them to live openly. That does not mean, however, that you want to get involved in their romantic life. Let them know what you're happy discussing or doing with them. Try hard to accept new things they tell you but don't listen or engage if it makes you very uncomfortable. A good friend will be grateful you're trying hard and respect your limits as they stand for the time being."

      "content": "Accept your friend's identity. Acceptance can make a huge different in the lives of LGBTQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual) people. It tells them that they are not broken, and that their sexuality doesn't change others' love of them. Your friend may be craving acceptance, especially if they are ostracized, bullied, or abused because of their sexuality. Be proud of your friend and the strength they showed in making the choice of living openly. Also, encourage your friend to be proud of who they are. Basically, be your friend's cheerleader! Don't try to change your friend. Your friend has the right to express their sexual orientation. It is not your right to try to change that."
