      "content": "Attract and reach out to large sponsors. There is no single way to land a major sponsorship, but it will be easier if you have already created a significant following and have participated in competitive events. Ideally, a sponsor would contact you or your team with an offer. More often, you will need to reach out to potential sponsors with an introductory email. When contacting a potential sponsor, make sure you are polite and professional. Sponsors chief concern is their reputation. If you are offensive in public or private, you will likely discourage sponsorship. Obtaining a large sponsorship creates a steady stream of revenue that will allow you to practice, compete, and generate content at the highest competitive levels. Although winning prize money from tournaments may amount to more, sponsorship revenue is determined by your contract."
