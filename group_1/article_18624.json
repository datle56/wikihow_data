      "title": "Air out your leather in sunlight.",
      "content": "Air out your leather in sunlight. According to Sharma, the best way to get smells out of leather is simply to leave it to air out for a few days. “The smell will automatically go,” she explains. [1] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. So, try leaving your leather in a safe spot with plenty of indirect sunlight and air circulation to air it out; you can do this alone or combine it with one of the cleaning methods outlined below. For example, leave the leather by a window or behind a screen door, where there’s light and air flow. Indirect sunlight is best; if you put the leather in direct sunlight, Sharma recommends only leaving it there for a few hours. “Sunlight can cause leather to fade,” she adds. [2] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Alternatively, you can put the leather outside (as long as the weather is good). [3] X Research source If you need to air out leather quickly after getting it wet, try using a blow-dryer on a low heat setting. Avoid getting the dryer too close to the leather; run it at a distance to soak up the moisture and prevent big water stains."

      "title": "Use new leather to wear it in and help it age out of its odor.",
      "content": "Use new leather to wear it in and help it age out of its odor. Due to the tanning process, new leather typically has a chemical smell—and the easiest way to get rid of that smell is to use your leather product. Trying to mask the smell with perfume or odor-masking agents can actually make the smell last longer, so just use your jacket, shoes, or other product for a few weeks until the smell dissipates. [4] X Research source The same goes for leather that smells like cigarette smoke; leather is a very porous material and absorbs smells easily, but continuing to use it can help the smell fade over time. The aging process will also often your leather, effectively opening its pores and releasing the bad smell."

      "title": "Pack the leather in newspaper or packing paper.",
      "content": "Pack the leather in newspaper or packing paper. Newspaper (and packing paper) are extremely porous, making them great for absorbing any bad smells in your leather. Always check that the leather and newspaper are dry before doing this! Then, crumple up several sheets of newspaper in a box and place the leather item in the paper. Close the box and leave it sealed for 1-2 days. [5] X Research source After a couple days, check to see if the newspaper has effectively gotten rid of the bad smell. If not, you may need to leave the leather there for another day. Newspaper is definitely the ideal choice compared to other types of paper; the loose fiber in the newspaper makes it more absorbent."

      "title": "Wipe down the leather with a vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Wipe down the leather with a vinegar solution. The acid in the vinegar can help counteract bad smells—and although some don’t like the smell of vinegar, it’ll dissipate along with any other bad odors in the leather. Make your vinegar solution with equal parts distilled white vinegar and water. Then, dip a clean cloth in the solution and use it to wipe the solution across the leather’s surface. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a spray bottle and spray the vinegar solution over the leather, then wipe it clean with a cloth. Before cleaning the leather with your vinegar solution, dab a bit of it onto a very small patch of the leather and test it to make sure there’s no discoloration or cracking!"

      "title": "Sprinkle baking soda over the leather to absorb the smell.",
      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over the leather to absorb the smell. Baking soda is great for absorbing bad odors, and it’s safe to use on leather. Gently sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over affected areas (or the entire leather product, if needed). Then, let the baking soda sit there overnight (for 24 hours), and vacuum or brush it away with a clean cloth the next day. Be gentle when brushing to avoid scratching the leather! [7] X Research source You can also put the leather item in a pillowcase or plastic ziplock bag with baking soda and let it sit in the baking soda overnight. You may need to repeat this process with baking soda a few times until the bad odor is completely gone."

      "title": "Apply a professional-quality leather cleaner product to the leather.",
      "content": "Apply a professional-quality leather cleaner product to the leather. Leather cleaners are specifically made to get smells and stains out of leather. While it’s important to follow the specific instructions of the cleaner you choose, using it usually involves spraying it on or using a dry, clean cloth to spread it onto the leather. Most leather cleaners can not only remove odors but also preserve the leather’s color and sheen. [8] X Research source After using the cleaner, use a clean cloth to wipe the leather dry—especially if you’re treating a pair of leather shoes, a jacket, or a purse. Avoid alcohol-based products or odor-masking products like perfume; the chemicals in them can damage the leather’s pores."

      "content": "Clean or replace the cushions in leather couches. When you’re specifically trying to get the bad smells out of a leather couch (like smoke or pet odors), there’s one other thing to consider—the cushions underneath that leather. If none of the other methods seem to work fully, it may be because the couch’s foam cushions have absorbed the odor, too, and need to be cleaned or replaced. Most couches will allow you to remove the leather coverings, so you can clean the couch cushions directly."

      "title": "Condition your leather to prevent bad smells.",
      "content": "Condition your leather to prevent bad smells. Sigal recommends you apply conditioner to the leather surface with a clean cloth or soft bristle brush. Wait a few minutes, let it dry, then brush off any excess conditioner. “Leather is a very finicky material,” Sigal explains. “If not treated correctly, it will start to dry and crack.” [9] X Expert Source Marc Sigal Shoe Care Specialist Expert Interview. 15 January 2020. You can also condition leather every 6 months to prevent odors. There are several conditioner options: Leather conditioner . Most leather conditioners come as a spray that you can apply to the surface of the leather, allowing the chemical to seep into the leather’s pores. High-quality linseed oil . This natural oil is a very effective conditioner for leather clothing (and other leather items). Just massage the linseed oil into the leather with a cloth so it gets absorbed! Shoe polish . Liquid shoe polish will work on leather shoes, jackets, and even bags or purses. You can also use canned shoe polish for leather shoes and boots. For natural leather, get shoe polish with carnauba wax and natural ingredients. Avoid using saddle soap to condition leather since it’ll require a lot of rinsing and may give the leather a streaky look (or sticky surface). [10] X Research source Good conditioners can also be used to soften your leather, according to Sharma.

      "content": "Get your leather professionally cleaned and conditioned. “Professionals use deodorizing chemicals to get rid of smells urgently,” says Sharma. [12] X Expert Source Mallika Sharma Certified Leather Care Technician Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. So, if the odor resists your home remedies or even over-the-counter leather cleaners, consider bringing the leather item to a professional who can clean and condition it. Depending on the item in question (shoes, a jacket, or a watch band, for example), you may be able to get the odor removed for a small fee."

      "content": "An unpleasant odor in your leather products can be caused by many different things. However, there are a few especially common culprits! Try identifying the source of the smell before attempting to clean your leather. If you notice that your leather smells bad, it could be caused by one of the following: [13] X Research source Moisture, mold, and mildew . Because leather is a natural material, it’s absorbent and easily soaks up moisture, which can cause it to develop mold or mildew (along with a characteristic musty smell). Pets . If you have pets in the house, their odor can easily seep into naturally absorbent leather. The same goes for any other odors in the environment, like smoke or even just body odor. Packaging . Leather packaged in airtight containers can have an even stronger smell because the fumes are sealed in too, with nowhere else to go. Tanning agents . As mentioned above, tanning agents during the leather’s tanning process can give it a chemical smell (although vegetable tanning agents can smell differently). Manufacturing . When a leather item is manufactured, substances sometimes used during the process (like fish oil) can leave a lingering smell. Natural aging . Leather can also start smelling as it ages, because the oils and fats in the leather can eventually become rancid."

      "title": "Genuine leather is more likely to develop an odor than faux leather.",
      "content": "Genuine leather is more likely to develop an odor than faux leather. Did you know that the type of leather can change how it develops and gets affected by odors? It’s true! Real leather is more delicate and porous, so it absorbs odors more easily compared to faux leather. Of course, real leather is also stronger and more durable, so it has its upsides! [14] X Research source Faux leather can absolutely develop an odor, too—it’s just not as absorbent as genuine leather, so it doesn’t collect smells as quickly. There are also different types of real leather, like full-grain and top-grain. Full-grain is the highest quality and also the most porous (meaning it absorbs odors the easiest). Top-grain is thinner because its surface layers have been sanded off, and it’s not quite as prone to picking up smells."

      "title": "Why does fake leather have a fishy smell?",
      "content": "Why does fake leather have a fishy smell? Fake leather is often produced with phthalates, or plasticizers. Over time, those chemicals percolate to the material's surface, giving it a strong, fish-like smell. Cleaning and storing faux leather in well-ventilated areas can prevent this smell!"

      "content": "Is a hot car bad for leather? Yes, leaving leather in a hot car can be bad for it. If it’s only in a hot car for a brief period, the leather can get slightly dry or faded—and repeated exposure to a hot car can cause the leather to crack, lose color, or get very stiff."

      "title": "What should you do if the leather smells even stronger after cleaning it?",
      "content": "What should you do if the leather smells even stronger after cleaning it? This might mean the cleaning product you used had a reaction to the leather or just wasn’t fully wiped away. Try gently wiping the leather with water and drying it; if that doesn’t work, it might be time to visit a professional for leather cleaning."
