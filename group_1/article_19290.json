Wash your face when you wake up in the morning and before going to bed at night. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you can find one, use a face wash that contains exfoliating particles to help smooth your skin. If you have acne on other parts of your body such as your shoulders, back, and chest, give these areas a scrubbing twice daily as well with the same cleanser as you use on your face. If you wear makeup, never go to bed without washing it all off. Sleeping with makeup on is a surefire way to increase your pimple-count and make getting rid of your acne even more difficult. Use an oil-free makeup remover prior to washing with your regular cleanser to make sure all traces have been removed."

      "title": "Exfoliate",
      "content": "Exfoliate your face. Exfoliates are mild scrubbing products that work to slough (to get rid of) off dead skin cells that build up and cause acne. Exfoliation can be chemical or physical. For a gentler approach, use a chemical exfoliator, an AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) or BHA (beta hydroxy acid) at a pH between 3 and 4 to slough off skin. A chemical exfoliation un-glues dead skin. [5] X Research source A BHA product often cited includes salicylic acid, it must be between a pH between 3 and 4 to work. A BHA works to slough (to get rid of) off dead skin cells and encourage new skin growth. As a result, you may experience dry skin and scaliness around your acne, but this will dissipate over time as your skin begins to regenerate faster. Use this in a cleanser or spot treatment daily on the acne-affected areas of your skin. [6] X Research source Aspirin tablets, which contain salicylic acid, a BHA can be ground up and mixed with water and then put on your zits to reduce redness and swelling. Rub a light layer of honey into your skin, and let it sit for 30 minutes. Rinse off with warm water. Honey has a variable pH from 3 to 6, but at a pH between 3 and 4, it contains AHA's that will exfoliate skin. For physical exfoliation, consider purchasing a konjac sponge. It is gentle enough for usage upon your face. For physical exfoliation, consider using oatmeal as an exfoliate. Mix oatmeal with honey and rub it onto your face for 2-3 minutes, and gently rinse away the residue with warm water."

Toners work to tighten pores making it less likely that dirt and oil will become trapped in them. Buy acne toners at a local drugstore, or use witch hazel or apple cider vinegar dabbed on with a cotton ball. Don’t rinse toners after application - allow them to stay on your skin."

Certain medications can be prescribed by your dermatologist to help with particularly bad cases of acne, but should be used with caution. As with all medications, there may be unwanted side-effects in a small portion of the population. An antibiotic pill can help kill the bacteria that may be causing your acne. Topical antibiotics applied directly to the skin can also be used. Going on a specialized form of birth control (for women) can help to regulate hormones which may be producing your bad acne. Ask your dermatologist if this seems like a good option for you to take. In particularly troublesome cases of acne, a specialized drug known as accutane can be prescribed. This is an incredibly intense retinoid treatment that has shown to almost completely remove all acne in users. However, it has the most serious side-effects of any acne-fighting drug and should be used with extreme caution."

      "title": "Wear sunscreen everyday and do not tan.",
      "content": "Wear sunscreen everyday and do not tan. Ultraviolet Radiation is the number one cause of premature aging. It also leads to skin cancer in high enough doses. Treat the sun like the death ray that it is. Exposing your skin to harmful UVA and UVB rays damages skin and prolongs post inflammatory erythema(PIE)--red acne marks, as the sunlight stimulates pigment-producing cells. Not only can the sun prolong PIE appearance, it can lead to premature aging including sun spots, fine lines, and wrinkles. UV damage is DNA damage. Sunscreen is an anti-aging must for all ages young and old--preventing future skin cancer. It is the fountain of youth in a bottle. Prevention is better than treatment. There is no such thing as safe tanning, as tanning is the result of sun damage. Therefore, it is very important that you wear sunscreen everyday, with an SPF of 30.Of note, after SPF 30, there are decreasing marginal returns in UVB protection. The % of UVB protection as a function of SPF Value is a log graph and plateaus after SPF 30. Therefore, there is not much difference in protection between SPF 40 and 50. Sunscreens with an SPF 100 are banned in some countries. For UVA protection, a sunscreen with a high UVA protection of PA+++ or higher of PA++++ as recommended, especially to treat PIE. PPD is the UVA equivalent of SPF; use a sunscreen with a minimum of PPD20. The PA+ system has a + that corresponds to a tier of PPD protection. Of note, different countries use different PA systems. Japan and Taiwan changed their PA system to a 4+ tier system while Korea uses a 3+ tier system. When out in the sun for long periods of time, stay in the shade as much as possible and wear a wide-brimmed hat and light, long-sleeved clothing. Wear sunglasses, especially those that have less melanin in their eyes. Consider using a parasol, and carrying it about with you. In Asia, they are a popular fashionable accessory."
