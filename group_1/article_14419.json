      "title": "Place 2 pencils at each end of a paperclip.",
      "content": "Place 2 pencils at each end of a paperclip. Place your paperclip down on a piece of paper where you want to draw your circle. Then, take 2 pencils and place their tips inside the paperclip on opposite ends. [1] X Research source Or, use 1 pencil and another object like a short skewer, the tip of a pen, or even the tip of your finger. Just make sure the object is thin enough to fit inside the paperclip."

      "title": "Move 1 pencil around to draw your circle.",
      "content": "Move 1 pencil around to draw your circle. Determine which pencil will act as the anchor and which one will do the drawing. The anchor will be the center of your circle, and the other pencil will draw the outside of the circle. Press down firmly on the anchor to keep the paperclip steady as you move the other pencil around the center to draw your circle. [2] X Research source If you used 2 pencils, there will likely be a small dot in the center of your circle when you’re done. Erase this if you don’t want it in your drawing."

    {
      "title": "Separate the paperclip to draw a bigger circle.",
      "content": "Separate the paperclip to draw a bigger circle. If you want to draw a larger circle, bend the paperclip so that it spreads out and forms an S shape. Place a pencil inside each of the rounded ends of the paperclip. Hold one pencil down as your anchor and move the other pencil to draw a circle around it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the wrist of your drawing hand on the paper.",
      "content": "Place the wrist of your drawing hand on the paper. Hold your pencil in your drawing hand and place the outside of your wrist down on the paper. Position your wrist so that the bone at the base of your hand on the side of your pinky finger is pressing down on the paper. Your wrist will act as your anchor while you draw and will mark the center of your circle. [4] X Research source Using your wrist as an anchor lets you draw a large circle. To draw a medium-sized circle, use the second knuckle of your pinky finger on your drawing hand as your anchor. To draw a small circle, press the tip of your middle finger on your drawing hand onto the paper."

      "title": "Spin the paper underneath your hand.",
      "content": "Spin the paper underneath your hand. Use your free hand to spin the paper around on the table. Press down with your wrist, knuckle, or finger hard enough so that it doesn’t move from its spot, but not so hard that you can’t spin the paper. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Lower your pencil onto the paper.",
      "content": "Lower your pencil onto the paper. Keep spinning the paper and slowly lower your pencil until the tip touches the paper. Hold your pencil with a firm grip and do your best not to move it as you draw your circle. Spin the paper around until you have a complete circle. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Find something round that you can trace.",
      "content": "Find something round that you can trace. Any round object will work. Use a glass with a round top or bottom, the bottom of a candle, a roll of tape, or a circular piece of paper. Choose an object that’s closest to the size you want to make your circle. Just make sure the rounded edge is smooth so that you can easily glide your pen or pencil around it."

    {
      "title": "Trace around the edge of the object.",
      "content": "Trace around the edge of the object. Take a pen or pencil and follow along the round edge of the object until you’ve completed the circle. When you’re finished, take the object off the piece of paper and you’ll have a perfect circle. If there are any gaps in the circle after you remove the object, fill them in with your pen or pencil."

This is meant to protect your table or whatever surface you’re drawing on from getting any holes in it. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that the pin will leave a hole in your paper when you’re done drawing. If you don’t want to punch a hole in your drawing, use a different method."

Press the pin in deep enough so that it doesn’t wiggle around. If it moves while you’re drawing, you’ll likely end up with a squiggly circle. [9] X Research source"

If you want to draw a small circle, use a small rubber band or wrap the rubber band around the pin multiple times until it’s your desired length.

If you place it too high, you might accidentally pull the pin out of the paper as you’re drawing. [11] X Research source If you’re using a string, tie another loop into the other end of the string. Then, place your pencil in the loop so that the string sits just above the lead of the pencil."

Maintain the same distance as you move the pencil around the center to draw your circle. [12] X Research source Don’t pull too hard on the rubber band since this might cause the pin to come out of the paper. If you’re using a string, pull on the string until it’s taut, and then draw your circle."

Don’t trace the flat edge of the protractor unless you want a line running through the center of your circle. Press down on the protractor using the hand that’s not doing the tracing to make sure it stays in place.

Make sure that the lead of the pencil is evenly in line with the compass’s needle. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a compass, make your own with pencils and rubberbands. Take two pencils and place them side by side. Then, tie them together with a rubber band just below the end where the erasers are. [14] X Research source Spread the 2 pencils apart so that they form a V shape. Then, place a third pencil (or another straight object, such as a popsicle stick) across the 2 pencils just above their tips. The 3 pencils should look like the letter A. Finally, tie 2 more rubber bands around the spots where the 3 pencils intersect. Now you have your own hand-made compass!"
