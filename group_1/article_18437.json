      "content": "Eat protein to gain muscle. If your goal is to put on muscle mass, then you need to be eating protein-rich foods on a regular basis. It's especially good to eat protein after a workout. Lean meats (such as chicken, lean pork, and fish), eggs, beans, and lentils are all great sources of protein, as well as yogurt and nuts and healthy oils [1] X Research source Even something as simple as chocolate milk is a good way to get in your protein, although be mindful that most chocolate milks contain a lot of sugar, which isn't good for you in large quantities. [2] X Research source Also try to eat protein right before going to bed. Drink some milk or eat some yogurt to fuel you through the night. This may also help you recover if you work out frequently. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Stir in protein powder to your yogurt, oatmeal, and other foods to add a protein and calorie boost."

      "content": "Add calorie-dense foods to your meals. Try adding full-fat cheese to the top of your meals. Stir some peanut butter and honey into your oatmeal. These foods are high in calories and can help you increase your overall caloric intake. [4] X Research source Another calorie-dense food is dried fruit, such as dried apricots, figs, or raisins. Eat complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, bulgur, barley, whole grains, and quinoa. Avoid simple carbs like white flour, sugar and white rice."

Simply stir in the powder while you're cooking. Wait for it to dissolve before you serve the dish.

      "content": "Eat healthy oils and fats. Healthy oils, such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts (which have healthy fats in them), are rich in nutrients as well as high in calories. Adding a dash of oil to a salad or topping your meal with some sliced avocado is an easy way to increase calories. [6] X Research source For instance, if you're enjoying some mashed potatoes, stir in some olive oil to make them creamier. For a quick mid-afternoon snack, a handful of almonds or peanuts is a good option. Seeds such as sunflower and pumpkin seeds have a high level of calories and also contain \"good\" fats that raise your good cholesterol levels. Use coconut oil sparingly. Although it does boost your \"good\" cholesterol levels, it is 90% saturated fat and too much of it could cause health issues. Other oils, such as olive oil and soybean oil, provide more health benefits. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Include treats in your diet more often. Though you want to keep your foods nutritionally dense, it's fine to include treats every now and then to help increase your calories. Have a brownie after dinner if you're craving chocolate. Just don't make sugar the bulk of your food. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might consider having 1 treat daily."

      "content": "Eat comfort foods while you're sick. If you just don't feel like eating while you're sick, one of the best tricks is to pick foods that are comfort foods for you. That way, at least you are still getting enough calories to sustain yourself. It's important to try to incorporate fruits and vegetables as much as possible, but when nothing sounds good, pick something you normally enjoy. Bland foods such as mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese can be good choices, since they're packed with calories but unlikely to upset your stomach when you're sick."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure to eat balanced meals with protein, whole grains, vegetables, and fruit.

You may have a tendency to skip breakfast, only eating 2 main meals, but making sure you actually eat three meals can help you gain weight.

      "content": "Eat regularly. Eating often throughout your day can provide you a steady flow of calories. Try to eat at least every 4 hours, whether it is one of your meals or a small snack. If you're not up to a meal, have a snack that includes protein and three different types of food. If you prefer, you can create 4-6 smaller meals throughout the day, rather than adding snacks between larger meals. For instance, try a piece of whole grain bread with banana and peanut butter or some celery with hummus and feta cheese."

      "content": "Keep calorie-dense snacks on hand. Prepare snacks ahead of time that are easy to grab and eat. If you have them on hand, you're more likely to eat when you should. For instance, you can mix dried fruit, chocolate chips (dark is best), rolled oats, and a nut butter. Make them into golf-ball size portions, and store them wrapped individually in parchment paper or wax paper. For quick snacks, keep trail mixes on hand, as the mix of nuts and dried fruit is calorie-dense."
