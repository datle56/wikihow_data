      "content": "Review the project guidelines. If you’re making the file for a school project , go over the project guidelines provided by your teacher. Be sure to follow any formatting or decorating instructions. For instance, your teacher may not allow clipart or printed images on the file."
    },
    {
      "title": "Match the project file to the theme of the project.",
      "content": "Match the project file to the theme of the project. The style and theme of the project file should have something to do with the project itself so everything is cohesive. For instance, if your project is about marine life, you could make the project file blue and decorate it with pictures of coral and fish. Alternatively, if your project is about a specific book, you could draw pictures of the characters or sketch a scene from the story."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your ideas before you begin decorating.",
      "content": "Outline your ideas before you begin decorating. Once you know how you want your project file to look, map it out on a separate piece of paper with the same dimensions as the file. If you outline your design first, it can save you time spent correcting mistakes later. [1] X Research source You can use a ruler to figure out how much space you’ll use for each element as well as to help you center text or pictures. You don’t need to add tons of details; simply map out a quick sketch with text boxes, stick figures, and the like."

    {
      "title": "Don’t make the project file too busy.",
      "content": "Don’t make the project file too busy. You don’t have to cover every square inch of space! You can simply add a border and put the title of the project and your name in the middle. Even if you want to make a more detailed design, be sure to leave some blank space on the page. Aim to leave at least a quarter of the page blank. If you decide to add text or a title, leave room around it so it’s easy to read."

      "title": "Keep your work as neat as possible.",
      "content": "Keep your work as neat as possible. Take your time and pay attention to the details. Check all your text to make sure there are no spelling or grammatical errors. Avoid crossing out misspelled words—cover the area with a new sheet of paper or start over, instead."

      "content": "Make an outdoor scene for nature-themed projects. If your project is about nature, the environment, animals, or habitats, you can make your project file look like an outdoor scene. Be sure to focus on the specific element of nature that the project focuses on. [2] X Research source For instance, if you’re depicting a bug’s habitat, use a green marker to draw grass of varying lengths “growing” up from the bottom of the page. Add layers of dirt in addition to worms, insects, and plants to fill out the project file."

      "title": "Include lots of images for an art project.",
      "content": "Include lots of images for an art project. If you’re decorating the file for an art project, forgo words and letters and focus on the images. You can make your own artistic creations or even do a rendition of a famous painting or sculpture, depending on the focus of the project."

For instance, draw an important scene from the book that shows the main characters. If you want to add symbols, choose ones that are central to the story, such as an albatross and ship for “Rime of the Ancient Mariner” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. If you use letters to decorate the file, be sure to vary the order and use every letter of the alphabet. Use a variety of colors to make the cover more interesting. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source You can use white school glue, a glue stick, or rubber cement."

[8] X Research source You could also print out the text on a separate sheet of paper, cut it out, and glue it to the file.

Just don’t use too much, or it might be overwhelming—not to mention messy! Use glitter to add accents, such as in a border around the edge. You could also cut out a piece of shiny paper that’s smaller than the project file by about 3 inches (7.6 cm) on each side. Glue it to the center of the file to make it stand out from the background."
