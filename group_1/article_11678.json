      "content": "Deflect the bully with humor. Laugh it off to show the bully they can't control your emotions. When a bully starts bothering you, take a deep breath and start laughing. Laugh at everything they say—the worse the insult, the harder you should chuckle. After laughing, simply turn around and walk away without adding anything else. This tactic frustrates bullies because they want you to cry, not laugh. [1] X Research source Try to think of it as something hilarious and actually laugh, or imagine something genuinely funny to you, so your laugh sounds more natural. Don't make jokes at your own expense, however. That'll only add fuel to the fire and give them something else to pick on you about."

Do your best not to show any reaction in front of the bully—just walk away if you can.

      "content": "Distract yourself from the bully. Use distraction tactics so the bully can't see how you really feel. One good tactic is to count down from 100 until you're somewhere safe. This way, you won't react to whatever your bully says because your mind is focused on something else. Come up with a distraction plan that works for you, whether counting, spelling or singing a song in your mind. [3] X Research source For example, you could recite the lyrics of your favorite song to yourself. Alternatively, you could try spelling your first and last name backward and then your parents' names to keep your brain busy."
