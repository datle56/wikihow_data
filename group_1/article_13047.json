You may unplug the eject button assembly from the mainboard by simply pulling on the blue plastic attached to the end of the wire. [3] X Research source"

If you are not accessing the DVD internals, leave the cover in place to prevent damage to the laser when maneuvering the console."

Preferably, set the PSU on a clean sheet of paper so that it will not get any conductive residue on it. It is also now possible to remove the metal hard drive cage. If desired, you may remove the controller port from its ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket. Gently flip up the long brown cover on the board-side socket with a small flat tool, then lift out the wire."
