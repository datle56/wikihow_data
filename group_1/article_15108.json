Keep the bills in an area where they won't get blown away or easily lost. Avoid putting the bills near open air vents or next to tight crevices where the bills could fall. Try arranging them on the edge of a sink so the water will drip to the ground."

      "title": "Use the sun's warmth to dry out your bills.",
      "content": "Use the sun's warmth to dry out your bills. This often takes up more time than using a blow dryer or fan, but it requires the least amount of effort. Find a sunny spot like a windowsill or the dashboard of a car to ensure the bills are getting enough warmth. Close any windows and try to minimize air circulation so the bills aren't getting blown away. Divide the bills. In order to get each bill as dry as possible, you need to separate each one and arrange them next to each other in your sunny location. Leave the bills out for a few hours. The time varies based on how sunny it is and how soaked your bills are. In most cases, it only takes 2-4 hours for the sun's warmth to cause the water to evaporate from the monies, leaving them crisp and dry."

      "content": "Set the heating of the iron to the lowest setting. You may be tempted to set the iron temperature higher in order to dry the bill faster. However, this can lead the bills to become burnt or even set aflame in some instances. Take the time and make sure it's on the lowest heat setting so your bills are dried without becoming damaged."

      "content": "Iron each bill. Move the iron over the bill in a steady, back-and-forth motion. Never place the iron on the bill and wait. This will cause the bill to catch on fire or become burnt. Iron the bill back and forth, and then flip the bill over to iron the backside. Each bill should be dried in about 30 seconds, but it may take longer depending on the saturation."

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) in the Department of Treasury accepts mutilated currency claims, which include wet money. However, there a few requirements that need to be met before placing a claim. [3] X Research source More than 50 percent of the bill must be able to be identifiable as U.S. currency by the BEP. If your wet bills have been severely ripped, the BEP may still accept them if you can provide enough supporting evidence that the missing portions have been destroyed. For those in the United Kingdom, The Bank of England offers a similar service for replacing damaged currency."

Find a sturdy envelope for your currency, and learn to take extra precautions when packing it. For wet bills that were rolled, never attempt to unroll or straighten them out. For bills that were straight when water damaged, don't roll them up or add any adhesive if the bills were ripped. Wet currency that's especially frail should be wrapped in cotton or plastic in order to preserve it as much as possible."
