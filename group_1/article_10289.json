Your work is automatically protected by copyright when it is \"fixed in a tangible form,\" like a writing or drawing on a piece of paper. [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source This means the U.S. copyright laws apply to your work as soon as you produce it, write it, record it, or draw it. Remember, it isn't enough just to be the first to voice your idea or invention. If you tell someone your idea, but that person describes it in their own words in a tangible form (e.g., writes it down) first, then that person owns the copyright of that description, not you. This \"first to record\" rule would not apply if you authorized the person to record your words for you, as you remain the \"author\" of the words that they record. Under US law, you do not own the copyright of a recording you make of a live public performance of music unless you obtained the permission of the performers.

      "content": "Understand ownership of \"works made for hire\". Works may be made for an employer or for a client under an independent contract. The law determines who is the original owner of the copyright, which also determines the copyright duration. If a work is created by an employee as part of their work, then the employer is considered \"the author\" and owns the copyright. If you hire an independent contractor, they own the copyright of their creations unless expressly agreed otherwise in a signed writing. This is important if you hire an independent contractor and you want to own and enforce the copyright in the resulting works. [12] X Research source 17 USC § 201. Complex issues arise when collaborating with others in a jointly authored work. Not all types of works qualify as \"works for hire\" under an independent contract, meaning the resulting ownership may be different from what was intended, absent a clear transfer of ownership.

      "content": "Know when copyright protection ends. For works created in 1978 or later, a copyright generally lasts for the duration of the last living author's life, plus an additional 70 years. If the work was made for hire, anonymous, or created under a pseudonym, the copyright lasts for the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from the creation. [14] X Trustworthy Source United States Copyright Office Part of the Library of Congress, responsible for maintaining copyright records Go to source Works created prior to 1978 may be subject to different duration rules, depending on when they were created, when or if they were published, how they were created, what types of works they are, and whether the copyright was renewed. . [15] X Research source httpss://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html#duration You can find an overview of various copyright terms here. There is no longer any need to renew a copyright. Works published in or after 1964 automatically have their maximum copyright term. For works published after 1922 and prior to 1964, the chance to renew expired 28 years later. [16] X Research source Those works would have a copyright with duration of 95 years, if renewed, regardless of when the authors died. Works of US authors published in the US without proper copyright notice or registration (prior to 1989) and any necessary renewal (published prior to 1964) have no US copyright. Since the copyright to your creation will extend beyond your life, you should consider to whom you would like to leave the rights to your work when you die. [17] X Research source Keep your copyrighted work in mind when writing a will or creating an estate plan. You may also transfer ownership of your US copyrights to others by a written and signed document, but it will have the same duration as before transfer regardless of who owns it. [18] X Research source 17 USC § 204 Transfers may be recorded in the Copyright Office. Sound recordings first published in the USA prior to 1972 have no US federal copyright, but may be protected against unauthorized duplication under various state laws until 2067. Different rules for duration may apply to works first published in a foreign country."
