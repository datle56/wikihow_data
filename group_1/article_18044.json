      "content": "Talk to your doctor. Most likely, a doctor or surgeon is requiring you to follow a clear liquid diet. However, if you are doing this for yourself for other reasons, it's important to talk to your doctor about whether or not a clear liquid diet is safe for you. Ask your doctor the purpose of the clear liquid diet, how long it needs to last and what exactly you're allowed to consume during that time. Also ask if you should limit physical activity, discontinue supplements or stop taking (or change) any medications you're currently taking. Ask your doctor to review any potential side effects your doctor may expect you will experience during your clear liquid diet."

      "content": "Restrict physical activity. When you're following a clear liquid diet you're not able to consume many calories and other nutrients that support physical activity. If you're normally a very active person, you may need to reduce or restrict the amount of physical activity you typically do. For example, if you normally run for 45 minutes, you may need to go for a 30 minute walk instead. Light activities like walking and your daily lifestyle activities should still be OK to continue even on a clear liquid diet. If you are feeling overly tired, nauseous or lightheaded during or after physical activity, stop immediately and discontinue exercise while on your clear liquid diet."
