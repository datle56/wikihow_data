      "title": "Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of extra virgin olive oil into a small, glass jar.",
      "content": "Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of extra virgin olive oil into a small, glass jar. The jar needs to have a wide mouth for easy access, and be large enough to hold about 1½ cups (350 milliliters). Extra virgin olive oil is full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It is great for dry, oily, and aging skin alike. It can help treat acne, eczema, and psoriasis. It can give skin a healthy glow, and make it appear more smooth and youthful. [1] X Research source If this is for your face, consider replacing 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of the olive oil with rose hip oil. It has vitamin C and anti-aging properties, making it ideal for dry, aging skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Stir in 15 to 20 drops of essential oil, if desired. You can use just one type of oil, or you can use a combination of several different types. The essential oil will make your scrub smell nicer. Some types of essential oil also have additional benefit for the skin. [3] X Research source If this is for your face, reduce the amount to 10 to 15 drops to avoid possible irritations. [4] X Research source For acne, try tea tree, bergamot, or geranium oil. For anti-aging, try pomegranate, grapefruit, or lavender. For a brighter or glowing complexion, use moringa oil or peppermint oil. Dry skin will benefit from rose oil, chamomile, or sunflower oil.

      "content": "Add some citrus juice or spices, if desired. Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 milliliters) of freshly-squeezed lemon or lime juice will help brighten up your skin and give the scrub a refreshing fragrance. Another option would be to use 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 grams) of spices, such as cinnamon, apple piece, pumpkin pie, or vanilla. [6] X Research source If this is for your face, leave the juice/spices out."

      "content": "Add 1 cup (225 grams) of white, granulated sugar to make a body scrub . White, granulated sugar will work for most people, and is suitable for dry skin. If you have sensitive skin, however, try something with smaller grains, such as castor sugar or brown sugar. [7] X Research source To make an extra-exfoliating scrub, add ¼ cup (55 grams) of sugar. [8] X Research source While this recipe is for sugar and oil, you can use salt too. Fine sea salt makes for a great, friction-free scrub. Just replace the sugar with the same amount of salt."

      "content": "Add 1 cup (200 grams) of brown sugar instead to make a face scrub. White sugar is much too harsh for the sensitive, delicate skin on your face. If you are planning to make a face scrub, you should use brown sugar instead. It will be much gentler on your face thanks to its smaller granules. It is also a natural humectant, so it helps draw moisture into your skin. [9] X Research source"
