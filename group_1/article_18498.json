      "title": "A gaslighter will try to make you question your reality.",
      "content": "A gaslighter will try to make you question your reality. Gaslighting is a cruel (and fun!) game of manipulation, and in order to have control, they'll try to make you question what you know to be true. They need you to believe solely in what they say for things to go their way. [1] X Research source How to respond: Stick to what you know is true, and try not to believe what they say. When they push back, reply firmly with phrases like, “I was there” and “I know what happened.” [2] X Research source Try talking to a friend or trusted loved one to gain an outsider’s perspective."

      "title": "Gaslighters can make you think your feelings are invalid.",
      "content": "Gaslighters can make you think your feelings are invalid. It’s their way of the highway, so they’ll do whatever they can to manipulate you. They want to discredit your emotions, so they’ll try to make you believe that your feelings are unreasonable. How to respond: Establish boundaries about how you should both approach a disagreement. For instance, use “I statements” to express what you need to communicate efficiently, and ask them what they need in return: \"I need to be able to express my feelings, so I'd love for you to respect that. What do you need from me?\""

    {
      "title": "You may second-guess your sanity with a gaslighter.",
      "content": "You may second-guess your sanity with a gaslighter. They want you to feel confused and unsure of yourself because it gives them more power in the relationship. Words like “crazy,” “insane,” and “delusional” are often used to make you question your reality. How to respond: Stay firm and rational by saying, “I know what I saw, and I know I’m not crazy. Going forward, I'd love it if we could both avoid name calling.” [3] X Research source This not only validates your reactions, but also helps them realize that they can’t control you."

      "title": "A gaslighter could try to use your emotions against you.",
      "content": "A gaslighter could try to use your emotions against you. There’s nothing wrong with being emotional or empathetic, but a gaslighter may try to turn your sensitivity into a weakness. If you cry in an argument or say, “I’m upset about this,” they’ll most likely claim you’re “too soft” for your own good. [4] X Research source How to respond: Acknowledge and know that it’s perfectly okay to have emotions. Explain this to them clearly, or remind yourself if you need to: “Yes, I have strong emotions, and that’s part of being human.” [5] X Research source"

      "title": "A gaslighter wants you to think you’re blowing things out of proportion.",
      "content": "A gaslighter wants you to think you’re blowing things out of proportion. If someone is gaslighting you, they’ll say things to make you doubt yourself. [6] X Research source Words like “exaggerating,” “overacting,” and “overthinking” can be used to plant a seed of doubt. How to respond: Gain control of your emotions and the situation by stepping back and saying, “I need some space to sort through my thoughts and make sure I’m not exaggerating. Can we revisit this when we’ve both cooled down?” This gives you a chance to regroup and plan what you want to say next. Keep in mind that gaslighting tactics work far better on people in heightened emotional states rather than calm states."

      "title": "To so many gaslighters, harmful words are considered \"jokes.\"",
      "content": "To so many gaslighters, harmful words are considered \"jokes.\" If a gaslighter says something hurtful towards you, they may say this common phrase when they notice you getting upset. They’ll turn the blame onto you, making you believe you can’t take a “harmless” joke. [7] X Research source How to respond: Explain to them that you don’t appreciate the “jokes” they’re making and that they make you uncomfortable: \"You may see it that way, but I find it insulting. And I know you don't want me to feel that way, so I'd love for you to be more sensitive going forward.\" If they continue to discredit your feelings even after you’ve made them know, it may be time to move on."

      "title": "Changing the subject and shirking responsibility are gaslighters' go-to moves.",
      "content": "Changing the subject and shirking responsibility are gaslighters' go-to moves. Even the smallest accusation can set a gaslighter off. In their minds, they’re never in the wrong, and they’ll get defensive if anyone says they are. Instead of having to feel guilty themselves, they'd much rather you feel bad for questioning them. [8] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source How to respond: Take a deep breath and firmly explain your reasoning using “I statements:\" “No, I think we both need to work on things,” or “Yes, I believe you could’ve done things differently.”"

      "content": "Gaslighters may shift the blame onto you. A gaslighter will never say you’re right (even if you are), especially if it doesn’t benefit their agenda.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source How to respond: Try to keep a level head and redirect the conversation back by saying something along the lines of, “I hope we can work on this together without blaming one another.” [10] X Research source"

      "content": "If something doesn’t fit a gaslighter's narrative, they aren't interested. A gaslighter may suddenly switch gears during an argument to divert your attention. [11] X Research source They’ll probably raise their hands and say this phrase with the hopes that you’ll move on, especially if they're starting to feel found out. How to respond: Keep in mind that you’re under no obligation to listen to them. If you’re not ready to end the conversation or “forget,” let them know that by saying, “Before we end this conversation, I have to get something straight…” [12] X Research source"

[13] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source They may twist your words and claim that you want them to be perfect and argue that you’re not an angel either. How to respond: Come back with a gentle but firm explanation like, “I don’t claim to be perfect. I'm just asking you to listen to me.” This is a great way to show them that they can’t control you."

      "content": "They might minimize the situation, so you feel like you’re overreacting. A gaslighter will make something big or important to you seem insignificant, in an attempt to make you feel small.

[14] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source How to respond: Know that you have a right to talk about things that are bothering you. [15] X Research source Calmly explain to them why you think it is a “big deal” by expressing your emotions and thoughts openly."

      "title": "Gaslighters may fake heroism to get your sympathy.",
      "content": "Gaslighters may fake heroism to get your sympathy. At the end of the day, a gaslighter wants attention. They may sway your focus, sympathy, and love by making you think they only do things to serve you. With this, they can avoid responsibility for their actions, because they can claim it was as an act of love or friendship. [16] X Research source How to respond: Briefly acknowledge what they’ve said but steer things back on topic by starting your sentence with, “That may be, but…” [17] X Research source For instance, you may say, “That may be, but I wanted to make that decision myself.”"

      "content": "Gaslighters know that when you feel insecure, you're easier to control. This is a diversion tactic used to keep you from thinking about their manipulation. They may also be hoping that you'll get upset, so they can claim you're overreating. [18] X Research source How to respond: First, avoid comparing yourself to others —you’re fantastic, and it’s their problem if they want to make you question that! Then, firmly explain why their comment is unfair: \"I'm not perfect, but I'm doing my best here, and it sort of feels like you're trying to make me feel bad about myself.\""

      "content": "A gaslighter aims to make you feel like you’re the problem. [19] X Research source Even the slightest critique or comment can send a gaslighter over the edge. They most likely want you to believe that it’s your way or the highway, even though in reality, you know that it's usually their way or the highway. How to respond: Stay on topic when talking to a gaslighter. Redirect the conversation back to the main topic, and try to avoid acknowledging how they try to dismiss you. [20] X Research source You might say something like, “No, I'm not. But in this case, I know what I saw.”"

      "content": "When a gaslight is desperate, they'll use your insecurities against you. A gaslighter will continue to knock you down, so they look better about themselves and you feel worse about yourself. This is their way of getting inside your head. If no one else values you, at least they do, right? [21] X Research source How to respond: Remind yourself of all your amazing qualities and strengths—you're amazing. [22] X Research source In fact, you're so amazing that you deserve to surround yourself with people who build you up, not break you down. Let the gaslighter know that this behavior is unacceptable: \"I'm not okay with you purposefully trying to make me feel bad. I won't accept this in the future.\""

[23] X Research source How to respond: Stay firm in your beliefs with the phrases, “I know what I saw. I know what I heard. I know what happened.” And know that if your close connect is trying to isolate or manipulate you, that is 100% not okay. [24] X Research source Reach out to a loved one for support."

      "content": "If they can, a gaslighter pin bad behavior onto you. No matter what a gaslighter does, they'll say you're the one in the wrong. They do this to make you second-guess yourself and reevaluate your decisions, all while justifying their own negative behavior.

You haven’t forced them to do anything, and at this point, it may be time to walk away. \"We're both adults, and I haven't forced you to do anything.\""
