      "content": "Have a strategy. Get ahead now, so you won't have to dig yourself out of a hole later. Aim to get a solid foundation in all of your classes during the first week, and don't spend too much time in one class, keeping your grades around the B+ or A- range. Then begin working hard on the classes with the lowest grades, bringing all of them to a comfortable position at around 95%. [1] X Research source Take part in all extra credit activities whenever possible and increase your scores to the A+ range so during the last few weeks you can focus mainly on projects and maybe even skip a few homework assignments, if your scores are really high."

      "content": "Understand your school's grading policies. Find out how your school calculates GPAs, if there are weighted grades for honors classes, which grades actually show up on your transcript, the cutoff percentages for each letter grade, and anything else that might affect your final grades. Grades are a game that all students play, and the more you familiarize yourself with the rules, the better you'll do."

      "content": "Make the first week of school count. First impressions are everything with teachers, so make sure they have a positive reason for knowing who you are. [2] X Research source If your teacher starts off the year thinking that you are polite, respectful, and hard-working, they will be nicer to you and will grade your works more easily. It is much easier to have a good first impression than to fix a bad one."

      "content": "Ask questions and volunteer to answer your teacher's questions. You may have to learn the art of faking intelligence and preparedness. It's always easier to appear smart and prepared than to actually be smart and prepared. Try to recall something that you think has some relevance to the topic at hand. Usually the teacher will say something about how good your point was and then give you clues to the answer she was looking for. This method has two benefits. First, the teacher thinks you are paying attention in class, and second, they will think you are capable of independent thought and will be more likely to grade your papers easier. Teachers love students who participate, and will sometimes boost their grades by whole letters.

      "content": "Don't be afraid to collaborate or ask for help. Ask teachers, parents, and classmates to explain things that you have missed. It is easier to ask then to take more time to discover the answer for yourself. Come in before school for help. If your teacher offers to give help outside of school, accept. Even if you are struggling with the material in the class, if you show your teacher you are dedicated, s/he will be more likely to give you a good grade."

      "title": "Recognize busy work.",
      "content": "Recognize busy work. [4] X Research source In order to truly understand, you have to think in terms of the teacher. Teachers are people too. They are just as busy outside of school as you are, if not more so. Also remember that for every homework page you do, the teacher has to grade it, and since she might have over 100 students, that's a lot of papers. There's no way to grade all of them in depth. If you follow the above two steps, your teacher will probably think pretty highly of you and won't be checking your work too closely. You can be pretty sure an assignment is busy work if: The assignment is a worksheet. You see the teacher grading the exact same papers and spending less than a minute on each before entering a grade."

Don't lose points because you could not keep up with assignments. Tackle busy work efficiently. Busy work should take as much time to do as your teacher will spend grading it! If there is an article with questions, oftentimes the answers can be found in order in the article. Read each question then skim the article for the answer. In opinion questions, you don't need to put thought into your answer. Just make something up that sounds good. Many students already have a knack for how to handle busywork, but for others it takes practice. It's a huge time saver once you get the hang of it."

      "content": "Revamp your handwriting. [7] X Research source This step is optional, although it will dramatically reduce your workload. Try for a style that is legible, but quick. Your teacher isn't grading you on your penmanship and neat handwriting takes valuable time, especially when doing busy work. Handwriting that is ideal for this is quick yet legible - put down words on the page fast, but at the same time aim to make each word readable without too much effort. You may also have to consider using a different type of pen for this - 0.7mm pens best suit this purpose. The Sarasa Clip 0.7 and Pilot Juice 0.7 come to mind, however the Pilot V5 Hi-Tecpoint (0.5), or the Faber-Castell CX Plus 0.5 also work well, since they all have little friction on the nib, allowing you to dramatically increase the speed at which you write (the Sarasa Clip 0.7 is especially good for this, though the lack of friction may also take some getting used to."

That doesn't mean you need to spend hours every night; try utilizing the time at the end of classes. Tackle one assignment at a time. Your first section should be worksheets as they take the least amount of time. Then you should do any homework that is broken down into independent parts, such as math. That way you can work for a few minutes at the end of various classes without wasting time finding your place. Eliminate distractions. When you really don't feel like doing homework, but need to, get rid of things that normally divide your attention. Turn off the TV. Put your phone in another room. Log off your social media.

Do the work that you know will be read in depth first, and do a good job so you can build trust with that teacher. Then do all of the work that might not be checked so closely and don't worry so much about the quality; just make sure your writing is on topic and looks lengthy and detailed. If you begin to run out of time with just a few unimportant assignments to do, work quickly through them all making sure to complete them all.

Do any pre-writing work you have to turn in after you write the paper to save time. If you make your paper long enough, chances are that the teacher will only read halfway through, so you have two options. You could either make it really short and good, or really long with several mistakes. After the first few times you try, you'll realize how easy and quick it is to write perfect papers with half of the rewriting you used to do.
