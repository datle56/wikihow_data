      "title": "Choose separates over dresses or jumpsuits.",
      "content": "Choose separates over dresses or jumpsuits. Because of your natural curves, you may have trouble finding dresses that fit both your torso and your hips. Choosing separates allows you to get a better fit overall. [1] X Research source For instance, pick a nice shirt and a skirt over a dress. A dress may fit your bust or your hips, but you may have trouble finding a dress that fits right in both places. However, with a shirt and skirt, you can get each piece to fit perfectly."

      "title": "Add shape to a dress with a belt.",
      "content": "Add shape to a dress with a belt. If you choose an easy-going fabric such as jersey, a belt adds shape to the dress. Use it to cinch the waist in the proper place for your body, and you'll have a flattering, form-fitting dress. [2] X Research source Choose a skinny belt, as it adds shape without cutting your body in half visually. Another option is a wrap-around dress. The wrapping effect and the built-in belt make it easy to tailor it to your body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have garments tailored to your size.",
      "content": "Have garments tailored to your size. Most people have trouble fitting into ready-made clothes, and having clothes sewn from scratch for your shape can get expensive! However, taking ready-made clothes to a tailor can make all the difference in how they fit you, and it's more cost effective than having them made from scratch. [3] X Research source The curvier you are, the more trouble you're going to have getting a perfect fit with ready-made clothes. Every person's body is different, so getting those curves right can be difficult for manufacturers."

    {
      "title": "Pick clothes that follow your natural curves.",
      "content": "Pick clothes that follow your natural curves. Don't try to hide your curves with items like trapeze dresses or shifts. Instead, go for form-fitting clothes that highlight your natural curves rather than hiding them. Focus on the areas you want to flaunt! [4] X Research source Choose an outfit with a fitted waist, for instance. Pick something you feel good in!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Skip embellishments that overemphasize your curves.",
      "content": "Skip embellishments that overemphasize your curves. While you don't want to hide your curves, adding too many embellishments can make you look off-balance. Instead, go for simple cuts without too many ruffles or puffs. [5] X Research source For instance, large ruffles at your shoulders can make you look top-heavy, while a gathered skirt can make you look bottom-heavy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a v-neck or scoop neck to draw the eye upward.",
      "content": "Pick a v-neck or scoop neck to draw the eye upward. A v-neck helps draw the focus to your face. If you've created an elongating effect elsewhere, this helps pull the look together, as anyone who sees you will be focusing on your smiling face. [6] X Research source For instance, try a v-neck sweater paired with an a-line skirt and knee-high boots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for smaller bags to keep your look proportional.",
      "content": "Opt for smaller bags to keep your look proportional. Pick small hand bags or petite shoulder bags. These bags are more proportional to the size of your body, so they enhance your look rather than detracting from it. Large shoulder bags add width to your body, drawing attention to your petite size. Plus, they add visual bulkiness to your hips and shoulders."

    {
      "title": "Try single-color looks.",
      "content": "Try single-color looks. Choosing a look in 1 color can help create a streamlined effect. If you're a bit afraid of going all 1 color, start with black, grey, or navy, which are naturally flattering. [7] X Research source Make your outfit a bit more interesting by choosing different textures for the items in your outfit. For instance, try a black wool sweater with a leather skirt."

    {
      "title": "Try high-waisted pants to make your legs look longer.",
      "content": "Try high-waisted pants to make your legs look longer. High-wasted jeans and other pants give the illusion your legs are longer than they actually are. It helps elongate your whole body, adding balance to your curves. [8] X Research source For instance, try a pair of high-wasted skinny jeans that hug your curves. When wearing high-waisted pants, highlight the fact by tucking in your shirt or opting for a top that's a bit shorter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider flared jeans or pants.",
      "content": "Consider flared jeans or pants. Pick pants that sit on your natural waist line and that hug your thighs and knees. The flare at the bottom will help make your legs look a bit longer. Choose a pair that hits the top of your shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick an a-line skirt for a night out with flats.",
      "content": "Pick an a-line skirt for a night out with flats. An a-line skirt highlights your natural curves with its shape. Plus, the short hemline helps elongate your legs, so you don't have to don a pair of heels to give yourself some height. [9] X Research source Be sure to go for an a-line skirt that's a bit fuller than average to help highlight your curves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a pair of knee-high boots to your a-line skirt.",
      "content": "Add a pair of knee-high boots to your a-line skirt. Pick a pair of boots that matches at least 1 of your a-line skirts, then wear them together. Using matching colors on your legs will make them look longer. [10] X Research source For instance, try a brown skirt with brown knee-high boots. Add a pair of matching tights."

    {
      "title": "Try a mini skirt to add length to your legs.",
      "content": "Try a mini skirt to add length to your legs. A mini skirt obviously shows more leg than other skirts. The shortened length of the skirt makes your legs appear longer, creating an elongating effect. Aim for a skirt that's about mid-thigh. Pick outfits you're comfortable in! If you feel a little uncomfortable in just a mini skirt, go for a bit longer length or add a pair of leggings underneath."

    {
      "title": "Pair flowing, long skirts with fitted tops.",
      "content": "Pair flowing, long skirts with fitted tops. A maxi skirt can be a great option to make your whole body seem longer. However, with so much fabric below, choose a fitted look for your top half so that your look will feel more balanced. For instance, try a tucked-in shirt with your maxi skirt."

    {
      "title": "Choose shoes with a low-vamp to make your legs look longer.",
      "content": "Choose shoes with a low-vamp to make your legs look longer. When picking fancy shoes, opt for ones that have a low cut. The vamp is the part that cuts across the top of your foot. If you pick a shoe that goes across your toes instead of up higher, it makes your legs seem that much longer. Another option is choosing shoes with pointed toes, as they also make your legs look longer."

    {
      "title": "Use vertical stripes to elongate your whole body.",
      "content": "Use vertical stripes to elongate your whole body. Vertical stripes establish long lines down your body. In turn, that helps you appear taller overall. Opt for stripes in a tailored dress, for instance, and you'll have an elongating, flattering look. Remember to wear what you love! If stripes aren't your thing, choose something else."
