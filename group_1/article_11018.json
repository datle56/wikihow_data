      "content": "Drink coffee and water to cover up the alcohol smell. Coffee has a strong, distinct smell that can easily cover up the boozy odor on your breath. It also helps wake you up in the morning after a night of drinking. [1] X Research source Accompanying the coffee with a glass of water helps replenish the hydration you lost while drinking and promotes salivation, which can lessen alcohol breath too. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not mix coffee (a stimulant) with alcohol (a depressant). This can cause a spike in energy that makes you feel less drunk but leads you to inadvertently drink more than you can handle. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Foods and drinks only mask alcohol breath instead of getting rid of it. The distinct, slightly sweet smell comes from your lungs and stomach, not your mouth. The only way to truly cure alcohol breath is to wait for the alcohol to metabolize out of your system. Your body typically processes 1 ounce (30 ml) of liquor (and its equivalent to beer and wine) in 1 hour. However, the time it takes depends on how much you’ve drunk and other factors like age and gender. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat strong-smelling foods like onion and garlic to mask the alcohol. Highly aromatic foods can help override alcohol breath by coating your mouth with their odor. Red onion and garlic both stay on your breath for a long time, reducing the smell of alcohol. [5] X Research source If you’re out at a bar drinking, order foods that contain onion or garlic like garlic fries or garlic bread. Or, add red onions to a sandwich, burger, or salad after drinking. Simply eating onion or garlic raw can replace alcohol breath with another strong, often undesirable, smell. If you’re heading off to work or another event, use one of the other methods to leave your breath smelling more pleasant."

Mint, spearmint, and cinnamon-flavored gum are typically the best at reducing alcohol odors. As an alternative, try breath mints or suck on mint or herbal-flavored cough drops."

Use strong-smelling soaps, shampoos, and conditioners to help eliminate or lessen the smell of alcohol.

      "title": "Drink alcohol in moderation.",
      "content": "Drink alcohol in moderation. Drinking moderately, which is defined as 1 standard drink for women and 2 for men, prevents a greater buildup of alcohol in your system that can lead to unpleasant alcohol breath. Instead of binging 4 or more drinks in a night, stick to sipping 1 to 2 drinks over the course of the evening. Binge drinking can not only result in a strong smell but other health problems, especially when done frequently. [14] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Cutting back on drinking, and not drinking to get drunk, can also help prevent alcohol breath. A standard, US alcoholic drink is either a 12-ounce beer (around 5% alcohol by volume (ABV)), 5 ounces of wine (about 12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of liquor (about 40% ABV)."

      "title": "Drink a glass of water after every drink.",
      "content": "Drink a glass of water after every drink. Alcohol is a diuretic that causes you to urinate more, which can lead to dehydration. When your mouth is dry, bacteria are more likely to develop and intensify the smell of alcohol on your breath. [15] X Research source Drinking a glass of water after every alcoholic drink keeps you hydrated, which helps you avoid alcohol breath, excessive drinking, and a hangover the next day. [16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Choose alcoholic drinks that contain water, like mixed drinks with club soda, to hydrate as you drink.

[17] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This can cause you to drink more and get dehydrated, which can lead to worse alcohol breath. Eating food helps absorbs some of the alcohol you drink while also stimulating the production of saliva to help prevent dehydration. [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Bars often provide snacks like peanuts, popcorn, and other munchies to make sure patrons don't get sick from over-drinking. Snack on these complimentary foods while you're out. If you're drinking at a friend's place, bring a snack for the group like bags of potato chips or microwave popcorn. This can help you reduce alcohol breath and make you look generous in the eyes of the host."

      "title": "Do not mix different alcoholic drinks.",
      "content": "Do not mix different alcoholic drinks. All alcohol, even the seemingly odorless vodka, gives off a distinct, sweet smell as your body processes it. Each alcohol has a slightly different smell that can combine into an overall worse odor if you mix them together. So, stick to 1 type of alcohol you like for the night to help lessen your alcohol breath. [19] X Research source For example, if your first drink was a beer, keep drinking beer for the night. Or, if you ordered a vodka soda, stick to that or other vodka mixed drinks."

      "content": "Stick to drinking simple, non-mixed drinks. Mixed drinks that contain sugary liquids, herbs, and spices tend to have a stronger odor than beer, wine, and liquor.
