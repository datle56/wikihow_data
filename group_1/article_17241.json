The basic formula is: P = 2 * (l + w) . [4] X Research source Perimeter is always the total distance around the outside edge of any shape, whether it is simple or compound. In this equation, P stands for “perimeter,” l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle. Length always has a greater value than width. Because opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, both lengths will be the same and both widths will be the same. This is why you write the equation as a multiplication of the sum of the length and width by 2. You can also write the equation as P = l + l + w + w to make this very clear."

[5] X Research source If you are calculating the perimeter of a rectangle in real life, use a ruler, yardstick, or tape measure to find the length and width of the area that you are trying to measure. If you’re measuring outdoors, measure all sides to see if the opposites are truly congruent. For example, l = 14 centimeter (5.5 in), w = 8 centimeter (3.1 in)."

Once you’ve completed this multiplication, you have the perimeter of your rectangle. [8] X Research source This multiplication takes into account the other two sides of your rectangle. When you added together the width and length, you only added together two sides of the shape. Since the other two sides of the rectangle are equal to the two already added together, you can simply multiply this measurement by two in order to find the total sum of all four sides.

Even though you already know the area of the rectangle in this problem, you will still need to use the area formula to find missing information. The area of a rectangle is a measurement of the two-dimensional space within the rectangle, or the number of square units within the rectangle. The formula used to find the area of a rectangle is A = l * w . The formula used to find the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2 * (l + w) In the above formulas, A stands for “area,” P stands for “perimeter,” l refers to the length of the rectangle, and w refers to the width of the rectangle."

A standard rectangle has four sides. The two sides composing the length are equal to each other, and the two sides composing the width are equal to each other. Therefore, the perimeter is the sum of those four sides. A compound rectangle has at least six sides. Think of a capital “L” or “T” shape. The top “branch” can be separated into one rectangle and the bottom “bar” can be separated into another. The perimeter of this shape, however, does not rely on breaking up the compound rectangle into two separate rectangles. Instead, the perimeter is simply: P = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 . Each “s” represents a different side of your compound rectangle."
