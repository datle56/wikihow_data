If you decide to get circumcised, a physician will perform a short, relatively simple surgical procedure that will remove part of the foreskin of your penis permanently. After a period of recovery, your penis will heal normally, but without the retractable foreskin. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Generally, circumcision is performed on infant babies, but it's also performed on consenting adults, for medical, hygienic, religious, or cosmetic purposes. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Circumcision is also recommended for urinary issues like retention or recurring yeast infections in the penis, as it can help prevent further infections. Circumcision does not help prevent any sexually transmitted infections. You should only get circumcised by a licensed physician or a mohel with a good record and experience. Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to circumcise yourself, as one small mistake can be dangerous."

It is generally advisable to have a circumcision as a child, since recovery is much quicker, though adults can also get circumcised. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source The procedure consists of the following steps: Your genitals will be cleaned and prepped for surgery, and you will be anesthetized using a dorsal nerve blocker. [4] X Research source A cut will be made in the foreskin on the upper side of the penis using scissors, while a second slit will be made on the underside of the penis, cutting away the foreskin around the rim of the ridge under the glans. The edges of the foreskin will be pulled back and the blood vessels will be tied off using stitches or diathermy, which involves using electrical currents to essentially cauterize the ends of the vessels. Finally, the penis will be bandaged tightly to aid in the recovery period. If you're an adult, the edges of the foreskin may be stitched together.

      "content": "Understand the potential benefits. Most adults tend to get circumcised to prevent pain due to tight foreskin, to treat infections, and to combat yeast. Some adults also get circumcised for hygienic reasons or because of religious beliefs. Others get circumcised because they believe that a circumcised penis is more sexually attractive than an uncircumcised one, although an intact penis with a fully retracted foreskin looks similar to a circumcised one. Plenty of people still believe circumcision prevents HIV and STIs in general. However, research and studies have proved otherwise. Circumcision of HIV-infected men does not reduce HIV transmission to female partners [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source . In this national cohort study spanning more than three decades of observation, non-therapeutic circumcision in infancy or childhood did not appear to provide protection against HIV or other STIs in males up to the age of 36 years. Rather, non-therapeutic circumcision was associated with higher STI rates overall, particularly for anogenital warts and syphilis. [7] X Research source [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Make sure you practice safe sex and always use a condom. Another reason people choose circumcision for themselves and their sons is that they believe it is good for hygiene. However, in fact, children's foreskin is attached, or 'fused' to the glans usually until around puberty, leaving nothing underneath to clean. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source [11] X Research source And cleaning an intact penis with retractable foreskin is much quicker and easier than brushing your teeth or washing your face."

      "content": "Understand the risks. Essentially, a circumcision involves the willful cutting of your genitals, removing the most sensitive front tip of the foreskin of the penis. As with any elective surgery, there are possible complications. Typically done on infants, circumcision for adults carries with it a significant and uncomfortable period of recovery. [12] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Circumcision ablates some of the most sensitive parts of the penis. Foreskin it is a region of great sensitivity and possessed of an abundant nerve supply. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Circumcision increases the risks of erectile dysfunction. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Logistic regression analysis revealed that circumcised men could be reliably classified as having penile scarring, need for use of lubrication when undertaking sexual activity, reluctance to use condoms, progressive decline in sexual sensitivity, as weil as unhappiness with and reluctance to think about their circumcision status. Female and gay male sexual partners reported that their circumcised partners were more likely to experience reduced sexual sensation as compared with their intact partners, as weil as dissatisfaction with their orgasms and a wide range of negative emotions associated with being circumcised. [17] X Research source While no significant differences were found in the rates of prostate disorders between the two groups of men, circumcised males did rate their current level of sexual sensation as significantly less than that indicated by intact males. [18] X Research source Preputioplasty is a surgical procedure that widens a tight foreskin to treat severe cases of phimosis. During preputioplasty, an incision is made on either side of the foreskin to widen it. Circumcision removes the foreskin. Meanwhile preputioplasty widens the foreskin. Preputioplasty has the advantage of healing very quickly with little or no significant cosmetic alteration to the appearance of the penis. Unlike circumcision, preputioplasty preserves the foreskin, its blood vessels, nerve-endings and functions, along with the frenulum. Preputioplasty has a lower risk of complications compared to circumcision. [19] X Research source As an adult, circumcision is a personal, medical choice. Whatever you choose, make sure you weigh the benefits and risks and decide what is right for you. Make sure you consider the non-surgical treatments for the medical diagnosis you have first before considering surgical options. Also, ask your doctor advice on preputioplasty if you have severe phimosis that needs surgery. If you have mild phimosis, try phimosis stretching"

      "content": "Check out the hospitals or clinics in your area. If you prefer a private consultation, seek advice from your local physician. Contact a hospital and ask to speak with a urologist to get a second opinion on the potential benefits and risks, and to get a description of the procedure and the recovery. For a teenager or an adult, circumcision is typically performed under anesthesia and takes about two weeks for recovery. Some hospitals will not perform circumcisions on adults unless there is a medical reason. If you're committed to getting circumcised, be prepared to shop around for a place to get the procedure done."

Cover the genital area with waterproof covering during the first few days, when taking a shower or bathing, and keep the area very clean when using the restroom. The wound needs to be kept dry to facilitate quick healing. Your doctor will offer more specific instructions and topical medication, but in general you'll want to keep the area as clean and dry as possible. You may be catheterized for a few days after the procedure in order to aid in keeping the penis dry. Your doctor will remove your catheter once the healing has begun."

      "content": "Consider the implications of circumcision. It's common practice in American hospitals for babies to be circumcised within the first few days of birth. Consider whether or not you'd like to respect the child's bodily autonomy and importance of consent, or have it done in the hospital. [21] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Consider allowing your child to make this decision for themselves when they become an adult. Consider the importance of consent and rightfully teach your son the importance of it by making a good example. As a painful skin-breaking procedure, neonatal circumcision alters infant physiological and behavioral stress responses. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you remove their foreskin and they decide they want it, foreskin restoration requires a lot of time and effort and does not replace all of the penile structures removed in circumcision. Conversely, if they decide to get circumcised as an adult, they will be able to make an informed decision based on the risks and benefits. Talk to your obstetrician and pediatrician. In general, the procedure will be done quickly and will recover relatively simple cleaning for the baby to recover."
