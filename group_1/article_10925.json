      "content": "Get out your crochet hook and yarn. You'll need to use a US F (3.75 mm) crochet hook to make these women's gloves. Choose a worsted weight yarn in your favorite color and material. The skein should be 100 g or 280 yards (256 m) and you'll only be using half of it to make the gloves. Save the rest of the skein for another pair of gloves or for a different project. You can use a single color, use multi-colored yarn, or select several colors for your gloves."
