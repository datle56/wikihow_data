      "content": "Brew a strong pot of coffee. A regular cup of coffee uses 2 tablespoons (7-9 g, or 2 scoops of a coffee measurer) of grounds per cup, which uses about 6 oz (178 ml) of water. [1] X Research source To make the coffee stronger, add another 1-2 tablespoons of grounds. For a pot equivalent to 8 cups of coffee, use 48 oz (1.5 L) of water and 18-20 tablespoons (80g) of grounds. Note that the stronger the coffee, the darker the brew. Soaking your hair with coffee will darken your color, which can be great for brunettes or people with gray hair, as it can add depth and darken your hair color. [2] X Research source If you are blonde or have light red hair, or have dyed your hair a light color, you may may want to try a different method of treating your hair. Otherwise, you may end up with dingy or dirty looking hair. [3] X Research source If you don't have coffee, you can use a ground espresso instead. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Standing in the bathtub, pour cold coffee through your hair, starting at the roots. For a thorough treatment, use a bucket or large bowl to catch the coffee drippings as you pour it through your hair. Then pour the drippings back through your hair a second time. [6] X Research source If you want more control over the application, transfer the cooled coffee into a spray bottle and spray it into your hair. [7] X Research source If you are worried about the coffee staining your bathtub or shower floor, pour the coffee through your hair while leaning over a bucket, so it catches the drippings. Rinse any coffee out of your bathtub immediately to prevent staining."

      "content": "Rinse your hair, making sure you wash out all the coffee grounds. The coffee grounds should have removed any buildup from your hair, leaving it soft, shiny, and healthy. Dispose of the coffee grounds you caught in the drain by throwing the filter into the garbage or compost . With regular use, you may notice your hair is growing faster, too. The caffeine in coffee blocks a hormone that causes hair loss and allows your hair to remain in its growth cycle longer than normal. Try using coffee grounds once or twice a week. Dry your hair with an old towel, and remember if your wet hair drips on your clothes the coffee may ruin them. Wear a towel around your shoulders or an old T-shirt until your hair is dry."
