      "content": "Check the care label of the clothing to ensure that it’s safe to wash. The care label is usually found on the inside seam of the clothing. Read it carefully to make sure that it is machine washable and is safe to soak. [1] X Research source Some fabrics such as silk usually require dry cleaning. Always follow the instructions on the care label to make sure that you don’t damage the fabric."

      "title": "Allow the glue to dry completely.",
      "content": "Allow the glue to dry completely. Water-based glue is white when it’s wet. Wait until the glue on the clothing turns clear, as this indicates that it is fully dry. [2] X Research source Be very careful if you are working with hot glue. It’s especially important to let this dry first so that you don’t burn yourself. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape off as much dried glue as possible. Use a stiff-bristled brush or something blunt like the back of a spoon to remove the glue. This will remove the top layer of the glue. [4] X Research source It is important that you wait until the glue is completely dry to begin scraping it off, as otherwise this will cause it to spread. You can also use a flat-bladed knife to scrape the glue off. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the clothing in cold water overnight. Fill up a bucket or the laundry sink with cold water. Fully submerge the clothing into the water, and leave it there until the next day. [6] X Research source Soaking the clothing in cold water will help to soften the substance, making it easier to remove afterward. Always use cold water to soak the clothing in. Warm water may set the glue further, which will make it more difficult to remove."

      "content": "Apply a drop of liquid laundry detergent to the remaining glue or stain. Remove the clothing from the bucket or sink, and place the liquid laundry detergent straight onto the same spot as the glue. Gently massage the liquid laundry detergent into the stain. Check the label of the laundry detergent to ensure that it is right for the type of fabric that you are Lightly massaging the liquid laundry detergent into the stain will help it to reach into the fabric and to work on the stain."

      "content": "Wash the clothing in the washing machine on a warm setting. Place the clothing into the washing machine. Set the temperature to around 30 °C (86 °F), and start the cycle. [7] X Research source Choose the washing cycle that you normally use to wash the clothing. Don't use a hot temperature as this can make the glue stain worse."

Usually you can either hang up the clothing to air-dry, or use a dryer. Check the care label if you are unsure of the best way to dry the clothing."

      "title": "Wait for the glue to dry and check if it can be easily scraped off.",
      "content": "Wait for the glue to dry and check if it can be easily scraped off. Let the super glue fully dry before trying to remove it, so that it doesn’t spread. Then use a blunt object such as a spoon or a stiff-bristled brush to gently scrape away at the glue. [9] X Research source Don’t scrape vigorously or harshly at the super glue, as it won’t come away as easily as water-based glue. Just scrape it a few times gently, and don’t worry if it doesn’t fully come away. You will be able to tell that the super glue is dry when it looks and feels solid."

      "content": "Spot test acetone nail polish remover on an inside seam. Turn the clothing inside out, and apply the nail polish remover to a ball of cotton wool. Dab a small patch on the inside seam lightly, and check if it discolors or damages the fabric. [10] X Research source Make sure that the nail polish remover contains acetone, otherwise it won’t work to remove the glue. If the fabric is stained or damaged by the nail polish remover, get the clothing dry cleaned instead."

Continue wiping at the stain until the acetone stops removing the glue. [11] X Research source This process will take a little while as the acetone only remover 1 layer of super glue at a time. This is also an effective way to remove super glue from your skin."
