      "content": "Prevent acne before it starts. Here are some small daily-life hacks you can use to prevent pimples before they happen: Change out your pillowcase every four or five days. A fresh, bacteria-free pillowcase can stop your skin from erupting overnight. Keep your hands off your face. If you tend to rest your chin in your palm, or you're constantly fussing with your face, stop. The oils on your hands can cause breakouts, even in small amounts. [8] X Research source Tie your hair back while you sleep. If you have long hair, keep it off your face while you rest. Braid it back, and use pins or a headband to keep bangs off your forehead. [9] X Research source Get your beauty rest. Stress can lead to breakouts, so make sure you're well-rested and calm. [10] X Research source Change your birth control (females). Some oral contraceptives containing estrogen can calm down regular breakouts. Ask your doctor if this is the right choice for you. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a clay mask.",
      "content": "Try a clay mask. Clay absorbs excess oil, removes impurities, and even kills bacteria in blemishes for clearer, more even skin. Once a week, after showering, dab your skin dry and apply a clay mask. Leave it in for 10 minutes or until it begins to dry. Rinse off and apply a moisturizer. Do not allow the clay to harden completely or leave it on overnight. It can over-dry the skin."

      "content": "Wash your face at night. Over the course of the day, makeup, dirt, and oil build up on your face. Make cleansing your skin part of your bedtime routine. [14] X Research source Use makeup remover. Not only does this prevent it from clogging up your pores and causing breakouts while you sleep, it also stops you from smearing bacteria on your pillow — where it can get into your skin night after night. Use a gentle soap. Remember that you want to clean your skin, not completely strip it of all oils — if it feels tight and dry after washing, you're using something too strong. Avoid the eye area; the skin around the eye can be too delicate for most cleansers. Rinse off by splashing water on your face. Using a washcloth or rag to roughly wipe your skin clean can irritate it more. Instead, bend your face over the sink, cup your hands together, and bring up small amounts of water to splash over your face. About 10 splashes should do it. Pat dry. Don't roughly rub your skin dry with a towel. Instead, dry it with small, gentle pats or let it air dry."

      "title": "Apply toner.",
      "content": "Apply toner. A toner removes excess oil and dirt from your skin that the soap missed, in addition to closing your pores. Not everyone needs to use a toner, but some people find it helpful. [15] X Research source Put a few drops onto a cotton ball or pad. Swipe it lightly over your skin. Only use astringent if your skin is exceptionally oily. Astringent is a stronger type of toner that can be up to 60% alcohol. If your skin tends to be dry, using astringent could actually cause acne by driving your oil glands to overcompensate. Witch hazel is a natural alternative to buying synthetic toner/astringent. Consider applying toner to only the areas of your skin that tend to break out. For instance, you might only use it on your nose or forehead."
