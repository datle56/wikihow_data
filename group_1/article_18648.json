      "content": "Heat up your curling iron. Plug your curling iron in and set it on a temperature that works with your hair's texture. Coarser hair will need a higher setting, while fine hair will need a lower setting. For big curls, use a curling iron at least 1” wide; the wider the barrel of the iron, the larger your curls will be. Give the iron at least 2-3 minutes to heat fully before attempting to curl your hair."

Add in a heat-protectant spray or mousse to keep your hair glossy and prevent it from getting fried. If desired, you can also add in a curl-enhancing product to help create big, voluminous curls with your iron."

Tie the upper ⅔ of your hair into a ponytail on the top of your head, and leave the bottom-most layer down. Brush out your hair to remove any knots and tangles to prepare it for curling.

Then, twist their iron up toward your scalp to curl the length of your hair up to the roots. Hold the hair in place around the barrel of the iron for 5-10 seconds, and then release the curl. Repeat this process throughout the entire bottom layer of your hair. [2] X Research source To get big, bouncy curls, you need the curl to extend all the way to the roots. Otherwise, the style could collapse."

Pull this section straight up to make sure you get the most volume possible. Then, wrap this section around the hair, leaving 1”-2” inches of the ends left out while you roll it up. When the hot roller gets to your scalp, tuck the end piece underneath to help hold it in place. Clamp or pin the roller cover over the top of the roll, and you’re ready to move onto the next section.
