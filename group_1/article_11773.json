The key is to remember that no matter what the customer is actually saying, the real cause of his problem has nothing to do with you as a person.

It's entirely possible that the customer had unreasonable expectations to begin with, or perhaps there was a simple error made that has momentarily upset him. Focus on resolving the issue, rather than focusing on feeling hurt or insulted. [5] X Research source Repeat a calming mantra to yourself internally. Something that will help center you and keep you calm would be key. Try thinking to yourself, \"This is not my fault. He isn't mad at me, and it's not about me.\" It can help remind you that you haven't necessarily done anything wrong, and that the customer's temper will eventually pass."

      "title": "Listen and learn what the real issue is.",
      "content": "Listen and learn what the real issue is. If a customer is being rude to you, it's possible that you or a coworker made a mistake. Or perhaps the customer did not get something he was supposed to get. Whether or not the customer's behavior is appropriate to the situation, the key is to listen and try to understand what that actual situation is. It can be difficult to listen to an irate customer screaming obscenities at you, but beneath all that anger there is a problem that, most likely, you or a coworker can resolve. Tune out the customer's bad attitude, and zero in on the problem that is causing his bad behavior. Rather than making statements about the issue, stick to asking questions. This shows the customer that you're not being resistant to his complaint, and in answering your questions he may come to realize that there has been some sort of misunderstanding. [6] X Research source Try to ignore whatever insulting or rude things the customer is saying, and focus on what his actual complaint is. If he isn't making his complaint clear, ask him politely but firmly, \"Sir, I'm not following what the issue is. What can I do to help you today?\" Try asking something like, \"What were your expectations?\" and follow that question with a polite \"Why did you have those expectations?\" This should be done carefully, as asking these questions without a calm and polite tone could come across as flippant. But these questions may help get to the root of the problem - for example, perhaps the customer misread an advertisement, or misunderstood what was being offered. You may need to state the reason for your stance on the issue. This is fine, but make sure you stick to the issue and your reasoning without attacking the customer or his logic. Calling his logic or his character into question will only escalate the situation and make him more difficult to deal with. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Speak low and slow. If a customer is getting increasingly irate, try lowering your voice and talking slower. This can have a somewhat soothing effect, and it also communicates to the customer that you are being firm and professional. It's important to consciously monitor your own tone and volume, because if you let yourself grow irate back at the customer it will only make things worse. If your correspondence with the customer is by email, take a few moments to center yourself before responding to the email. Take a few deep breaths, focus on something that makes you happy, and compose the email only after you've composed yourself."

      "content": "Empathize with the customer. It may be difficult to empathize with someone who is being rude or even aggressive, but this is the best tactic. This shows the customer that you're not trying to ruin his experience, and lets him know that you're willing to work with him to resolve the issue. This can help defuse the undoubtedly tense situation between you and the customer. Let the customer know that you understand how he feels, and why he is upset. Try saying something like, \"I understand why you're upset, sir. That sounds like a very frustrating situation.\""

At the very least you should verbally summarize the situation to the customer, speaking from his point of view, to show the customer that you are on his side. [8] X Research source Say something like, \"Okay, sir, just to make sure I understand...\" and then reiterate what the customer has told you. This subtly communicates to the customer that you trust his version of events, and that you take whatever happened very seriously. [9] X Research source"

It doesn't matter if you feel the customer deserves an apology. The reality of the situation is that you will not be able to defuse the situation without apologizing and making some effort at remedying the situation.

If the customer is wrong and he is being unreasonable, you should still apologize for any inconvenience, but you may need to hold your own ground to prevent the customer from walking all over you. Use firm but polite phrases, such as \"Please let me finish,\" \"That was not my question,\" or \"That's not what I said. If you're communicating by email and the customer ignores something you've already said, try saying it again, or say something firm but polite like \"Sir, I've already addressed that issue for you.

If there's nothing that you or your coworkers can do, let the customer know. Be polite but firm - say something like, \"I understand your frustration, and I'm terribly sorry, but there is nothing we can do about the problem.\" He may get more upset, but he'll most likely recognize he's defeated and leave after he feels he's said his piece."

Or if the customer is making demands that go against an agreement he signed, you can show him the agreement. No matter what the situation is, having some sort of documentation or supporting evidence can help you quickly shut down an irate customer's demands, if he's being unreasonable.

If you are not authorized to give refunds or exchanges, or if you're certain that doing so would go against your company's policy in this instance, talk to your supervisor. You should also let a supervisor know if a customer becomes irate or unreasonable, as the manager may need to intercede before things escalate. [13] X Research source Let your supervisor know what the customer's complaints are, what the issue seems to be caused by, and mention that the customer was being difficult. Your supervisor may give you instructions on how to proceed, or she may offer to step in and talk to the customer herself. At the very least, your supervisor should be able to help you strategize a reasonable solution to the problem, ideally one that would satisfy all parties involved."

Step outside for some fresh air, grab a cup of coffee or tea, or simply go into the washroom and splash some cool water on your face. Whatever strategy you choose, it's important that you give yourself some time to cool down and unwind after a tense, potentially upsetting situation."

After a tense situation, such as dealing with a rude customer, you may feel the temptation to vent about that customer to other coworkers, or even to friends or family when you get home. But experts warn that venting about an upsetting situation can actually become quite damaging over time, if you do it often. Even though it offers a short-term period of relaxation and satisfaction, over time that practice of venting or ranting can inadvertently become the preferred way your brain deals with stress and anger. That can become unhealthy for you, and it could become frustrating for your friends, family, and coworkers.
