      "content": "Gather your materials. You will need a couple skeins of yarn and a crochet hook to do double crochet. Contrasting colors work best for interlocking crochet, so make sure that you choose two colors that will pop next to each other, like green and pink or purple and yellow. Also, choose smooth yarn types for this project and avoid anything too fluffy. [1] X Research source You will need: Two different colors of yarn. A size 8 crochet hook (or a hook that is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using). A pair of scissors."

      "title": "Determine how long to make your foundation chain.",
      "content": "Determine how long to make your foundation chain. The number of links in your foundation chain will depend on how many squares you would like your finished interlocking crochet to have. [2] X Research source Multiply the number of squares you want to create by 2 and then add 4. For example, if you want your interlocking crochet to have 6 squares, then you would multiply 6 by 2, which equals 12, and then add 4, which equals 16. If you want larger squares, then multiply the total number of squares by 3 and then add 5. For example, if you wanted your interlocking crochet to have 5 squares, then you would multiple this by 3, which equals 15, and then add 5, which equals 20."

For example, if you came up with 16 for your number, then chain 16 stitches. [3] X Research source You'll do this just like you would make any other foundation chain in crochet.

Each of the filet mesh pieces you create will need a turning chain at the end. To create a turning chain, make a chain of 4 at the end of the piece and finish it by leaving a large loop. This will help to ensure that the chain does not come undone before you are ready to use it. [9] X Research source"

To add the next piece, you would use the turning chain of the shorter piece and insert it in through the window of a long piece to connect it."
