[1] X Research source Think about recent events that may have injured your dog. If your dog went missing for a few days and then came back limping, then there is a good chance that he was injured. If your dog has just been hit by a car or if he has other signs of a visible injury (bleeding, bone sticking out, etc.), then you need to take him to a veterinarian right away. [2] X Research source"

If you notice that your dog is limping, then this is a strong indicator that he may have a broken bone. Your dog may also be avoiding walking at all if it hurts too much. If your dog is laying around more than is usual for him, then this can also indicate that something is wrong. Keep in mind that dogs may limp due to a broken bone in the leg, hips, or even the ribs.

This change in behavior can be due to his pain and stress levels. You may need to muzzle your dog to prevent him from biting you or someone else in self-defense. Dogs may bite their owners if they are stressed or in pain. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Get x-rays. If your dog’s veterinarian suspects that your dog has a broken bone, then x-rays will be necessary. X-rays can help the veterinarian evaluate the bones for a break, assess what type of break it is, and pinpoint its location. Although many breaks are obvious, there are certain types that are not as apparent—particularly when the are within the joints or in young, growing dogs with open growth plates. Your dog will be sedated for x-rays to help keep him still and reduce his pain. Fractures are classified as either complete or incomplete. A complete fracture is where the bone is separated in one or more places and an incomplete fracture is where the bone is bent and not fully separated.

You can use a crate to encourage your dog to rest for up to six weeks. [11] X Research source If you have never used a crate with your dog before, then you will need to make sure that you: Get a crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and lay down in. Place some comfortable bedding in the crate, such as a couple of folded blankets or a dog bed. Do not leave your dog in the crate for more than a few hours at a time. You will need to let him out to go to the bathroom and to eat and drink as well. Never use a crate as punishment. Your dog should want to spend time in his crate, not fear it."

Your dog’s healing time will depend on the severity and type of break as well as your dog’s age. [12] X Research source For example, if you have a puppy, then he may fully recover in about one month. If you have an older dog, it can take much longer."
