      "content": "Trim, file, and buff your nails to prepare them for your manicure. Before applying any polish, spend 5 minutes prepping your nails so they’ll look picture-perfect after your at-home manicure. Use nail clippers to trim them all to an equal length, file away any rough edges and give them a square or round shape, and use a cuticle pusher to expose as much of the nail bed as possible. Finish your prep work by rubbing a buffer over the surface of each nail 2-3 times. [1] X Research source All of these pieces of equipment can be bought at your local drug store. Try something new by filing your nails in a different shape, like the almond, coffin, or stiletto style."

      "content": "Wash your hands to remove any polish-blocking lotions or oils. Your nails must be completely clean of anything that might make it hard for the polish to adhere to your nail beds. Gently scrub both of your hands with warm water and soap; dry them off with a clean towel. [2] X Research source Even if you don’t wear lotion, just the normal oil from your skin can form a barrier between your nails and the polish."

      "title": "Select a gel-specific base and top coat for your at-home manicure.",
      "content": "Select a gel-specific base and top coat for your at-home manicure. There are a lot of different products made to mimic the color and durability of a salon manicure without having to use a UV or LED lamp. Some products don’t even require a base coat, making the application process that much simpler. When you’re picking your products, consider the following: Look for a base and top coat that specifically mention giving your nails a gel-like finish. Check out the directions on the back to make sure you don’t need to buy any additional supplies. The colored polish itself doesn’t have to be gel-specific, but some brands of base and top coats should be used with the same brand of colored polish for the best results. This should be indicated in the product instructions."

      "title": "Apply a thin base coat to your clean, dry nails and let it dry for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Apply a thin base coat to your clean, dry nails and let it dry for 3 minutes. If the products you selected don’t require a base coat, you can skip this step. Otherwise, shake the base-coat bottle, then open it up and press the brush against the inner rim of the bottle to remove excess product. Stroke up from the bottom to the top of your nail in the middle, then paint along the right and left curves to cover your entire nail bed. [3] X Research source It’s up to you if you want to do both hands at once or just one hand at a time! If you’re new to at-home manicures, it may be easier to do each hand separately so there’s less chance of your nails getting smudged."

      "title": "Apply 1-2 coats of normal nail polish, letting each coat dry for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Apply 1-2 coats of normal nail polish, letting each coat dry for 3 minutes. This polish doesn’t have to have a gel-like finish, but make sure it’s the same brand as the base and top coats if that was recommended by those products. Shake the bottle before opening it so the color mixes completely. Wipe the brush against the interior rim to remove excess paint, then repeat the same brushing technique you did for the base coat: middle, left, and right sides to completely cover the nail. Let the coat dry for 3-5 minutes before applying the second coat. [4] X Research source Most polishes require 2 coats to thoroughly cover the nail, though some may need 3. If you can still see the color of your nail through the polish, it needs an additional coat. Painting your nails at home can take 30-60 minutes, so it can be a time-consuming process. Watch a TV show, listen to a podcast, or call a friend so you don’t get bored."

      "content": "Seal your nails with a gel top coat and let them dry for 3-5 minutes. Shake the top coat and prepare the brush by wiping away excess product along the rim of the bottle. Just as you did with the base coat and polish, apply a thin, even layer of product over each nail. Finish each one by lightly swiping the brush across the tip of the nail to help prevent chips. This step is the most important in the at-home gel-manicure process and is what gives your nails that beautiful shine. [5] X Research source Most top coats need 5 minutes to fully dry, but always check the instructions on your specific product to see what is recommended."

Once your polish begins to chip or you decide you’re ready for a new color, it’s super easy to remove this type of polish. Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover and wipe away the polish on each nail. You may need to go over your nails several times to get everything off, but it should only take you a few minutes. [6] X Research source Use a fresh cotton ball every 1-2 nails to make the removal process easier."

Cut your nails so they’re all the same length, file them into whatever shape you prefer, and use a cuticle pusher to expose as much of your nail beds as possible. [7] X Research source Consider giving your nails a square or round shape or try something a little more daring, like the stiletto style."

Use warm water and soap to gently scrub your hands, then dry them off thoroughly with a clean towel. [8] X Research source Depending on how big your machine is, you may want to wash the first 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of your wrists, too, if they might come into contact with the UV rays."

If you have these, consider wearing them every time you do your nails. While the chances of getting skin cancer from a UV nail light are low, they still exist.

If you applied a thicker base coat, cure your nails for 3 minutes. For thin coats, 2 minutes will be fine."

After the second coat, if you can still see your nail through the paint or if the paint looks streaky, do a third coat. [14] X Research source Remember, you can only use gel polish with a UV lamp. And if you have gel polish, you can’t use it unless you cure it under a UV light—otherwise, it’ll stay tacky and won’t dry."

[16] X Research source After about 2 weeks when you’re ready to remove your manicure, try not to pick off the gel polish. Doing so can weaken your nails. Instead, take it off with rubbing alcohol, cotton balls, and tin foil. [17] X Research source"
