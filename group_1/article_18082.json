If someone did not want to be your friend, you may find yourself dwelling on this. If a potential friend rejected you, you may have a lot of questions as to what went wrong and why. However, try to avoid dwelling. Unless they tell you upfront, you will never know for sure why someone rejected you. Therefore, there's little point in worrying. [2] X Research source Think about how close you really were to this person. If you were just getting to know someone, only to find they weren't interested in your friendship, how well did you really know them? You may be better off forgetting what occurred and moving on. Be aware of your thoughts. When you find yourself dwelling on something, do something to distract yourself.

[4] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. Pouring over someone's Facebook profile will only re-open old wounds. You may start wondering why they rejected your friendship all over again. [5] X Research source Try to block seeing the person's updates for awhile. This will help you from inadvertently seeing their pages when browsing social media. You might want to stay off social media altogether for a bit, especially if you're struggling to accept the rejection. Remember that many people only share the good things about themselves, so what you see online is not the full picture."

      "content": "Reframe how you view the situation. If you view rejection as solely negative, you'll have trouble forgetting it. Instead of seeing rejection as a failure, see it as one in a series of endeavors that did not work out. This way, it'll be easier for you to forget and move on to the next thing. [6] X Research source Think about it this way: You pushed yourself out of your comfort zone and tried to make a new friend. Many people are terrified of opening up their social circles. You deserve some credit for trying to meet someone new. This friendship did not work out. That's normal. Many people have a lot of commitments and relationships to attend to. If someone simply did not click with you as a friend, they may have decided to move on. Look towards the future. While this new friend did not work out, there are plenty of opportunities left to meet people and make new friends. Keep in mind that if you were able to make a connection once, you can certainly do it again with someone else."

[7] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022. If you try to completely forget negative feelings, you may end up feeling them more. If you really want to let go, embrace the pain briefly. This will allow you to release any anger and resentment and take steps forward. [8] X Research source No one likes being rejected. It hurts when someone does not want to be your friend. Allow yourself to be human and grieve the loss. Give yourself a few hours or a day to be sad. Then, focus your energies forward. Think something like, \"That was sad. I wish it would have ended differently, but I need to move on now.\" Think about what’s ahead and the type of friends want to make in the future. Practice mindfulness and live in the present moment instead of dwelling on rejection. Staying focused on what is happening in your life right now will help you to avoid feeling distressed about things that happened in the past or what might happen in the future.

A good way to forget someone who did not want to be your friend is to try to expand your social network. Find places where you can make new friends. [10] X Research source Make a goal of interacting with people more. You can start small. For example, promise yourself to make more small talk at work this week. From there, push yourself more. Go to a party you were invited to or chat up others that you meet at a social place, such as a coffee shop or a community center. Look for groups in your community (via Facebook, recreational webpages, etc.) that do things you enjoy. A shared activity can help people connect."

Try to look at the situation somewhat objectively. If you're being honest with yourself, was the rejection truly personal? Think about relationships in your own life. Chances are, you've rejected someone's friendship in the past. Maybe a classmate or co-worker kept asking you to hang out, and you kept making up excuses. Was this personal? Probably not. You likely just did not click with that particular person, or were too busy for new friendships. The person who rejected your friendship may have done so for similar reasons. Maybe they have a lot on their plate and aren't looking for new friends. Maybe they thought you were perfectly nice, but did not feel a strong enough connection with you. There's a good chance the rejection was not a reflection of your worth as a person."

Think about everything you've done well throughout the week. Take stock of your talents and abilities. This will all make you feel like a worthwhile person. You should also strive to remember your current relationships. Chances are, you have a lot of good friends now. Just because one person was not interested in your friendship does not mean you're not a good friend.

This will help bolster your confidence and sense of self-worth. [12] X Research source Notice your thoughts throughout the day, particularly in regards to the failed friendship. You may, for example, hear the person who rejected you made plans with a friend of yours. You think to yourself, \"I guess I'm just not cool enough to be friends with this person.\" Stop and redirect your thoughts. Replace negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, \"I didn't click with Sharon, but I know how much Felice values my friendship. I must be doing something right to have a great friend like Felice.\""

Eventually, you will move on and find new, better friends. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that your emotions don’t always reflect the facts.

Did you make crude or negative comments that may have made someone uncomfortable? Did you share too much information too soon? Were you flaky on plans, or maybe too rigid about plans?
