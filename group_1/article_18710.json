If it’s still fresh, Gholian says to “gently rub coffee stain with a clean, dry cloth.” [1] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 19 April 2021 Then, presoak the stain with a mixture of 1 quart (946 ml) warm water, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of dish soap, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of white vinegar. Let it soak for 15 minutes, then rinse with clean, warm water. If the stain remains, blot it with a sponge and rubbing alcohol before washing as usual. Only put the shirt in the dryer if you’re 100% sure the stain is gone, as the heat may set it further. [2] X Research source This method works for shirts made of synthetic fabrics (like nylon, polyester, and spandex), as well as cotton. If your shirt is made of a specialty fabric, like silk, fur, or leather, it’s best to have it professionally cleaned, as these materials can easily be damaged. Sometimes, a mixture of just water and vinegar will be enough to remove the stain. Alternatively, pretreat the stain with liquid laundry detergent and let it sit for about 5 minutes before running the white shirt through the wash. Stocker says you can “absolutely” use both vinegar and detergent when washing your clothes, “But you cannot mix them together. If you are using detergent, only use the vinegar in the rinse cycle after the detergent is out. You’ll get oily clothes otherwise.” [3] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

      "content": "Presoak old stains with an enzymatic cleaner for 30 minutes. Older coffee stains are more stubborn, but they can still be removed! Mix 1 quart (946 ml) of warm water with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of an enzymatic presoak or stain remover in a large bucket or basin. Immerse your white shirt for 30 minutes, then check to see if the stain is gone. If it is, wash the shirt as you normally would, then let it air dry. [4] X Research source Enzymatic presoaks are commercial stain removers that use enzymes in their formulas to help break down organic stains. Stain removers work particularly well with cotton fabrics. If the stain is still there, try soaking it for another half an hour or give one of the other cleaning techniques a try. If the stain is small, a stain pen may be enough to remove it."

      "content": "Pour hot water over cotton if pretreating doesn’t work. If you already tried pretreating a stained cotton shirt and the stain remains, stretch the stained area of fabric over a bowl and secure it with a rubber band. Heat some water in a kettle until it reaches 200 degrees F (93 degrees C), then pour it directly over the stain. Be careful not to burn yourself, and make sure the material is 100% cotton, as the hot water may damage some dyes and finishes. [5] X Research source"

Then, rinse the shirt with cold water,run it through a normal wash cycle, and let it air dry. Alternatively, launder the shirt with bleach. Add a cap full of bleach to the washing machine drum as it fills up with cold water, then add the shirt and run the cycle. Avoid using bleach to treat coffee stains on spandex, wool, silk, mohair, or leather clothing. It’s best to take those fabrics to a dry cleaner. Warning: Do not mix bleach with other cleaning solutions, as this could create toxic fumes. Work in a well-ventilated area and wear gloves to avoid touching it.

Remove the stained garment (if possible) and pour the club soda directly onto the coffee stain. Then, gently blot the area with a paper towel until the stain lifts. If possible, hang the shirt up to air dry, then toss it in the wash as soon as you can. [8] X Research source Repeat this process as many times as you'd like. Club soda probably isn’t realistic if you’re dealing with a large coffee stain. This method also works to remove coffee stains from tablecloths and carpets ."

Then, sprinkle some baking soda over it and let it sit for a while to soak up the coffee. Then, blot the area again with a clean, dry paper towel. Alternatively, mix some baking soda with a few drops of water and apply the paste directly to the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse with clean water. [9] X Research source Salt also works to prevent fresh stains from spreading. Generously sprinkle it all over the stain and let it sit for a few minutes before wiping it away with a paper towel. Stocker adds that baking soda “brightens clothes and removes odors. In the house cleaning business, we use it for our cleaning cloths, as well, to remove any odors. And if you mix baking soda and vinegar together, it actually kills 99% of bacteria!” [10] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

If the stain is still fresh, pour some baby powder directly onto the affected area and let it soak in for a few minutes. Then, gently brush it off with a clean, dry cloth. The baby powder may not remove the stain completely, but it should make it easier to clean.
