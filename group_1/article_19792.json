      "content": "Find the root of your inferiority complex. There are two kinds of inferiority complexes. The first is learned in childhood, while the second occurs when you are unable to meet goals you set for yourself. Both of types can vary in severity. [1] X Research source An inferiority complex that comes from childhood can be caused by neglect, overly critical or shaming parents, bullying, exposure to negative messages in the media, or not getting to experience positive social experiences. An inferiority complex developed as an adult can occur when you feel that you aren't able to accomplish things you set out to do, or when you feel harassed by your family, partner, or coworkers. Both types of an inferiority complex are associated with low self-esteem and making unfavorable comparisons between yourself and others."

      "content": "Watch for the signs of an inferiority complex. Sometimes you may not realize that things you do result from your inferiority complex; however, the complex can affect how you think and act. [2] X Research source You may find yourself getting into relationships expecting the other person to fill a void in you. You may feel an urge to hide your true feelings and to instead put on a false face to convince people you're better than you think you are. You may isolate yourself from others. You may develop compulsive behaviors like shopping, overeating, drinking, or collecting. You may try to control, blame, or harm other people. You may be unable to accept compliments. You may be easy to manipulate or may conform easily. You may experience feelings of anxiety, reluctance to trust others, low self-worth, and fear of rejection."

      "content": "Try to find the cause of your feelings. Inferiority complexes may come from something in your past. To help you move past it, you need to determine the root of your feelings. It may be a bad childhood experience, a traumatic event, or a combination of people putting you down over the years. Reflect on your past. Try to remember experiences that could have caused the inferiority complex. Some of these might be buried deep because of how painful they are. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine who you feel inferior to.",
      "content": "Determine who you feel inferior to. If you have an inferiority complex, then you feel inferior to someone else. Ask yourself who you feel inferior to. Try to be as specific as possible, or start broad and narrow it down. Do you feel inferior to attractive people? People with more money? Smarter people? Successful people? Try to go from one of those to a specific name of someone in your life. When you figure that out, ask yourself how those people or that person isn't superior to you. Can he play the piano like you? Does he have your work ethic? Your caring attitude? Your family values? [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Break down your complex.",
      "content": "Break down your complex. One way to start dealing with the complex is to break it down. Start with characteristics that you feel inferior about. Look at them logically, not emotionally. Are your perceived flaws that bad? If the answer is still yes, remember that everyone has traits they would like to improve. What you see as a flaw may not seem like one to someone else. No one may notice your large chin although it's all you ever think about. You may think your baldness is a flaw, while some people find bald men sexy. Your perceived flaws do not control you. Even if you have a large chin, are overweight, or are bald, that doesn't define you. That's one small part of you. It only controls and defines you if you let it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand that we're all inferior in some ways.",
      "content": "Understand that we're all inferior in some ways. Everyone on earth is inferior to someone in some way. There isn't one person who has everything. Although someone may be the most beautiful and rich person, there will be someone with more intelligence or more compassion. On the flip side, everyone is superior to others in some way. Everyone is a different combination of positive attributes and flaws. Understanding this concept can help you start to view yourself more realistically. Since everyone has flaws, this is not a reason for a complex. The over-exaggeration of your flaw and the self-consciousness you develop because of it causes the feelings of inferiority. The inferiority is made up and in your head."

      "title": "Stop wanting to be like others.",
      "content": "Stop wanting to be like others. Inferiority complexes are rooted in the desire to be just like someone else. They make you want to be someone you're not. If you try to be someone else, you aren't being true to yourself. This doesn't include limiting yourself and trying new things. Just don't try to be someone else. Be you. [6] X Research source You can get inspired by people. That means you look up to them and take some of their traits and put them into yourself. But the important difference is you are still you. You aren't trying to copy someone else or be someone else. You are using them as a positive guide while still being true to yourself."

      "title": "Try not to worry about what others think.",
      "content": "Try not to worry about what others think. Inferiority complexes arise from our constant concern about what others think about us. We oftentimes find problems with ourselves based on if others find us good enough. This isn't healthy thinking. Stop worrying so much about what others think about you. Only your opinion matters. Sometimes these judgments are real, but many times they are imaginary. Focus on making yourself happy without worrying about what others think. And try not to make up people's judgments. Remind yourself that you have no way of knowing what someone is really thinking or what is really happening in their life. Even if you think someone has it all, they may have the same insecurities as you do. Focus on your strengths and successes, not on what others might think of you. Make decisions on your own without asking for someone else's opinion so you build your confidence.

      "content": "Focus on your positive attributes. When you feel inferior, you put more emphasis on what you don't have instead of what you do have. Everyone has positive qualities.

It could be something like, \"I have a good job with lots of room to grow\" or \"I have nice teeth.\" When you're done, think about how many good things you have going for you. It might not make you better than someone else, but you don't have to be better. You just have to be happy being you and be thankful for what you have. [9] X Research source Include things from all facets of your life. Maybe you think you're overweight, but you have nice legs, nice feet, or nice hands. Maybe you have a great family, smart children, a good education, drive a nice car, or can crochet well. There are a lot of things that make us up. Try to find the positive things and focus on that."

If you do this, you will come up with a never ending list of ways people are better than you. You can't compare yourself to someone else, because everything about your life and circumstances are different - from the family you were born in, to your genetics, to your opportunities.

      "content": "Don't think in absolutes. Inferiority complexes make us think that if one thing could change, our lives would be great. We might think, \"If only I was 20 pounds smaller, my life would be great\" or \"If only I had a better job, I'd be happier.\" If you achieve these things, they will only provide temporary happiness, because deep down you will still be insecure. Material and superficial things, which many inferiority complexes thrive on, won't magically fix the problem. Try to retrain your thinking from \"If only...then I'd be happy.\" It can lead to more disappointment when it doesn't make you happy. [11] X Research source Focusing on the strengths, values, and positive assets you possess now is much more fulfilling. Learning to accept these things can help you move towards a happier life."

      "content": "Stop negative talk. Every day, you reinforce your inferiority complex by speaking negatively about yourself. When you say things like, \"He doesn't like me because I'm ugly\" or \"I won't get this job because I'm not smart enough,\" you are bringing yourself down and writing more negative, untrue beliefs onto your brain. When you find yourself saying something negative, stop it and say something positive instead. [12] X Research source You don't have to lie to yourself and say, \"He will love me because I'm the most beautiful.\" Instead, speak about yourself in positive, realistic terms. \"I am attractive/worthy of someone's affections. I am a kind, generous person who people want to be friends with.\" Reroute negative self-talk and beliefs by correcting yourself when you do it. For example, if you think, \"I'm the fattest girl here,\" change that thought to, \"I look great in this new dress, and everyone is going to see how stylish I am.\" Don't compare yourself to unrealistic goals. For example, if you start to negative self-talk because you only ran three miles instead of the five you planned, switch it around. Say, \"Wow, I've just started running and made it through three miles. That's great progress. I'll keep working until I hit my goal.\" By noticing and changing your negative self-talk, you can build your confidence and self-esteem."

Inferiority complexes are based on false ideas about ourselves. Try to remind yourself that this image is false and doesn't portray the reality. Remove labels you have attached to yourself. Don't think of yourself as stupid, ugly, unsuccessful, a failure, or anything else. Refuse to use them when you think about yourself. [13] X Research source"

People with these complexes sometimes fear exposing themselves and opening up. You need to push yourself to interact with people. These feelings of inferiority are in your mind.

If you spend your time with negative people who are constantly criticizing, analyzing, and judging others, it will start to affect you. Instead, spend your time with people who are positive. Look for people who accept and like people without judgment. Surrounding yourself with people who don't judge you can help you accept yourself. [15] X Research source Although your confidence should come from yourself, it is helpful to be friends with people who accept you.
