      "title": "F9 E1 means the water is taking too long to drain.",
      "content": "F9 E1 means the water is taking too long to drain. If your washing machine either cannot pump the water out after the drum fills up or it cannot pump the water out as efficiently as it normally should be able to, the F9 E1 error will appear on the display. On some models, the F9 E1 error will be accompanied by “DRN” on the display, which is short for “drain.” F9 E1 and DRN are interchangeable. If there’s still water in your drum but it’s draining slowly, wait for the drum to empty before trying to fix the error. If the water won’t drain, avoid removing the drain hose. It’s okay if you have to, but have a shop vac close by because there may be water in the hose that spills on the floor."

      "content": "Confirm the drain hose empties out 39–96 inches (99–244 cm) off the ground. The drain hose must empty the water out 39–96 inches (99–244 cm) off of the ground to drain properly. Use a measuring tape to determine how high off the ground it is. [1] X Research source You can pull or push the hose freely so long as you unlock the collar holding it in the machine (if there is one) If the hose drains out too high, pull the hose out of the machine a bit to add to the length. If the hose drains too low because it’s going into a floor drain, add an extension to the floor pipe and feed the hose into the extension."

      "content": "Ensure you have 4.5 inches (11 cm) of clearance in your sink. If your washing machine drains into a sink, use your measuring tape to gauge the distance from the end of the drain hose to the bottom of the sink. If you do not have 4.5 inches (11 cm) of space, readjust the hose. [2] X Research source If the hose is lower than 4.5 inches (11 cm), the water won’t have enough room to drain. While the drum is emptying, the water will siphon back up into the drain. When that happens, the machine will interpret it as a blockage."

      "title": "Unravel and smooth out any kinks in the hose.",
      "content": "Unravel and smooth out any kinks in the hose. If the drain hose is kinked up, restricted, or squeezed, the water won’t flow freely. Check the hose to make sure it isn’t restricted at all. If it is, reorient your machine and smooth the hose out. People often use zip ties to secure the hose to a nearby sink. If you overtighten that zip tie, it can restrict water flow. You only need the hose to sit in place."

      "title": "Check the hose for blockages and remove them.",
      "content": "Check the hose for blockages and remove them. Shine a flashlight down the drain hose to see if there’s anything stuck inside. If there is, either remove the hose and shake it until the blockage falls out or grab a drain auger and snake the hose to force the blockage out. [3] X Research source If the machine is on the newer side, refer to your manual to find the location of the drain filter. Then, confirm you actually have a filter in there. If you don’t, contact Whirlpool or your local appliance repair company."

      "title": "Remove the filter and clean it out.",
      "content": "Remove the filter and clean it out. If the hose itself is just fine and the dimensions of the hose are correct, the filter between the drum and the hose is likely the culprit. Look at the bottom of your machine for a panel (it’s usually on the opposite side of the drain hose). Open that panel and remove the filter inside. Rinse and clean the filter out before replacing it. The filter is supposed to catch any debris or dirt from the drum to keep it from clogging the drain hose. If that filter is super dirty, it can restrict the water from flowing correctly."

      "content": "If the water still won’t drain at all, the pump is probably bad. The drain pump is responsible for pumping the water out of the drum and through the hose. If everything appears to be in working order and your drum isn’t draining, your pump is probably bad. Contact Whirlpool. If your machine is under warranty, to see if they’ll replace it.
