      "content": "Benzoyl peroxide Try a cleanser with benzoyl peroxide —a topical antiseptic that kills acne-causing bacteria and clears out pores—to get rid of pimples on your lip line and other parts of your face. Benzoyl peroxide can potentially dry out your skin, so start with a face wash or gel that you rinse off afterward. Look for products with 4% or 5% benzoyl peroxide to start; if your skin does OK with it, you can work up to a stronger concentration.

      "content": "Salicylic acid Try a salicylic acid cleanser to unclog your pores and treat small lip pimples that aren’t very inflamed. Since it doesn’t kill bacteria (like benzoyl peroxide), salicylic acid is more effective for mild acne and pimples. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Licensed esthetician Joanna Kula says, “salicylic acid is excellent for oily, acne-prone, and congested skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties so it can also help reduce redness and acne marks.” Use the cleanser 1–2 times daily to start. Kula adds, “When and how often [you use salicylic acid] depends on your individual skin type.” Need to get rid of a lip pimple overnight ? Kula recommends “icing it and spot-treating with a salicylic acid product , but keep in mind that it will generally take more than one night to completely heal [the pimple].”"

A gentle foaming cleanser is always a great choice for sensitive skin and it does a great job.” If you’ve got oily skin that’s causing acne, Ramos adds that “ toners can work wonders to reduce oil on the surface of the skin.” As for moisturizing, Ramos recommends “a mild, natural moisturizer. Many people don’t know that oily skin is often caused by unbalanced, dry skin. Your body reacts by creating excess oil and sending it to the surface of the skin. An oil-free moisturizer can curb this process and tell your body to produce less.”"
