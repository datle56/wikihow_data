You can find a list of exit codes here . The exit code for the United States is 011. Some countries (such as Brazil and Chile) require you to add an extra digit depending on your phone carrier. Other countries (such as Australia and Finland) have an optional extra digit for your carrier. If you're calling from a business line, you may need to type \"9\" first to reach any external phone line."

The only exception is Italy, where area codes start with 0.

The resulting number would look something like \"011-502-xxxx-xxxx\"."

When you’re not in your home country, your service provider will charge you for call minutes, text messages, and even data usage. Before you make call using the internet, make sure you’re connected to a WiFi source and not using cellular data. [7] X Research source To make sure you aren’t using data, you can turn it off in your phone’s settings. On an iPhone, for instance, go to Settings, then choose Cellular. Switch the toggle button next to “Cellular Data” off. A lot of places offer free WiFi now. Try a hotel, restaurant, library, or coffee shop."
