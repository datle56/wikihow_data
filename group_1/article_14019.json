      "content": "Hinge does not notify a user when their profile or message has been screenshotted. Feel free to take as many screenshots as you would like of other people's profiles. They will not receive a notification from Hinge informing them of your screenshot. So go aheadâ€”send that screenshot of your Hinge crush to a friend to see if they think you should pursue a conversation . It's a good idea to consider the Hinge user's privacy when capturing screenshots of their profile. Avoid sharing the screenshot publicly, at least not without blurring or blocking the user's name or photo. Sharing screenshots of your chat with friends can be a valid way to receive advice or feedback on what you should say next. If you feel you are being harassed or threatened via chat on Hinge, screenshots may be helpful in filing a report against that user."
