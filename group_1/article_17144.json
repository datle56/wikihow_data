In Google Chrome, click the icon of two sliders to the left of the URL and look for \"Connection is secure.\" [4] X Research source You can click on the padlock icon or the sliders to verify the details of the website (e.g., the type of encryption used). A site that uses an \"https\" connection can still be unreliable, so it's best to verify the website using other means as well. Make sure the site's payment page, in particular, is an \"https\" page."

A website's URL consists of the protocol type (\"https\" or \"http\"), the domain itself (e.g., \"wikihow\"), and the top-level domain, which is the extension that comes after the dot (\".com\", \".net\", etc.). Even if you've verified that the connection is secure, be on the lookout for the following red flags: [5] X Research source Domains ending in .tk, .pw, .cc, ws, .xyz, .cm, .sbs, .zw, and .icu, as these are more commonly associated with phishing scams, malware, and other illegitimate websites. [6] X Research source Misspellings in any part of the domain name. Hyphens/dashes in a domain name, like amazon-4u.com, goog-le.cm, and fed-ex-tracking.com, usually indicate an illegitimate website. Domain names that imitate actual businesses (e.g., \"Amaz0n\" or \"NikeOutlet\"). Uncommon domain extensions at the end of legitimate business names. For example, USPS.com is the United States Postal Service's official website, not usps.lost-packages.xyz. One-off sites that use a credible site's templates (e.g., \"visihow\"). Too-good-to-be-true deals on shopping websites. Did you find a website that's offering a shockingly great deal on a rare collectible item you can't find anywhere else? Unfortunately, there are many fake online stores designed to steal your credit card information and money, and it can be tricky to tell the real from the fake. If a deal seems too good to be true, take that as a sign not to enter your personal information."

If you notice a large number of poorly spelled (or missing) words, generally bad grammar, or awkward phrasing, you should question the site's reliability.

If author names are not listed, there's no Contact page, or the information on the Contact page doesn't match up with what you'd expect, question the site's legitimacy. Make sure you scroll all the way to the bottom of the site to search for the Contact page. If the site in question doesn't have a Contact page listed anywhere, it should be an immediate red flag."

To do this, go to https://lookup.icann.org and enter a domain name. [8] X Research source When checking whois data, be on the lookout for: Private registration: It's possible to register a domain privately, where a \"private registration\" provider serves as the domain's contact, instead of the actual owner. If a domain uses private registration, consider this a red flag. Suspicious contact information: For example, if the name of a registrant is \"Steve Smith,\" but the email address is \"ramsaybolton12345@hushmail.com\", this might be a sign that the registrant is trying to hide their true identity. Recent registration or transfers: A recent domain registration or transfer may indicate that a site is untrustworthy."

Check their followers: If a company doesn't have a lot of followers, or the followers don't seem legit, the website likely isn't legit either. Look for engagement: If the company has a lot of followers, it's important to see how the followers interact with the company's social media account. Are they liking and commenting on posts? Do the comments align with the post content, or are they random? Are there lots of likes but hardly any comments? These are all signs a company has purchased fake followers instead of growing naturally."
