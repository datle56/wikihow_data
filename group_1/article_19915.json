      "content": "Take notes in class and when you study. When you're listening to a lecture or reading a chapter of your textbook, the act of taking notes helps you focus more closely on what you're hearing or reading. Additionally, your notes will help you remember the key points of the lecture or reading assignment when it's time to review the material. Carry a notebook and pen and take notes by hand if you can. When you take notes by hand as opposed to typing them, you're forced to focus on the most important points instead of writing everything down word-for-word. [2] X Research source If you're an auditory learner, ask your professors if you can record their lectures. You might also find it helpful to read your written notes aloud to yourself."

Start by doing a quick skim, focusing on the introduction, conclusion, and informational headings. This will help you spot the main points of the text. [3] X Research source You may find it helpful to write a brief outline of your reading or take notes in the margin as you read."
