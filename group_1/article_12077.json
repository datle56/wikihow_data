      "content": "Resist the urge to lash out or “punish” your partner. When you act on your feelings instead of explaining them, your SO may feel less safe about opening up to you. [1] X Research source If you feel yourself losing your cool next time your partner acts distant, take a few slow, deep breaths. You may need to step away for a little while and get your feelings under control before talking to them. Remind yourself that their behavior is about them, not you. When someone acts emotionally unavailable, it’s typically a defense mechanism to help them deal with uncomfortable feelings. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use “I” language so that they don’t feel attacked.",
      "content": "Use “I” language so that they don’t feel attacked. If your SO is acting distant or shutting you out, calmly explain how this behavior makes you feel. Don’t make any demands or try to force them to open up—just tell them what you’re experiencing. [3] X Research source For instance, “When you refuse to make eye contact with me, I feel sad and frustrated. I feel like I don’t matter to you.” [4] X Research source Avoid making statements that attack your partner as a person or make it seem like they’re at fault for your own reactions. For example, don’t say things like, “You always act so cold! You’re driving me crazy!”"

      "title": "Take an honest look at your own behavior.",
      "content": "Take an honest look at your own behavior. Try putting yourself in your partner’s shoes. Ask yourself if anything you’re doing might be triggering your partner to go into “defense mode.” For instance, do you tend to interrupt them or tune them out when they’re speaking? Do you lash out or become overly critical when they do something you don’t like? If so, acknowledge it—both to yourself and to them. Let them know that you recognize the problem and are willing to work on changing your own behavior. [5] X Research source For instance, say something like, “I know that sometimes I lash out when I feel criticized. But I want you to be able to open up to me when something’s bothering you, so I’m going to work on being better about that.” This can be extremely tough to do. You’re probably feeling very hurt by your partner’s behavior, which is totally understandable! But being empathetic and owning your part in things is a huge step towards helping your partner feel more secure and less defensive."

Make a specific, gentle request expressing what you want them to do differently. [6] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. For example, you could try saying, “Next time you’re angry with me, could you please tell me how you’re feeling and what’s bothering you?” Or, “I know you’re upset, but it would mean a lot to me if you would look at me or acknowledge me verbally when I talk to you.” [7] X Research source"

      "content": "If possible, do this at a time when you’re both calm and relaxed. In a non-judgmental way, acknowledge that your SO has a tendency to shut down when they’re unhappy with you. Talk to them about what you can do when that happens to make communication easier and put them more at ease. [8] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. For instance, say something like, “Sometimes when you’re stressed, I’ve noticed that you kind of check out and don’t want to talk. What’s the best way for me to talk to you when that happens?” Make an effort to really listen and understand your partner’s response. [9] X Research source You could even try rephrasing what they say in your own words. For instance, “Okay, it sounds like you get quiet because you’re worried about losing your temper and yelling, and you just need a few minutes to yourself to calm down. Is that right?”"

      "content": "Be gentle, but clarify that intentional stonewalling isn’t acceptable. If your loved one regularly deals with problems in the relationship by freezing you out, calmly explain that you’re not going to engage with them if they act this way. Set some specific consequences and be consistent about following through. [10] X Research source For example, you might say something like, “Okay, if you’re not willing to talk to me, I’m going to go out for a while. It’s too difficult for me to be around you when you’re acting like this.”"

Be attentive to their needs do your best to approach them with compassion and empathy. [12] X Research source Whenever your partner opens up to you or behaves in responsive way, acknowledge and reward that behavior!

      "content": "Some people are more naturally open and affectionate than others. Sometimes distant or unemotional behavior is a reaction to negative feelings in a relationship. In other cases, though, your partner may simply not express affection the same way you do. Consider whether your SO may be uncomfortable verbalizing their emotions. [13] X Research source If so, you can focus on trying to understand (and speak) their “love language.” For instance, they may prefer to express or receive intimacy by: [14] X Research source Spending quality time with you. Performing or receiving acts of service. Giving or receiving gifts. Expressing affection physically (e.g., through hugs, handholding, backrubs, or sexual intimacy). Do activities and play games together, this allows more communication and social interaction between the two of you [15] X Expert Source Allen Wagner, MFT, MA Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 24 September 2021."

      "content": "Don’t try to rush your partner or force them to respond. At the same time, give yourself a break if you lose your cool sometimes. It will take a lot of time and work—on both your parts—to change the way you interact with each other.

      "content": "You and your partner may both benefit from an outside perspective. If you feel like things aren’t getting better, or like the situation is so tense between you that nothing works, talk to your SO about seeing a counselor with you. If they won’t go, consider going by yourself. A therapist can help you develop stronger coping skills and give you advice about how to deal with your partner’s behavior—or even help you decide whether it’s time to end the relationship. [19] X Research source If you’re not sure how to find a therapist, talk to your doctor. They may be able to recommend someone who has experience with relationship issues. Stonewalling or unresponsiveness can be extremely damaging in a relationship. If your partner does it intentionally to hurt or manipulate you, then this is a form of abusive behavior. It’s very important for them to recognize the issue and be willing to work on it."
