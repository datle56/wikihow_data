      "content": "Recognize a runny nose as a viral symptom. If a virus causes your tonsillitis, you’re more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. A general feeling of being unwell and a fever can occur with either viral or bacterial infection, but the fever is usually lower if you have a virus – closer to 100.4°F (38°C) than 102°F (38.9°C).

      "content": "Consider a viral cause for your cough. You may have a cough with either cause, but a cough and a husky voice are more commonly associated with viral illness. Coughing and voice changes can be caused by laryngitis, usually a viral ailment that goes along with tonsillitis. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Notice if you start improving within four days.",
      "content": "Notice if you start improving within four days. Tonsillitis caused by a virus usually goes away or at least begins to improve within three to four days, so if you start to feel better after that time you likely have a passing viral infection. Bacterial tonsillitis can last much longer, or even until medically treated. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source See your doctor if you see no improvement in symptoms after four days — you may have a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics. Even viral tonsillitis can last up to two weeks, so a longer illness isn’t a definite sign of a bacterial infection. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Get tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) if you have constant fatigue. EBV is the usual cause of mononucleosis , or “mono.” Mono is a common cause of tonsillitis in young adults and teens. Mono can last for weeks, and is often associated with fatigue, sore throat and tonsillitis, fever, swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, and headache. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mono will pass on its own and usually doesn’t require treatment, but you should still get diagnosed. This can be done with a simple blood test."

      "content": "Check the roof of your mouth for a rash. Some people with mono also get a pinpoint red, speckled rash on the roof of their mouth. Open wide and look at the top of your mouth in a mirror. Red speckles can indicate mono. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mono can occur with or without a skin rash, too. While looking in your mouth, also check for a gray membrane covering your tonsils. This is another sign of mono. [9] X Research source"

Your spleen may enlarge if you have mono and feel tender when pressed. Be gentle! A swollen spleen can rupture if handled roughly.

Bacterial tonsillitis may cause small, white, pus-filled spots on your tonsils. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Look in a mirror, open your mouth wide, and look closely at the tissue on either side of the back of your throat. If it’s too hard to see, get a family member to look for you and try shining a light back there. It’s normal for your tonsils to look red and swollen with bacterial or viral tonsillitis – the white, pus-filled spots are more common to bacterial infections."

Use your pointer and middle fingers to gently press along both sides of your neck, on your throat under the angle of your chin, and behind your ears. Feel for a hard or tender lump about the size of your pinkie fingernail. This could be a swollen lymph node. Though your lymph nodes can swell any time your body is fighting an infection, swollen nodes are more common with bacterial infections.

Some complications of bacterial tonsillitis include scarlet fever and rheumatic fever, though these usually only occur if the infection is left untreated.

This is when your throat swab is sent to the lab and a lab technician determines what, if any, bacteria are present on your tonsils. Then your doctor can prescribe you the right antibiotics to treat the cause of your tonsillitis.
