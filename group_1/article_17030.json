      "content": "Use mountains and oceans as a means to locate deserts. It can be frustrating if you didn’t initially spawn in or near a desert—but that’s where mountains and oceans come in handy! Climbing to the top of tall mountains and boating across large stretches of the ocean gives you a better vantage point of more distant biomes, which can help you pin down a desert (and, potentially, a desert temple). If you’re playing in creative mode, simply fly around until you locate a desert."

      "title": "Lower your game’s FOV while searching the desert.",
      "content": "Lower your game’s FOV while searching the desert. In Minecraft, your game’s Field Of Vision (FOV) setting essentially controls how much of the map you can see in the distance at once. By decreasing your FOV, you’re essentially “zooming in” your screen, which might make it easier to spot a desert temple (if you’re already in a desert biome). Bedrock: Hit Esc , followed by Settings . Then, go to the Video page, where you can adjust the FOV. Java: Hit Esc , followed by Options . In the top left corner of the screen, use the slider bar to adjust the FOV."

      "content": "Increase the Render Distance so more of the game loads at once. The more blocks you can see in the distance, the quicker you’ll be able to find a desert temple. Just keep in mind that boosting Render Distance can be tough on your computer’s processor, and may not be an option if you have an older/slower device. Bedrock: Get to the Video page by hitting Esc , followed by the Settings option. On this page (the same page that has the FOV settings), locate the Render Distance slider bar and adjust it accordingly. Java: Hit Esc , along with Options and Video Settings . The Render Distance slider is on the right side of the screen. On Java, it’s possible to increase the Render Distance on the Video Settings page, which controls how much of the screen loads at once. Use the corresponding slider bar to render more of the game at once, which potentially makes it easier to spot a temple in the distance."

Then, type in your Minecraft coordinates at the bottom of the screen. Once you hit Go , all the desert temples in your game are displayed in relation to your current position.

To survive the encounter , destroy the central blue piece of terracotta on the floor, along with a few of the surrounding terracotta and sandstone blocks. Then, jump down to the secret room with the chests, avoiding the pressure plate as you land. [4] X Research source"
