      "content": "Roast marshmallows over an open fire for an easy treat. Spear a large marshmallow on a long stick or metal skewer, then place it over a fire that’s been burning for a while. Hover your marshmallow about 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) above the hot coals or firewood, rotating it slowly for several minutes. Try not to let the marshmallow catch on fire, or else it won’t cook evenly. [1] X Research source Don’t be discouraged if you don’t roast the perfect marshmallow at first—after all, practice makes perfect! It may take 4 minutes or so before your marshmallow is roasted and ready to enjoy."

      "content": "Prepare some tasty cereal bars with cereal, chocolate, and mini marshmallows. Take out an 8 by 8 in (20 by 20 cm) baking pan and grease it up with some cooking spray. In a separate bowl, melt one 11-12 oz (312-340 g) bag of chocolate chips mixed 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time until both ingredients are completely melted. Add 2 cups (100 g) of mini marshmallows and 2 cups (80 g) of graham cereal into the melted chocolate, then transfer the mixture into the greased pan. Press the mixture down with your hands, then wrap and store your dessert in the refrigerator until it’s cool and hardened to the touch. [6] X Research source To serve these bars, just cut them in smaller pieces. It helps to let the refrigerated bars warm up slightly at room temperature for a few minutes. You may want to give the melted chocolate and oil a few minutes to cool before adding it to the recipe. These bars are good for up to 1 week if you keep them in a sturdy, airtight container."

      "content": "Whip up your own crispy rice bars with small marshmallows. Add ¼ cup (59 mL) butter to a saucepan, letting it melt completely at a low temperature. Then, pour in 4 cups (200 g) of mini marshmallows. Continue stirring and mixing the marshmallows until they’re completely melted. Once they’re melted and no longer lumpy, turn off the heat and move the saucepan off. Mix 5 cups (250 g) of crisp rice cereal into the marshmallow mixture until you have a sticky mixture. Take a spatula and spread the sticky cereal into a greased 13 by 9 in (33 by 23 cm) pan. Refrigerate the mixture, and then cut the dessert into squares. [7] X Research source It helps to grease the spatula as you press the crisp rice into a baking pan. Store the bars in an airtight container and store them for a few days. If the marshmallow treats seem stale, throw them out."

Melt 2 cups (350 g) of chocolate in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time, until the chocolate is completely melted. Spear 10 large marshmallows with a toothpick, then dip it into a bowl of melted chocolate. While the chocolate is still warm, dip the marshmallow into a bowl of chopped nuts, peppermint, or another tasty topping. Leave the marshmallow on a sheet on foil, then place it in the freezer for 1-2 hours, or until the chocolate is completely hard. [8] X Research source It may help to let the marshmallows thaw for 5 minutes or so before enjoying them. Crushed toffee and coconut flakes are other great ideas. You can keep the marshmallows frozen until you’re ready to eat them."

Form a sandwich with the bread slices and cook it on a nonstick skillet over a medium-high heat setting. [10] X Research source You can use a single banana for this, along with a small handful of chocolate chips. Each side of the sandwich only needs to be cooked for about 1½ minutes."
