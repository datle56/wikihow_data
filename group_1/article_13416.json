If your hair gets tangled after washing, detangle with your fingers and a wide-tooth comb. Be gentle when detangling, as hair strands are very fragile when wet. Use your fingers to detangle to prevent hair breakage."

Use a blow dryer on medium or high heat to dry your hair completely after washing it. You can use a wide-tooth comb or blow dryer comb attachment to go through the hair for faster and more complete drying. If your hair is particularly thick, separate the hair into 4 or more sections when blow-drying. If you have naturally curly hair, use the blow dryer to straighten it as much as you can. To prevent heat damage, use a heat protector spray to spritz the hair prior to blow-drying."

However, make sure you’re getting extensions that are made for cornrows and braiding. This information should be labeled clearly somewhere on the packaging. You can choose either synthetic or real human hair, depending on your preference and budget. You may need to purchase 2 or 3 packs of hair, depending on your style and how thick and long you want your braids. Human hair is great, because it typically looks and feels natural, and it is also more durable. However, they tend to be more expensive and will react to high humidity by frizzing. Synthetic braiding hair is typically more affordable and does not react to weather conditions by frizzing. Unfortunately, it tends to look a lot less natural than real human hair, and it doesn’t last as long. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Prepare your extensions by separating them into sections. Your hair extensions will come in a long pack with all the hair in a single bundle. Before you start braiding, you’ll need to separate the extensions into sections and put them in a row within reach. Your first section of hair should be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thick. Then continue to separate it, making each section a little bit thicker than the previous one. Separating the extensions prior to braiding will help you to quickly pick up the hair with one hand instead of having to stop and separate the hair in the middle of braiding. [2] X Research source If you want long feed in braids, separate your braiding hair into about 7 sections. For shorter braids, separate the hair into 3 or 4. The more sections you have, the longer the braids will be. You’ll need to separate extensions into sections for each feed in braid you’re going to create. For example, if you’re doing 2 long feed in braids, you’ll need to have two sets of 7 extension pieces (for a total of 14 hair sections)."

To achieve this look, you’ll need to make a single part down the middle if your head. Use the tip of a rattail comb to divide the hair. Place the tip of your comb at the top of your forehead right in the center of your hairline. Then, pull it back to make a straight line down the middle of your scalp.

There are many styles where people rock 6 braids and more! To make a part, take a rattail comb and place it at the edge of your hair. Then, slowly separate your hair by pulling the comb back in a straight line. Pull it all the way back until the row goes to the nape of your neck. You can do this to make as many braids as you want, making sure to make even rows in your hair. [4] X Research source The number of parts in your hair depends on how many braids you want. If you want 8 braids, you’ll need to make 7 parts. Use a mirror to check the back of your head to make sure all of the rows are straight and even."

Wrap a hair tie or use duckbill hair clips to keep the hair sections separate. You can leave these in your hair until you’re ready to begin braiding. [5] X Research source"

To cornrow, start with either the left or right section of hair in your fingers, and move it over the adjacent section, so the section you started with is now in the center. Then move the section on the opposite side over so that it is in the center. This is one stitch. Continue doing this until you have about 3-4 stitches. To create a cornrow, make sure you are adding hair from the untouched part of the row every time you cross a section over. This will make the braid stay close to your scalp when you’re finished."
