Your skin will be smooth for three weeks on average. After that, it'll be time to return to the salon for another session."

[6] X Research source Giving your skin a soft oil-based massage can help to alleviate some of the pain or irritation the waxing strips may have caused you.

      "title": "Choose a razor blade.",
      "content": "Choose a razor blade. Shaving hair is arguably the most common way of removing leg hair. While it may not take hair out at the roots like waxing, it's relatively easy and pain-free to do. Purchase a quality razor from the health section at your local supermarket. Women's razors and men's razors are relatively the same. The only difference is that women's razors are designed to hug around natural curves in the body. Electric razors are also available, but won't result in as close of a shave. Getting cut by the razor blade indicates you may need to replace the razor. Razors are durable, but you should switch them up when they begin losing their efficiency. It is important to use a new, clean razor blade to keep your skin healthy and avoid razor bumps. If you shave your legs regularly, change the blade often."

It can be helpful to apply gel to a certain area and shave that before moving to other parts."

[10] X Research source Although it won't leave your legs hairless for as long of a time, the quickness and convenience makes it a good way to deal with it if you're in a pinch for time. Electric shavers require a degree of maintenance. Change your electric razor blade annually, assuming you're using it on a semi-frequent basis. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider switching to a root removal method. While shaving is usually the most painless hair removal method, a shave doesn't last very long. Shaving leaves the hair follicles intact, meaning that the hair will grow back in a few days. Additionally, shaving can lead to razor burn, dry skin, bumps/nicks, and possible cuts. Ingrown hairs might form as well. Consider switching to an alternate method that removes the hair at the root."

      "title": "Use an epilator",
      "content": "Use an epilator . [12] X Research source Epilators are handheld machines that remove hair by pulling out individual hairs by their roots. On the plus side, they result in an incredibly smooth feeling comparable with waxing. However, because you're removing the hairs one at a time, epilating your legs may take quite a while. One benefit that epilators have over waxing is the fact that they can pull out hairs as short as 0.5mm. This means you never have to wait for the hair to grow out before you remove it again. [13] X Research source Taking hairs out from the root never feels pleasant. Although some may find the epilator less painful than waxing, the discomfort lasts a lot longer. Aesthetician Alicia Ramos suggests taking a bath before you epilate: \"Soaking in warm water helps loosen the [hair] follicles and will mean that you have to do fewer passes to do the job. Really dry off after your bath and make sure your leg is free of any oils or anything that will make it difficult for the epilator to grip the hair you're trying to remove.\""

      "content": "Apply a depilatory cream. [14] X Research source Depilatory creams work to dissolve hair on the surface of your skin without irritating the skin itself. Lather the cream gently onto your skin and leave it for ten minutes while it does its work. Once enough time has passed, the hairs will come off along with the cream when you wipe it away from your legs. Depilatory creams can be found in the health section of your local supermarket. You can also purchase a number of versions online. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Fight ingrown hairs.",
      "content": "Fight ingrown hairs. Hair follicles sometimes re-enter the skin and can't be waxed or epilated. Prevention is key here, so exfoliate often and follow up with a moisturizer. A loofah or body cloth works well with delicate skin, while a body scrub or gel exfoliate can tackle tough skin. Don't skip exfoliation: even a bit of simple sugar scrub will make a difference. This is also a great way to make your legs smoother. Keep in mind, however, that too much of exfoliation can irritate your skin. A great place to start is one good exfoliation once a week or even once every other week."

      "content": "Consider laser hair removal. [16] X Research source Laser surgery is considered extreme by some people, but there's no arguing with results. Concentrated lasers will work to destroy follicles completely. The affected hair will fall out within 2-3 weeks. It will make your legs deeply smooth, and you will avoid the irritation of shaving or other procedures. However, it is notably more expensive than home-based treatments, and requires several trips back to the Doctor's office before the procedure is complete. If you have particularly thick leg hair, you may have to schedule more appointments than the average."
