[3] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 1854 wikiHow readers who read body language, and only 9% of them agreed that the best sign of anger is furrowed eyebrows. [Take Poll] However, when accompanied by other physical reactions like flaring your nostrils, this can help signal aggression."

In order to achieve this look, pull your lips together to make them look thinner, and pull both your mouth and your cheekbones up slightly. [5] X Research source Be sure to pull your entire mouth up. Pulling just the corners up will read as a smile, which is not desirable in this case, unless you want the person you are glaring at to know that you are just being playful."

Depending on the exact kind of evil you're going for, you may want to experiment with using all of these facial expressions or just a few. Research has found that when a face displays just one of the characteristics of an \"angry face,\" it is interpreted as strong and assertive, but not angry. [7] X Research source If you want to look assertive and maybe even menacing, but not necessarily angry, try incorporating just one or two of the adjustments into your facial expression. Practice your expression in front of a mirror to determine which level of anger is appropriate for your needs."

It's easy to get a beautiful yet menacing look with some simple makeup tricks. A black and gold smokey eye with cat eye liner is perfect. To get this look, apply gold shadow to your lids and black shadow to your creases, blending the two together. Then line your upper lid with black liquid eye liner. Use gold eyeliner above your black eyeliner, around the inner corner of your eye, and under your lower lash line. Make sure all of your eye shadow and liner extends beyond the external corner of your eyelid into a wing for the perfect cat eyed look. A matte red lip is the perfect complement to your evil smokey eye. Apply blush to your cheekbones and a darker contouring color under your cheekbones."

[10] X Research source Think about how much impact your evil glare will lose if you don't look confident while doing it! Your facial expressions will all be for naught if you don't have the confident body language to back them up."
