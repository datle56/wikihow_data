      "content": "Hold the reflector in front of you like a steering wheel. Pick the reflector up and hold it at opposite sides. Make sure your hands are at the far right and far left of the reflector. [1] X Research source Your fingers will be clutching the outside."

      "title": "Reverse the grip with your left hand.",
      "content": "Reverse the grip with your left hand. Let go of the reflector with your left hand. Move your shoulder and arm up so you can reverse the grip. Now, your fingers will clutch the side facing you. [2] X Research source This may feel uncomfortable, but you won't have to hold the position for very long."

    {
      "title": "Twist your left hand clockwise.",
      "content": "Twist your left hand clockwise. Make sure your left hand is gripping the reflector in the reverse grip with your fingers facing you. Then, twist your left hand clockwise with the reflector. Your grip will revert to its original position. As you rotate your hand around, the reflector will twist into the shape of the number 8. [3] X Research source You should now be holding the reflector like a steering wheel again."

      "title": "Reverse the grip of your right hand.",
      "content": "Reverse the grip of your right hand. Gripping the reflector, twist your right hand counter-clockwise until it's in the reverse grip. Your fingers should be on the side facing you. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Push both sides together until the reflector's aligned.",
      "content": "Push both sides together until the reflector's aligned. With these twists, the reflector is almost folded. You can put it away at this stage. If you'd prefer it to be more compact, push both sides of the reflector towards each other. Once they align, you can let go. It will keep its folded shape until you unfurl it again.

    {
      "title": "Hold the reflector with your hands on opposite sides.",
      "content": "Hold the reflector with your hands on opposite sides. Pick the reflector up with both hands, imagining that you're holding a steering wheel. Grip both sides tight so that you don't lose your grip. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold both sides together.",
      "content": "Fold both sides together. Bring both of your hands together as you grip the reflector. The reflector will push out to the ground. As your hands draw nearer, the reflector will loosen on both sides. [7] X Research source Crumples and creases indicate loose material. If the material is still firm, try folding different sides together."

    {
      "title": "Grab the furthest side and fold it into itself.",
      "content": "Grab the furthest side and fold it into itself. Both sides of the reflector should be flopping down. The reflector will compress naturally as you fold the furthest side inwards. [8] X Research source Give the reflector time to make the natural folds and twists it needs to."

      "title": "Make minor adjustments to fine-tune the fold.",
      "content": "Make minor adjustments to fine-tune the fold. You've now folded the reflector. If both sides of the reflector aren't aligned, push and pull them until they are touching each other. You can now let go of the reflector. It will keep its compact form. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your foot under the center of the reflector. Sometimes, a reflector is too big to carry. Try this method if the reflector is too wide to hold from both sides. Stand the reflector up on the floor. Then, slide your foot under the center. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay your hands along the edge. You'll need to adjust your grip to properly fold the reflector. Rest your hands over it so the edge runs along your palms. Grip the outer face with your thumbs, then, curl your palms and fingers along the inside edge. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the reflector as you lower your body. You will need to complete two actions at the same time. First, begin to lower your body with your legs so that you can follow the natural folding of the reflector. As you're lowering your body, twist your hands clockwise. The reflector will crumple as you descend. [13] X Research source You may need to practice this motion several times until you can pull it off seamlessly."

      "content": "Perform any small adjustments to the fold. Sometimes both sides of the reflector won't align. Push the sides towards each other until they're touching. The reflector is now folded. [14] X Research source To unfurl it, pry apart the fold and it will spring outwards."
