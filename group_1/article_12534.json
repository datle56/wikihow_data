      "content": "Learn the basics of describing symptoms. There are four basic elements you should use to describe symptoms. Learning these will help you figure out your symptoms and best convey them to your doctor. [1] X Research source Tell your doctor how your symptoms feel. For example, if you’re experiencing headaches, use descriptive words like sharp, dull, stabbing, or throbbing. You can use these kinds of terms to describe many physical symptoms. [2] X Research source Explain to or show your doctor the exact location in or on which you’re experiencing your symptoms. You want to be as specific as possible so say “The front of my kneecap is swollen and has throbbing pain” instead of something general like “I have pain on my leg.” [3] X Research source You should also note if the symptoms extend to another location. Mention how long you’ve had your symptoms. The more specific date you can pinpoint, the easier it may be for your doctor to figure out what is causing your symptoms. [4] X Research source Note how frequently you have or notice symptoms. This information can also help your doctor figure out what’s causing your symptoms. For example, you could say “I feel symptoms every day, especially after I work out,” or “I only notice my symptoms occasionally, like every few days.”"

Note if symptoms are connected to specific activities, injuries, times of day, food or beverages, and anything else that exacerbates them. Also, note if they affect your life in any way.

[6] X Research source You may not end up needing to refer to it, but if questions about your medical history come up, having your patient profile available will maximize the time you can spend discussing your current medical issue(s).

For example, “I get bad pain right in between my menstrual periods that lasts about three days.\" Tell your doctor how the symptoms affect your daily life and ability to function. Let your doctor know if you’ve experienced the symptoms before and under what circumstances this happened. Tell your doctor if you notice that your symptoms are better or worse at certain times of the day. For example, “I have much more extreme rectal itching in the evening.” Mention parallel symptoms or concurrent conditions. For example, you could say, \"During the three weeks I've been having these fainting spells, my wife also said that I've been looking very pale and I've also had these dark-colored bowel movements and I've lost ten pounds even though I'm eating the same.”"
