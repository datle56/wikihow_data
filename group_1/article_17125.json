      "content": "Go exploring to find a Deep Dark Biome. Ancient Cities are only found in Deep Dark Biomes in Minecraft , which spawn deep underground. They most often spawn under mountains (such as jagged peaks, stony peaks, and snowy slopes) but can also spawn under groves (cherry groves included), meadows, and savannah plateaus. [1] X Research source They will never spawn under oceans, rivers, swamps, or deserts. Unfortunately, the only way to find an Ancient City without using cheats or third-party tools is to go digging and exploring. There are no surface-level indicators that there's an Ancient City under your current location. The floor of an ancient city will always generate at Y level (altitude) of -51, though the Deep Dark Biome may start before that. [2] X Research source You'll know when you've found a Deep Dark Biome because it's surrounded by sculk blocks and sculk veins."

      "content": "Use the /locate structure cheat to find an Ancient City. If you don't feel like looking around for an Ancient City yourself, you can use a cheat to locate the nearest Ancient City. Simply type /locate structure minecraft:ancient_city to get the coordinates to an Ancient City. You must be playing on a server that allows cheats. If your current game doesn't allow cheats, you won't be able to use this method. Open the console by pressing T or / . Using the forward-slash button will auto-fill a forward slash into the console, which can save you a little time when writing your cheat command. Then type the cheat command and press Enter or Return . If you want to teleport directly to the Ancient City, you can do so with another cheat. Simply type /tp [username] [coordinates] into the console, where [username] is your username and [coordinates] are the coordinates that the cheat code gave you."

You must have permission to use commands in the server to get the seed in this way. If you don't want to get the seed of your server (or you can't, due to server permissions) you can also load your seed from a save file. Simply click the Load from Saveâ€¦ button and select the level.dat file for your game (which is a small file located in the folder for your Minecraft saved game). You can also press the Random button to put a random seed into the Ancient City Finder. Alternatively, you can find a seed for an interesting-looking Minecraft world ] and check to see where any Ancient Cities are located."
