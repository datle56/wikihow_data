Both of these ends are the shape of a circle. The first step to finding the surface area of your cylinder will be to find the surface area of these circular ends. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Find the radius of your cylinder. The radius is the distance from the center of a circle to the outer edge of the circle. Radius is abbreviated “r.” The radius of your cylinder is the same as the radius of the top and bottom circles. In this example, the radius of the base is 3 centimeter (1.2 in). [2] X Research source If you are solving a word problem, the radius may be given. The diameter also might be given, which is the distance from one side of the circle to the other, passing through the center point. The radius is exactly one half the diameter. You can measure the radius with a ruler if you are looking for the surface area of an actual cylinder."

      "content": "Calculate the surface area of the top circle. The surface area of a circle is equal to the number pi (~3.14) times the radius of the circle squared. The equation is written as π x r 2 . This is the same as saying π x r x r. [3] X Research source To find the area of the base, just plug the radius, 3 centimeter (1.2 in), into the equation for finding the area of a circle: A = πr 2 . Here's how you do it: A = πr 2 A = π x 3 2 A = π x 9 = 28.26 cm 2"

You can follow the same steps as you did with the first base, or you can recognize that the bases are identical. You can skip using the area equation a second time for the second base if you understand this. [4] X Research source"

The bases are connected to each other by a “wall” of can. The radius of the wall is the same as the radius of the base, but unlike the base, the wall has height. [5] X Research source"

To get the circumference, simply multiply the radius by 2π. So, the circumference can be found by multiplying 3 centimeter (1.2 in) by 2π. 3 centimeter (1.2 in) x 2π = 18.84 centimeter (7.4 in).

All you have to do is add 56.52 cm 2 , the area of both bases, and the outer surface area, 94.2 cm 2 . 56.52 cm 2 + 94.2 cm 2 = 150.72 cm 2 . The surface area with a cylinder with a height of 5 centimeter (2.0 in) and a circular base with a radius of 3 centimeter (1.2 in) is 150.72 cm 2 . [10] X Research source"
