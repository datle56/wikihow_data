All parallelograms have a simple area formula: area equals base multiplied by the height, or A = bh . [2] X Research source If you place the parallelogram flat on a horizontal surface, the base is the length of the side it is standing on. The height (as you would expect) is how high it is off the ground: the distance from the base to the opposite side. Always measure the height at a right (90 degree) angle to the base. In squares and rectangles, the height is equal to the length of a vertical side, since these sides are at a right angle to the ground."

Cut any parallelogram in half along the diagonal, and it splits into two equal triangles. Similarly, if you have two identical triangles, you can always tape them together to make a parallelogram. This means that the area of any triangle can be written as A = ½bh , exactly half the size of a corresponding parallelogram. [3] X Research source"

The base is the easy part: just use the third, unequal side of the isosceles. For example, if your isosceles triangle has sides of 5 centimeters, 5 cm, and 6 cm, use 6 cm as the base. If your triangle has three equal sides (equilateral), you can pick any one to be the base. An equilateral triangle is a special type of isosceles, but you can find its area the same way.
