Also, if you have a Sudoku book handy, consider tracing an existing puzzle to get a standard shape and size. [2] X Research source"

There should be three squares on the top row, three in the middle row and three in the bottom row: three equally spaced lines going across the square, and three equally spaced lines going down the square. Make sure you use a ruler to ensure that your lines are straight. [3] X Research source"

Trace the lines you drew with a marker or pen, making sure that the lines of the first 3x3 square are thicker and bolder. The lines of the smaller squares should be light and thin, so consider using a ballpoint pen."

Don’t forget how the game works, or you’ll end up with an incorrect solution. [5] X Research source Remember the rules. To win sudoku, the player must fill the grid so that each row contains the number 1-9, each column contains the numbers 1-9 and each 3x3 box contains the numbers 1-9. [6] X Research source Start filling in the number 1. Place a number one in each 3x3 box, each row and each column. Make sure that that you don’t place two number ones in any column, row or 3x3 box. Move on to the number 2. Begin to place the number 2 in each column, row and 3x3 square. As with the number one, make sure you don’t double up your number 2s. Continue with each number consecutively. Keep adding the number 3, the number 4 and so on to each row, column and 3x3 box. As you fill in more numbers, the boxes will become easier to fill because you’ll have fewer and fewer spaces left."
