      "content": "Put your hands on the bar with your palms facing your body. Whereas a pull-up would begin with your palms facing away, a chin-up begins with your palms facing your body. This is called an underhand grip. Grip the bar comfortably but firmly, with your hands spaced shoulder-width apart.

      "content": "Do isometric chin-ups. Stand on a chair and grip the bar as though you were going to do a chin-up. Bend your knees as much as you need to so that your chin is just above the bar. Move your feet off of the chair and hang in this position for 30 seconds or as long as you can. After 30 seconds, lower yourself back down until your arms are straight. Repeat this five times.

Go to source It's important that when you lower yourself down it's slow and controlled. You use the same muscles on the way down that you use on the way up. This exercise will help to train your muscles to perform a chin-up without the help of a chair.

Starting from this position, pull yourself up so that your chin is past the bar. Repeat five times starting from the same position.

      "title": "Increase your number of reps.",
      "content": "Increase your number of reps. When you can do a full chin-up, pull yourself up five times in a row, or as many times as possible. You can also do a combination of full chin-ups and half chin-ups. As your muscles gain strength, increase your reps. You should be able to increase your reps every other week or so. Don't overdo it. You don't want to tear a muscle or overexert yourself. Rest between sessions to give your muscles time to repair and get stronger."
