      "title": "Soak and rinse the rice before cooking.",
      "content": "Soak and rinse the rice before cooking. Add the rice to a large bowl and cover it with fresh water. Soak the rice for about 30 minutes. Then, transfer the rice to a sieve to strain the water. Wash the rice under fresh running water for a minute. Soaking and washing rice removes dirt and excess starch, so your rice will be fluffy and not sticky."

      "title": "Boil the water.",
      "content": "Boil the water. Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of water into a medium saucepan. Put on a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Depending on the type of rice you're making, you may need to adjust the rice to water ratio. Per cup of rice (195 g), use the following water quantities: [1] X Research source Use 2 cups (470 ml) of water for long-grain white rice, medium- or short-grain brown rice, and wild rice. Use 1¾ cups of water (411 ml) for long-grain brown rice or jasmine rice. Use 1½ cups of water (353 ml) for medium-grain white rice or basmati rice. Use 1¼ cups of water (294 ml) for short-grain white rice. You can also replace the water with chicken stock if you want to give your rice a subtle yet different flavor."

      "title": "Simmer the rice, salt, and oil.",
      "content": "Simmer the rice, salt, and oil. When the water is boiling, remove the lid from the pot. Stir in the rice, salt, and oil. Bring the water back to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Once the water is simmering again, put the lid on and turn the heat down to low. Continue cooking for 18 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of rice. [2] X Research source White rice varieties will take around 18 minutes to cook. Brown rice varieties will need closer to 30 minutes. Don’t stir the rice or remove the lid until it’s time to check for doneness. The rice is done when it’s firm but tender and not crunchy."

      "title": "Let the rice rest when it’s done.",
      "content": "Let the rice rest when it’s done. When the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat. Leave the lid on and set the pot aside to rest for at least five minutes. This will help to steam the rice, give it a chance to absorb leftover moisture, and make it tender. You can leave the rice to steam for up to 30 minutes."

      "title": "Fluff with a fork before serving.",
      "content": "Fluff with a fork before serving. Fluffing the rice means stirring it with a spoon or rice spatula. This lets excess moisture escape and helps to make the rice plump. After stirring, let the rice sit for another two minutes before serving. [3] X Research source Serve the rice as a side dish, add to soups, or add your favorite spices and vegetables to make a complete meal. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days."

When the time is up, drain the rice in a sieve and rinse it under running water. [4] X Research source Rinsing will remove starch and help make the rice less sticky."

For a more flavorful rice, you can also add other herbs, spices, and seasonings, such as: [5] X Research source Chopped garlic Minced onion Bay leaf Dried herbs like parsley, rosemary, and thyme Cayenne pepper Paprika"

For a stovetop pressure cooker, put on and lock the lid. Bring the pressure cooker to pressure over high heat, then lower the heat to low. The cooking time will depend on the type of rice: [6] X Research source Cook jasmine rice for one minute Cook short-grain, medium-grain, and long-grain white rice for three minutes Cook basmati rice for four minutes Cook brown rice for 22 minutes Cook wild rice for 25 minutes"

Let the pressure drop naturally for the next 10 minutes, and don’t open the release valve during this time. [7] X Research source This will give the rice a chance to finish steaming, and allow the pressure cooker pressure to drop to a safe level."

      "content": "Relieve the remaining pressure. After 10 minutes, open the pressure valve to release the remaining pressure from the cooker. Stand back from the cooker while the steam releases to avoid burning. [8] X Research source When the pressure has dropped to zero unlock and remove the lid."

      "content": "Wash the rice. Combine the rice in a bowl with enough cold water to cover the rice. Let it soak for at least 30 minutes before draining and rinsing the rice under running water. You can soak the rice for a couple hours before draining and rinsing, and this will result in rice that isn't sticky at all. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Combine the rice and water.",
      "content": "Combine the rice and water. You can steam rice in either a rice cooker or an electric steamer. A rice cooker is specifically for rice, whereas an electric steamer is for vegetables and other foods as well. Both come with a basket for rice. Stir together the rice and water in the basket. When steaming rice, always use equal parts rice and water. To make rice to serve more people, simply increase the quantities of both equally."

      "content": "Add water to the basin of an electric steamer. When using an electric steamer to make rice, you also have to add extra water to the basin below the steamer basket. This is necessary to create the steam that will cook the rice. For smaller quantities of rice, add water to the minimum fill line. For larger quantities, add water to the maximum fill line. You don’t have to add extra water to a rice cooker."
