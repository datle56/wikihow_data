      "content": "Right after your kitty’s favorite meal is a great opportunity. Cats usually aren't thrilled about getting their claws trimmed, but this doesn’t have to be a negative experience! Cats are more cooperative when they’re happy and a bit groggy, so try giving yours a big helping of their favorite wet food or a tasty treat a few minutes before you start. [1] X Research source Post-playtime is another good option—just make sure your kitty is worn out enough to be drowsy."

      "content": "Face the cat away from you and support its body with your arm. Nestling the kitty firmly in the crook of your arm works well, just be sure to leave your dominant arm and hand free to operate the clippers. If your cat is being squirmy, enlist a friend or family member to help you hold the kitty still. [2] X Research source If you don’t have anyone to assist you, try wrapping the kitty's body firmly in a towel with its paw extended. [3] X Research source Face the chair away from the window, if possible. The last thing you want is for your cat to spot a bird through the window in the middle of a claw trim! If you have other pets, keep them in a separate room for now. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s usually easier to start with one of the front paws. Front paws tend to be more accessible, but it doesn’t really matter as long as you're working on one paw at a time. Hold the paw between your fingers and massage it for about 3 seconds so your cat adjusts to the feeling. [5] X Research source Avoid massaging for more than a few seconds since most cats get impatient. If your cat is being squirmy, let them sniff the clippers. Then, give them a treat so they start associating the clippers with good things. Keep the treats nearby since you’ll probably need them again.

      "content": "Examine the first claw closely under a light and find the pink center. This dark pink area closest to the base of the toe is called the quick. You’ll want to avoid cutting into this sensitive area since it’s a blood vessel. Get a good look at the claw and familiarize yourself with the quick’s location. [8] X Research source It’s not the end of the world if you nick the quick, but it’ll bleed and be painful. Plus, your kitty will probably be a lot less cooperative during future trims!"

      "content": "This is key when you're using human clippers on kitty claws. Turn the human clippers to the side, which is a 90-degree rotation from how you’d orient them to cut your own fingernails. [9] X Research source If you place the flat edge of the clippers perpendicular to the extended claw, you might split the kitty’s nail."

      "content": "Squeeze the clipper handles and make a quick cut. Remember: anywhere in the white zone near the tip of the claw is safe! Avoid the pink area (the quick) in the center. You won’t be able to measure it exactly, but it’s best to cut about 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) before the quick. [10] X Research source When in doubt, err on the side of caution—it's better to cut off less than more. If you accidentally cut into the quick or splinter the cat's claw, stay calm and speak to your pet in a low, soothing voice. Apply styptic powder to the nail to stop the bleeding and finish the trim another day.

Go slow and give your cat lots of positive reinforcement and tasty treats along way. That way, your kitty will associate nail trims with positive experiences and rewards. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "If your cat is still mellow and relaxed, keep on trimming. You probably won’t be able to trim all of your cat’s claws in a single session, which is normal and expected. A good goal for the initial session is to cut at least the first 2 claws. Then, you can tackle the remaining claws on subsequent days. If your cat is still relaxed and happy after you cut the first 2 claws, it’s fine to keep going. Every cat reacts differently."

      "content": "You could hurt or agitate your cat if you try to force it. A wriggly, yowling cat is tough to groom and you’ll be more likely to cut into the quick. If your cat resists, stop immediately and stay calm. Give your kitty a treat and a cuddle session and try again tomorrow.

These folks are trained and can probably show you some tricks to help you “nail” future trims on your own!"

      "content": "The front claws need to be trimmed more frequently than the back ones. Check your cat's front paws every 2 weeks or so and trim them once they’ve grown out. If you’re able to trim the back paws during the same session, go for it! If you can’t, the back claws can be trimmed every month or so. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Growth varies depending on your cat’s breed, age, and health. Typically, senior cats will need more frequent trims than younger cats."

A dedicated scratching post encourages your cat to wear down its claws on its own, so you won't need to trim them as often. It can also prevent your cat from scratching up your carpets and furniture.
