      "content": "Place old white cloth over your shoulders and workspace. Take a well-used white towel and dangle around your shoulders, back, neck, and any other place that the bleach might touch. Don’t use a dark towel for this, as the bleach will stain and permanently recolor the material. [2] X Research source Any material will work, as long as you don’t mind it getting bleached. Old T-shirts and linens are also great options."

Use the brush applicator or another stirring utensil to mix the ingredients together. Aim for the bleach mixture to have a thick, yogurt-like consistency. If the bleach is too runny, then you won’t be able to apply it in your hair. [3] X Research source If you have longer hair, you might want to use more bleach, while individuals with shorter hair might want to use less. See how much bleach mixture you have after stirring 2 packets into the developer, and go from there. Since the ombré look is gradual, you only want to bleach the lower sections of your hair."
