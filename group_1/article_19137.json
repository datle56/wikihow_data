      "title": "Relax and don’t panic.",
      "content": "Relax and don’t panic. Quicksand usually isn't more than a couple feet deep, but if you do happen to come across a particularly deep spot, you may sink quite quickly down to your waist or even chest. If you panic, you can sink further, but if you relax, your body's buoyancy will cause you to float. [1] X Research source Breathe deeply to remain calm and make you more buoyant. Keep as much air in your lungs as possible. It is impossible to go under if your lungs are full of air. Panicking can also make you flail around. Big, frantic movements can get you more stuck. They create a vacuum, which then just fills in with even more densely packed sand as it settles toward the bottom of the quicksand. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop everything to make yourself lighter.",
      "content": "Drop everything to make yourself lighter. If you step into quicksand and you're wearing a backpack or carrying something heavy, immediately take off your backpack or drop what you're carrying. Because your body is less dense than quicksand, you can't fully sink unless you panic and struggle too much or you're weighed down by something heavy. [3] X Research source If it's possible to get out of your shoes, do so. Shoes, especially those with flat, inflexible soles (many boots, for example) create suction as you try to pull them out of quicksand. Tip: If you know ahead of time that you are highly likely to encounter quicksand, change out of your boots and either go barefoot or wear shoes that you can pull your feet out of easily."

      "title": "Try to take a few small steps backward if only your feet are stuck.",
      "content": "Try to take a few small steps backward if only your feet are stuck. As soon as you realize what you’re standing in, take a couple of quick, small steps backward onto solid ground before the quicksand takes hold. It usually takes a moment for the sand to fully liquify, which means you have a short window to “unstick” yourself before you’re more firmly stuck. [4] X Research source Warning: If your feet do become stuck, avoid taking big lumbering steps to try to get yourself out. Taking a big step forward might unstick one foot, but push your other farther down, making it extremely difficult to completely unstick yourself. If you’re with someone, try to grab their hand or a stick for support while you wiggle yourself out. However, don’t let them try to pull you right out; the suction is very strong and the force required to pluck something out of quicksand is the same as you’d need to lift a small car. [5] X Research source Chances are it won’t work (and it could injure you, too)."

      "title": "Lie on your back and “swim” if you sink past your knees or higher.",
      "content": "Lie on your back and “swim” if you sink past your knees or higher. The more you spread out your weight across the surface, the harder it will be to sink. Bend and float on your back while you slowly and carefully kick and wiggle your legs to help them float toward the surface (the small movements introduce more water into the dense sand below, helping to free your feet from the sandy suction). Soon, you’ll be floating on top of the quicksand. [6] X Research source Once your legs are free, inch yourself to safety by using your arms to slowly and smoothly propel yourself backward. Move your arms in a sweeping motion, almost as if you were swimming a backstroke . Tip: If you have a walking stick, lay it on the surface of the quicksand horizontally behind you. Flop onto your back on top of it for extra support and to keep your hips from sinking further while you slowly pull your legs free. Take short breaks if you need to. Fighting quicksand can be exhausting, so conserve your energy and remember to use small motions. You’ll definitely get dirty doing this, but it’s the quickest and safest way to free yourself."

      "content": "Roll onto firm ground when you reach the edge of the quicksand. Rolling keeps your weight widely distributed so you won’t get re-stuck. If you stand up too soon, you risk planting your foot back into the quicksand and having to start your escape all over. Leave your shoes and other belongings behind if necessary.

      "content": "Look for rippled or spongey looking patches of ground. Be on the lookout for ground that appears unstable and wet, or sand that has unnatural looking “ripples” in the texture. You should be able to see water seeping up from below the sand, making quicksand quite visible if you're on the lookout as you're hiking around. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the ground in front of you with your walking stick. Always bring a hefty walking stick, both to use in case you become stuck, but also to tap the ground in front of you as you walk. A few seconds with a walking stick could be the difference between a messy wrestling match with a pool of quicksand and a safe hike. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Quicksand is a mix of sand (or silt), water, and air that appears solid but collapses under any weight or stress.",
      "content": "Quicksand is a mix of sand (or silt), water, and air that appears solid but collapses under any weight or stress. Normally, roughly spherical grains of sand are packed tightly together with only 25-30% of the total volume taken up by voids or spaces between them, which can fill with air or water. With quicksand, however, the grains are more elongated than spherical. This means anywhere from 30-70% of the total volume is taken up by voids between the grains, leaving them vulnerable to shifting quickly when pressure is applied. [10] X Research source Think of quicksand like a house of cards—the space taken up by emptiness or voids is much greater than the space taken up by the actual cards (or in this case, grains) that are touching each other. Quicksand can be so sensitive to pressure or vibrations that just a 1% increase in stress can cause it to suddenly liquify. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Quicksand forms worldwide in areas where water and loose sand mix. While quicksand is not a unique kind of soil, it can form anywhere groundwater mixes with sandy soil, creating a distinctive soupy mixture. Learning to anticipate places you might encounter quicksand is the best way to avoid becoming entangled in it. Quicksand most commonly occurs in: [12] X Research source Tidal flats Swamps and marshes Near lake shores Near underground springs Beaches and riverbanks during low tide The downwind side of desert dunes (possibly; this type of “dry” quicksand has so far only been found in laboratories) [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Quicksand isn't very dangerous but can be fatal if you’re stuck for long. Unlike in Hollywood, it’s extremely unlikely you’ll drown in quicksand; it’s typically not deep enough (only a few inches or feet at most), plus it’s almost impossible to sink all the way under unless you’re panicking (quicksand is about twice as dense as a human body, meaning you can float in it). [14] X Research source If you step in deep quicksand, you’ll usually only sink to your waist or mid-chest because of your buoyancy. [15] X Research source However, if you’re stuck and exposed to the elements for a long time, you can suffer from dehydration, heat exhaustion, or hypothermia (all of which can be fatal after enough time). [16] X Research source If you’re stuck near a riverbed or shoreline, you also risk potential drowning if water flows and rises over the quicksand. Additionally, the pressure of the sand can shut off your blood flow and potentially cause nerve damage, numbing your legs and making it far more difficult yourself without help."
