      "content": "Think about what you’re looking for in a relationship. As you grow, you may find your priorities and desires shift over several weeks, months, and years. Imagine where you want to be several months or years from now, and decide if a Fwb is a good fit for that lifestyle. [1] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. If this isn’t the case, then you may need to rethink your relationship. [2] X Research source Don’t feel like you have to make a relationship decision overnight! It isn’t easy figuring out what you want, and it may take you several weeks or months before you can figure out what lifestyle is best for you. If you’d prefer a more monogamous, committed relationship, you may need to redefine the terms of your relationship with your friend. Reader Poll: We asked 659 wikiHow readers about what they wanted from their romantic life, and only 8% of people said they enjoyed periods of casual dating without building any lasting connections. [Take Poll] So if your ultimate goal is to move from casual to committed, you’re not alone there (and your feelings are valid)!"

      "content": "Schedule an in-person meet-up to discuss the situation. Call or text your friend and see if they’re available to meet. In-person conversations are tough, but they say a lot about how much you value the other person. Choose a time and a place to meet so you can talk in person. [3] X Research source A good segue to this conversation might occur if your friend texts you asking for a hook-up. For instance, you can say something like: “Hey, are you free today? I was wondering if you’d like to grab lunch at the food court, since I wanted to talk to you about something.” You can also say something like: “Sorry I didn’t reply to your text earlier. I can’t make it tonight, but I’d like to meet up with you sometime so we can talk about a few things.” Reader Poll: We asked 949 wikiHow readers about how they’d prefer to end a very casual or short-term relationship, and 64% agreed that it’s okay to end these types of romantic connections over text or phone. [Take Poll] Note: this should only apply to very casual or short-term relationships though. If there was genuine intimacy or the two of you got to know each other, you should break up with them in person."

      "content": "Discuss any new circumstances that are ending the relationship. Be honest about what’s been on your mind—if you’ve found a serious, monogamous partner, be sure to mention that person. If you need some time by yourself, or feel like you and your friend have different priorities, be honest about those feelings. Don’t try to brush your thoughts and feelings under the rug, or the break-up may seem harsh or not genuine. For instance, you can say something like: “For a while now, I feel like we’ve had different priorities in our friendship. You only text me at night when you want to hook up, and I’m just not getting much out of this anymore.” You can also say something like: “I’ve really appreciated your companionship, but I’ve started a serious relationship. For my emotional health and yours, I don’t think we should hook up anymore.”"

      "content": "Stress that you really value their friendship. This may seem like a cliche thing to say, but it’s a cliche for a reason. Describe how much your friend means to you, and that you aren’t looking to end the friendship. Explain that you’d still be interested in texting and hanging out without hooking up. For instance, you can say something like: “I’ve always treasured our friendship, and I really mean that. You’ve gotten me through countless obstacles, and I don’t know what I’d do without you.” You can also say something like: “I know it’s cliche, but I really do want to stay friends. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I don’t want to lose that.”"

      "content": "Focus on the future when you end the relationship. Talk about how you’ve been looking to the future a lot, and how a Fwb doesn’t fit with your priorities or goals. Mention that being friends with benefits is something fun and short-term that you’ve enjoyed a lot, but not something that’s a huge priority for you anymore. Additionally, stress that you want your friend to be with someone who has the time and energy to dedicate to a fulfilling relationship. [4] X Research source For example, say something like: “You’re a really great person, and you deserve to be with someone who views you as a top priority in their life. I have a lot going on in my life right now, and I can’t be that person for you anymore.”"

      "content": "Stick to your guns if they try to bargain with you. Don’t falter if your friend starts getting really emotional. They may start making demands or promises to change, but do your best to put your foot down. Keep emphasizing that this relationship isn’t good for your emotional health, and that you need to take a step back for yourself. [5] X Research source For instance, you can say something like: “I really appreciate your willingness to change, but I’m not looking to fix or salvage our relationship right now.”"

      "content": "Don’t try to dictate their emotions. Even if it’s not a committed or monogamous relationship, a Fwb can offer a lot of close, emotional ties. It’s normal for your friend to feel angry or sad that the relationship is ending. Don’t try to take those feelings away from them, or tell them that their emotions aren’t valid. Instead, try to be as comforting and understanding as possible. [6] X Research source Instead of saying “I don’t get why you’re so upset about this,” says something like: “I’m really sorry to spring this on you. I know that this is upsetting, but this decision is what’s best for you in the long run.”"

[7] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. After making such an emotional declaration, your friend will probably have questions about why you’re ending the relationship, and ask if there’s anything they can do. Answer their questions honestly, and give them space to air out their thoughts. [8] X Research source For instance, if they say something like “I don’t get why you’re doing this,” you can say something like: “I don’t want to pretend that I know what you’re feeling, but I get that you’re really hurt right now. I don’t expect you to understand my reasoning, but it’s really important to me that you respect my space.”"

      "content": "Allow yourself to grieve the end of the relationship. A Fwb relationship may not be the same as a committed, monogamous partnership, but there are still a lot of emotions involved. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel sad that the relationship is over, even if you’re the one ending it. [9] X Research source Talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you’re feeling. They can offer support and help remind you that you made the right choice."

      "content": "Keep texting or hanging out with them to stay friendly. Offer to hang out if the break-up conversation doesn’t go that badly. Texting and spending time together as friends may help you adjust to the new state of your relationship without focusing as much on the break-up. For instance, you can offer to grab lunch or see a movie with your friend as a casual, non-sexual outing."
