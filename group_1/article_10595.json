This base of your car is also referred to as your \"chassis.\" Open the Spawn Menu of Gmod by pressing and holding the Q button. In this menu, you should see an extensive list of props that can be used in this game. [2] X Research source Browse your available props until you find a chassis that will suit your purposes. If you spawn a prop you have decided will not work for your vehicle, you can hover your cursor over the prop you wish removed, opening the context menu by pressing C , and selecting \"Remove\" from the drop-down menu.

      "content": "Investigate suitable wheels for your vehicle. You will need at least four wheels for making your car, but once you've become more comfortable with the physics behind car creation in Gmod, you may want to add more to your design. Look through your wheel choices by opening your Spawn Menu. Press Q , and from list that appears, choose the \"Tools\" option. Under the \"Construction\" heading in Tools, you should find the \"Wheel\" option. [5] X Research source Select this to look through potential wheels you might use. Spawning causes your wheels to weld in place, either to the ground or the object the wheels have been spawned against. You may want to wait until assembling your vehicle before spawning your wheels. In the event that your wheels don't work for your situation, keep in mind you can alter the wheel model in the context menu by hovering your mouse over the part, holding C , and selecting \"Model\" from the dropdown menu.

[7] X Research source You will also need thrusters to steer your vehicle. Open your Spawn Menu by pressing Q , open \"Tools\" from the Spawn Menu, and look under the \"Construction\" heading for a list of potential thrusters. [8] X Research source Spawning your thruster will also cause it to affix either to the ground or an adjoining prop. You may want to wait until you begin assembling your vehicle before spawning your thrusters."

While you are holding your chassis in the air, right-click your mouse to freeze the object in mid-air.

Choose the wheel you have decided upon to activate your wheel attachment gun. Aim your wheel gun at the corners of your chassis. You should see a translucent wheel appear where your gun is aimed. To attach the wheel, shoot your wheel gun by left-clicking and your wheel should attach to your chassis."

When you approach your wheel with your in-game character, you will be able to adjust the wheel settings by pressing and holding C and entering your context menu. These variables can be adjusted to your preference, but your torque should be about 2/3's your friction. The friction rating of your wheels will influence your car's sturdiness, and higher wheel torque will give your car more speed. Setting your friction too high may affect your car's top speed. Keep your \"Force Lift\" set to zero, or your wheel may fall off."

You can attach your thrusters by left-clicking while hovering your cursor over the part of your chassis to which you wish to attach them. You can use your thrusters to control turning by placing one on each side of your vehicle. You may have to experiment with positioning, as an improperly placed thruster might cause your vehicle to flip. After attaching your thrusters, you will need to set keys to activate these parts. Do so by hovering the part with your cursor, holding C to open the context menus, and selecting the \"Keypad\" option. Consider the following key-binds for your thrusters: Right thruster: Forward: → Reverse: ← Left thruster: Forward: ↑ Reverse: ↓"

Too much force will make your vehicle difficult to maneuver, but too little force (or a high friction setting for your wheels) will severely limit your speed.
