      "content": "Remove the condom correctly. A used condom still poses the risk of pregnancy and illness. Don't spill everywhere. You don't want to spend twenty minutes cleaning up, much less eighteen years raising a child. Remove the condom so that fluids do not spill. If you're not careful, removing a condom will make a big mess, and possibly increase the risk of unwanted pregnancy or infection. Pay attention to what you're doing to avoid mishaps. For a male condom, remove with the tip pointed down. If you pull off just by the ring of the condom, it can come off inside-out. Pull from the tip, and gently ease the ring off. Condoms with a reservoir tip are specially designed to help retain fluids at the tip of the condom, and they may help during this process. For a female condom , squeeze and twist the outer ring so that the fluids do not leak out. Pull the condom out gently. The inner ring of the female condom should help to hold any fluids in.

All should be disposed of in the same way. They go in the garbage. With condoms, there's no real way to avoid the landfill. Get a biodegradable latex condom or lambskin condom if you're worried about the earth. [3] X Research source Latex condoms are the most common. They are durable and inexpensive when compared to other condoms. However, some people are allergic to latex condoms. Polyurethane is stronger than latex and can be made thinner. They are a suitable replacement for people with latex allergies. However, they are more brittle and expensive than latex condoms. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Nitrile feels a bit like latex and is relatively inexpensive. This material works very well for female condoms. Polyisoprene is relatively new material. It is made by putting latex rubber through a process to remove allergens. It is expensive, but it is still, though rare, possible to be allergic to it. Lambskin condoms are able to prevent pregnancy , but not HIV. Natural membrane condoms are not proper protection from sexually transmitted infections. Those seeking to prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases should choose a latex, polyurethane, nitrile, or polyisoprene condom."
