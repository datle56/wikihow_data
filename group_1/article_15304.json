      "title": "Rest the shoulder for 24-48 hours after you first injure it.",
      "content": "Rest the shoulder for 24-48 hours after you first injure it. Strained and tensed muscles need rest to recover and repair damaged tissues. Avoid overexerting yourself or putting any unnecessary stress on your shoulder muscles for the first day or 2. [1] X Research source hhttps://health.clevelandclinic.org/shoulder-pain-3-most-common-causes-and-how-to-fix-it/ For example, avoid lifting heavy objects or using repetitive movements (e.g., a hammering motion) while resting. This will help to reduce inflammation in your injured shoulder. Note that excessive rest is not advisable, since mobilization of the joints and muscles is important to promote good blood circulation. Avoid resting for more than 48 hours straight."

      "title": "Keep the shoulder elevated for the first 48 hours to reduce inflammation.",
      "content": "Keep the shoulder elevated for the first 48 hours to reduce inflammation. Use several pillows or a cushion behind your upper back to prop up your injured shoulder. Elevation helps with inflammation, as the effects of gravity help to pull down excessive fluid and blood that are lodged in a certain area, thus promoting proper circulation. [2] X Research source If you’re lying in bed, elevate your back at a 45-degree angle for the most comfort."

      "title": "Apply cold packs to the affected shoulder during the first 24 to 48 hours.",
      "content": "Apply cold packs to the affected shoulder during the first 24 to 48 hours. Apply the cold pack for 15-20 minutes at a time, repeating this process about 3-4 times each day. Wrap the cold pack in a towel or cloth before applying it to your shoulder. [3] X Research source Cold temperatures cause the blood vessels to narrow, which can help to control muscle inflammation in the shoulder. By minimizing inflammation, further damage to the shoulder can be prevented. Note that cold packs are usually only beneficial for the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury."

      "title": "Use heat packs on the affected shoulder after 48 hours have passed.",
      "content": "Use heat packs on the affected shoulder after 48 hours have passed. After applying cold packs for the first 24 to 48 hours, the next step is to apply warm packs to promote muscle relaxation. Apply the warm pack for 15-20 minutes at a time and repeat the application 3-4 times each day as needed. [4] X Research source Warm temperatures help to dilate blood vessels and improve blood circulation to the shoulder, minimizing inflammation and damage. Be careful that the warm packs are not too hot, otherwise they can burn your skin."

      "title": "Massage the shoulder",
      "content": "Massage the shoulder to relieve soreness and relax your muscles. Using your fingers, apply minimal to moderate pressure on the affected muscle and move your fingers in a circular motion. If your injury is in a location that’s hard to reach, have a friend or family member massage the muscle for you. [5] X Research source If you can’t have someone massage the shoulder for you, place a tennis ball inside a sock and push the ball up against a wall with your shoulder muscle. Then, move up and down while pressing the ball against the wall to massage your muscle. Massage can be performed several times daily or as needed. You can also seek the services of a professional massage therapist to treat your shoulder pain."

[11] X Research source If you experience severe pain and inflammation of your shoulder or you are unable to move your shoulder, go to the nearest hospital, as the radiating pain may be a sign of an impending heart attack.
