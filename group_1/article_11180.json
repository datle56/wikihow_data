Look for leaves that are visibly broken, along with leaves that show signs of disease. [1] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. Take a pair of bypass pruners and clip these leaves down so they only stick 2 in (5.1 cm) out of the ground.

      "content": "Cut back your irises after several frosts have occurred. Check on the weather reports throughout the week. Specifically, wait for the first few frosts to arrive, which will kill off most of your iris foliage. Once most of your leaves look brown and dead, set aside some time to trim your plants. [3] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Make a note on the calendar each time a frost occurs. Once 3-4 frosts occur, you can get ready to cut back your irises."

      "content": "Trim away the entire iris plant so only 2 in (5.1 cm) stick up from the ground. Take a pair of bypass pruners and cut straight across each iris leaf. Leave about 2 in (5.1 cm) of leaf sticking out of the ground, so the plant’s roots don’t have to expend energy keeping the leaf alive. Repeat this process with all of the other iris plants in your garden.

      "content": "Make angled cuts on the sides of your trimmed irises to create a fan shape. Cut along the left and right sides of your trimmed iris plants at a 45-degree angle, which creates a fan shape. [5] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. This helps make your irises look more uniform, and can prevent diseases from spreading on the leaves. This is more effective if you have a lot of irises in your garden. If you only have a few irises, it won’t make a huge difference if you fan the leaves or not."

This time period is the best, as your irises won’t be as likely to develop any bacterial rot.

[8] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. Don’t divide your irises in winter—at this point, they’re just starting regrowth, and dividing them will cause a setback."

[12] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source The goal of this process is to split apart individual rhizomes, which will make your irises easier to replant."

If the plant looks healthy, set it aside for replanting. [13] X Research source Watch out for iris borers, which are white worms that feed on irises. Unhealthy or rotted rhizomes tend to have a foul odor, and may feel really light or hollow. If you’d like to go the extra mile, you can sanitize your shears or cutting tool with a mixture that’s 9 parts water and 1 part bleach. This will kill any potential bacteria and make the division process more sanitary."
