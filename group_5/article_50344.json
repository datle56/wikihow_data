      "content": "Set \"Normalize maximum amplitude\" to -10.0 dB. That is the recommended number, but don't adjust it much lower than -10 or the audio may sound noticeably quieter. Don't set it too much higher than -10 either, since it may cause distortion when you try to increase the bass. When you're done, click \"OK\"."

      "content": "Drag the handle next to \"Bass (dB)\". Increase it, then click \"Start Playback\" to test the sound. If it sounds distorted, adjust the handle. Increase the treble if you'd like, but preferably not as much as the bass. If you like how it sounds, click \"Apply\" and then press \"Close\". If it doesn't have enough bass, set it the highest you can without making distortion, then repeat the above process. Repeat those steps over and over again until you get the desired bass."
