      "content": "Give yourself and the catfisher an opportunity for closure. Let your catfisher know what you’ve discovered, and that your relationship is over. Explain that you’re hurt and confused by their behavior, and give them a chance to be honest and drop the facade. Even if they refuse to drop the ruse, let them know that they’re out of your life. [8] X Research source You might say: “I reverse searched some of your profile pictures and saw that they all came from stock photo websites. I know that you’re catfishing me, and I’m breaking things off. Still, I’d appreciate an explanation as to why you lied to and deceived me for so long.” “Cut the act, Jason—I know you’re catfishing me. This relationship is over, but I’ll give you one chance to come clean and explain yourself.” Confronting your catfisher is a really personal decision, and you definitely don’t have to reach out if you don’t feel comfortable. Remember—they’ve already wasted enough of your time, and you don’t owe them anything!"

Before blocking your catfisher on every possible platform, take a look at their friends lists and followers to see if you share any mutual contacts. It could be worth sending a quick warning message to these people to let them know that their “friend” isn’t who they say they are. [9] X Research source “Hey Cassie! I saw that you were following the account “itzjamie123xoxo” on Instagram. I recently discovered that they’re a catfisher, and I just wanted to give you a heads up.” “Hi John! Sorry for the random message—I saw that you follow @katie0157543 on Twitter. I just wanted to let you know that she’s a known catfisher, and that you might want to cut ties.” Don’t bother messaging mutual friends that you met through your catfishers.
