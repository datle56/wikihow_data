      "content": "Be prepared beforehand. Test your music player's volume and set up your headphones before you go into the classroom. Move the earphones about a foot away from your ears, and if you can still hear the music, it is too loud. Also, you want to keep it on the quiet side so if the teacher says something to you, you'll hear her\\him"

      "title": "Conceal your headphones.",
      "content": "Conceal your headphones. The savvy listener knows a couple ways to hide the cord and headphones for the best camouflage. Run the cord through your shirt or shirt sleeve, and out your collar. Put an earbud into the ear that is facing away from the teacher and conceal it with your hair or a hoodie. If you don't have long hair, turn the earbud upside down and wrap the cord behind your ear. Run the headphones up your sleeve. Keep them in your sleeve, and not in your ear. Then, simply put the sleeve up to your ear and lean on that arm. Use a cordless Bluetooth headset. If your music player supports Bluetooth, these headphones can be very small and easily hidden under your hair."
