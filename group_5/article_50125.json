      "title": "Admit you have sinned and repent to seek God’s forgiveness.",
      "content": "Admit you have sinned and repent to seek God’s forgiveness. We’re inherently flawed, and that’s why you’re challenged with temptation each and every day. You’re faced with countless decisions, and it’s okay if you make a mistake as long as you’re willing to admit it. [1] X Research source Before you can fully let Christ into your life, you must recognize your wrongdoings—you must repent. [2] X Research source Repenting is the process of changing your mind and attitude to own your mistakes to live a forgiving, welcoming, and understanding life. Recognizing sin within yourself isn’t easy. Remember, change can’t happen if you refuse to admit your mistakes. [3] X Research source Allow yourself to feel everything. Owning your mistakes can bring up past traumas and emotions, but God will help guide you. Don’t be afraid to sit in difficult feelings because they can help your faith grow. Remember, “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:8–9). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Believe that Jesus died to save you from your sins.",
      "content": "Believe that Jesus died to save you from your sins. To be saved by the Lord, you must believe in Him. God sent His only son to die on the cross so you can be free. He loves you regardless of if you’ve sinned, and recognizing and accepting this wholeheartedly is the next step to letting Jesus into your life. [5] X Research source Review the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ in the New Testament’s Gospels Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Keep in mind that “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16)."

      "title": "Confess your sins",
      "content": "Confess your sins openly and honestly to God through prayer. Repentance and confession go hand-in-hand. You’ve admitted your mistakes and believe that Christ has given you the choice to be better, so now it’s time to apologize by praying. Repent your sins by saying “I’m sorry” to God and those you may have hurt. [6] X Research source You might pray, “Lord, I believe you love me. Please forgive me of my sins, and help me become a better person. Amen,” or “Dear God, I’m a sinner and need your forgiveness. I believe Jesus Christ shed His precious blood and died for my sin. I’m willing to change and turn from my sin.” [7] X Research source God knows all, so be sincere in your apology. If you’re not ready to apologize, take a few steps back until you’re ready—Christ will still be there for you when you are. Don’t forget, “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9)."
