      "content": "In general, Aries and Aries make a good match. They’re bold, active, and straightforward, so this couple will never have to wonder what each other is feeling. They're confident and ambitious, which sometimes gives them the reputation of being impulsive, competitive, or selfish. Another Aries can appreciate a good competitive streak, though, and an Aries pair will enjoy pushing each other to succeed. Energetic and uncomplicated, they’re innovative and brave and know exactly what they want. [1] X Research source Aries’ competitive drive can cause friction with others and they’re known to be hot headed at times. Under their fiery and direct persona, though, Aries can be very affectionate and tender."

      "content": "In the bedroom, Aries share some passionate chemistry. This sign is known for its high libido. Aries are naturally athletic, energetic, and physical thanks to their Mars ruler and few others in the zodiac can keep up! Expect hot chemistry and feverish passion when two Aries collide in bed for the first time. If both Aries make an effort to consider their partner’s needs in the heat of the moment, they can build a fulfilling, long term sexual relationship. Both Aries should remember that sex isn’t a competitive sport. Being on top, dominating, or looking for ways to constantly “win” sex can lead to friction and arguments after the first spark fades. Aries are into themselves and can be extremely impatient. They want immediate gratification. [2] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. Both partners run the risk of being selfish in bed if they don’t acknowledge each other’s physical and emotional needs."

      "content": "Two Aries understand each other’s emotional needs. Aries express love through encouragement and loyalty over romantic words. Their softer side can be hard to find or understand, but another Aries will know there is a warm and passionate lover underneath their hard exterior. Short tempers and arguments are common between Aries, but they forgive and forget very easily and quickly without holding grudges. [3] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Aries don’t like wading through complicated emotions and one or both might bail on the relationship when hardships come up. This is why hot flings between Aries are common, but longer relationships are tougher. Some Aries find it hard to stay strong and independent enough in a relationship. When they encounter an obstacle to their freedom, they might make like a ram and batter through a breakup."

      "content": "Communication between two Aries is crystal clear. They leave nothing up to interpretation, but their blunt style can lead to heated arguments. There’s never a dull moment when two Aries are talking—their conversations are fast-paced, stimulating, and cover a million different topics. Even if they’re both incredibly intelligent, Aries can come off thick headed or stubborn because of their need to be right. If they feel like they have something to prove, a lively conversation can quickly turn into a fight complete with yelling and door slamming (at home or in public!). It can be hard for two Aries to get along if they don’t share the same opinions. Both will need to slow down and try to understand the other to keep the peace. When prompted, Aries make their feelings crystal clear. They have a natural courage to tell you how they feel and can’t hold things back or keep things secret for very long.

      "content": "Aries are very honest and intuitively trust each other. They can easily detect lies when one partner gets overly defensive or angry (more than usual, that is). One partner might be dishonest when they fear the hotheaded reaction of the other and vice versa. A pair of Aries will need to work on calmly accepting things they don’t want to hear to encourage full honesty. Aries sometimes lack tact and their impulsive reactions make it unpredictable how they’ll respond to a hard truth. Aries can be so honest and direct that they end up hurting each other with their words. They prefer this over being lied to, but the resulting arguments can be intense. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "This relationship has a solid foundation built on many shared values. Aries will support each other’s ambitions and adventure together. They’re energetic and both enjoy physical activities like walks, sports, sex, and dancing. They’re essentially down to do anything together as long as it’s exciting and counteracts their restlessness. In terms of values, two Rams will almost always be on the same page since they understand each other’s need for independence and expect the truth, honor and respect. Any way to get their aggression out is where two Aries can bond. They may be playing video games, practicing MMA, or watching or participating in sports, or channeling their energy into creative pursuits like acting, singing, theater, public speaking, or social media.

      "content": "If Aries can cool down and compromise, they’ll be in it for the long haul. The challenge is keeping things fresh, adventurous, and sexually satisfying after their first burst of passion simmers down. Variety is a must since this sign craves new things and experiences. By pushing each other to succeed and keeping their temper in check, these Rams can build a solid foundation for a lasting, fulfilling relationship (with a little bit of head butting here and there for fun). An Aries-Aries fling is more common than a serious relationship. Both partners need to commit to each other to make it past the honeymoon phase."

      "content": "Selfishness is the most likely reason an Aries pair won’t last. Aries rules the 1st House of the zodiac (the House of Self), so they can be incredibly self-absorbed. An Aries will need to compromise and put the needs of the relationship over their own to make things last. Both partners hate backing down or losing, but if they can agree to prioritize listening and communication, they can make things work. There will be lots of fighting in an Aries-Aries coupling. If an Aries is fighting, they fiercely love their partner but may need to find better ways to understand or express it.
