    {
      "title": "Note her Passive (Shadow Combo).",
      "content": "Note her Passive (Shadow Combo). Whenever Karina hits the enemy more than twice, the third attack deals extra damage that is balanced by 7% of the enemy's lost HP. Additionally, she will reduce her skill cooldowns (minus her Ult) by 1.5 seconds. Creeps are dealt 2000 true damage if they are focused on. [1] X Research source This passive will help intensify your attacks on enemies through time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make use of her 1st skill (Dance of Blades).",
      "content": "Make use of her 1st skill (Dance of Blades). Karina will speed up herself by 45% and her twin blades will twirl for 3.5 seconds. While this occurs, she will block all basic attacks and deal up to 200 magic powers to those attacking her. Once she is finished (or uses Shadow Assault), she will deal up 255 magic power and slows the enemy for one second. [2] X Research source Use this skill to initiate an attack on an enemy. The enemies' first instinct will use their basic attack on you. Before you know it, you'll be killing the enemy with ease!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use her 2nd Skill (Dance of Death).",
      "content": "Use her 2nd Skill (Dance of Death). Karina will brandish her twin blades and deal up to 600 magic power to enemies around. [3] X Research source This is a simple skill for Karina, but use it while combining it with Dance of Blades to enhance her attacks. Also, you can advantageously use her skill as her main damage skill - this will deal magic damage to multiple enemies at once! Feel free to upgrade this skill throughout the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Manage her Ult (Shadow Assault).",
      "content": "Manage her Ult (Shadow Assault). Karina will automatically charge at a selected enemy hero and creates a Shadow Mark for the enemy. She also leaves a shadow form behind it, with both forms lasting five seconds. If she decides to use her skill again, Karina will immediately go to her shadow form and deal 250 magic power to enemies near her path. [4] X Research source This is a useful ult that can be immobilized during a team fight. This ult will reset itself if you successfully kill an enemy, increasing the chances of earning a killing streak (Maniac/Savage) during a game."

    {
      "title": "Select an emblem.",
      "content": "Select an emblem. Although many would go for the Assassin emblem, it's best to go for the Mage emblem due to her magic damage. Upgrade Flow and Observation to increase her power, and finish it off with Magic Worship to kill enemies easily. If you want to quickly get equipment while jungling, choose Mystery Shop. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a battle spell.",
      "content": "Choose a battle spell. Depending on your playstyle, you can choose Retribution to jungle with creeps in the early game and use the battle spell to increase Karina's power. As a bonus, select Flicker to launch her attacks earlier to blink/chase enemies, or select Execute to kill enemies if her job is not complete. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick her equipment.",
      "content": "Pick her equipment. To start enhancing Karina, buy Arcane Boots (Ice Hunter when jungling) to increase her magic penetration. After that, buy Shadow Twinblades to enhance magic lifesteal/power, Calamity Reaper to deal basic attacks with magic, Divine Glaives for magic penetration, and Lightning Trucheron/Blood Wings for extra damage. As an alternative, add in Winter Trucheron if you are nervous about getting killed easily. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Note any alternatives to Karina.",
      "content": "Note any alternatives to Karina. Karina could potentially be banned for her status as a Meta Hero. For similar heroes that deal magic damage as an Assassin, choose Selena/ Gusion /Aamon, or go for similar heroes with the Reap specialty, including Natalia/Saber."

    {
      "title": "Counter Karina, if needed.",
      "content": "Counter Karina, if needed. If she is not stopped, Karina could potentially be unstoppable. It's best to choose heroes that have high CC/burst damage heroes to counter her - including Eudora (for her lightning combo), Franco (his hook), Balmond (hard to stop with his lifesteal), and Lylia (dealing enough damage will let her regenerate HP and her damaging skills are a factor)."

      "title": "Focus on the red/purple buff in the early going (if you are jungling).",
      "content": "Focus on the red/purple buff in the early going (if you are jungling). This is important as the buffs will temporarily enhance her stats. The purple buff will also lower the cooldown of her skills and increase her mana regen. You can also focus on the turtle once it spawns. Once you finish killing at least five creeps, start slowly killing enemies in the Mid/Gold lane. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Use her ultimate with grace in the mid-game.",
      "content": "Use her ultimate with grace in the mid-game. It's best to rotate through lanes and kill creeps to quickly gain experience, although stealing the buffs from the enemies is a good task. If Karina becomes a main target, use Dance of Blades to escape from enemies. She also needs to wait for teammates/tanks prior to attacking for kills. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Combo Karina's skills.",
      "content": "Combo Karina's skills. A notable combo for Karina is Dance of Blades + Basic Attack + Shadow Assault + Dance of Death. Use Dance of Blades to initiate the attack, then attack with her basic attack. Quickly then select Shadow Assault twice, and if the enemy is still there, finish it off with Dance of Death. Implement this combo during a team fight and use it to kill Marksmen/Mages with ease."
