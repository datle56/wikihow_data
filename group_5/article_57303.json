      "content": "Geminis hate being tied down, so let your guy roam free for a while. Even though it might be the last thing you want to do right now, constantly calling or texting a Gemini man could push him away. Instead, give him a bit of the cold shoulder. Since Geminis are so friendly and outgoing, there’s a good chance that he’s going to contact you first—and when he does, you can show him exactly what he’s missing. Geminis are known for being indecisive. Even if he broke things off with you and promised that you’d never see him again, you can still expect him to call or text you at some point. Geminis are ruled by planet Mercury, the planet of communication.

      "content": "Pique his interest and start a conversation at the same time. If he’s taking a little too long to reach out and you’re tired of waiting, try texting him something that seems like it wasn’t meant for him. Send a message that sounds intriguing so he’ll want to ask you about it. Quickly follow up with an “Oops! Sorry,” message to make sure he knows it was just a mistake. “I can’t believe it either! Last night was so crazy!!” “Oh sorry, wrong person.” “I had such a good time last night. Thanks again.” “Oops, that wasn’t meant for you.”"

The more you keep to yourself, the more he’ll want to talk to you to solve your mystery. Keep some things to yourself and don’t be forthcoming about your plans whenever you talk to him to leave him wanting more. “I’m traveling all next week, so I probably won’t be around to chat much.” “I’ll talk to you later!

      "content": "Keep yourself busy to make your Gemini man miss you. Since Geminis are so indecisive, don’t be surprised if your guy reaches out to see when you can hang out next. If that happens, tell him that you’re a little busy, but you can maybe squeeze him in. He’ll wonder what you’re doing (and who you’re doing it with) when he’s not around. “Sorry, I’m actually busy all day Friday. What about Saturday?” “Ooh, I’m all booked up that weekend. Can you do next week?”"

      "title": "Remind him of you to make him miss you.",
      "content": "Remind him of you to make him miss you. Geminis tend to move on quickly, and they often need tangible reminders of the person they’re with. You can ensure that you’re in his head by leaving a small item of yours in his home the next time you’re there. When he texts you about it, you can thank him for wanting to return your item and then strike up a fun conversation. Try leaving something small, like a bracelet or an earring. You could also use the item you left as an excuse to reach out to him. A simple text like, “Have you seen my watch?” is a great casual opener to get you two talking again."

      "content": "Make your Gemini man jealous to miss you even more. While Geminis can be hard to tie down, they definitely value monogamy.
