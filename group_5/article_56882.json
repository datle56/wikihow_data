      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/gas 4). Turn on the oven before you do anything else. This way, it will have a chance to come up to temperature. If your oven runs a little hot or a little cool, make the appropriate adjustment. After this, you can start getting ready to make the cookies."

If this is going to take some time, make sure to turn off the oven, then go and buy or borrow what is missing. Never leave an energized oven unattended ."

      "title": "Cream the butter and sugar.",
      "content": "Cream the butter and sugar. Make sure that the butter has come to room temperature so that it can hold air. This will result in a lighter and fluffier mixture. If it is not at room temperature, you can microwave the butter for 10 seconds at a time on 30% power until it has softened sufficiently. When you can easily push a fork into the butter, it is ready to be creamed. Add the softened butter and the granulated sugar to a a large mixing bowl (at least 2 quarts/1.9 liters). Starting at a medium speed, use an electric mixer to blend the butter and sugar. Continue until the mixture is smooth and well-blended. Avoid using a high speed as this will add air to the mixture and change the consistency of the cookies. If you use warmer or melted butter, the cookies will struggle to lift and lighten, resulting in a cakier texture, reminiscent of a brownie."

      "content": "Add eggs and extract. Mix on low speed with the mixer until the mixture is smooth and there are no clumps of sugar remaining. Add each egg, one at a time, fully mixing each in before adding the next. This ensures even distribution of ingredients and prevents the dough from becoming too dense in one area. Pause your mixing occasionally to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. This ensures that all ingredients are fully integrated into the dough."

      "title": "Combine the dry ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, mix flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder using a whisk until well-combined. The mixture should look like light brown flour. If either your cocoa powder or your flour appear clumpy, sieve them into the bowl. This helps break up any lumps and will aid you in distributing all ingredients evenly throughout the mixture. Use measuring cups and spoons to precisely measure out each dry ingredient, making sure to level off each measurement with a straight edge (table knife or similar). Avoid vigorous stirring, as dry ingredients will fly out of the bowl and make a mess while changing the proportions of each dry ingredient. As you mix, look to distribute the color of the cocoa powder evenly. This will aid even distribution of the dry ingredients throughout the mixture."

      "content": "Add the pre-mixed dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix on low speed until a soft dough forms. If the dough seems too dry and crumbly, add a tablespoon of water at a time until the dough reaches a soft, slightly sticky consistency. If it's too wet, add a little more flour, a tablespoon at a time."

      "content": "Drop 28 heaped spoonfuls of the cookie dough onto ungreased baking trays. Space each clump of dough about 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart. The cookies will expand in the oven, so these gaps allow them enough room to spread. Keep the spoonfuls uniform in size. To finish preparing the dough, round and flatten each mound with your fingers to create cookies of uniform shape."

      "content": "Put the baking trays in the oven and bake your cookies for 10 minutes. Judge if they are done by the color of the edges. It should just be beginning to turn golden brown. Once you take the trays out of the oven, press your finger (or a utensil) lightly on the surface of one of the cookies. If they are fully cooked, the edges will be firm but the centers will feel slightly softer and spring back when touched. The centers will firm up as the cookies cool. Don't press too hard, as this will deflate your cookies. Do not wait for the centers of your cookies to turn a darker brown before taking them out of the oven — only the edges. This will ensure you don't burn them. Look for light cracks in the tops of the cookies. These indicate that the tray is likely ready to be taken out of the oven."

      "content": "Serve your cookies fresh out of the oven. Other Serving Ideas: Top with a scoop of vanilla or coconut ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate sauce and a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes if desired. A glass of warm milk or an assortment of fresh fruit also complement the flavor of these cookies admirably. If you're partial to a sundae, crumble the cookies over layers of ice cream, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and shredded coconut and top with fresh fruit. Make cookie sandwiches by spreading a layer of coconut cream or chocolate ganache between two cookies. Roll the edges in shredded coconut or chocolate shavings. Alternatively, store the cooled cookies in an airtight plastic container and keep them in a cool, dry place for later. Do not store cookies in freezer."
