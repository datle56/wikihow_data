      "content": "Red If there were only one color Aries could choose out of all of them, it would be red! Red is the epitome of all things Aries : passion, fire, and an energy quite like no other. [1] X Research source It also symbolizes courage, excitement, and love, so it’s no wonder an Aries thrives when surrounded by this warm hue. If you’re an Aries, reach for red any time you can. Red is deeply associated with power—think of “red carpet status,” the dream of driving a red sports car, or a bold red lip on a woman—so it can be seen as a power color for Aries in more than one way."

      "title": "Orange",
      "content": "Orange While orange may not be quite as intense as red, it is still a fiery shade that complements the aspects of this fire sign. [2] X Research source Orange is warm and enthusiastic, and will encourage any Aries to embrace their adventurous side."

      "title": "Yellow",
      "content": "Yellow Yellow is a color associated with joy and optimism. [3] X Research source Those who fall under the Aries sign are considered to be boundless with energy, and yellow is a symbol of that triumphant nature. When it comes to yellow, gold can be placed in this category as well. Whenever an Aries opts for gold, successful energies are likely to follow."

      "title": "Pink",
      "content": "Pink Pink is another great color for tapping into Aries’ affectionate and passionate side, especially when it comes to romance. [4] X Research source It encourages self-expression, tenderness, and love—all things Aries excel exceptionally at."

      "title": "White",
      "content": "White White may seem a little more subdued than the other colors in the Aries palette, but Aries’ adventurous spirit is closely aligned with the purity, clarity, and fresh beginnings that are associated with white. [5] X Research source Much like a blank canvas awaiting a burst of color, white is the clean slate that Aries is ready to take on with new challenges. Because Aries are typically go go go, white can come in and bring a little more focus and guided intention to Aries’ high energy."

    {
      "title": "Blue",
      "content": "Blue When you think of extinguishing a fire, which element do you imagine using to do it? You probably said water, and as you may have guessed, blue is the color most associated with water. In terms of an Aries, blue will act similarly to water putting out a fire—it will dampen and put out the flame. [6] X Research source We don’t want that! We love Aries for who they are, so keeping their flame burning is essential."

      "title": "Black",
      "content": "Black While signs like Scorpio may thrive with the energies associated with black, it’s quite the opposite for Aries. When too much darkness is around Aries, they can feel weighed down, held back, and drained. [7] X Research source Other dark colors that are similar to black, like dark brown, may evoke the same energy as black, so these should be avoided, too."

      "title": "Grey",
      "content": "Grey Gray might look great as a contrasting color next to reds and oranges, but when it comes to the energy of an Aries, gray should be kept as far away as possible. Like a rainy day, gray is associated with low enthusiasm and a lack of energy, which is the exact opposite of Aries. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Paint your walls with warm shades. If you’re an Aries, consider swinging by the warm tones next time you’re in the paint department. All of those vivacious shades of reds, oranges, golds, and pinks may be the inspiration you’ve been needing to give the energy in your home a facelift. If painting your walls hot pink or fire red sounds a bit intimidating, don’t worry about trying to go as bright as possible. You can find shades in these color families that are more on the subdued side such as salmon pink, muted berry shades, and light corals. Use furniture to control how much warmth you want the room to have. For example, if you opt for a red shade on your walls, select white furniture to offset the brightness a bit. Accent walls are game here, too! A pop of color on one wall is a great way to add visual interest to your space while still evoking Aries energy."

      "content": "Incorporate your power colors at work or in your office. For most of us, we’re at work or in our offices more than we’re actually home. This means that your work space is one of the most important places when it comes to creating a balanced energy. For Aries, figuring out ways to sneak warm colors into your office may be a fantastic way to set yourself up for success and keep you focused to achieve your own goals. Swap out your plant vases for red, orange, and yellow shades, utilize colored picture frames, purchase warm-toned office supplies whenever you can, and decorate the space in the hues that feel inspiring and comfortable to you."

      "content": "Integrate shades of red, orange, and yellow into your wardrobe. Whether you’re dressing down for a night in with friends, going all out for a night on the town, or getting ready for work, selecting Aries power colors can boost your confidence and have you feeling ready to take on the world. Adding a classic red blazer, tie, belt, or shoes to your ensemble may be all you need to get yourself feeling motivated. If you’re dressing for work and are worried about reds and oranges being too loud, add small accents of color here and there. For example, you may accent an outfit with a red pair of earrings or watch."

      "content": "Accent whites with pops of fiery colors. Since white is one of Aries’ main power colors, playing up white outfits in any setting is to your advantage.

      "content": "Consider a red lip if you’re feeling bold. Aries’ number one color is red, which helps to bring out the confident nature that resides with the fire sign. [10] X Research source When an Aries has a red lipstick in their arsenal, their energy becomes a force of nature that exudes bold confidence, passion, self-expression, and ambition. Choose a red lip color based on what looks best on your skin tone. While anybody can rock a red lip, certain shades and undertones better compliment specific skin tones."

      "content": "Aventurine Sure, aventurine is a green crystal and green isn’t one of Aries’ power colors, but this stone is believed to bring forth good fortune, inspire leadership, and cultivate prosperity. [11] X Research source Aries already has a keen focus on all of these goals naturally, so the properties of this crystal mesh beautifully with the confident leadership of an Aries. Aventurine is also said to encourage inner harmony by stimulating the heart chakra, so this may help soothe the fire within an Aries when things get too intense. [12] X Research source By bringing peace to some of that heated energy, Aries are more capable of achieving their goals with ease and focus."
