      "content": "Lengthen your garage to create a larger workspace. Does your garage tend to double as a home workshop? When you lengthen your garage, you create a lot more room for your tools and equipment. This type of extension can also provide more storage space, or help convert your garage into another living space. For instance, you might lengthen your garage to make room for a home gym."

      "content": "Widen your garage to fit more cars. Parking space is essential to any home, especially if you’re getting a new car. Transform your one-car garage into a two-car garage, or widen your garage slightly to give your car a little more room. A small extension can help if you store bikes and other outdoor equipment in your garage."

      "title": "Raise your garage height to fit bigger vehicles.",
      "content": "Raise your garage height to fit bigger vehicles. A typical garage is great for basic vehicles, like sedans and SUVs, but likely won’t be tall enough for a trailer or RV. A taller garage can also fit a car lift, which makes working on your vehicles much easier. Garage height extensions are great if you don’t have enough space to extend in other directions."

      "title": "You can, but it requires a lot of construction and planning.",
      "content": "You can, but it requires a lot of construction and planning. First, you’ll need to hire an engineer to inspect your current garage—they’ll let you know if the frame and foundation can support an extra extension. Then, ask a contractor to inspect and reinforce the garage’s foundation if needed. At this point, hire building professionals to complete the renovations, who can make sure the addition is up to code. [1] X Research source For instance, your base garage needs a 5 ⁄ 8 in (1.6 cm) layer of drywall added along the walls and ceilings when an addition gets installed."

      "content": "Yes, you can definitely transform your garage into more living space. You might turn your garage into a studio apartment, or convert it into a home gym.

      "title": "You’ll probably need a permit, but it depends on where you live.",
      "content": "You’ll probably need a permit, but it depends on where you live. Meet with a local government employee to see what specific permits you’ll need—different cities, states, provinces, and countries each have unique zoning requirements. Schedule an appointment at your local government office; when you meet, let them know what kind of project you’re planning. They’ll tell you what type of zoning or building permits you’ll need, and give you specific applications to fill out. In Prince William County, Virginia, you need a building permit and zoning approval to extend your garage."

      "title": "Ask your county or local government for specifics.",
      "content": "Ask your county or local government for specifics. Zoning requirements aren’t universal, and your project requirements will definitely depend on where you live. Stop by your local government office—an employee there can let you know what is and isn’t allowed. In Fremont, California, you can extend your home up to 10 ft (3.0 m) from the back property line, as long as your expansion doesn’t take up more than 30% of the backyard."

      "content": "The average garage extension costs over $12,000. When you break it down, garage extension projects are a combination of materials and labor. Certain materials, like brick and metal, are significantly more expensive than other building materials, like wood. Additionally, bigger projects, like converting a one-car garage into a two-car garage take more time to complete, and cost more than a smaller add-on. [4] X Research source The pricing will ultimately depend on the contractor you work with. Scout out different quotes online before committing to a specific builder!"

If you’re expanding and converting your garage into a different space, you may need extra professionals to finish the job, like carpenters and electricians. For large-scale jobs, like an addition, you might also hire an architect or designer to draw out the extension plans. [5] X Research source"

Before construction really gets underway, to ask your contractor for an estimate. [6] X Research source For example, it takes a lot longer to build with brick than concrete."
