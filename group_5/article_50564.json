    {
      "title": "Complete a Master Dungeon to receive a loot drop.",
      "content": "Complete a Master Dungeon to receive a loot drop. Each time you complete a dungeon in Destiny 2, you receive loot. Master Dungeons are more difficult, but they offer some of the most powerful loot in the game. These loot drops are where you may find pieces of Artifice Armor. Defeating the following dungeons may lead to a drop that includes Artifice Armor: Duality Dungeon Grasp of Avarice Spire of the Watcher Note that Master Dungeons are only available to players who purchased Destiny 2. They are not included in the free-to-play version of the game."

    {
      "title": "Ensure you have access to the Duality Dungeon.",
      "content": "Ensure you have access to the Duality Dungeon. To access the Duality Dungeon, you need a dungeon key or The Witch Queen Deluxe package. Even with access, you may need to wait for the dungeon to become available in the pinnacle rotator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter Duality with a fireteam of 3.",
      "content": "Enter Duality with a fireteam of 3. You will want as much firepower as possible when taking on the Master Duality Dungeon. Never enter the dungeon alone, as even the most powerful or skilled of players will stand little chance. Remember to run the dungeon on Master difficulty. If you are having trouble, you can run just the last encounter on Master difficulty, but this may lower your odds of receiving Artifice Armor. Ideally, all players will have a power of 1600 or above."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure at least one player has a void weapon.",
      "content": "Ensure at least one player has a void weapon. The Bellkeepers in the Duality Dungeon have a void shield that cannot be taken down without a void weapon. In the timed portions of the dungeon, the player with the void weapon will need to stay behind and kill all of the Bellkeepers before a wipe is triggered, erasing your team's progress. Wipes are detrimental to your success in the Duality Dungeon. While wipes can be overcome, a more successful run will lead to better bounty at the end (i.e. Artifice Armor)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to the Champions you encounter on your first run.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the Champions you encounter on your first run. You are likely to die on your first attempt at the Duality Dungeon. This is because the Champions rotate from season to season, and each Champion can only be defeated with a specific weapon. Once you recognize the Champions you will be encountering, update your loadout accordingly. While most enemies need to be defeated, note that it may be possible (and more effective) to ignore certain enemies, particularly those that appear in the Nightmare realm."

    {
      "title": "Defeat Caiatl to receive your loot.",
      "content": "Defeat Caiatl to receive your loot. Caiatl is the last stage of the Duality Dungeon. Ironically, the boss may also be the easiest. Once you have taken down Caiatl and rung the three bells, you will receive a drop. If your run was successful, this drop will likely include a piece of Artifice Armor. Consider adding the Classy Restoration mod to your loadout as part of this final stage. Repeat the dungeon as often as you need to collect additional pieces of armor."

    {
      "title": "Ensure you have access to the Grasp of Avarice dungeon.",
      "content": "Ensure you have access to the Grasp of Avarice dungeon. The Grasp of Avarice requires the 30th Anniversary Pass. Even with access, you may need to wait for the dungeon to become available in the pinnacle rotator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run the dungeon on Master Mode.",
      "content": "Run the dungeon on Master Mode. You can only run Grasp of Avarice on Master Mode when it is available as a rotating dungeon (roughly every 3 weeks)."

    {
      "title": "Enter the dungeon with a fireteam of 3.",
      "content": "Enter the dungeon with a fireteam of 3. The Grasp of Avarice is highly difficult on Master Mode, so you will want a full team of players to fight alongside. Ideally, all players will have a power of 1600 or above."

      "title": "Defeat the final encounter for double loot.",
      "content": "Defeat the final encounter for double loot. What makes the Grasp of Avarice so great for farming Artifice Armor is that the dungeon's final boss will always drop double loot when defeated. Your chances at a piece of Artifice Armor are therefore doubled! [1] X Research source Repeat the dungeon as often as you need to collect additional pieces of armor. The Grasp of Avarice is also where you are most likely to find the Twisting Echo cloak in Destiny 2."

    {
      "title": "Ensure you have access to the Spire of the Watcher dungeon.",
      "content": "Ensure you have access to the Spire of the Watcher dungeon. This dungeon requires a dungeon key or The Witch Queen Deluxe package. Unlike the Duality and Grasp of Avarice dungeons, you can load up the Spire of the Watcher dungeon at any time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reach the Ascend the Spire checkpoint.",
      "content": "Reach the Ascend the Spire checkpoint. The Spire of the Watcher dungeon is surprisingly straightforward, even on Master Mode. Be sure to enter with a fireteam of 3, and progress past the jumping puzzle, at which point you will encounter a white circle on the floor, with the spire in the distance. Ideally, each member of your team will have a power of 1600 or above."

    {
      "title": "Ascend the Spire.",
      "content": "Ascend the Spire. There is no time limit on this final stage of the dungeon, so most fireteams should be able to handle it. Take your time and reach the top of the spire to retrieve your loot, and hopefully some Artifice Armor alongside it. Repeat the dungeon as often as you need to collect additional pieces of armor."

    {
      "title": "Artifice Armor includes an extra seasonal mod slot.",
      "content": "Artifice Armor includes an extra seasonal mod slot. Although powerful, Artifice Armor offers nearly identical protection to armor from regular dungeon drops. Its differentiating factor is the extra mod slot it offers players each season. The armor is therefore perfect for players who would like to tailor their loadout a bit more. The armor is otherwise just a fun challenge for those who want to farm Master Dungeons."
