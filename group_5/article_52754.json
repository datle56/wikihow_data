Move your cursor to the extreme left edge of the page, over the narrow vertical strip. Click this to expand the multireddit tab. This tab is not accessible from anywhere besides the front page. If you are using a mobile app to view reddit, these links may be in a different place. Browse the options or ask for help on the app's forums."

Type in the name of any subreddit and press enter. Repeat this with any number of subreddit names. As you add each subreddit, you should see its posts appear on your multireddit feed. That's what multireddits do: combine posts from multiple subreddits into one feed. There's no need to include the \"/r/\" at the beginning of the name. Once you've entered one or two subreddits, the page will suggest more subreddits under the \"people also added\" heading. Click the + icon next to a name to add it, or click the name itself to visit the subreddit in a new tab."
