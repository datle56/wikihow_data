      "content": "Stolen Device Protection bumps up the security of your iPhone. With iOS 17.3, you can add an extra layer of protection and security when you take your iPhone to unfamiliar locations (away from home or work). If your device is stolen or misplaced, this feature places additional requirements to access personal information, which can deter thieves. [1] X Research source For example, to access your stored credit card information or passwords, you must supply your Face ID or Touch ID; there's no way to use an alternative (such as a passcode). A security delay is also placed on your device. Actions like changing your Apple ID password will now be delayed by an hour, followed by another Face or Touch ID request. This security delay gives you enough time to lock your stolen device and secure your Apple account. For a complete list of the features, see this section ."
