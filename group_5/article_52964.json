      "content": "Shower her with compliments and admiration. Leo women are known to be creative and have a distaste for the status quo. Praise her uniqueness and her artistry and you'll instantly get in her good graces. Just make sure you're taking the time to find something to admire about her that truly makes her special. If your compliment is superficial or fake, she'll see right through it. If she likes you, a Leo woman will return your admiration tenfold. According to psychic astrologer Stina Garbis, you should be ready for her to \"constantly compliment you, buy you things, and show off and brag.\" [1] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021.

      "content": "Let her be the center of attention. Leo is a sign that tends to thrive in the spotlight. Outgoing and social, the lioness is the life of the party. The two of you will get along great if you let her take the lead and are comfortable hanging in her shadow a bit. [2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. This doesn't mean you should be a wallflower, though!

      "title": "Take the initiative and ask her out.",
      "content": "Take the initiative and ask her out. She might be pretty bold and outgoing, but when it comes to love, a lioness is usually more cautious. In the beginning, when you're first getting to know each other, she'll tend to be very protective and watch over herself. At the same time, a Leo lady isn't going to wait around forever—if she suspects that you're going to ask her out and you don't, she'll get bored and move on to someone else. Romancing her and whispering sweet nothings can make her feel vulnerable—and a lioness isn't always so comfortable with vulnerability. Keep your game in check and avoid saying \"I love you\" until you know you mean it."

      "content": "Treat her to the finer things in life. Leos are known for their love of luxury. The lion is the king of the forest and Leo ladies are zodiac royalty with extravagant and regal taste. It's not just about a hefty price tag or a trendy brand, though—the lioness needs her possessions to have meaning as well. This means you can't just shower her with random gifts and expect to win her heart. Instead, show that you've put thought into your gift and chosen something with a message that she'll think about every time she sees or uses it. For example, you might get her a signed first edition of her favorite book or a beautiful hair clip that's the same color as her eyes. You can still land a Leo lady if you're on a budget—just think about quality over quantity when it comes to buying her things. She'll be happier with something that has meaning and significance than something that's merely expensive."

      "title": "Give her plenty of attention.",
      "content": "Give her plenty of attention. The typical lioness is very proud, but her pride disguises a delicate ego that can quickly become damaged if it's neglected. The result? She'll likely get sulky and distant at first, then eventually lash out. She might come across as needy to some people, but as long as you're not ignoring her, she'll be the most affectionate, doting, and supportive person you know. If you give her lots of attention, she'll give you lots of attention too. Psychic astrologer Stina Garbis notes that Leos \"are the most affectionate sign in the zodiac. They are friendly, generous, love to touch, and are not shy about public displays of affection.\" [3] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021."

      "content": "Indulge in playful, childlike moments with her. A Leo woman often enjoys poking fun of you in harmless ways or engaging in a little gentle teasing to make you smile. Once she's comfortable with you, expect the teasing to become more regular. She's light-hearted and playful and loves to get silly. Doing childlike activities with her will bring out her playful side and can be a great way to win her heart. For example, you might take her to the circus or the zoo. Better yet, invite her out to the park on a hot summer day and carry along an arsenal of super-soakers. Follow up with an ice cream cone or a trip to the candy store."

      "content": "Show that you put thought into the dates you plan. When it comes to dates, a Leo lady typically isn't one to be impressed by a haphazard \"Netflix and chill\" type of evening. She wants to see that you believe she's worth putting out some effort to create a meaningful and magical evening. A Leo lady is sure to love anything that she can tell you put thought into, such as a homemade card or love letter taped to her door or red roses tucked under her desk at work. According to psychic astrologer Stina Garbis, the way to get a Leo woman's attention is to \"show her that you are investing time and resources into her.\" [4] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 14 February 2022.

      "content": "Carry a conversation with confidence and curiosity. The typical Leo lady is sharp, quick-witted, and funny. She wants to be with someone who's sensitive and intelligent and can keep up with her. Expect her to pepper you with questions and be ready with some of your own to show that you're interested in her unique perspective. Because she loves the spotlight, you'll also win points if you give her short answers and then follow up with a question to turn the focus back on her."

      "content": "Act assertively with self-assurance. A Leo woman has a reputation for being a strong, confident woman and she wants an equally strong, confident partner by her side. She's not all that fond of shrinking violets—she wants someone who isn't afraid to speak their mind and stand up for themselves. Leo women are drawn to confidence, so if you exude confidence you could already be halfway to winning her heart. Show her that you're willing to take the lead when she wants to take a step back and she'll see that you have what it takes to be a true partner."

      "title": "Respect her independence.",
      "content": "Respect her independence. A Leo woman needs to be in control of her own life, even when she's in a long-term, committed relationship. Expect her to have her own interests and her own group of friends that she likes to hang out with on her own from time to time. Be independent yourself and she'll never be worried that she's neglecting you while she fulfills her own dreams. [5] X Research source While you can give her advice or suggestions, be careful about trying to impose your beliefs on her or tell her how she should act or what she should do—she'll rebel against that. Maintain control over your own life so your Leo lady never feels as though she has to take care of anything for you. If she suspects that you've become dependent on her, she'll likely get bored pretty quickly. She wants a partner who can handle things on their own."

      "content": "Let her have space when her temper flares. Leo ladies have some pretty intense emotions and can definitely get hot-tempered and dramatic when they're angry. If you do something to rub her the wrong way, the best thing you can do is offer a genuine apology and let her have some time to herself to cool down. She'll return feeling much more balanced and affectionate towards you. Leo women are usually pretty good at regulating their emotions on their own, they might just need a little time to get things under control. Keep in mind that in a Leo's mind, she's right about whatever it is. Avoid blaming her or trying to point out where she was wrong—that'll just get her more enraged."

      "content": "Encourage her to open up to you about her insecurities. Remember that delicate ego? While a Leo woman might be all boldness and bravado on the outside, on the inside she can be quite sensitive and shy. It takes a lot to get her to open up because she can be very timid about exposing her vulnerability, but it'll be well worth it in the end. If she trusts you and cherishes you with a passion, there will be no secrets between the two of you. Continually let her know that you appreciate her for who she is and don't care about the superficial trappings, such as money or style, that everyone else might focus on."

She's in her element when she's showing kindness and caring to others—in fact, she can get so caught up in giving that she might forget herself entirely. She also loves to give to people in need, whether they're friends, family, or complete strangers. Make sure you're just as open and generous with her as she is with you so she won't ever feel slighted or like she's doing all the giving and getting nothing back."

      "content": "Treat her family with love and respect. For a Leo lady, family is wrapped up in survival, making it very important to her. These are people she knows she can always count on to support and uplift her—people she knows will always be in her corner. If you really want to make a relationship with a lioness work long-term, her family will have to love you at least as much as they already love her. Many Leo ladies also prioritize building a family of their own. Even if you don't think you're ready to have kids yet, hear her out with an open mind and understand that this is important to her."

      "content": "Show your willingness to compromise when you don't see eye to eye. A Leo lady has a reputation for being stubborn and tends to believe that she's always right. This can make her a tough one to get into a disagreement with because she'll dig in her heels and refuse to yield until you somehow see the light. If you demonstrate early on that you have no problem meeting her halfway, she'll tend to be more agreeable to finding a compromise. If you're the type of person who always has to get your way, you and a Leo woman are unlikely to make it long-term. She needs someone who can go with the flow and doesn't mind following her lead sometimes."

      "content": "Indulge in a little spontaneity to keep her on her toes. Leo ladies tend to get bored pretty easily—they're not fans of the same routine day in and day out. If you really want to keep the spark alive, you have to be able to surprise her every once in a while. Wait until she thinks she's got you dialed in, then hit her with something completely unexpected. For example, if the two of you normally go out to eat on a Friday night, you might surprise her with a home-cooked meal that's ready when she gets home from work. Spontaneous road trips or mini-vacations are great options to reignite the flame when you feel things getting a bit stagnant between the two of you."

      "content": "Leo women are most compatible with Gemini, Sagittarius, and Libra. Air signs Gemini and Libra are light-hearted, fun, and outgoing, so they'll definitely capture a Leo lady's attention. As air signs, communication will be strong with these couples. Fire sign Sagittarius also enchants the lioness with their passion and sense of adventure. [9] X Research source Leo ladies tend to get along with other fire signs Aries and fellow Leos, but usually connect with them more as friends than as lovers. They often have so much in common that they can clash—especially when both want to take the lead or be the center of attention."

      "title": "Leo women tend to clash with earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn).",
      "content": "Leo women tend to clash with earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn). Putting together a grounded, practical earth sign with a flamboyant, dramatic Leo woman will often result in fireworks—but not necessarily the fun kind. Their values are just so opposing that they have a difficult time understanding each other. This isn't to say that a Leo woman can't make a relationship with an earth sign work, but both have to be prepared to let go and compromise—something a lioness can find difficult to do. Leo ladies don't usually get along great with water signs (Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio) either. They're far more reserved and she can get bored by their homebody ways. And when she finds herself irritated, a sensitive water sign is likely to be hurt by the hot temper of a lioness."
