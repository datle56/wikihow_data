Starting from the Pokémon League, travel along the mountainside (below where the two Veterans are) until you find a Zoroark. Then, follow the Zoroark—it’ll take you to a staircase within a cave, which leads to N’s Castle. [1] X Research source"

These Pokémon will both be level 70, so make sure your team is strong enough to take them on. This shouldn’t be a problem, however, considering you’ve already become the Pokémon Champion."

Once you’ve successfully defeated N’s Zekrom or Reshiram, the dragon will disappear and become a Dark Stone (Zekrom) or Light Stone (Reshiram). At this point, N will instruct you to take the Stone to Dragonspiral Tower, allowing you to battle and catch the Legendary Pokémon for yourself. You’ll get the Light Stone/Reshiram if you’re playing White 2 and the Dark Stone/Zekrom if you’re playing Black 2."

Continue battling the Pokémon until it’s low enough to catch. Be forewarned, though—it will likely take many tries before you successfully catch it! [4] X Research source"

Unfortunately, Black 2 and White 2 only let you catch one of the dragons—Reshiram if you’re playing White, and Zekrom if you’re playing Black. While Nintendo no longer supports the Global Trading System for these games, it’s still possible to trade with a friend using the game’s IR or local wireless technology. [5] X Research source Infrared (IR): You and a friend both open up the C-Gear in your game on your DS/3DS. Position your DS systems so your game slots are each facing one another; then, tap IR along with “Trade.” Local wireless: Head to the top floor of any Pokémon Center within the game and interact with the NPC on the left side of the screen. Then, enter the Union Room. If your friend does the same thing in their game, you both should be able to trade."

If you still have a Master Ball on hand, use that to catch your Zekrom or Reshiram—with its guaranteed catch rate, it’ll make your battle a cinch. If you don’t have one available, stock up on Ultra Balls. Timer Balls can also be handy, though they’ll be more effective in a battle with countless turns."

Putting a Pokémon to Sleep makes it a lot easier to catch, so make sure to have a Pokémon on your team that knows a Sleep-inducing move like Hypnosis, Sleep Powder, Grass Whistle, or Spore. [6] X Research source Freezing a Pokémon also makes it easier to catch, but it’s a lot easier to Sleep a Pokémon than it is to Freeze it. [7] X Research source Moves like Blizzard, Ice Beam, Ice Fang, and Ice Punch all have a 10% chance of inflicting the Frozen status effect. [8] X Research source Whatever you do, steer clear of moves that inflict Poison or Burn on the Pokémon. These will cause continuous damage that will eventually make the Pokémon faint."
