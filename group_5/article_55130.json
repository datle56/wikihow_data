      "title": "Embrace her directness.",
      "content": "Embrace her directness. Aries are usually thought of as a masculine sign, regardless of gender. So your woman in waiting is likely to have some brusque tendencies—directness, energy, a temper perhaps—in addition to her feminine traits. The first step in getting an Aries to fall in love with you is to understand, accept, and cherish her domineering tendencies. Accept her way of doing things, especially in the beginning. This can be tough if you also like to have things your way. If she doesn't get to decide what she wants to do because your ideas are different from hers, the chemistry between you too is likely to suffer. Go with the flow. [1] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Let her be rowdy. Remember the tactful little lady that Audrey Hepburn always played in old movies? That is, most definitely, not your average Aries female. She may talk loud, swear, or act boisterously, but you have to be there, at her side, trying not to wilt under the pressure. A tough act, but a rewarding one."

      "title": "Engage her competitiveness.",
      "content": "Engage her competitiveness. Aries women are fiercely competitive. This competition plays itself out in the workplace (where she's usually angling to get a promotion, or at least win the support and admiration of her peers) as well as in her day-to-day life. So how do you begin to attract an Aries woman? Stoke her competitiveness! Play games with her. Bring a set of cards when you go to a bar and challenge her to a game of Rummy ; or bring 8 dice along and play a game of Liar's Dice . Whatever you do, don't just let her win ; she wants the satisfaction of knowing that she beat you when you were giving it your all."

    {
      "title": "Get active.",
      "content": "Get active. It's a must. Aries are extremely active signs, preferring the rough and tumble of physical adventure over the easy predictability of domesticity. In order to click with an Aries, you need to enjoy that side of yourself. Gone are the days of sitting in front of the TV on Fridays and Sundays; get ready to meet mother nature and sweat like a sow. The romantic stereotype is a walk on the beach, but Aries might rather go kite-surfing instead. Or how about an impromptu swimming challenge past the breakers and back? Go on jogs and runs with her. Yoga and Pilates are rather tame, so try to pick something with a little more verve—something that really gets her heart pumping. Many Aries love rock-climbing . Play and watch sports with her. Aries is likely to embrace any opportunity to watch sports and especially to play them—and the more competitive, the better. Challenge her to a one-on-one game of basketball, or go watch a hockey game or roller derby bout together."

      "title": "Indulge her impulsive side.",
      "content": "Indulge her impulsive side. Aries will often act before they think. That can sometimes lead to a little trouble, but Aries love the adventure of wriggling out of trouble, too. Don't be afraid to act on your impulsive side, or accept hers, when you're around her. Many Aries can't stand a partner who doesn't know how to fly by the seat of their pants from time to time. Take her on an unplanned date. Try showing up unannounced and whisk her off to a sculpting class, followed by a bar. If she, on the slim chance, has other plans or isn't ready to jump down the rabbit hole, shrug it off and try again another time. Don't take it as a slight against your character."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be confident (or pretend to be).",
      "content": "Be confident (or pretend to be). Aries find it hard to understand why other people are shy. They're confident and direct, communicating their feelings easily and readily, and they respect people who do the same. If you're a shy one, don't put your shy side front and center during the first couple of dates. It's not that she can't love it; it's that she simply doesn't understand it. If you can show her in the beginning that your shyness doesn't define you, there's a chance that she can learn to live with it, and love it."

    {
      "title": "Give her freedom and independence.",
      "content": "Give her freedom and independence. Aries need to feel that they are free to do anything they want, even if that's not strictly the case. [2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Don't cling to her like a squid to its prey. Keep her in your sights and engaged, but never smothered. As soon as you complain that she hasn't made enough time with you or is hanging out with another guy too much, you've stifled her sense of freedom. Lover beware. Don't rush her into the relationship. If you two are doing things together but haven't begun calling yourselves a couple, don't sweat it. It'll take her time to come around, most likely. Even if she isn't calling you a partner, you're benefiting from the arrangement. Don't forget that."

      "title": "Be prepared for a passionate, but straightforward, sexuality.",
      "content": "Be prepared for a passionate, but straightforward, sexuality. Aries women tend to know what they want. They don't debate the intricacies of sex like other signs do, even if they enjoy it very much. Aries women will be straightforward with you. They'll tell you want they want and expect to get it, unless you can give them a really good reason why it's a bad call. Aries can have an emotional selfishness which can sometimes detract from the spiritual nature of sex. If you're expecting sex to be a tantric fusing of two persons' souls, expect again. Aries probably has a different idea of what it is. On the other hand, many Aries have a romantic side to their personality, one that juts out from their other tendencies. If you learn to nurture this romantic side, which you will as time goes on, you can generally expect sex to look a lot different from how it was in the beginning."

      "title": "Never make things more complicated than they need to be.",
      "content": "Never make things more complicated than they need to be. Aries is nothing if not uncomplicated. An Aries won't try to play mind games with you. An Aries won't expect you to know something without first telling you. An Aries won't belabor the meaning of love if it doesn't mean something practical to her at the end of the day. Learn to understand this part of her personality, and be the same way with her. Be direct and straightforward. [3] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Keep things simple—but that doesn’t mean avoiding discussing your feelings when you have them. Be upfront with how you feel, but don’t dwell on your emotions or overthink things too much."

      "title": "Take risks with her.",
      "content": "Take risks with her. Be spontaneous and exciting, but make her feel like she's there with you for each step of the way. Tap into that adventurous, inner-child spirit that she gets along with so well and don't be afraid to take risks. Travel with her. Nothing says romance more to an Aries than the adventure of travel. Being in a novel place, with different sights, sounds, and customs, will help fuel the fire of her passion. Just make sure she's ready to take the jump with you. Start a whole new career path or direction in life. Although this is more for you than for her, it can feel like it affects her more than usual because she likes to experience adventure vicariously when she's not experiencing it firsthand. Just be sure the new change in direction is good for you, too. Be selectively liberal with the money that you spend. The key word here is \"selectively.\" Aries are notoriously spendthrift, so try to balance out her freewheeling wildness with a little bit of tact, but be sure to let loose on occasion. It'll help make her feel validated."

      "title": "Bounce back from crises and setbacks.",
      "content": "Bounce back from crises and setbacks. Since Aries are often bold, bossy, and boisterous, you're inevitably going to get into arguments with her, or see things a different way. [4] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021. Try to be calm and forgiving throughout the entire argument. If you reach an impasse, give her an out: say something like \"Let's talk about this when our tempers have cooled.\" Don't take any wrenching personal attacks to heart; she's impulsive and wants to win at any cost. She may have to learn how to compromise if your relationship is to thrive. Many Aries see compromise as \"losing\" and stay away from it at all costs. Try to patiently convey to her that compromise isn't the same thing as losing—in fact, it's essential to a relationship. Learn to communicate your needs in order to keep the relationship humming. Aries can be blissfully unaware of what your needs are if you don't explicitly let her know. She's direct and communicative, so she expects you to be the same."

      "title": "Aries works exceptionally well with Leos.",
      "content": "Aries works exceptionally well with Leos. Aries women work well with all fire signs, generally, but Leo (July 23 to August 24) excites her most. Both are domineering and alpha-types, but Leo's encouraging and generous nature really makes Aries hum. At times, though, Leo's dramatic nature can butt heads with Aries' more straightforward tendency."

      "title": "Aries works great with Sagittarius.",
      "content": "Aries works great with Sagittarius. (Sometimes, too great.) It's not a match made in heaven, but it works better than most. Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) and Aries share a fierce independent streak, feeding off of one another. But Sagittarians are so independent that they might just out-independent her and walk out before the relationship starts. Still, they're compatible in bed and love each other's sense of humor."

    {
      "title": "Aries works well with Gemini.",
      "content": "Aries works well with Gemini. A great relationship if neither tries to dominate the other, Gemini (May 20 – June 21) and Aries both share a restlessness and sense of adventure. Gemini can be fickle, however, and Aries can cause them to retreat if she's just a little too straightforward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries works well with Aquarius.",
      "content": "Aries works well with Aquarius. Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) enjoys Aries's impulsive nature. They aren't the same when it comes to sex, but are surprisingly compatible sexually. Aquarius might be too distant and introspective for her rambunctious and extroverted tendencies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries works very well with Libra.",
      "content": "Aries works very well with Libra. Because Libra (September 22 – October 23) actually wants to be dominated, Aries' bossiness actually works to her advantage here. Libra gives her the romance she wants, and she gives them the guidance they crave. Still, she can become frustrated by Libra’s indecision."
