Before you begin any type of home treatment for a wax plug, it’s important to determine that you have one. This can help ensure that you don’t use a treatment that could cause harm or that you don’t have another condition such as an ear infection. You can purchase a special light (an otoscope) to look into the ear that is made for people who are not doctors for $10-$30 online or at some drug stores. A family member or friend can help you determine if you may have ear wax by using this tool. [7] X Research source"
