      "content": "Talk to your neighbors. Other people might have seen something. Visit your neighbors and ask if they know anything about the situation. Check whether they know where the owner is and how to contact them. By talking to your neighbors, you also spread the word that someone might be in the house illegally. Not all squatters are dangerous, but your neighbors should nevertheless be advised of who is there. If a neighbor has seen something, have them write down notes about who they saw and when. Ask them to describe the squatters, if they can."

You are not required to speak to the squatters, and you shouldn’t if you are scared of them. It’s enough to record what you have observed and then call the appropriate people. If you’re scared, another option is for a group of neighbors to go talk to the squatters. There’s safety in numbers."

      "content": "Defend against a claim of adverse possession. Some squatters claim that they are now the property owners through a process called “adverse possession.” Adverse possession is incredibly complicated, and very few squatters get ownership of the property this way. Nevertheless, you should be prepared for this defense. To claim adverse possession, the squatter must have continuously and exclusively possessed the property for a minimum amount of time. [3] X Research source The length of time will vary by jurisdiction. Generally, however, they must possess the property for a long period of time, ranging from just a few years to 10 years or more. [4] X Research source The use must be continuous and exclusive . This means they can’t stop by for the summer, stay a few months, and then leave for eight months. They also can’t share the property with someone else, such as the owner. The possession must be open and notorious . This means they can’t hide in the attic for 20 years. Instead, they need to make improvements to the property, such as putting up a fence, or treating it as a regular owner would, by inviting people over. [5] X Research source In many states, squatters must also pay the property taxes. You can defend against adverse possession by disproving any of these requirements. Talk to your neighbors to find out how long the squatters have been on the property, and find proof that they haven’t paid taxes."
