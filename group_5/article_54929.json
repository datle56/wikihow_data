      "content": "Apply an oil-free sunscreen to prevent further scar darkening. Back acne discoloration scars are typically darker than your surrounding skin, and sun exposure can darken them further. So, if your discoloration scars are on your shoulders, the back of your neck, or another area that receives sunshine regularly, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen to limit further darkening of the skin. [1] X Research source Look for an oil-free sunscreen meant for sensitive skin. Oily sunscreens may contribute to additional acne breakouts.

      "content": "Wait it out and let the discoloration fade. The most common type of back acne scar isn’t a scar but post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation—a temporary discoloration of the skin. In most cases, this pink, red, purple, brown, or black discoloration will fade on its own within 12 months. [12] X Research source If you run your fingers over your back and the skin feels generally smooth, most of your back acne scarring is likely post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. However, the only way to know for sure is to visit your dermatologist. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can also occur after cuts, scrapes, and other injuries to the skin, and all the remedies mentioned here should be equally effective in those cases as well."

Many dermatologists offer this treatment, and it’s relatively quick and painless. However, you will experience redness in the treated areas for at least 2 weeks and possibly up to several months. [22] X Research source Non-ablative laser treatments don’t destroy the top layers of skin and instead stimulate new skin-tightening collagen formation from beneath. They’re quick, painless, and leave no redness, but they are only useful for hyperpigmentation or minor scars. It takes weeks to months for the skin to regenerate without the scars, so this isn't a quick fix."

They punch out (remove) the scar tissue, then the area is sutured. The scarring from the sutures will fade over time. [23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Punch grafting includes using skin grafts (usually from behind the ear) to replace the tissue from very large acne scars. While you’re trading one type of scar for another, the suture scarring will usually disappear within several months. Your dermatologist might use dermabrasion treatments to speed the process along."

This is a temporary measure, however, and will need to be repeated every several months for ongoing results.

      "content": "See if subcutaneous incisions help with undulating scars. Instead of cutting down into the skin, subcutaneous incisions (or subcisions) are cut parallel to and just beneath the skin’s surface. This process severs the tissue bands that tether the skin in place, allowing it to rise and smooth out. [25] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This treatment works best on rolling scars that create a wavy texture on your skin. Your dermatologist can perform this procedure quickly using local anesthesia. You can see immediate results with this procedure but may have some minor discomfort and scarring at the small incision sites."

Your dermatologist may give you injections one or more times in their office, or they may give you a steroid cream to apply to the area daily for several hours, then wipe off. Steroid treatments can take several months to be effective. If you are given a steroid cream to apply, follow the application instructions exactly as prescribed."

      "content": "Give dermabrasion or microdermabrasion a try on discoloration scars. Dermabrasion is done under local anesthesia at your dermatologist’s office and involves using a tiny wire brush to scrape away the top layers of your skin. It can remove hyperpigmentation (discoloration) scars, as well as smaller ice-pick and boxcar scars. You’ll likely experience minor pain at the site for a few days and redness for up to several weeks. [27] X Research source Microdermabrasion is more akin to sandblasting and impacts only the very top layers of skin. As such, it is only effective on discoloration scars. It can be done at day spas and medical offices and usually requires several treatments to be effective. You'll have to wait at least a few weeks for the redness to subside before noticing any positive results."
