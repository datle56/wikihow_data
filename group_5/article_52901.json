      "content": "Fit a bandsaw or table saw with a diamond-tipped blade. Ensure that the power saw is turned off and unplugged before you put a new blade on it. Remove any blade that is currently fitted in the power saw and replace it with a diamond-tipped saw blade. [1] X Research source This method works well to cut large agates that you can easily hold on both sides in order to feed it into the bandsaw or table saw. A bandsaw utilizes a long skinny saw blade on a band that rotates around and through a work table, whereas a table saw has a round spinning saw blade mounted in the middle of a work table. Both can be used to cut agates equally well using the same process, so use whichever one you have available. You can buy a diamond-tipped saw blade for either type of saw at a home improvement center, hardware store, or online."

      "content": "Put on safety glasses or goggles and a dust mask. Wear safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes from flying agate particles. Cover your mouth and nose with a dust mask to avoid breathing in any agate dust. [2] X Research source You can get a good pair of safety glasses or goggles for under $10 USD online or at a home improvement center or hardware store. You can get a pack of multiple disposable dust masks starting at under $10 USD as well."

      "title": "Feed the agate straight into the saw blade, holding it flat against the table.",
      "content": "Feed the agate straight into the saw blade, holding it flat against the table. Hold the agate firmly between both hands, leaving at least 3 in (7.6 cm) of space between your fingertips and where you want to make the cut. Press the agate firmly against the tabletop of the power saw, then carefully slide it straight into the blade of the saw to start making the cut. [4] X Research source If the agate is too small to leave at least 3 in (7.6 cm) of space between your fingertips and the saw blade, you can place the agate in a pair of locking pliers and hold the pliers to guide it while you make the cut. Never feed an agate into the saw blade at an angle or you might bend and break the blade. You can cut a whole agate in half by cutting straight through the middle or through the fattest part so the 2 halves have equally-sized faces. You could also cut your agate into multiple slices of about 0.5 cm (0.20 in) or thicker."

      "title": "Look straight at the saw blade while you cut.",
      "content": "Look straight at the saw blade while you cut. Position yourself so your eyes are lined up directly with the saw blade. Don’t take your eyes off the blade until you’re done cutting. [5] X Research source This will allow you to make a straight cut as well as keep an eye on the saw blade to make sure it doesn’t bend."

      "content": "Push the agate carefully into the blade until you cut all the way through. Keep pushing the agate into the blade while holding it firmly against the table to feed it through the blade. Push it all the way through until you cut the agate into 2 pieces. [6] X Research source You can repeat this process to cut the agate into more pieces if you want. Remember to use locking pliers to guide the agate through the blade whenever the pieces become too small to safely hold between your hands."

      "content": "Attach a Dremel diamond blade to a Dremel tool. Change the bit on a rotary dremel tool to a diamond wheel bit. These types of diamond wheels are made for cutting through many types of hard materials, including different types of stones. [8] X Research source This method works well for cutting agates that are too small to safely hold in your hands to guide them through a power saw. You can purchase a Dremel diamond blade at a home improvement center, hardware store, or online. A Dremel tool is a handheld rotary tool that you can attach a wide variety of bits to. It is a good choice for cutting agate when you don’t have a large power saw available or when the agates you want to cut are too small to comfortably cut using a table-mounted power saw. Keep in mind that Dremel diamond blades only come in sizes up to about 3 in (7.6 cm). For stones bigger in diameter you will have to cut them on a table-mounted power saw. You can buy a diamond-tipped saw blade for either type of saw at a home improvement center, hardware store, or online."

Press the spinning diamond blade against the agate firmly where you want to begin the cut. [12] X Research source If you aren’t confident that you can eyeball the cut, you can mark the agate with a permanent marker beforehand to help guide you. You could cut your agate in half by either cutting right through the middle or by cutting through the fattest part. You can also cut an agate into multiple slices of at least 0.5 cm (0.20 in) or thicker if you want."

Go slowly to avoid chipping the stone or heating up the blade too fast. [13] X Research source If you can’t cut all the way through the stone from 1 side, just cut as far as you can, then pull out and turn off the Dremel tool. Rotate the rock 90-180 degrees in the clamp before you continue to cut all the way through."
