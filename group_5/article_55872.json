These attacks often result in severe pain that can generally occur along the right side of the body or between the shoulder blades. This pain is often accompanied by nausea and other stomach discomfort. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A buildup of too much bile in the gallbladder can cause gallbladder attacks. Different people experience gallbladder attacks differently. Although pain typically is on the right side, or between the shoulder blades, it may also feel like low back pain, cramps, or the like."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The attacks often occur in the evening, within hours of eating. Gallbladder attacks are usually a symptom indicating that something else is wrong with the gallbladder. If gallbladder function is compromised and the gallbladder doesn't empty as quickly as it should, a gallbladder attack may occur."

      "content": "Watch for early symptoms. A few of the earlier symptoms of gallbladder disease include gas, burping, belching, heartburn, feeling bloated, constipation or indigestion. These signs can be easy to miss or diagnosed or dismissed as a less serious problem, but early intervention can be key.

There can also be \"twinges\" or pain that feels like gas or cramps in the midsection."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Lighter, loose stools may be the result of insufficient bile. You may also have darker than usual urine with no change in water consumption.

[12] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To determine how effectively your gallbladder is functioning or whether there are large obstructions to the organ, an ultrasound will be needed. The ultrasound technician will check for gallstones, bile flow, and signs of tumors (which are rare). Most polyps found in the gallbladder during the ultrasound are very small and do not need removal. Your doctor may want to monitor smaller polyps through additional ultrasound examinations to ensure they do not grow. Larger polyps generally indicate a greater risk of gallbladder cancer. Removal of gallbladder polyps is at the discretion of your doctor."

[13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The body can function normally without the gallbladder, so do not be alarmed if your doctor recommends its removal. Gallstones are almost never treated with medicine. It takes years to dissolve the stone with medicine, and the stones that can be treated effectively are so small that it almost never worth the bother. Removal of the gallbladder sometimes have side effects, (such as loose stools) but often none at all."
