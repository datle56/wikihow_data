[1] X Research source Do not respond to any of their texts, emails, or website comments. Instead, save all of these communications for evidence. If you see the stalker, try not to show any reaction. The stalker wants to see you react to know they have control. Do your best to present a stone-faced and calm exterior, but don’t beat yourself up if you can’t. Their behavior is not your fault."
