    {
      "title": "Understand who Destroyer is.",
      "content": "Understand who Destroyer is. He is a boss similar to Eater of Worlds, since they both share the Worm AI. However he is much longer and thicker. Each unit of his body has a red flashing light, which eventually detaches and becomes a Probe that fires lasers at you. Once defeated, he drops Souls of Might and some Hallowed Bars."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather equipment.",
      "content": "Gather equipment. Get Titanium Armor/Adamantite Armor with helmet depending on your class choice or Frost Armor/Forbidden Armor if you are able to farm Frost core/Forbidden Fragment. You will need at least 12 greater healing potions, which can be crafted from 12 bottles of water, 12 Pixie Dust, and 4 Crystal Shards."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather weapon.",
      "content": "Gather weapon. For melee users, You could try Adamantite Glaive/Titanium Tridents, Dao of Pow, Hel-Fire or Fetid Baghnakhs. Ranged users can use Onyx Blaster, Daedalus Stormbow, Dart Pistol with Crystal Darts or Dart Rifle with Cursed Darts depending on your world's evil. Most magic weapons that are piercing should be viable for magic users."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spawn him in.",
      "content": "Spawn him in. You need to make a Mechanical Worm, which is crafted from 6 rotten chunks, 5 iron bars, and 7 Souls of Night. He can only be spawned at night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Destroy him.",
      "content": "Destroy him. He spawns off screen, so be ready and waiting. Destroyer likes to get underground and zip up at you at an almost straight vertical angle. From then on, just attack him and his Probes until he dies. If your health gets low, drink a Greater Healing Potion. If your health gets really low and the cool-down for healing potions isn't up yet, then teleport home with Magic Mirror/Recall Potion to the nurse and heal up. Be careful if you do, because he might kill a few of your NPCs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Done!",
      "content": "Done! Once he's dead, he drops Souls of Might, which can be used to craft Excalibur, Megashark, and other useful items.."
