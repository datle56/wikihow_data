      "title": "Cut two pieces of cardboard down to the size you want.",
      "content": "Cut two pieces of cardboard down to the size you want. Use a metal ruler and a sharp craft blade to cut the cardboard. Thin cardboard from the back of a pad of paper or cereal box will work the best, but you can use chip board too. If you are using an old pad of paper, pull the back cover off and cut it in half.

      "content": "Cut some colorful paper to wrap the covers with. The paper needs to be 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) longer and wider than your cover. [2] X Research source You can use any type of paper you want, such as scrapbooking paper, wrapping paper, or even construction paper. For a more unique look, create your design on the computer, then print it out on high-quality paper. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Decorate the paper, if desired.",
      "content": "Decorate the paper, if desired. You don't have to do this, especially if you used paper that's already fancy, like wrapping paper or scrapbooking paper. If you used construction paper or printer paper, consider drawing designs onto it, then coloring them in. Make the front cover fancier than the back cover. Add a title or an image."

    {
      "title": "Glue the paper to the cardboard.",
      "content": "Glue the paper to the cardboard. Turn the paper so that the blank side is facing you. Brush a thin layer of liquid glue (ie: Mod Podge, tacky glue, or white school glue) onto the cardboard. Place the cardboard, glue-side-down, onto the paper. Make sure that it is centered. You can also use a glue stick instead. Smooth the paper down, if needed, with a ruler or credit card. Work your way from the middle of the cover to the outside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clip the corners of the paper.",
      "content": "Clip the corners of the paper. Use a metal ruler and a craft blade to cut the corners of the paper off. Make sure that you cut all the way down to the cardboard. This will help remove bulk and help the paper lay smoother."

    {
      "title": "Glue the edges of the paper down to the inside of the cardboard.",
      "content": "Glue the edges of the paper down to the inside of the cardboard. Turn the cardboard so that the blank side is facing you, and the covered side is facing down. Coat the back of the paper with more glue. Fold it tightly over the edge of the cardboard, and press it down. Smooth the edges of the paper down, if needed. Work your way from the edges of the cover inward. Wipe away any glue that seeps out."

      "title": "Cut paper for the inside covers.",
      "content": "Cut paper for the inside covers. Cut two sheets of paper that are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) than your cover, both lengthwise and widthwise. Try solid-colored paper if your cover is fancy, and patterned paper if your cover is plain. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Glue the paper to the back of each cover. Turn the cover so that the paper side is facing down. Coat your cut paper with glue, then press it down onto the cover. This will cover up the bare cardboard and overlap part of the wrapped edges. [5] X Research source Smooth the paper down, as before, then wipe off any excess glue."

      "content": "Consider sealing the front and back covers. Choose a waterproof decoupage glue, topcoat, or acrylic spray sealer. Spray it onto the front and back cover. Let the sealer dry before moving on. [6] X Research source Be careful if you decorated or printed the paper; the ink may run."

      "content": "Cut 20 to 40 sheets of paper down to same size as the covers. You can use lined paper, printer paper, or even sketchbook paper. Avoid cutting more paper than this, especially if you are using thick sketchbook paper. If you cut more paper, you will need to make a bigger coil, which is more likely to warp out of shape. [7] X Research source If you are using an old notebook, cut the paper in half, and use that instead. [8] X Research source"

Use a pencil and ruler to draw a vertical line down the paper, about 2 millimeters from the left side edge. [9] X Research source You can put the binding along the top edge instead. In this case, draw a horizontal line 2 millimeters from the top edge."

      "content": "Punch your first hole along the center of the line. The hole needs to be to the right of the line so that it's closer to the middle of the paper than the edge. You can make the hole with a thin nail, a 3-millimeter screw punch, or a 1/8-inch (3-millimeter) hole puncher. [10] X Research source Don't use a regular hole puncher. It's too big. If you made a horizontal line, punch the hole below the line instead. You can find these tools in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts shop."

How many times you wrap the wire around the pen depends on how many holes you have. If you have 24 holes, wrap it 24 times. [16] X Research source Trim off the excess wire with wire cutters. Every so often, squish the coils together so that they are nice and tight."
