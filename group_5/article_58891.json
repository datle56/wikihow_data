      "title": "Pay attention if he pressures you to commit.",
      "content": "Pay attention if he pressures you to commit. Your new boyfriend could potentially become abusive if he’s pressuring you to commit early on. Pay attention if he seems to get attached too quickly. Try to slow the relationship down.

      "content": "Notice any jealousy or neediness. Be wary of your new boyfriend if he wants to be in constant contact with you. The attention may feel nice at first, but a boyfriend who checks in on you frequently may be overly dependent or have difficulty with trust.

Follows you, or stops by your house or job frequently."

      "title": "Look for blaming behavior.",
      "content": "Look for blaming behavior. Notice if your boyfriend tends to blame you or other people, particularly old partners, for his circumstances or feelings. Abusers often use this blaming tactic because it allows them to deny any personal wrongdoing. In the future, this could become a way for your boyfriend to control you or justify physical abuse. For example, your boyfriend might say, “You made me angry. It’s your fault because you didn’t do what I told you.”"

      "title": "Watch out for disrespectful language.",
      "content": "Watch out for disrespectful language. Pay attention to how your boyfriend talks to you. If he frequently puts you down, belittles you, or is sarcastic with you and doesn’t listen if you complain about the way he talks to you, he may become even more verbally abusive in the future. Other signs of verbal abuse may include: [2] X Research source Cursing at you. Putting down your accomplishments or goals. Using degrading words to describe your body."

      "title": "Watch out for isolation tactics.",
      "content": "Watch out for isolation tactics. Pay attention if your boyfriend tries to isolate you from friends or family. Abusers will try to diminish your support system and will try to make you feel bad for spending time with others. He may even try to accuse your friends or family of being “trouble” or convince you they’re bad for you. Keep in mind as his behavior escalates, your boyfriend may try to prevent you from using your car, using the telephone, or going to work. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "See how he’s trying to control you.",
      "content": "See how he’s trying to control you. Your boyfriend might try to control you in subtle ways at first, but these behaviors escalate for people who are abusive. There are many ways he may try to control you, but in the beginning he’ll try to convince you that he’s just doing it out of love or concern. [4] X Research source Some controlling behaviors you need to watch out for include: [5] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Telling you what clothes or how much makeup to wear.

      "title": "Observe any mood swings.",
      "content": "Observe any mood swings. If your boyfriend is prone to being highly sensitive or having rapid mood swings, he may have difficulty with emotional regulation. While this might not mean he’ll become abusive, it could mean he’ll be unstable and unpredictable with you. This is actually a way of controlling you, because you’ll never know what to expect and will feel like you have to make him feel better."

    {
      "title": "Notice how he deals with conflict.",
      "content": "Notice how he deals with conflict. Pay attention to how your boyfriend handles arguments with others.

    {
      "title": "Notice his use of force.",
      "content": "Notice his use of force. A very good indicator your boyfriend may become physically abusive in the future is his use of force. Pay attention to your boyfriend intimidating or scaring you during arguments or times of stress. These intimidation tactics are definite signs of emotional abuse, so it's important to recognize them and leave the relationship before it escalates to the point of violence. Ask yourself these important questions: Does he break or throw things? Does he punch walls? Does he corner you? Does he physically restrain you or hold you down? Does he tower over you and yell? Does he drive recklessly when he’s upset?"

      "title": "Be aware of threats.",

      "title": "Notice how he treats you during sex.",
      "content": "Notice how he treats you during sex. A boyfriend who pressures you into sex, tries to make you guilty for not having sex, forces you to have sex, or is violent during sex is abusive. Pay attention if he tries to manipulate you into having sex, especially if he makes you feel guilty for saying “no.” Keep in mind sexual control and manipulation may worsen over time.

      "title": "Listen to clues about his history.",
      "content": "Listen to clues about his history. If your boyfriend tells you he has a past history of hitting partners, he'll be more likely to be physically abusive in the future, particularly if he shows no remorse for it or blames past partners. Also watch out for a history of cruelty to animals or children. This may be less easy to see, but if he hits your dog when angry and is insensitive to its suffering, be careful. You may hear him say something like: “I hit my last girlfriend, but it was her fault. She made me do it.” Listen to clues from other people that he's been violent in the past. If you hear or notice a tendency toward violence or that others are scared of him, pay attention to it, even if he denies it or tries to blame others. You may want to actively seek out information online, such as his criminal records, to see if he's been arrested for domestic violence or had any restraining orders placed against him."

      "title": "Be aware of the cycle of abuse.",
      "content": "Be aware of the cycle of abuse. Relationships that are violent or abusive often follow a pattern. First, your boyfriend may get more angry, blame you, demean you, and argue with you more. Next, your boyfriend’s behavior will escalate and he’ll get more verbally, physically, sexually, or emotionally abusive with you. After that, he may apologize and make promises. This cycle will repeat unless you get help or leave the relationship, which is very hard to do when your boyfriend is apologizing or promising to change. You may also have difficulty leaving because of: Fear of being physically hurt. Low self-esteem. Fear of what others will think. Fear that you’re to blame."
