    {
      "title": "Call them Sister.",
      "content": "Call them Sister. You shouldn’t refer to a nun by their first or last name alone. Instead, you should use the term “Sister.” This signifies respect and is the term that most churches use for a nun. [1] X Research source For instance, you can say something like, \"Hello, Sister. How are you today?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the nun’s name after Sister.",
      "content": "Add the nun’s name after Sister. You can also add the nun's full name or last name after saying “Sister.” If you know the nun that you’re talking to, add her name to personalize the title. [2] X Research source For example, if the nun’s name is Sophia Smith, you could refer to her as “Sister Smith” or “Sister Sophia Smith.” If you are friends with the nun, she may allow you to refer to her as “Sister Sophia.” Make sure that you ask her if it's okay before calling her this though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call the Superior of the convent or monastery Reverend Mother.",
      "content": "Call the Superior of the convent or monastery Reverend Mother. The Superior is the highest ranking nun at the church. The term “Reverend Mother” and “Your Reverence” are used in most forms of Christianity when speaking to the Superior. You can say something like, \"May the Lord be with you, Reverend Mother.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Stand up when a nun enters the room.",
      "content": "Stand up when a nun enters the room. Stay standing until the nun takes a seat. This is a sign of respect and is practiced widely in the Christian faith."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take off your hat in the presence of a nun.",
      "content": "Take off your hat in the presence of a nun. Wearing a hat in front of a nun could be deemed as rude. Much like mass, it's customary to remove baseball caps or non-religious hats when in the presence of a nun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write “Dear Sister,” as a salutation.",
      "content": "Write “Dear Sister,” as a salutation. Nuns are referred to as sisters, so starting your letter off with “Dear Sister,” is the right way to start a letter to a nun. You can also add their first and last name after “Sister,” as you would when addressing them in person. For example, if the nun’s name is Margaret Mills, you can write “Dear Sister Margaret Mills.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include their name and order initials on the envelope.",
      "content": "Include their name and order initials on the envelope. Because there may be many nuns that belong to a particular convent or monastery, including a full name is a smart idea when addressing a letter to a nun. After their name, write the initials of their order or church that they belong to. For example, if you were addressing a letter to Sarah Jones from the Catholic Bible Association, you’d write, “To: Sister Sarah Jones, C.B.A.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Abbreviate sister with Sr in the body of the letter.",
      "content": "Abbreviate sister with Sr in the body of the letter. If you want to write shorthand, you can abbreviate the term sister with “Sr.” Abbreviating \"Sister\" should only be done in the body of the letter, not in the salutation. For example, “When Sr. Moody gave me my first Bible, it opened my eyes to the church and the teachings of God.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Abbreviate Reverend Mother in the body of the letter to save time.",
      "content": "Abbreviate Reverend Mother in the body of the letter to save time. Write Rev. Mother instead of Reverend Mother. If you need to refer to the Reverend Mother multiple times within the body of a letter, you can use shorthand to save some time. You can write something like, “The Rev. Mother instructed all of the nuns to study the Bible.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak with the Superior if you need to ask a question.",
      "content": "Speak with the Superior if you need to ask a question. Sometimes nuns will be bound to a vow of silence and can’t actually speak to you. Unless a nun is open and enthusiastic to talk to you, direct your questions to the convent or monastery Superior. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Call tonsured nuns Mother.",
      "content": "Call tonsured nuns Mother. You can tell if a nun is tonsured if she is wearing a klobuk, a cylindrical black cap with a veil. This is the final stage for women that want to become nuns with the Orthodox church, and any woman who reaches this stage should be referred to as \"Mother.\" [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Call non-tonsured nuns Sister.",
      "content": "Call non-tonsured nuns Sister. Non-tonsured nuns in Orthodox Christianity are also sometimes called Novices and Rassophore. These are the first and second stages of the monastic life for women practicing the Orthodox faith. If the nun in question isn’t wearing a klobuk, you should refer to her as “Sister.” [5] X Research source When in doubt, call the woman \"Mother\" so that you don't disrespect them. If they are a Novice or Rassophore, they will correct you without being offended."

    {
      "title": "Bow your head and hold your palms up to receive a blessing.",
      "content": "Bow your head and hold your palms up to receive a blessing. When you see a tonsured nun, it’s customary to request a blessing. Put your right hand over your left hand, palms up when you want to receive a blessing. The nun will then say a blessing and make the sign of the cross."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kiss the nun’s hand after receiving a blessing.",
      "content": "Kiss the nun’s hand after receiving a blessing. After you receive a blessing it’s customary to kiss the top of the nun’s hand. Wait for her to complete the blessing and make the sign of the cross before kissing her hand."
