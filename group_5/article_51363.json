The first step is to set up the problem in the proper format. [1] X Research source Write down the number whose cube root you want to find. Write the digits in groups of three, using the decimal point as your starting place. For this example, you will find the cube root of 10. Write this as 10. 000 000. The extra 0s are to allow precision in the solution. Draw a cube root radical sign over the number. This serves the same purpose as the long division bar line. The only difference is the shape of the symbol. Place a decimal point above the bar line, directly above the decimal point in the original number."

You first a number that could be cubed and stay within the range for the long division for the first digit. This provides the term 1000A^3 in the binomial expansion. The second term of the binomial expansion has the coefficient of 300. (This actually comes from 3 ∗ 10 2 {\\displaystyle 3*10^{2}} .)
