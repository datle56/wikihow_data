      "title": "Add vinegar to baking soda.",
      "content": "Add vinegar to baking soda. Vinegar is an acid, and baking soda is a base. Thus, if you mix them together, you will get an acid-base reaction. Vinegar is probably the most common way to activate baking soda.. The reaction can turn the baking soda into a powerful cleaning agent. For example, vinegar and baking soda can be used to clean a kitchen sink. [1] X Research source Add ¼ cup of warm tap water and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vinegar into ¼ cup of baking soda to see if the baking soda is still good. If it bubbles, it is. This is called “proofing” the baking soda. Vinegar will create a powerful fizz when added to baking soda because of the degree of acidity in it. It's the acetic acid in the vinegar that causes the chemical reaction."

      "content": "Add lemon to activate baking soda. Lemon or lemon juice will create an alkalizing effect when mixed with baking soda, activating it. Add a teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of mineral or other water, and add in the juice from half a lemon. Mix thoroughly before drinking. Some recipes call for adding peppermint leaves or a pinch of salt into the lemon and baking soda mixture, in addition to water. [2] X Research source This mixture has purported health benefits. Some people believe it can be used to combat acidosis. The mixture helps the body remove toxins and burn fat. It can be helpful for kidney care. [3] X Research source Drinking lemon juice and baking soda can also improve your digestion and combat acid reflux. It helps to purify your liver and provides some needed nutrients, like vitamin C. Always check with your doctor, though, before using any natural remedies."

      "title": "Add other juices to baking soda.",
      "content": "Add other juices to baking soda. Although lemon juice is one of the most common acids to add to baking soda, other juices can work too. Try adding orange juice to baking soda, and you will get bubbles that come from the release of the carbon dioxide. Fruit purees also activate baking soda. Orange juice has more acid in it than most other fruit juices. Other juices that will react to baking soda include grape juice, vegetable and fruit juice blends, and limeade. [4] X Research source Ketchup can react with baking soda because it contains vinegar. The acidic reaction will cause fizzing that indicates the baking soda is fresh and actively working."

      "title": "Add water to the baking soda.",
      "content": "Add water to the baking soda. Baking soda will dissolve in water. However, there are many uses for baking soda water. The baking soda water can help with chronic heartburn or acid reflux by neutralizing stomach acids. All you need is a tablespoon of baking soda in a glass of water. Baking soda water can also be used as a mild antiseptic. Remember that baking soda is high in sodium and can have side effects, such as stomach cramping. Check with your doctor if you have high blood pressure, are a nursing mother or are pregnant. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add molasses to baking soda. In addition to reacting in batter, some people have claimed that a mixture of molasses and baking soda can help cure cancer. However, check with your doctor. [6] X Research source Mix one cup of water with 1 teaspoon of black strap molasses and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. The water should be room temperature. [7] X Research source You can also use grade B maple syrup, or Manuka honey in place of the black strap molasses. Always research alternative health treatments. Do not assume that the solution actually works because of one man’s experience. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the baking soda into batter.",
      "content": "Put the baking soda into batter. Baking soda is an essential leavening agent for recipes that call for an acid, such as buttermilk, vinegar, sour cream, yogurt, lemon or orange juice, cocoa, chocolate, honey, maple syrup, fruit, or brown sugar. When baking soda interacts with acidic substances such as those above it creates sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide bubbles give rise to baked goods. Follow the amount of baking soda specified on the recipe. Make sure that you do not substitute baking soda for baking powder as they are different! Sour cream, yogurt, and molasses also create a bubbling reaction in baked goods. Add one teaspoon of baking soda or follow the recipe’s directions. The addition of the baking soda will cause an instant reaction if one of these acidic ingredients is present, so that the batter will expand when the batter is put into the oven. This in turn will cause the batter to rise, creating a lighter texture to baked goods like cookies, quick breads, cakes, and muffins."

      "content": "Use baking soda as a healing agent. Baking soda can be used to alleviate the pain of insect bites and poison ivy. Create a paste out of baking soda and water, and rub it on the bites. Baking soda will relieve minor skin irritation and itching. Baking soda also neutralizes sunburn. Add ½ cup of baking soda to slightly warm bathwater. You can also use baking soda to neutralize stomach acid, thus relieving ailments like indigestion, heartburn and ulcer pain. Only use it as an occasional treatment, and check with a doctor first. Dissolve ½ teaspoon in half a glass of water, and take it every two hours. Do not take more than three ½ teaspoons of the mixture if you’re over 50 or more than seven ½ teaspoons in 24 hours."

      "content": "Use baking soda on your teeth. Baking soda can be used in place of toothpaste to clean and deodorize your teeth. Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to form a natural toothpaste. The hydrogen peroxide will activate the baking soda. Some toothpastes contain baking soda. Some studies have found those toothpastes are more successful at removing plaque because the baking soda has a mild abrasiveness. Mix six parts of baking soda to one part of sea salt and turn this into a tooth and gum paste by mixing in a blender for 30 seconds. Baking soda can also help whiten your teeth. Crush one strawberry together with ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Put the paste on your teeth, and leave for five minutes. Only do this once a week so you don’t damage your teeth enamel."
