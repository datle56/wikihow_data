      "content": "The 🤤 emoji means someone’s hungry. This emoji is the perfect depiction of how your mouth waters when you’re about to eat a delicious meal. When someone sends you 🤤, it might mean that they’ve just sat down to eat and want to let you know how much they’re looking forward to their meal. Or, maybe they’re drooling at the thought of eating something delicious soon. Expect to also get some pictures of their yummy-looking food soon after. [1] X Research source “My mom just made tacos 🤤🌮 My mouth is already watering.” “I could really go for some sushi right now 🤤🤤” “Are you gonna make me noodles when I get back? 🍜🤤 I’ll love you forever if you do 🥺”"

      "content": "🤤 expresses someone’s desire for something. Maybe your friend just saw a nice bag that they really want to buy, or maybe they’re completely obsessed with the new model of a laptop that just got released. Whatever it may be, sending the 🤤 emoji means that they really want some object—so much that they’re figuratively (and maybe literally) drooling over it. “Did you see the new iPhone? 🤤🤩 I need it.” “Okay tell me what you think of this shirt. I think I’m going to buy it 🤤” “I just saw the cutest pair of shoes 🤤🤤”"

      "content": "People use 🤤 when they find someone attractive. Have you ever seen someone who’s so good-looking that you couldn’t stop your jaw from dropping? That’s pretty much the feeling the 🤤 emoji conveys. If someone sends 🤤 to you, they might have just laid eyes on a very attractive person, whether it’s their crush or a particularly handsome or pretty celebrity. Along the same lines, they may also be saying they find someone sexually attractive by sending 🤤. [2] X Research source “Did you see his recent Instagram post? Why does he look SO good?? 🤤😭” “She looks so pretty today 😍🤤 Maybe I should go and talk to her.” “They just look so hot it honestly makes me angry 😤🤤”"

      "content": "🤤 represents someone’s approval of an idea. When someone’s particularly excited about a suggestion you or someone else just made, they might send 🤤 to express their excitement and anticipation. If you’re making plans with a friend, just know that receiving 🤤 as a reply is usually a good sign. “Ooh yes, we should totally go to that new cafe after class 🤤🤤” “I’m so down to go out Friday 🤤” “Who suggested getting drinks? Count me in 🤤”"

      "content": "Someone might be feeling sleepy when they send 🤤. Admit it, most of us are probably guilty of waking up with a bit of drool on our chin after a particularly deep sleep. If someone sends you 🤤, they might be trying to tell you that they’re feeling a bit sleepy, or maybe they just got up from a really great nap. “Today was exhausting. I feel like I could sleep for a year 🤤🥱” “Just had the best nap of my life 🤤” “How are you still awake? I’m literally about to fall asleep standing up 🧍😴🤤”"

      "content": "🤤 is also used to sarcastically mock someone. The 🤤 emoji kind of resembles a person’s slack-jawed appearance when they don’t really know what’s going on. So, a friend might send 🤤 when someone they know is acting foolishly or being a bit slow to keep up with what’s going on. “He seriously has no idea what’s going on 🤤🙄” “I’ll have to explain it to them again because I know for a fact that they weren’t listening the first time 🤤” “It appalls me how dense some people can be 🤤😤”"

It looks so yummy 🤤” “That looks good. I wish I knew how to cook 😞 Guess I’ll just stick to my instant noodles 🍜”"

If you’re talking to someone you’re not that close with, stick to a polite and positive comment. If it’s someone like a friend, feel free to give your honest thoughts. “Oh that is pretty cool! Are you going to buy it?” “Hmm 🤔 I’m not sure I’m a fan of the color. Are there other color options?” “Good to know. I was in need of ideas for a birthday gift for you anyways 😏”"

Ooh we could also go to that taco place nearby 🌮” “You want me to pick you up? I can be at your place around 7 if that’s cool.” “We could also catch a movie on Friday if we have time 🍿🎥”"
