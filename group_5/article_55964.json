Putting yourself out there on campus gives you a lot of opportunities to say hi to new people and potentially meet some new friends. [1] X Research source When people walk by, smile and say hi to them. You never know if they want to sit down and have a conversation. You could also mention something in your shared surroundings.

If there’s a group project in your class, see if they want to work together so you can socialize with them even more. Show that you’re open and approachable by being attentive in class and actively participating in the discussion. Start a study group with a few of your classmates so you can help each other learn the material better and spend time together outside of the classroom. [14] X Research source"
