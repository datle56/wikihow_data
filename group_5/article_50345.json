      "content": "Raise the bike off the ground on a bike stand. You need to be able to spin the wheels freely without the bike moving. The best way to do this is with a bike stand. If you don't have one, check if your local bike shop or outdoor store has a \"maintenance night,\" where you pay a small fee to access to all of their tools for the night. You can also turn the bike upside down, resting it on the seat and handlebars. If you do, however, know that you will have to reverse the direction you spin things in the following instructions. You can also hang the nose of your saddle in the notch of a tree or low hanging joist."

      "title": "Locate your derailleurs.",
      "content": "Locate your derailleurs. Derailleurs are the machines that physically shift your gears and keep your chain in place. There is one on the back wheel attached to the cassette (the collection of gears) and another smaller derailleur near the pedals. [1] X Research source Check that there is nothing in the derailleurs or gears like leaves, sticks, or mud, and clean them with a damp cloth. The rear derailleur is the more complex machine, consisting of the derailleur, an arm, and 1-2 smaller gears that the chain is threaded through. A cable pulls this arm back and forth, allowing the chain to switch gears. The front derailleur is clamped onto your bike's frame, and consists of a spring and two \"derailleur plates,\" or small metal walls that force the chain to stay on only one gear at a time."

      "content": "Diagnose your shifting problems by testing each gear. Using one hand to lightly pedal the bike, shift through 1 gear per click, starting with every gear on the back derailleur. Go up every gear once and down every gear once. Note places where the gears have trouble shifting, where the chain slips off the gear, or where you need to shift twice to make the bike shift. [2] X Research source While testing one derailleur, put the other one in the middle gear. For example, if I am testing the back derailleur and I have 3 gears in the front, leave the front derailleur in the middle ring the entire time. This prevents the chain from stretching."

      "title": "Find the cable adjusters.",
      "content": "Find the cable adjusters. Follow the cables leading to the derailleurs to find the adjusters, which look like little nuts or barrels surrounding the cables. There may be two for each cable -- one at the derailleur end and another by the handlebars. These make small adjustments to the derailleur cables, allowing you to make subtle changes to your shifting."

      "content": "Loosen your cable adjuster if the chain won't shift down. If you have trouble shifting as you lower your gears (lower gears are closer to the wheel), then loosen the cable adjuster by turning it counterclockwise. Turn the adjuster slowly, turning until the chain falls into the correct gear. Always work slowly, adjusting by a quarter-turn at a time at most. Think of it as of turning the adjuster the way you want the chain to move. Rotate towards the bike to make the chain move towards the bike. Don’t loosen the adjuster too far [3] X Research source or it may detach from the derailleur. If you need to make a large adjustment, thread the adjust into derailleur, shift into the smallest gear, loosen the pinch bolt, and pull the cable by hand."

      "content": "Tighten your cable adjuster if your chain won't shift \"up.\" If your bike struggles to work it's way up the gears (away from your bike), you should tighten the cable adjuster by turning it clockwise. When it is correct, the chain will naturally switch to the correct gear on its own. Think of this as turning the adjuster the way you want the chain to move. Rotate away from the bike to make the chain move away from the bike."

A small bolt clamps the cable in place, holding it tight. Using an Allen key, unscrew the bolt to free the end of the cable. Advanced Note: You'll notice that, if you pedal the bike, the chain will slide down to the lowest ring without your help. That is because derailleurs work by tightening the cable to hold the chain in place. Similarly, you can shift your bike manually by pulling the cable."

There are two small screws which hold the derailleur in place, located right next to each other on the top (front derailleur) or back (rear derailleur) of the derailleur. The screw on the left, often labeled with an \"H,\" which limits how high the chain can go and affects the outer gears. The screw on right, often labeled with an \"L,\" limits how low the chain can go and affects the inner gears."

Alternatively, it may not push far enough, and the chain will not get to all the gears. You can then adjust the limit screws to move the derailleur -- and you will actually see it moving. Tighten the low limit screw if you the chain goes too far. This will keep the derailleur from moving too much to the left. Loosen the low limit screw if you cannot shift into every gear. This will allow the derailleur to move farther in."
