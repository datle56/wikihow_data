      "content": "Open the watch band. If you have a band that separates, simply open it up. If you have a closed-loop metal band, look for the pin in the clasp. Use a small screwdriver to push the pin out the other side. Put the pin in a safe place, and open the bracelet. [2] X Research source Be careful when pushing out the pin, as you could scratch the band if the tool slips."

      "title": "Place the watch face down on something soft.",
      "content": "Place the watch face down on something soft. You don't want to scratch up the front of the watch. Therefore, you should place the watch face-down on something relatively soft. Try something with a bit of grip, such as piece of shelf liner. You can also hold the watch in your hand, particularly when using the ball."

      "title": "Work in a dry and clean area.",
      "content": "Work in a dry and clean area. You don't want to be in an area that's dusty, where debris could get into the watch. Also, you don't want to be in steamy room, as steam isn't good for the inside of your watch. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick the correct die.",
      "content": "Pick the correct die. Generally, a die kit for Rolex watches will come with multiple dies to fit different watches. Try them out until 1 seems to fit properly into the screw setting around the back of the watch. The edge of the setting looks like a standard dime. [4] X Research source You can buy these dies online or from a watch repair shop. If you're trying to order the correct tool online, measure across the back of the watch. Measure straight across from 1 ridged edge to another."

    {
      "title": "Place the die in the handle.",
      "content": "Place the die in the handle. Most watch tools come with a handle to place the die in. The handle gives you leverage for turning the die on the back of the watch. Usually, you'll just have a tool where the die sits in the middle, and it will just set in place. However, more sophisticated tools may come with a vice to hold the die and watch.

    {
      "title": "Set the die on the back of the watch.",
      "content": "Set the die on the back of the watch. Place the die with the handle on the back of the watch so that it sets in the grooves. Be careful to apply it straight, as if you come at it from an angle, you could scratch the watch. You should feel the die settle into place on the back of the watch. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Turn the die counterclockwise.",
      "content": "Turn the die counterclockwise. Check to see if the die feels secure on the watch. If it slides off, it could scratch it. Once you feel the die has set into place, turn the die counterclockwise to unscrew the back. Hold the watch in place as you turn. Keep turning until the back comes off. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a rubber ball.",
      "content": "Find a rubber ball. The other way to open a Rolex watch involves using a rubber ball. You can buy these at watch stores, but you can also get them cheap online. It should be a small inflatable ball, about the size of a tennis ball. Any squishy rubber ball should do, but it should also have a slightly tacky feel. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the ball on the back of the watch.",
      "content": "Place the ball on the back of the watch. Press the ball into the back of the watch. You need to press it hard enough so that you create friction between the ball and the watch. The ball is going to grip the ridges on the watch. [9] X Research source"
