      "title": "Blow air at your gerbil.",
      "content": "Blow air at your gerbil. If your pet becomes aggressive (bites or scratches), blow a puff of air at its face. Your gerbil will find this unpleasant, and it should stop biting or scratching. This same technique works if your gerbil is just nibbling on you."

    {
      "title": "Don’t flinch if bitten.",
      "content": "Don’t flinch if bitten. Bites can be painful, especially if they break skin. Your first thought might be to pull away. This can make your gerbil actually want to bite again, however. It’s better to react calmly. Gerbils don't bite to be mean. Biting is usually a sign that your gerbil is scared. Shouting or flinching can make the gerbil more scared and more likely to bite again. Gerbils are good readers of emotion. They can sense if you are afraid or scared, which can make them agitated."

      "title": "Stop irritating your gerbil if it nips you.",
      "content": "Stop irritating your gerbil if it nips you. When a gerbil nips, it will clamp its jaws down in a single motion. This won't be as painful or damaging as a bite, though it can still hurt a little. If your gerbil nips you, it’s a sign that it wants you to stop doing something. Let it be, and the nips should stop. For instance, your gerbil might nip you if you’re holding it and it wants down. You can blow air at the gerbil for a nip as well, but make sure that you also stop doing what’s irritating your furry friend. A nibble is a painless, repetitive chewing motion. Don't mistake these for nips or bites."

      "title": "Wash the bite or scratch wound.",
      "content": "Wash the bite or scratch wound. Gerbils can carry germs, just like any creature. To reduce the risk of infection, make sure to wash the bite or scratch wound with antibacterial soap and warm water as soon as possible. This is especially important if your skin is broken. Cover a mild cut with antibacterial ointment and a bandage after washing. If you see signs of infection (pus, redness, warmth), contact a doctor immediately. It is unlikely that a pet gerbil would carry rabies, but you may want to get a vaccine booster just in case."

      "title": "Let your gerbil know you want to pick it up.",
      "content": "Let your gerbil know you want to pick it up. Gerbils can get scared and bite or scratch if you pick them up without warning. Approach your gerbil slowly, start talking to it in a calm voice, and hold out your hand. If your friend seems calm, you can pick it up. Do not snatch your gerbil up quickly, since this can cause it to become aggressive. Hold your friend firmly enough that it won't fall, but not so hard that you squeeze it."

    {
      "title": "Clean your hands before handling your pet.",
      "content": "Clean your hands before handling your pet. Gerbils might become aggressive because they smell another gerbil on your hands. Likewise, if you have food on your hands, your pet might very well start nibbling on you. Washing your hands before handling your gerbil should take care of these causes of biting and scratching behavior."

      "title": "Spend time each day with a new gerbil so that it gets used to you.",
      "content": "Spend time each day with a new gerbil so that it gets used to you. Start by sitting next the cage so that the gerbil learns who you are. You can read or speak to the gerbil to get it used to your voice. After a few days, give the gerbil a treat, such as a sunflower seed, through the bars. Let the gerbil come up to your hand to eat the treat. [1] X Research source Over time, the gerbil will get less and less scared of you. Soon, you may be able to give the gerbil a treat from an open hand or the gerbil may willingly hop onto your hand when you hold it out."

    {
      "title": "Handle an aggressive gerbil with gloves at first.",
      "content": "Handle an aggressive gerbil with gloves at first. Some gerbils will bite out of fear until they get to know you. Wear gloves when holding yours, talk to it soothingly, and give it treats. Over time, you might see it stop biting the gloves. When it seems calm around you, try picking it up and holding it bare-handed. Most gerbils won’t make a habit of scratching, but if yours does, gloves will keep you from getting hurt. Gloves of any material are fine, as long as they are thick enough to prevent bites and scratches."

      "title": "Avoid handling a gerbil that seems afraid of you.",
      "content": "Avoid handling a gerbil that seems afraid of you. If you have a gerbil who constantly bites and scratches, it can be best to just generally avoid picking it up. You can get another gerbil so that it has a companion to play with, and use gloves when you have to pick it up. If you have a gerbil that has a habit of attacking your hand, you can also try letting it jump on your sleeve instead instead of picking it up and holding it in your hands. It might feel more comfortable that way."

      "title": "See a vet if you can’t figure out why your gerbil is aggressive.",
      "content": "See a vet if you can’t figure out why your gerbil is aggressive. Some gerbils will attack because they are ill. If you can’t see a clear reason for your pet’s behavior, take it to a vet for an examination to see if there is an underlying cause. Any illness might cause your gerbil to become aggressive. If the behavior is accompanied by diarrhea, a change in weight, loss of fur, skin problems, or inactivity, it is even more likely that an illness is to blame."
