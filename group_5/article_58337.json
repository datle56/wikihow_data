After selecting the growth plan, you will see how long it will take at the top of the Progress bar. On its right, you will see four main aspects of your players that would be affected. The general idea is to maximize where your player plays and what roles he plays for your team.

Generally, you want to research the player before approaching the club to buy them. You want to offer based on the player's market value as well as how his recent performances have affected his worth. You can also pay the club the Release clause to immediately buy the player without negotiation, but that is generally a bad practice."
