      "content": "Select your hairspray based on your desired finish. Some hairsprays provide a stronger hold than others. Others provide additional gloss and shine. Determine which type will work best for the hairstyle you’ve selected. [1] X Research source For example, if you have oily hair you should stay away from hairsprays marked “ultra shine,” “diamond gloss,” or similar. These will make your hair appear greasy. You can also make your own all-natural DIY product with sugar hairspray. To make sugar hairspray, boil 1 cup (240 mL) of water and add 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of sugar, mixing until it dissolves. Let the mixture cool, then put in an empty spray bottle. [2] X Research source"

You can also blow-dry your hair using a round brush or other styling tool to create your ideal look. [3] X Research source Hairspray is also often used in combination with a curling iron to keep waves from quickly falling out of your hair . Hairspray is also great for keeping a pompadour hairdo from losing its structure and volume throughout the day."

Before you set your style with hairspray you want to make sure it looks exactly the way you want. If you’re using a medium or strong-hold hairspray, it will be difficult to fix your hairstyle after you spray it. Opt for a soft-hold hairspray if you want a more flexible style. [4] X Research source To reach both sides of your head easily, it’s best to spray one hand and do one half then spray the other for the other half. Make sure your hairspray is within arms’ reach during this process because you’ll need to grab it and spray quickly once you’re ready to set your hairstyle. [5] X Research source"

Holding the bottle at arm’s length, spray it all over your hair to coat your style in hairspray. Use circular motions around your head to ensure you don’t spray too long in one spot. [6] X Research source Keep your hand moving while you spray to avoid saturating your hair and making it thick, clumpy, and heavy. Protect your eyes with the other hand to make sure you don’t get hairspray in your eyes."

Dry your hair completely with a hair dryer—clay creates a firmer hold when applied to dry hair. Make sure you’re pointing the hair dryer in the direction you’re planning to style your hair. [8] X Research source If you prefer a lighter hold on your hair, stop blow-drying when your hair is still damp but not dripping. [9] X Research source If you typically use a pre-styling product like hair tonic, leave-in conditioner, or heat protectant spray, massage that into your hair before blow-drying."

When you’re done, the clay should be spread evenly across your fingers and palms in a thin layer. There should be no visible clumps or dollops of clay left on your hands. [10] X Research source The precise amount of hair clay you need depends on how long your hair is. Short hair generally requires one pea-size dollop, while medium-length hair requires two. Since you can always layer more hair clay on later in the process, be conservative when starting off. [11] X Research source Make sure to select hair clay that has a matte finish and that’s solid in state."

If it seems like you need more product to really set your hair, scoop up another pea-size amount and repeat the process."

      "content": "Use your wax-coated hands to work your hair into the desired style. If you have short hair, brush the surface of your hair with your palms to coat your hair in a thin layer of wax. Then you can start using your hands to shape the hair how you’d like. Wax works well for a sleek slicked-back look —use your fingers or a comb to brush back your waxed hair. If you have thick hair, then you will need to use a brush to smooth your hair back and make it lay flat. Otherwise, it may still look puffy in some places. Hair wax can also work with longer layered haircuts by providing definition. Instead of brushing the wax through all your hair, twirl the ends of your hair between your wax-coated fingertips. Don’t rub it into the roots or mid-shaft of your hair because it will make your head look greasy and limp. Hair wax also helps to define the curls in your hair by making them springier and more structured. Work the wax into the ends of each curl with your fingertips."

Be careful of using too much—it’s easy to add more, and it’s almost impossible to remove product from your hair (other than washing it) once it’s been applied."

However, keep in mind that wax is thick and can be hard to style your hair with depending on your hair texture, so this might not always work out. You can also carry your hair wax with you in your purse or your pocket if you plan to do a major retouching job while you’re out."
