If you know someone who enjoys strategy-based board games, invite them to join you in a couple of rounds. To get other players in on the action, consider holding a Pai Sho tournament or playing a series of games with a “winner stays” format.

The first player to successfully create a chain of them around the center of the board is the winner. [3] X Research source It is also possible to capture your opponent’s tiles in Pai Sho. If two flower tiles clash, one may capture the other flower tile by landing on the space it occupies. Capturing flower tiles can be a useful way of preventing your opponent from creating their own harmony ring."

You can only play one of these tiles during a Harmony bonus, which you’ll be rewarded with any time you create a new Harmony. [5] X Research source Rock : Cancels Harmonies along any lines it's placed on. You can place this tile at any open intersection on the board. Once a Rock tile has been planted, it can’t be captured or moved, even by a Wheel. Wheel : Rotates all adjacent and diagonal tiles 1 space in a clockwise direction around it. You can place this tile at any open point, except where it would move a Rock tile, cause tiles to clash, or move a tile to an opposite-colored garden, off the board, off of a gate, or onto a gate. Knotweed : Cancels Harmonies in surrounding adjacent spaces by “choking” or “draining” the flower tiles. If you’re playing on a physical board, flip the affected tiles over to show that they’ve been neutralized. You can place this tile at any open point on the board. Boat : Either moves a Flower tile to an empty adjacent or diagonal space (taking that tile’s place in the process) or removes an opponent’s Accent tile from the board. You can only play this on a Flower tile moved outside of the Gate or an Accent tile. White Dragon or Orchid : Removes active tiles from the board if it lands directly on them. You can place this tile at any open point on the board and move it in 6 spaces in any direction on each turn. White Lotus : Turns Harmonies into Disharmonies and Disharmonies into Harmonies. You can place this tile at any open point on the board and move it up to 2 spaces in any direction on each turn."

They are “Blocked” if an opponent’s Flower tile is between the two Flowers attempting to Harmonize. There needs to be at least one open space between harmonizing Flowers.

Gardens come in 3 types: Light, the fully White Squares, Dark, the fully Red Squares, and Neutral, all other squares that are neither fully Light nor fully Dark. [19] X Research source Gates are where Flower tiles are “Planted,” when first placed on the board. They can start their first movement in any of the squares surrounding the Gate, as indicated by Blue. Key Flower tiles are either Light (white) or Dark (Red). Light Key Flowers can never land in Dark Garden Squares and Dark Key Flowers can never land in Light Garden Squares. However, all flowers can move through Gardens of the opposite color."

[21] X Research source Special Flower Tiles act much like Key Flowers—they need to be planted in Gates before moving into the Garden. However, each has a unique ability that can be employed to assist your play strategy. Instead of being “Planted” in Gates, Accent Tiles are placed in the Garden by switching them with one of the player’s Flower tiles that are already in a Garden square. The Accent tile is placed in the square that the Flower previously occupied, and the Flower returns to its player’s collection to be re-used later. Each Accent tile has a unique effect on the game. A player can place 1 Accent tile per turn at any point. Accent Tiles are the only ones capable of moving over other Tiles."

This tile can therefore be used by either player to complete their Harmony Ring. It can move up to 2 steps in a turn in any direction. Orchid: If a Player moves the Orchid Tile during their turn, they are allowed one additional move that same turn. It can move 1 step in any direction per turn. Dahlia: The Dahlia can move any distance vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and can move over other tiles. However, it must always land beside another tile already in the Garden. Fire Lily: The Fire Lily cannot form Harmonies (except with the Lotus), but it only blocks the opponent’s Harmonies. It can move 6 steps in a turn, with each step being in any direction."

It allows all of its player’s Key Flowers to enter any square in its quarter of the Garden, ignoring whether the Garden is Dark or Light. Knotweed: All surrounding Flowers are rendered unable to move themselves or to harmonize as long as they are beside the Knotweed (this affects Flowers belonging to either player). The Knotweed can move up to 2 steps per turn, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Wheel: Must be placed by switching with another Accent tile, not a Flower tile, allowing that Accent tile to be recycled. Once per turn, the Player can rotate all surrounding tiles up to 3 squares clockwise or counter-clockwise. All surrounding tiles must rotate the same amount and must be capable of landing in the final square of the Wheel effect’s motion. The Wheel can move up to 3 steps per turn, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Boat: When the Boat tile moves, it can activate its effect and carry all surrounding Tiles with it, placing them in the same positions relative to it at the end of its motion. All tiles must be able to land effectively in the final positions to use this effect. The Boat can move up to 4 steps per turn, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally."

All 4 of these Accent Tiles can move up to 5 steps per turn, whether vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. [24] X Research source The Dragon: Can land on another tile to return it to its player to be reused later. However, any Effect tile can land on the Dragon to completely remove it from the game. Once removed, it cannot be used again for the duration of that game. The Badgermole: Can land on a tile and be placed underneath it. When below a tile, the above tile is completely unaffected by Accent tile effects. The Badgermole can move while under a tile and may carry the above tile with it as it goes. The above tile can be moved off the Badgermole by its player. The Skybison: The Skybison can land on a tile and be placed beneath it. When below a Flower, the above tile cannot have its Harmonies blocked by opposing Flower tiles. The Skybison can move while below a tile and may carry the above tile with it as it goes, and once it has finished moving, the tile that it carried may make an additional move, off of the Skybison. The Koi: The Koi tile can swap the position of tiles on opposite sides of it (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). If they are in line and the Koi is between them, their positions can be switched, but only if both tiles can land in the other’s square (e.g. Light Flowers cannot land in Dark Gardens)."
