      "content": "Find the vertex of the function if it's quadratic. If you're working with a straight line or any function with a polynomial of an odd number, such as f(x) = 6x 3 +2x + 7, you can skip this step. But if you're working with a parabola, or any equation where the x-coordinate is squared or raised to an even power, you'll need to plot the vertex. To do this, just use the formula -b/2a to get the x coordinate of the function 3x 2 + 6x -2, where 3 = a, 6 = b, and -2 = c. In this case -b is -6, and 2a is 6, so the x-coordinate is -6/6, or -1. Now, plug -1 into the function to get the y-coordinate. f(-1) = 3(-1) 2 + 6(-1) -2 = 3 - 6 -2 = -5. The vertex is (-1,-5). Graph it by drawing a point where the x coordinate is -1 and where the y-coordinate is -5. It should be in the third quadrant of the graph."

      "content": "Find a few other points in the function. To get a sense of the function, you should plug in a few other x-coordinates so you can get a sense of what the function looks like before you start to look for the range. Since it's a parabola and the x 2 coordinate is positive, it'll be pointing upward. But just to cover your bases, let's plug in some x-coordinates to see what y coordinates they yield: f(-2) = 3(-2) 2 + 6(-2) -2 = -2. One point on the graph is (-2, -2) f(0) = 3(0) 2 + 6(0) -2 = -2. Another point on the graph is (0,-2) f(1) = 3(1) 2 + 6(1) -2 = 7. A third point on the graph is (1, 7)."

For a relation to be a function, if you put in the same input, you should always get the same output. If you put in a -7, you should get the same y coordinate (whatever it may be) every single time.

In this case, Becky can sell 0 or more tickets - she can't sell negative tickets. Since we don't know the number of seats in her school auditorium, we can assume that she can theoretically sell an infinite number of tickets. And she can only sell whole tickets; she can't sell 1/2 of a ticket, for example. Therefore, the domain of the function is t = any non-negative integer."

If you know that the domain is any non-negative integer and that the formula is M(t) = 5t , then you know that you can plug any non-negative integer into this function to get the output, or the range. For example, if she sells 5 tickets, then M(5) = 5 x 5, or 25 dollars. If she sells 100, then M(100) = 5 x 100, or 500 dollars. Therefore, the range of the function is any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five. That means that any non-negative integer that is a multiple of five is a possible output for the input of the function."
