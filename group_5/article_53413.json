      "content": "Yes, a septum piercing can shrink or close if you remove the jewelry. Just like any other piercing, there’s always potential for your septum to close when you take out the jewelry. Whether you got a brand new septum piercing or have one that’s fully healed, the hole is more likely to shrink the longer you leave your jewelry out. [1] X Research source The skin inside your piercing starts to rebuild itself when you remove your jewelry, so it can cause the hole to tighten or close off. Even if the hole doesn’t close up completely, it may become too small to fit the original jewelry back in."

      "content": "Septum piercings may close within minutes or days. How long it takes for septum piercings to close depends on many things, like the quality and size of the piercing, your age, how fast your body heals, and how well you take care of it. [2] X Research source Even if your septum piercing has fully healed, it may still close within a few minutes without jewelry. [3] X Research source For other people, it may instead take multiple days or even weeks for the piercing hole to shrink after you take out the jewelry. Septum piercings go through a mucus membrane in your nose, which tends to close up faster than regular skin."

      "content": "Let your piercing heal for 6–8 weeks before changing jewelry. After getting a new septum piercing, leave the original jewelry in for the entire time your septum is healing, which is about 6–8 weeks. As it’s healing, be sure to clean your piercing at least twice a day with saline solution to prevent infections. [4] X Research source Try not to move your jewelry around and be careful not to bump it, or it may increase your overall healing time."

      "content": "Keep jewelry in your septum piercing at all times. Because the piercing hole can potentially shrink in a short time, just leave jewelry in as much as you can. If you want to change your jewelry , then wait until you have the new ring or barbell before taking the old one out. As long as you keep jewelry in your piercing, there’s no risk of the hole closing up.

If you have horseshoe-shaped jewelry in your septum, simply flip it up inside your nostrils so it’s out of sight. If you need to remove your jewelry completely after it’s healed, put in a plastic retainer to help hold the hole open and prevent it from closing. [8] X Research source If your septum piercing is still healing, you’re still able to flip it up and down, but keep the movements to a minimum so you don’t prolong your recovery. Wash your hands any time you touch or handle your septum piercing to prevent bacteria from getting inside."

If your piercing has already started to shrink, avoid forcing jewelry through it because you could damage your skin and cause infections. Instead, contact your piercer to see what they can do. They may be able to widen the piercing gently with special tools, or they may have to re-pierce the hole completely. [9] X Research source"

Even if you decide you don’t want your septum pierced right after getting it, wait until it’s completely healed to remove the jewelry to prevent infections. After that, just remove the jewelry and let the hole shrink down, which may start within the first day or two. Usually, after a few months, only a small hole or mark will be visible once the piercing closes. [10] X Research source"
