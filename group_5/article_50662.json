Tell him things about him and his achievements that you like and admire and he'll be eating out of your hand. [2] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. As a Libra woman, you never hesitate to spread love and positivity, so you'll definitely have no problem showing that Ram how special he is. The key phrase for Aries is \"I am.\" Compliments that talk about who he is at his core will be a direct line to his heart. For example, you might say, \"You are such a great teacher. I was amazed by your patience.\" An Aries man is extremely competitive, so he'll also love it if you compliment him on his victories. You might say, \"That pass was exceptional! You really dominated in the game today.\""

      "content": "Your Aries guy will love that he can talk with you for hours. As an Air sign, Libra ladies are thinkers with great conversation skills. You and your Ram have a lot in common, so your conversations will just flow. The more he talks to you, the more he'll be interested. He loves to talk about daredevils and share tales of adventure—even better if you have stories of your own travels you can share. Aries guys tend to be competitive and won't shy away from a debate. As long as you hold your own, he'll be enamored. As a Fire sign, the Ram always enjoys introducing a little heat into a conversation."

      "content": "You'll attract his interest if you poke at him lightly. [3] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Libra ladies are known for their playfulness, so this type of gentle ribbing is second-nature for you. It's important to tread lightly here—you don't want to actually make him mad—but if you get under his skin a little, he'll start thinking about you a lot and want to see you more often. For example, if he's talking about sports, you might make a dig about his favorite team. If you don't know a lot about sports, just tease him generally about being a sports guy. Keep your tone light and try to avoid anything he might be really sensitive about. If you don't know him that well, it might be hard to tell, but stay away from negative comments about his appearance or his character."

      "content": "Aries men are highly competitive and always play to win. [4] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. This doesn't mean you should let him win—and as a Libra, you would never do that anyway. You're all about fairness, but that doesn't mean you don't enjoy a little healthy competition. Since he likes to win, pick something he's going to be better at than you, then give it your best shot. He'll love that you gave him a challenge. One-on-one games are great because that competitive energy he has will come out in sexual tension. As the game heats up, so will the two of you."

      "content": "The masculine Aries man is very attracted to feminine women. Libra ladies are known for graceful, delicate style. The typical Ram will be almost magnetically drawn to you. As a daughter of Venus, you embody all the feminine, romantic energy that Aries loves to have around him. For example, if you're going out on a date with him, you might wear a long, flowing skirt with a cute, fitted T-shirt and some practical sandals. Your outfit gives you the freedom to do pretty much anything while still maintaining a delicate femininity."

      "content": "Aries guys feel more comfortable when they're in control. The Ram doesn't like when someone else tries to lead him—he prefers to be the one holding the reins. Both of you are cardinal signs, which means you're both driven by leadership. But Libra is also the sign of partnership, so you have an intuitive sense of when it would be better for you to fall back and follow him. [5] X Research source For example, you might pick the initial spot where you meet up for dates, and then let him suggest where to go from there. You'll get frustrated if you don't have opportunities to take the lead as well. Communication is key here—talk to each other to figure out how to balance things out. As a Libra, you're all about balance, so it shouldn't be too hard for you to find it."

      "content": "Aries men love to take the lead and are natural teachers. Since you Libras love to learn things, pick something he's great at and ask him to show you how to do it. He'll be thrilled that you asked him and he'll naturally assume the role. The learning process is also a great bonding opportunity. For example, if he's a good bowler, tell him you want to learn how. Let him show you the best technique and then you can enjoy the competition when you play him later."

      "title": "He loves to lead the way to new experiences.",
      "content": "He loves to lead the way to new experiences. A Ram has a very adventurous spirit. As a Libra lady, you enjoy adventures too, but you're more comfortable simply going along for the ride. If you show him that you're open to trying new things, he'll want to spend more time with you. [7] X Research source For example, you might try sky diving or bungee jumping together. If you're not feeling quite that adventurous, go hiking or rock climbing instead. Visiting a new town where neither of you has been also gives you the opportunity to discover new things together. Leave room for spontaneity to inject a bit of adventure wherever you can when you're out together. Aries guys tend to be pretty spontaneous and won't hesitate to grab a chance to do something exciting."

      "content": "An Aries guy is an entertainer at heart who loves to be around people. You're both social people who are sure to have plenty of invitations to events. If you take him with you, you give him the opportunity to meet new people, which he'll love. He'll definitely be more attracted to you if he believes you can help expand and enliven his social life. [8] X Research source The two of you make great companions at social events because you both enjoy mingling and don't feel the need to be joined at the hip. He'll enjoy going out with you because he'll realize he doesn't have to worry about you—you're perfectly capable of holding your own."

      "content": "Aries doesn't really like to be tied down. He needs a woman who is independent and confident, someone who doesn't need him to be by her side every second. This can be difficult for a Libra lady, since you can be a little more insecure in a relationship. But your Ram is loyal—if you learn to let go and trust him, he'll stay true to you. Having your own interests is a big help here. If you have things that you're doing on your own, he can go do his own things during those times without having to worry about you."
