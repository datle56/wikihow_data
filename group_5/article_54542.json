      "title": "Check the volume on your TV.",
      "content": "Check the volume on your TV. It sounds silly, but sometimes just making sure your TV isn’t muted or set to a very low volume will solve the problem. Most televisions display the sound level on the screen as you adjust the volume ; look for that in the corner of the screen as you press your remote’s volume button."

      "title": "Check the volume on your other devices.",
      "content": "Check the volume on your other devices. An attached set-top box - or cable box - may have its own remote or a setting on a universal remote to adjust the volume separately from the TV’s built-in speakers. You should also check the device itself, as it may have a physical knob or button to adjust. This applies to external speakers, soundbars, and gaming systems that are connected to your television, as well!"

      "title": "Check your audio output.",
      "content": "Check your audio output. Modern televisions have an option in their settings menu to choose which speakers they use. If you have external speakers, Bluetooth accessories, or other devices connected to your television, it is best to rule them out as the cause of the problem. The manufacturer of your television will have a more detailed guide on finding that menu option, but for now switch the sound to play on your TV speakers and see if that works."

    {
      "title": "Check your Bluetooth devices.",
      "content": "Check your Bluetooth devices. If wireless speakers or headphones are connected to your television and intercepting the audio, it will be more difficult to determine. Even if you switched the audio output in your TV’s settings, the sound could be streaming to headphones in another room as they often override the audio preferences."

      "content": "Unplug it and plug it back in. The most frequently suggested tech solution is suggested for a reason. Start with the power cable, leave it unplugged for 20 seconds, and try again."

      "title": "Check the other cables.",
      "content": "Check the other cables. No luck with the power cable? Depending on how many devices you have - video game systems, speakers, soundbars - you’ll likely see all variety of plugs and cords coming out of the back of your TV, and all of them could be affecting your audio. Make sure they are all undamaged and securely plugged into the correct inputs . If they are, start unplugging them, too. If removing any of the cords fixes the audio problem, you will need to troubleshoot that specific device using manufacturer’s guidelines, but it is nice to narrow it down! It could be as simple as a setting on the device or a faulty cord."

      "content": "Maybe the speakers are broken. Worst case scenario, your internal speakers may be compromised. If you can redirect the sound from your TV to external speakers - either plugged in or wireless - then it is possible that it is a hardware issue and will require a professional’s help. Take your television to an authorized service provider and hopefully they will be able to get your TV back into working order."
