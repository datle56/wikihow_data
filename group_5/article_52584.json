      "title": "Soya chunks are made out of soy flour.",
      "content": "Soya chunks are made out of soy flour. After the oil is extracted from harvested soybeans through a process known as de-fatting, the leftover byproduct is essentially pure soy flour, which is nutritious and loaded with protein. The flour is then dried and forms into pieces or chunks that can be stored until they’re ready to be used in a recipe. [1] X Research source Also known as textured vegetable protein (TVP), soya chunks are often used in vegetarian or vegan recipes as a meat substitute."

      "title": "Boil the soya chunks in water for 2-3 minutes until they’re soft.",
      "content": "Boil the soya chunks in water for 2-3 minutes until they’re soft. Dried soya chunks are tough and hard, but they’re super easy to rehydrate so they’re nice and soft. Fill a pot with 4 cups (950 mL) of water and bring it to a boil. Add in about 2 cups (192 grams) of soya chunks and allow them to boil for a few minutes until they expand and soften. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the chunks in cold water and squeeze out the extra liquid.",
      "content": "Rinse the chunks in cold water and squeeze out the extra liquid. Soya chunks can have a strong odor once they’re rehydrated, so run them under a cold tap to cool them down and help remove the smell. Once they’re nice and cool, squeeze out the extra liquid a handful at a time until you’re left with rehydrated chunks that are ready to use! [3] X Research source You can use the soya chunks as is or mince them into smaller pieces if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "No, you can soak them in a bowl with hot water for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "No, you can soak them in a bowl with hot water for 20 minutes. Simply fill a large bowl or pot with hot water and pour your soya chunks into it. Cover the top with a lid or something like a plate to help retain the heat. After about 20 minutes, check the soya chunks to see if they’re expanded and soft. You can then run them under cold water and squeeze out the excess liquid. [4] X Research source If they aren’t soft and expanded, give them another 5 minutes and then check them again."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can marinate them to infuse them with flavors.",
      "content": "You can marinate them to infuse them with flavors. Make a simple marinade by mixing together 1 tablespoon (6.39 grams) of Tandoori Masala powder, 1 teaspoon (2.71 grams) of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon (1.69 grams) of coriander powder, 1 teaspoon (1.69 grams) of garam masala powder, 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of ginger paste, and some salt. Soak the rehydrated soya chunks in the marinade overnight or for at least 8 hours so they soak up all of the tasty flavorings. [5] X Research source Soya chunks don’t have much of a flavor on their own, but you can soak them in any type of marinade that you like and they’ll take on the flavor of the ingredients you use."

    {
      "title": "You can add soya chunks to basically anything!",
      "content": "You can add soya chunks to basically anything! They’re incredibly versatile and take on the flavor of the dish you add them to. [6] X Research source You can use them like you would use meat in a dish. Add them to a stew or sauce, grill them, or bake them. Try adding them to a tomato paste sauce for a simple, savory dish! [7] X Research source You can also cut up the soya chunks into smaller pieces and mix them with a curd (like cottage cheese), onion, tomato, salt, and pepper to make a “tuna” salad."

    {
      "title": "No, you need to rehydrate them first.",
      "content": "No, you need to rehydrate them first. Dried soya chunks are really hard and can crumble if you try to use them raw. They need to be rehydrated so they can expand and soften into tasty chunks you can use in a variety of recipes. It’s also super easy to rehydrate them, so it’s worth it! [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Yes, you can add them directly into recipes with a lot of liquid.",
      "content": "Yes, you can add them directly into recipes with a lot of liquid. If you’re making something like a chili or a stew, you don’t need to soak or boil the soya chunks first. You can simply drop them into the dish and they’ll soak up all of the delicious flavors and juices. It’s an easy way to add more protein without having to use oil to flavor the soya chunks.

      "content": "Make a simple tomato, green pea, and ginger masala. Puree 2 tomatoes and add them to a pan with just enough water to thin them out. Then, add peas, ginger paste, salt, and some red chili powder (if you want some heat). Let the sauce come to a simmer and let it cook over medium heat for 8-10 minutes so it thickens up. Then, mix in your soya chunks and enjoy this simple masala dish! [10] X Research source You can also add green chilis, onion, and garlic to your tomato puree for even more flavor!"
