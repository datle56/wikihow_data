The main point of registering your business in a state where you do business is providing information about your registered agent. [2] X Research source Essentially, if you're going to be doing business in the state, the state wants to know how to tell you that someone is suing you. That's why you need a separate registered agent in every state where you do business. If you do business in multiple states, you'll need to find someone in each state who will act as your registered agent. Most businesses just use a registered agent service, such as New Business Filing , that has offices in all states."

[10] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source If you don't want to include \"LLC\" in your brand name, you might also get a \"DBA.\" This allows your LLC to do business as whatever your brand is. States also call these trade names, fictitious names, or assumed business names (ABNs). Registering your name offers you limited state trademark protection because no new company can register a name that is the same or similar to yours. DBAs, on the other hand, don't offer any protection at all. Some states require you to register your name even if your headquarters is in another state. For example, if you have a chain of bookstores in Tennessee and North Carolina, you might need to register the name of your company in both states where you have stores."

Some local areas may also require a general license, especially for a brick-and-mortar business in a chartered city. Check with local authorities to determine if you need a general license.

A good general rule is to ask yourself, \"Where does my business have a physical presence?\" If there are physical offices in multiple states, it's likely you'll need to register in those states to retain liability protection. [13] X Research source If your business does business across state lines but doesn't have a physical presence there, you're generally not required to register in the other state. It's still a good idea to get an attorney to draw up contracts as necessary to ensure your home state is your jurisdiction for liability purposes. This is a lot to keep track of.

Most small business owners like LLCs because they get the limited liability of a corporation and the simple operating structure of a sole proprietorship or partnership, not to mention the tax versatility. LLCs are also far simpler and less expensive to set up than corporations and can usually be set up more quickly. [17] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Without the limited liability, if someone sued your business, they could potentially go after your assets as well. But as a member of an LLC, the only thing you risk is whatever you initially invested in the business. Because they have fewer formalities and documentation requirements, it's generally a lot easier to change things with an LLC, including ownership, than it would be with a corporation."
