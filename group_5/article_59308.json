      "title": "Switch off power to the light switch at the breaker box.",
      "content": "Switch off power to the light switch at the breaker box. You can usually find the metal breaker box in your basement, garage, kitchen, or hallway. Check the breaker labels to see which one controls the room with the switch that you’re replacing and flip it to the “OFF” position to completely cut off power to the circuit. [1] X Expert Source James Hornof Master Electrician Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. If you aren’t sure which breaker controls the switch you want to replace, then turn off the main power switch in the breaker box to cut off all the power in your home. Leaving the power on while you work on the light switch puts you at risk for electrocution, so always turn off the power before you start working."

      "content": "Remove the switch plate. The switch plate is the plastic cover over the switch and electrical box that hides the wires. Turn the screws on the switch plate counterclockwise with a screwdriver to loosen them. Then just pull the switch plate straight off of the switch. [2] X Research source If the switch plate is stuck to paint on the wall, run a utility knife around the edges of the switch plate to cut through the paint."

      "content": "Check the switch with a voltage tester to ensure it has no power. Use a voltage tester by touching the tip next to each of the screw terminals on the sides of the switch. If the wire still has power running through it, the tester will light up or beep. If the power is completely turned off, then the tester won’t react at all. [3] X Research source If there’s still power running to the switch, then it’s connected to another circuit breaker than the one you turned off."

      "content": "Inspect the wiring and connections to determine the type of switch. Look at the colors of the terminal screws on the sides of the switch and pay attention to the color of the wire attached to each one. If you see 2 gold terminal screws and 1 green ground screw, then you’re changing a single-pole switch . If there are 1 or 2 black screws, 2 brass terminal screws, and 1 green ground screw, then you're replacing a 3- or 4-way switch . [5] X Research source A single-pole switch is the most common type, and it will be the only switch that controls a light fixture. It will usually have “On” and “Off” printed on the switch. 3- or 4-way switches are usually used in large rooms or hallways so multiple switches control the same light fixture. These switches usually don’t have any words printed on them."

Use your screwdriver to turn each of the screws counterclockwise to loosen them. When the terminal screws are loose, gently unhook the ends of the wires from them. [6] X Research source If the wires are in a slot on the back of the switch, push the end of a small screwdriver in the slot to disconnect them. Single-pole switches have 3 wires connecting to them: a black hot wire leading back to the power source, a black or red hot wire leading to the fixture, and a green or bare copper ground wire. Take a picture of how the wires are attached before you disconnect them to use as a reference when you connect the new switch."

Bend the exposed end of the wire into a hook with a pair of needlenose pliers. Hook the wire underneath the green screw on the bottom of your new single-pole switch . Turn the screw clockwise to tighten it until the wire is secure. [7] X Research source If the exposed end of the wire looks damaged or dirty, cut it off with wire strippers . Strip the wire so there’s 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of wiring at the end. Push-in connections where the wires fit into slots on the back of the switch are less secure than mounting the wires to the screws."

      "content": "Hook the hot wires to the gold terminal screws. One hot wire will be black, but the other may be red, black, or any other color besides green. Use your pliers to bend a small hook on the exposed end of each of the wire. Loop 1 wire underneath each of the gold terminal screws, usually on the top and bottom of your switch. Turn the screws clockwise with your screwdriver to secure the wires. [8] X Research source You can connect either wire to each of the screws. Your switch will still work no matter which way it’s wired."

Go back to your breaker box and flip the breaker to the “On” position so your switch has power again. Try flipping the switch on to make sure it turns your light fixture on. If the light turns on, then you’re finished! [10] X Research source If the switch still doesn’t work, turn off the power to check that you attached the wires securely and to the right terminal screws. If you still have trouble, you may need to contact an electrician."

The common terminal screws on the sides of a switch connect the power source to the fixture and are usually a darker color than the other screws. Look for the wires that attach to the 1 black screw on a 3-way switch or the 2 black screws on a 4-way switch. Rip off a piece of electrical tape and wrap it around each of the wires that are connected to the screws. That way, you remember which wires are the hot wires that carry the current. [11] X Research source A 3-way switch has 4 wires: 1 black hot wire that’s connected to the power source or the fixture, 2 black or red traveler wires running between the switches, and 1 green or bare copper ground wire. A 4-way switch has 5 wires: 2 black or red hot wires connecting to the power source or fixture, 2 black or red traveler wires between the switches, and 1 green or bare ground wire."

If the end of the wire is damaged, snip it off with a pair of wire strippers . Secure the strippers 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the end of the wire.
