      "title": "Know the hotel’s check-in time.",
      "content": "Know the hotel’s check-in time. Nearly all hotels, and especially smaller hotels, have a specific check-in time, usually between 2pm and 4 pm. Check-in times should be listed online, but if you can’t find them, feel free to call the hotel to confirm. If possible, plan to arrive within that timeframe so you can check in immediately. [1] X Research source If there’s a large gap of time between your arrival and the hotel's check-in time, call ahead and ask very politely if you can check-in early, or at least drop your bags. Then, go explore the area! If you are checking in very late, especially if the hotel doesn’t have a 24 hour concierge, communicate your arrival time in advance so the concierge can make the necessary arrangements to receive you.

      "title": "Bring your ID, reservation confirmation, and form of payment to reception.",
      "content": "Bring your ID, reservation confirmation, and form of payment to reception. The front desk of a hotel is called reception, and this is where you go to officially check-in. Greet the concierge and tell them you’d like to check in. They’ll then confirm the reservation and take your payment. Having your ID, confirmation, and payment ready beforehand will make the process run much more smoothly. [3] X Research source For example, your ID may be your driver’s license or passport. If you’re staying abroad, the concierge will usually either copy the front page of your passport or keep your passport for the duration of your stay. Typically, credit cards are the best form of payment to use at a hotel. Most hotels will place a hold of the full amount of your stay plus a percentage as incidentals per day, so it’s best to not give them your debit card. A print out of your reservation confirmation can be useful, especially if you secured a special rate or promotion. If you do not have a reservation, be prepared to be turned away if the hotel has no vacancies. Ask the concierge for suggestions for alternate hotels."

      "content": "Alternatively, opt for self-check-in. These days, many hotels offer various forms of self-check-in. If you’d prefer a quicker process, see if you can check in on the hotel’s app or website or if they have a self-serve kiosk you can use. This may not be an option at every hotel, however.

      "content": "Ask questions and take note of hotel amenities. Note the location and time of breakfast, internet access and passwords, lounges, bars and restaurants, and gym and spa facilities to make your stay more comfortable. Reception and/or the concierge can provide you with a map and recommendations about where to go and what to do nearby."

      "content": "Get your key(s) and inspect your room. Many keys are electronic today, but some hotels still have old-school metal keys that also run the electricity of your room. After grabbing your keys, head up to your room and check it out. Make sure everything is as promised, that it’s well-stocked, and that there are no foul odors or stains on the bed, etc. If you are displeased with the room for whatever reason, politely ask to be relocated. If you’re satisfied, unpack and enjoy your stay! [5] X Research source If a bellhop brings up your luggage, be sure to tip them for their trouble. If you request to be relocated, most hotels will comply if possible. If they cannot place you in a similar room, ask if they will upgrade you to a nicer room or a room with a view. Remember to check for bed bugs , as well. Examine the sheets, mattress, box spring, and headboard for eggs, casings, and stains.

      "content": "Look online to find the best hotel for your needs. Before committing yourself to a reservation, check out different hotels online to determine which one has the best rates and your preferred amenities. Pay attention to the hotel’s location and look for images of the rooms to make sure they’re up to your standards. [7] X Research source Alternatively, give the hotel a call and ask them questions about the location, noise level, walking distance to restaurants, etc. Make note of the hotel’s cancellation policy, as well. Sometimes the unexpected happens, so keep track of the costs associated with canceling your reservation. [8] X Research source Some hotels and hostels are really bare bones, and you might have to bring things like drinkable water and your own linens. Double-check with your hotel to see what is and isn’t included. If you’re driving to the hotel, make sure to locate accessible parking ahead of time for your vehicle, and note the cost and location in your planning. If it’s helpful to you, bring a map so you can easily find the hotel."

      "content": "Book your room online or over the phone. Reserve a room through the hotel’s website by filling out basic information like your full name and which dates you intend to check into and out of the hotel. Alternatively, call the hotel directly to have a worker help you with the booking process. Calling directly can even help you get better deals or secure a room at the last minute. [9] X Research source In general, you’ll pay for your room at check-in, but some hotels may ask you to pay online or at least put your credit card information on file. When booking your room , be sure to include any special requests, like conjoining rooms, quiet rooms, a crib, etc. Make sure you’re old enough to book your room. In most cases, anyone 18 or older can book a hotel room, though some hotels don’t allow anyone under the age of 21 to make a reservation. Find the hotel’s age requirements in their terms and conditions. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask for or save your confirmation number.",
      "content": "Ask for or save your confirmation number. If you spoke to the hotel over the phone, ask for your confirmation number, or if you booked online, write the number down. This will make it easier to confirm your booking before you arrive at the hotel. Call a few days in advance to make sure everything is ready. [11] X Research source If you booked by calling the hotel, ask the worker to repeat your details back to you. This way, you know your reservation is correct and check-in will run much more smoothly. Confirming your reservation ahead of time prevents day-of-arrival mistakes on the hotel's part, and covers you if they do mess something up. Then you can negotiate an upgrade with a clear conscience!"

Mismatching names often make it difficult or impossible to check in, as the hotel needs to confirm your ID to make sure they give the room to the right person. Before leaving for your trip, make sure these details match. [12] X Research source If someone else is paying for your stay, make sure they list you as a guest and share all booking details and confirmation with you so you can check in. You will still need a valid ID when you check in."

This will prevent them from giving your room away altogether. Many hotels have 24-hour reception desks, so you can typically check in at any time after the set check-in time. [16] X Research source"
