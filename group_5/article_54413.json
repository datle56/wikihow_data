To find the reciprocal of any number, just calculate \"1 ÷ (that number).\" For a fraction, the reciprocal is just a different fraction, with the numbers \"flipped\" upside down (inverted). [1] X Research source For instance, the reciprocal of 3 / 4 is 4 / 3 . Any number times its reciprocal will give you 1."

[2] X Research source For a whole number, write that as a fraction; there's no point in calculating it out to a decimal. For instance, the reciprocal of 2 is 1 ÷ 2 = 1 / 2 ."

Remember, the number 1 can always be written as (number)/(the same number), and fractions with the same denominator (lower number) can be added together. [4] X Research source Here's an example with 2 4 / 5 : 2 4 / 5 = 1 + 1 + 4 / 5 = 5 / 5 + 5 / 5 + 4 / 5 = (5+5+4) / 5 = 14 / 5 ."

[6] X Research source For instance, 0.5 = 1 / 2 , and 0.25 = 1 / 4 . Once in fraction form, just flip the fraction to find the reciprocal. For instance, the reciprocal of 0.5 is 2 / 1 = 2."

You can use a calculator to solve this, or continue on to the next step to solve it by hand. [7] X Research source For example, you can find the reciprocal of 0.4 by calculating 1 ÷ 0.4."

      "title": "Change the division problem to use whole numbers.",
      "content": "Change the division problem to use whole numbers. The first step to dividing decimals is to move the decimal point until all the numbers involved are whole numbers. As long as you move the decimal point the same number of spaces for both numbers, you'll get the correct answer. For example, you can take 1 ÷ 0.4 and rewrite it as 10 ÷ 4. In this case, you've moved each decimal place one space to the right, which is the same as multiplying each number by ten."
