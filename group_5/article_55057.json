      "content": "Hold the brake pedal down with your right foot and the clutch with your left. Use both of your feet to press the clutch and the brake pedal down. Keep them both held down all the way. [1] X Research source In a manual car, the clutch is the pedal all the way on the left. The brake is in the middle and the accelerator is on the right. Even if you’re driving a car where the wheel is on the right side, the order of the pedals is usually the same. The clutch is the pedal that transfers power from your engine to the wheels. Holding it down keeps your wheels from spinning while your engine is on. Releasing it completely transfers all of the power from the engine to the wheels."

You may feel the car try to slide back as you start it, but it will stop immediately, so don’t worry. Do not take your feet off of the clutch and brake as you’re starting. [2] X Research source"

Quickly shift your right foot from the brake to the accelerator. Begin releasing the clutch at the same time that you’re pressing down on the accelerator to start moving. [3] X Research source If you start rolling backwards, press the foot brake and pull the handbrake. Start again. This can take some practice to get used to! Releasing the clutch too quickly will cause the car to stall. [4] X Expert Source Ibrahim Onerli Driving Instructor Expert Interview. 18 November 2019."

      "title": "Press the accelerator down and fully release the clutch.",
      "content": "Press the accelerator down and fully release the clutch. As you press the accelerator down, release the clutch completely to get up to speed. You may notice the clutch “biting” or kicking back as you press the accelerator. This is normal, and is an indicator that you’re able to release it and control the car with your accelerator. [5] X Research source Biting refers to the friction you feel in the clutch when you’re accelerating the car. As you rev the engine up, the clutch is trying to mitigate the speed of the wheels, causing some friction in the pedal."

Press the button on the top of the handbrake to release it and pull the handbrake all the way up to its vertical position. Keep the clutch held down all the way while doing this. [6] X Research source This method is a little easier if you struggle shuffling your foot quickly from the brake to the accelerator. It’s basically the same as the first method, except you’re using the handbrake instead of the foot brake."

Move it forward at the same time as you’re pressing the accelerator down to release the brake and move the car forward.

There may be some discrepancy between the clutch and the handbrake if you’re on a really steep incline."
