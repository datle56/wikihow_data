      "content": "“Hold my beer” means someone wants to top or one-up someone else. It’s like saying, “I could do that! Hold my beer while I demonstrate!” Usually, the activity in question is something ridiculous or comical, like parkouring over a bench, but it could be something more tame too, like acing a test. The phrase is meant to be lighthearted and joking. “I can do a backflip too! Hold my beer!” “A hot dog eating contest? Hold my beer.” “Hold my beer” can also be abbreviated as HMB."

It’s like a friend telling you to watch their drink while they go do a (potentially stupid) stunt. People say, “Hold my beer,” as a joking way of saying, “I’m about to do something reckless.” [1] X Research source “There’s a tornado warning! Hold my beer, I’m gonna go watch.” “I bet I can make that jump. Hold my beer!” “Hold my beer” can also be a comment on someone doing something dangerous, like jumping from a roof into a pool."

Hold my beer is also commonly used as a meme to make fun of when a celebrity, brand, or random person online makes an even bigger mistake than one of their peers, or when they manage to do something better. It’s like they’re saying, “Hold my beer, I can do something worse/better than them.” [2] X Research source Tesla: “We ruined our brand loyalty in just 2 months.” Southwest Airlines: “Hold my beer.” TikToker: “I just manifested the most amazing relationship!” Someone making a stitch: “Hold my beer!

Back in the mid-1990s, Southern comedian Jeff Foxworthy had a joke formula that poked fun at the “redneck” life he was exposed to. It went, “You might be a redneck if your last words before losing consciousness have ever been, “Hey, y’all, watch this!” before doing something dangerous. This eventually inspired the phrase we know and love so well: “Hold my beer and watch this!” [3] X Research source"

Even if there’s no way you can compete (you probably can’t outrun an Olympian), it can still make a great joke! In most cases, folks will assume you’re crackin’ a joke in the first place. If you’re retweeting or stitching with someone online, include a photo or video of your one-up as proof! Them: “My burger recipe is the best there is.” You: “Oh yeah? Hold my beer!” Them: “I have the cutest dog!” You: “Hold my beer and LOOK AT THIS GOOD BOY! 🐶”"

While you shouldn’t actually go through with something that could hurt or embarrass you, it’s fun to pretend! Joke about someone holding your beer for any scenario, from asking out a stranger at a bar jumping into the ocean in the middle of winter. Them: “Bet you can’t ride that bike without handlebars.” You: “Hold my beer!” “I’ll show those Alaskan fishermen how it’s done. Hold my beer!” Keep in mind that these are hypothetical or humorous situations. Have a real “hold my beer” moment at your own risk!"

      "content": "Tweet or meme “Hold my beer” to call out major events or public figures as flops. Have you ever skimmed a news headline and said, “Huh?” In situations where major events seem contradictory or two celebs or politicians almost seem like they’re competing to fail harder, you could highlight this in an “HMB” tweet. The format works best as two lines of dialogue between people, brands, or organizations where one does something “dumber” than the other. For example, if one brand sells a product with a defect and then one of their competitors makes an even bigger error, you could format the joke like: Brand 1: “We’re gonna charge you a fortune for a product that doesn’t work!” Brand 2: “Hold my beer.”"

That’s gotta hurt.”). The caption “Hold my beer” implies that the person in the video saw someone do the stunt successfully, then tried (and failed) to imitate it.
