Is it to amplify your energy, is it to give you protection? ...Whatever your intention is is going to affect the stones that you choose for your chakra bracelet.\" For example, if you’re dealing with a stressful work environment, you might select a bracelet with orange beads to promote adaptability, yellow for determination, and/or blue for self-knowledge and the courage to ask for what you need. If you’d like to become more motivated to achieve your goals, you might pick a bracelet with violet beads, for self-control and enlightenment, indigo, for vision and inner knowledge, and/or yellow, for motivation and energy."

      "title": "Cleanse your bracelet regularly to promote positive energy.",
      "content": "Cleanse your bracelet regularly to promote positive energy. The more you wear your bracelet, the more likely its gemstones are to gather negative energy, which can keep them from working as effectively. As a good rule of thumb, cleanse your bracelet every month or so, using any of the following methods: Smudging : Light palo santo or white sage, and guide the burning palo santo or sage over your bracelet while praying to the universe to restore the gems’ healing energies . Moonlight charging : Place your bracelet outside all night to let the moonlight charge them . (You can do this any night, but it’s most effective under a full moon.) Brown rice : Place your bracelet in a bowl of uncooked rice. Cover it. Leave it for about 24 hours to let it recharge. Sound cleansing : Place your bracelet in a singing bowl and strike the bowl with the mallet to wash the stones in sound. You can also use a tuning fork or bell to create sound if you don't have a singing bowl. Christensen advises cleansing your bracelet as soon as you get it, as the gems' energy may be compromised by \"whoever is selling it, [who]ever packaged it...not to mention if there was any kind of trauma involved in how the stone is mined, you know, any kind of environmental things that might have happened.\""
