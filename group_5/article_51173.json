      "content": "Check for small spots where the display looks brighter. If you have a small spot on your screen where the display is brighter, not necessarily white, your phone likely has an issue with the backlight layer. This is usually caused by a component in the phone pressing against the backlight layer, causing it to be pressed closer to the screen, which can make the image appear brighter. To fix the backlight layer, contact your phone manufacturer or a certified phone repair specialist. The phone may need to have the internal components put back in place, or your entire display may need to be replaced. One common culprit is a swollen battery pressing against the backlight layer. If this is the case, your phone manufacturer may replace it entirely if it's still under warranty."

      "content": "Check the phone's frame for any damage. If you've dropped your phone, this can damage or bend the frame , which can then cause the screen to have display issues such as bright spots. This is because the screen isn't lying flat anymore, and part of the display may look bright or distorted. To fix the frame, you must have your phone repaired by your phone manufacturer or a certified repair specialist. Attempting to fix it on your own could lead to more damage and void your warranty."

      "title": "Check your screen protector for air bubbles or dust particles.",
      "content": "Check your screen protector for air bubbles or dust particles. A bit of dust under your screen protector can cause a light-colored speck to appear on your phone screen, even when the phone is off. Air bubbles can also look like light spots due to the trapped air beneath the screen protector, causing the material to not adhere to your phone screen. To fix this, simply remove the screen protector, clean your phone screen, and replace the screen protector with a new one. Make sure you're doing this in an area free from dust, dirt, pet hair, or other airborne particles so you don't get anything under the screen protector again."
