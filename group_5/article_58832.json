Every project is different and may or may not include what other projects have. The Level Of Detail (LOD) is determined by each Architect for each project. The growing trend is for Architects to have more, rather than less detail, because the Contractors then have less guesswork and can more easily understand what to include and what to price. Some builders may or may not have comments about the LOD, but that has no relevance to what the licensed Architect who is designing the project feels is necessary to properly explain the design."

      "title": "Learn how to lay out a building footprint from architectural plans.",
      "content": "Learn how to lay out a building footprint from architectural plans. To do this, you will have to locate the element of construction you are reviewing to implement a portion of your work. If you are laying out the location of the building, you will first look at the site plan for location of existing buildings, structures, or property lines so you have a reference point to begin measuring to your building footprint. Some plans simply give a coordinate grid position using northings and eastings, and you will need a \"total station\" surveyor's transit to locate these points. Here is what you'll need to do to lay out a building footprint from the plans: Lay out your building on the site by either the above referenced plan or the measurements given on the site plan. Measure to locations, preferably corners, on one side of the building, and check for any \"checkpoints\" to verify the accuracy of your layout. If you cannot absolutely establish an exact building line, you may have to suppose the location is correct and continue. This is widely accepted in cases where the site is very large, allowing for tolerance, but on a crowded lot or site, the location must be exact. Establish the elevation you will work from. This may be a height relative to a nearby roadway, or an elevation determined from sea level. Your site plan or architectural floor plan should have a bench mark (a bench mark refers to some item, such as a manhole lid or survey waypoint with a known elevation) elevation or a \"height above existing grade\" as a starting point. Use your plan to measure the location of each corner of the building, including offsets. Remember what exact element of construction you are using for your layout. You may mark an outside wall line , a foundation line , or a column line , depending on the type of construction and the most practical element for making subsequent measurements. For instance, if you are building a structural steel building with I-beam columns which require setting anchor bolts to secure them, you may begin your building layout with the centerline of these columns, where if you are building a wood-framed residential structure with a monolithic slab floor, the edge of the slab would be your best choice for the initial layout."

      "content": "Reference the description of various sheets to find an element of construction you are going to use in the work you will perform. Plumbers use the Architect's floor plan to locate walls so the pipes they stub up will be concealed inside the wall cavity when the building is constructed, then use their plumbing floor plan to find out what types and sizes of pipes are required to service a particular fixture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the dimension scale where measurements are not provided.",
      "content": "Use the dimension scale where measurements are not provided. As a rule, architectural plans are drawn to a \"scale\". An example would be, 1 inch (2.5 cm) equals 10 feet (3 m) (1\"=10'), so measuring between to walls on the plan sheet means for each inch, the distance is 10 feet (3.0 m). A scale rule will make this much easier, but be careful to match the rule scale to the plan's scale. Architects often use a scale of fractions, such as a 1/32 scale, engineers usually use an inch per foot scale. Some plans or details are not to scale, and should be marked \"(NTS)\"."

      "content": "Read all the notes on a page. Often a particular element has special considerations which are more easily described verbally than drawn, and notes are a tool the architect will use to illustrate them. [1] X Research source [​​v161695_b01]. 6 October 2022. You may see a table of notes on the side of a sheet, with numbers identifying the note location on the plan (a number with a circle, square, or triangle around it) and a corresponding numbered statement describing the situation on the side of the sheet. Sometimes there may be a single sheet or several sheets of Numbered Drawing Notes that consolidate all or most of the drawing notes for an entire set of drawings. Many Architects organize these numbered notes into a CSI (Construction Specifications Institute) method utilizing 1-16 or even more Divisions that categorize the drawing notes into subsections. For instance: a note \"4-127\" may refer to a type of Masonry, as Division 4 represents Masonry. A note 8-2243 may refer to a window or door component, because Division 8 is Doors & Windows."

      "content": "Learn to recognize the different types of lines the architects and engineers may use. You should have a specific keynote table for section of plans, and this will provide information on the abbreviations, symbols, and specific lines used in each section of the plans. An example would be that the electrical plans, a circuit may have the \"home run\" \"leg\" (the wire going from the first junction box in a circuit to the panel box (the power source) highlighted or in darker ink than other circuits, and exposed conduits may be indicated by a solid line, and concealed conduits by a dotted or broken line. Because there are many different line usages indicating different type walls, piping, wiring, and other features, you will have to see individual plan page \"key notes\" to understand them."

      "content": "Use a Builder's Calculator to add dimensions when determining distances on your plans. These are calculators which add feet and inches, fractions, or metric measurements. Often, an architect will not give a measurement to a specific plan item, from a baseline such as the \"' OBL \" (outside building line), so you will need to be able to add the distances each feature which has a measurement provided, to get the total distance. An example would be finding the center line of a bathroom wall to locate the potable water pipe stub up. You may have to add the distance given from the OBL to the living room wall, then the distance to a hallway wall, then across a bedroom, to the bathroom wall in question. This might look like this: (11' 5 ) + (5' 2\") + (12' 4\")= 28' 11."

      "content": "Use CAD (Computer Assisted Design) building plans. If you have a set of architectural plans in an electronic form, as on a CD, you will need a version of the original \"cad\" program which created it to open the files. \"AutoCAD\" is a popular, but very expensive, professional design program, and the designer will usually include a \"Viewer\" on the disc which you can install on your computer to view files, so that actual plan pages appear on your screen, but without the full program, you cannot manipulate design components or change the drawings. However, most Architectural firms know how to save their CAD and other computerized files as a PDF, which they will normally e-mail to you and you will be able to open and view (although not alter, as the Architects are responsible for the integrity of their work)."

They are either bound or stapled on the left edge, and allowing them to be torn from the bindings, ripped apart by mishandling, laid out in the sun to fade the ink, or left in the rain can make them difficult to use. These documents can cost hundreds of dollars (US) to replace, so try to protect them, and have a flat, wide, protected work surface to unroll and read them on."

Specifications are usually printed and kept in a binder, and they list descriptions of methods and materials used in the project, as well as testing methods, quality control information, geotechnical data, and other information useful in building the project. However, some Architects do include the specifications on the drawing sheets (to insure that the specs will not be misplaced). Specifications are the architect's way of indicating the quality standards, materials, model numbers, and other characteristics of projects. Even single family homes often have specifications. Specifications are traditionally arranged in numbered sections, typically Division 1-16, although these numbers have expanded considerably during the last decade. Many Architects number their paragraphs so that they can cross-reference actual verbiage from the specifications onto their drawings using the paragraph numbers, which improves the coordination of the various trades."

Many Architects locate a blank section, often in the lower right corner of their sheets, just above the sheet number, reserved for a list of Revisions. Revisions are often numbered and enclosed within a triangle, octagon, circle or other consistent symbol. To the right of each revision number will be the date of the revision, then to the right of that, a brief description of the revision. Then on the drawing area of the sheet, that numbered symbol will appear in the area where the revision was made, often along with a \"revision cloud\", which is usually depicted with a lumpy series of arcs resembled a cartoon cloud, encircling the area in which the revisions where made. This allows everyone to understand exactly what has changed. Also, the Architect will normally issue an e-mail summarizing the revisions contained in each addendum, sent simultaneously to the Owner and registered bidders. It is then up to the various bidders to convey this information change to their subcontractors and material providers."
