      "content": "A wild Pokémon nets you a certain amount of Stardust when caught. Whenever you have your game open, aim to successfully catch as many Pokémon as you can. Each day, the first Pokémon you catch earns you an 1,800 Stardust bonus (9,000 if you’ve consistently caught Pokémon for a week straight). A basic Pokémon in its first tier of evolution gets you 100 base Stardust; a second-tier evolution gets you 300; and a fully-evolved Pokémon gets you 500. [1] X Research source Certain types of Pokémon net you extra Stardust depending on the type of weather that’s occurring in your area. Pokémon affected by this bonus will have a swirl of wind surrounding them. Specific Pokémon get you a larger base amount of Stardust, like the Meowth evolutionary line (including the Alolan versions), the Paras evolutionary line, and the Shellder evolutionary line."
