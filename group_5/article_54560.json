      "content": "Stick to pieces of furniture that are useful and in good condition. Some of the easiest and most profitable pieces to flip when you’re getting started are end tables, nightstands, buffet cabinets, and dressers. Before you buy any furniture, check it for cracks or damage. Test any moving pieces, like drawers or cabinet hinges, to make sure they open and close smoothly. [1] X Research source Try to pay $250 USD or less for buffet cabinets, $150 USD or less for dressers, and $25 USD or less for small end tables and nightstands. Avoid buying furniture that’s damaged or requires a lot of repairs since it won’t be as profitable. Keep your eye on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist to see which types of furniture are trending or in demand."

      "content": "Check online marketplaces to find local sellers. Log in to Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist and browse through the furniture listings. Start by looking in the “Free” category for items since you’ll make the most money from flipping them. If you see a piece of furniture that you’re interested in, contact the seller to ask them more questions about the piece and schedule a pickup. [3] X Research source Choose listings that have the furniture’s dimensions and multiple, high-quality pictures posted so you avoid scams or poor-quality items. Try to negotiate a lower price if the item is too expensive. The seller may be willing to drop the price if they’re trying to quickly sell the item."

      "content": "Browse through yard and estate sales for antique furniture. Look for garage sales in your area using social media or by checking the newspaper. Pay special attention to any listings that specifically mention old or antique furniture and prioritize them. Try to get to the sale early so you can see all of the items available before someone else purchases them. [4] X Research source Make sure you bring a truck or van to the sales you’re visiting so you can easily transport any furniture you buy. Alternatively, check the side of the road on trash collection days, especially if there’s a bulk item pickup, since you may find lightly used furniture people are getting rid of."

      "content": "Ask friends and family if they have any furniture they don’t want. Let everyone know that you’re on the lookout for cheap or free furniture, and ask if they have any old pieces they’re not using. Even if the people you know don’t have any furniture, they’ll keep their eyes out and tell you if they find any pieces you’re interested in. [5] X Research source If you have friends that are moving, ask them if they’re taking all the furniture with them. They may be updating their items for their new home and have old furniture they’re leaving behind."

All your supplies may cost around $100+ USD to get started, but choosing high-quality tools will ensure they’ll last for all the future projects you work on. The starting supplies you’ll need are: [6] X Research source Basic tools, like a hammer, screwdriver, and pliers All-purpose cleaner or degreaser Sanding sponges or an electric sander Paintbrushes Primer Paint or stain Polyurethane or shellac sealant"

Wipe the entire surface to remove any buildup or grime that would affect the paint or stain. If there’s really stubborn buildup, use a commercial degreaser instead. After you clean the piece, wipe it with a damp cloth to remove the residual cleaner. [7] X Research source If your piece of furniture has peeling or blistered paint, brush on a paint stripper onto the surface. Once the paint starts to bubble and lift up, use a putty knife to scrape it off. [8] X Research source If your furniture has knobs, handles, hinges, or other pieces of hardware, unscrew them before you start cleaning."

      "title": "Sand your furniture to distress or scuff the old finish.",
      "content": "Sand your furniture to distress or scuff the old finish. If you’re working on a small end table or nightstand, rub the surface with a sanding sponge. Use small circular motions until you expose bare wood underneath the paint or stain. For larger pieces like cabinets and dressers, use an electric sander so it goes by faster. [9] X Research source Sanding the surface ensures primer, paint, or stain bonds well to the wood and creates a smooth, even finish. If you’re using chalk paint , you may not need to sand your furniture. Check the packaging to see what it recommends."

      "title": "Apply primer to your furniture if you’re painting.",
      "content": "Apply primer to your furniture if you’re painting. Work in a well-ventilated area, like a garage or a room with open windows. Use a paintbrush or a roller to spread the primer over the furniture’s surface. Apply a thin coat at first and let it dry for about 1–2 hours. If you can still see the wood through the primer, paint another coat and wait another few hours for it to dry. [10] X Research source Check if your paint already has primer mixed in. If it does, you don’t need to apply primer as a separate coat. Avoid using primer if you plan on staining your furniture. Primer gives your paint an even finish and prevents knotted wood from showing through."

      "title": "Paint",
      "content": "Paint or stain the piece. If you want to give the furniture a modern twist with a pop of color, then use paint. If you want to make the piece look classier and maintain the look of the wood grain, choose stain instead. Apply thin coats of paint or stain to the entire piece, and give it about an hour to dry in between each one. Once your furniture has a smooth, even coloration, let the paint or stain dry completely. [11] X Research source Wipe the excess stain off in between coats so the wood doesn’t get darker than you expect it to. Try to avoid using bright, bold colors when you’re painting since it may make the piece tougher to sell. Stick to white, black, or muted neutral tones so more buyers are interested."

      "content": "Coat the surface with a sealant to protect it. Use either polyurethane or shellac as a protective topcoat. Dip a brush in your sealant and paint it onto the surface to seal the wood . Let the sealant dry for 1–2 hours before lightly sanding the surface and applying a second coat. [12] X Research source Sealant prevents wooden furniture from getting water-damaged and protects the surface from small nicks and dents."

Place a few objects on the piece, such as a lamp, a potted plant, or a small stack of books to stage it. [13] X Research source Take at least 6 photos of the furniture at eye level and try to capture every angle so the buyer can see all the details of the piece. [14] X Research source Taking the time to stage your furniture helps a buyer get a better picture of what the piece would like in their home."

      "content": "Price your furniture competitively so you turn a profit. Check if there are any other similar pieces of furniture listed on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist to get an idea of what buyers are willing to pay in your area. Then, consider how much money you spent on the furniture, what your supplies cost, and how much time you put into the work. Prices will vary depending on your local market and your costs, but some example asking prices are: [15] X Research source Dressers: $300–450+ USD Buffet cabinets: $400–500+ USD Nightstands: $80–100+ USD End tables: $50–60+ USD Set your prices on the higher end of the range. That way, if a buyer negotiates for a lower price, you’re still earning a profit on the piece."

List the brand name (if you know it), dimensions, and any other distinguishing features in the listing so the buyer knows what to expect. Be sure to mention if you’ll deliver the furniture to the buyer or if it’s a local pickup. Be honest about any damage or defects you notice since the buyer will appreciate knowing them upfront.

      "title": "List your furniture on online marketplaces.",
      "content": "List your furniture on online marketplaces. Post the listing along with any pictures you took on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist to sell the pieces locally. Share the listings on your personal account too so your friends and family see you’re selling your furniture. When someone is interested in the piece, answer any questions they have and set up a time when they can pick up the furniture. [17] X Research source It’s okay to list the same items on multiple sites or pages so they get more visibility, but make sure to delete the posts as soon as the item sells so you don’t keep getting inquiries about it. If you’re not having any luck through online marketplaces, reach out to thrift stores or antique malls to see if you can rent booth space to sell your items. The store may take a percentage of the profits, but more people will potentially see the piece. If you’re serious about flipping furniture and want to make it a more official side hustle, create a website or Facebook page to share pics and list your items. Friends and family are always a good place to start to help market things. Social media and channels are also helpful, but the content and merchandise should be good quality. If you are a beginner, asking for referrals is a great place to start. You can be more successful if someone personally recommends your products or services. If you have a website, improve your SEO."
