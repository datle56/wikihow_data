      "content": "See your doctor for FSH testing and diagnosis. A simple blood test can determine whether your FSH levels are higher or lower than normal for your circumstances. If the test reveals abnormal FSH levels, your doctor will use additional testing to diagnose the underlying cause(s) before developing a treatment plan with you. [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source In males, normal FSH levels range from 1.4 to 15.5 IU/ml. The range for females is much wider, depending on their age and menstrual cycle. To diagnose the cause of abnormal FSH levels, your doctor may look at hormonal panels that compare the level of certain hormones in the body (such as GnRH and estrogen), or they may do a biochemical analysis, which looks at enzymes and other substances that affect the operation of certain organs and glands. In certain situations, you doctor may turn to radiographic methods to diagnose the cause of abnormal FSH levels, such as ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with conditions that can impact FSH levels. FSH levels are determined by a complex and delicate network of hormones. Therefore, there are a large number of conditions that can affect your body's production of FSH. These underlying conditions must be identified and treated in order for FSH levels to return to normal levels. Some of the most common conditions that can impact FSH include: [2] X Research source Aging: In females, FSH levels naturally increase during their 30s and 40s as menopause approaches. High FSH levels negatively impact fertility. [3] X Expert Source Joshua U. Klein, MD, FACOG Board Certified Reproductive Endocrinologist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. Polycystic ovarian syndrome: With this condition, there are multiple cystic follicles in the ovaries, which leads to the excessive production of estrogens and androgens. High levels of these hormones can significantly lower FSH levels. Hypopituitarism: With this condition, the function of the pituitary gland is suppressed, which can greatly affect the levels of FSH, since this is where FSH is produced. Hypogonadism: As a result of many different syndromes, the diminished functional activity of the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) can interfere with FSH levels. Tumors: A tumor in one of several different locations—such as the pituitary gland, the ovaries, or the testes—can cause abnormal FSH levels."

      "content": "Follow the therapy regimen recommended by your medical team. The specific treatments can vary widely, based on your current FSH levels, the underlying causes, and your specific circumstances—for instance, if you’re a female in your late 30s and are trying to get pregnant. If you’re undergoing fertility treatments, you’ll need to follow a very specific regimen, which may include injections and/or pills, to manage your FSH levels. In some cases, you may be prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT involves using medication in tablet, topical gel, skin patch, or vaginal ring form to adjust the levels of hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. This adjustment can, in turn, improve your FSH levels. Whatever treatments you are prescribed, it’s essential that you follow your medical team’s instructions to the letter. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, get clarifications, or request demonstrations."

      "content": "Undergo surgery, if necessary, to remove any tumors or cysts. In some circumstances, abnormal FSH levels are caused by a tumor or cyst on the ovaries, testes, or pituitary gland. Keep in mind that most cysts and tumors are not life-threatening, but having them removed surgically may improve your FSH levels and address other medical issues you may be experiencing. [4] X Research source The complexity of the surgery and the risks involved will vary greatly based on your specific circumstances. Discuss your condition and your options with your medical team so that you’re informed and prepared."

      "content": "Eat more foods containing omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in the production of hormones in the body, which may in turn improve FSH levels. There is some evidence that increasing omega-3 intake through diet or supplements may decrease elevated FSH levels in some cases. Although some studies support the use of Omega-3 fatty acids for lowering FSH levels, more research needs to be done to determine whether it is safe and effective. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Talk to your doctor before trying to adjust your FSH levels with any type of dietary, supplementation, or lifestyle change program. Medical intervention is usually the best option, and it’s important for your doctor to be informed about any other treatments you’re using. Good food sources of omega-3 include oily fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines, herring, and anchovies), walnuts, flax seeds, seaweed, and kidney beans, among others. Omega-3 supplements are also available."

Dark green leafy vegetables provide the body with a range of vitamins and minerals that support a healthy endocrine system, which, in turn, may help improve your FSH levels.

This can be done by blending kale into a morning smoothie, eating a green salad for lunch, and including at least two portions of green or sea veggies with dinner. If you’re on a blood thinner, you may need to avoid eating dark green leafy vegetables. Talk to your doctor."

When you are feeling stressed out, your body releases stress hormones (such as cortisol), which can in turn throw your FSH and other hormone levels out of balance. Therefore, reducing stress may help to improve your FSH levels.

      "content": "Try fertility massage to possibly improve FSH levels. A relaxing massage can certainly reduce stress, and there’s some evidence that stress reduction can improve FSH levels. However, there’s no real evidence that a specific “fertility massage” will provide particular benefits. Keep this in mind before booking a massage with a practitioner who offers fertility massage sessions. While some people think fertility massage has a positive effect, current research does not support its use. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may instead try self-massage to potentially stimulate the glands that manage FSH and other hormones. Try using gentle circular motions to massage your lower abdomen for 10 to 15 minutes each day. If you don’t mind the lack of scientific evidence supporting it, you might also try rubbing the ball of your big toe. In reflexology, the big toe is linked to the pituitary gland, which is essential for balancing hormone production in the body."

A quick search online will reveal numerous at-home and in-clinic options for “fertility cleanses,” which claim to cleanse excess hormones from the body. Supporters claim that cleansing before trying to get pregnant can increase your chances of success. However, there’s no reliable medical evidence to support this, and these \"cleanses\" can often present serious health risks, contrary to their claims. Talk to your medical team first if you’re considering doing a fertility cleanse to improve your FSH levels and other fertility markers. Make sure you’re fully aware of any risks involved before deciding whether to proceed."
