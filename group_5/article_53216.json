A pregnant dog’s nipples will become larger and rosier during the first month of pregnancy. [1] X Expert Source Kateryna Zabashta Dog Breeder Expert Interview. 19 March 2021. Dogs don’t produce milk until the end of gestation or when the puppies are born; however, the nipples may leak a clear or milky discharge throughout the pregnancy."

They may be more affectionate and cuddly and want to play less. Your dog isn’t being lazy—she’s saving her energy to grow her puppies! [2] X Expert Source Kateryna Zabashta Dog Breeder Expert Interview. 19 March 2021. For instance, if she’s napping more often and falling behind on her walks, it may be because she’s pregnant."

In the early stages of pregnancy, your dog may eat less and experience morning sickness.

By the second month, she may start eating a lot and get a bigger appetite than usual—she has more mouths to feed, after all.

If your dog is constantly throwing up and eating and drinking very little, it may be a good idea to see a vet to ensure that her and her puppies are healthy."

Her expanding center is a positive sign, as healthy pregnant dogs gain 20 to 50% of their weight during pregnancy. Typically, you’ll be able to see a distended tummy when she’s 45 to 50 days pregnant.

      "content": "Ask your vet to perform an abdominal palpation on your dog. A vet can look for initial signs of pregnancy by massaging your dog’s abdomen. Not only is this the cheapest way to examine your dog, but it’s also less invasive. Basically, the vet will feel your dog’s stomach for the puppies. This test is the most successful between day 21 and 31 of gestation. [7] X Research source The best time for abdominal palpation is day 28 because the puppies are now big enough to make a bump in the womb. By day 35, each puppy is surrounded by their own fluid, making it harder for a vet to accurately predict the number and size of the puppies. Keep in mind that an abdominal palpation isn’t always conclusive. Depending on your dog’s anatomy and the puppies positioning, a vet may suggest another testing option."

While X-rays are not typically the first recommendation for detecting pregnancy in a dog, they can be effective during the later stages of pregnancy. These radio-active scans are an excellent way to determine the number of puppies in the litter and spot any abnormalities in the mother or puppies’s development. X-rays give the best results after day 50 of gestation, but a vet may recommend one sooner if there’s a medical complication. [11] X Research source Sedation may be necessary when X-raying a dog, which can drop a pregnant dog’s blood pressure and put her and her puppies at risk. Radiography isn’t typically recommended unless a specific diagnosis is needed."

However, if the dog came to you as an adult from a rescue center, you might not know. Take your dog to the vet just to be sure, as they can do a quick examination to see if pregnancy is possible. An unspayed dog comes into heat twice a year, so if you’ve owned her for over 9 months and she hasn’t been in heat, she’s probably been spayed. Heat is the clinical term for a female dog’s reproduction cycle. Spaying a dog is eliminates the ability to have a litter and breeding instincts. [12] X Research source There are 4 stages in a dog’s reproductive cycle: proestrus, estrus, diestrus, and anestrus. A female dog is most likely to get pregnant in the estrus stage, which can last 3 to 4 days or 7 to 11 days. [13] X Research source While the duration of heat depends on the individual dog, it’s usually about 18 days and starts between 6 and 24 months of age.

An enlarged, swollen vulva (the outer part of the vagina) often starts just before heat starts. Bloody discharge occurs the first 7 to 10 days and may become a lighter color in the middle of the cycle. [15] X Expert Source Kateryna Zabashta Dog Breeder Expert Interview. 19 March 2021. Place a white sheet or towel on your dog's bed to see if she’s in heat. This way, you can catch the vaginal discharge before your dog cleans herself.

      "content": "Notice if your dog is abnormally calm or aggressive. Dogs in heat experience hormonal imbalances. Because of this, they may act differently. How your dog behaves depends on her usual demeanor and personality: if she’s usually placid, she may become short-tempered; if she’s home-loving, she may start wandering. [16] X Research source Aside from a slight behavioral change, your dog should be in good health. If your dog lacks energy, loses her appetite, vomits, or drinks heavily, contact a vet for advice, as this may be a sign of an underlying womb condition like pyometra."

Check-in with the suspected dog’s owner to see if they’ve been neutered. If they have, another dog may be the father; if not, they may be responsible for your dog’s future puppies. If a dog has been castrated 4 weeks before mating, there’s a very small chance that some of his sperm was left behind after the procedure, and he could impregnate another dog."

Relay what you know about your dog’s heat cycle and when you suspect she mated. Based on the hormonal stage of her heat, a vet can predict the gestation of the pregnancy. [18] X Research source From the first day of diestrus (the 3rd stage of heat), gestation is 56 to 58 days. From the initial rise in progesterone, 64 to 66 days. Keep in mind that if the dog mated but is still in heat, it’s too early to know if she’s pregnant."

Believe it or not, some conditions can make a dog appear and act like she’s pregnant when she’s not, such as false pregnancies and pyometra. Pseudopregnancy or false pregnancy is often caused by a hormonal imbalance after heat and resolves itself on its own. [19] X Research source Pyometra, on the other hand, is a bacterial infection that causes the womb to fill with pus and can be life-threatening. [20] X Research source Pyometra can cause an enlarged stomach, extreme third, loss of appetite, blood poisoning, organ failure, and if left untreated, death. Always bring your dog to the vet if you suspect they’re pregnant, as a vet can provide life-saving treatments if necessary.
