      "content": "Cut the pants down to the length you want the skirt to be. It would be a very good idea to make the skirt a little longer than you think you want it to be. Remember, it is easier to take away length an to add it again. Set the cut-off pant legs aside for another project. If you want to hem the skirt, cut it 1½ inches (3.81 centimeters) longer than you want it to be. Consider trying the jeans on first, then making a mark with a pen, chalk or pins where you want to cut them."

Cut up along the front and back crotch seams by 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to 7.62 centimeters), or until you reach the end of the curved part.

Close this gap as much as possible by moving the two cut edges together and overlapping them. Pin the gap shut, then repeat the process for the back. [3] X Research source You can have the bottom inch (2.54 centimeter) or so open. If the bottom of your skirt become too narrow, you will have to add a panel to it.
