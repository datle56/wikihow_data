It depends a little bit on the laws where you live, but expect to spend around 45 hours in a classroom learning about the rules of the road, and 22 hours behind a wheel with an instructor before you get your license. Again, these requirements differ from state to state, so it may be a little longer or shorter for you. [1] X Research source This primarily applies to the US, although a lot of countries have a comparable system for people who want a driver’s license. Some states require fewer hours. Washington, for example, only requires 30 hours of classwork and 6 hours of practice behind the wheel. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "It may take up to 6 months if you need an under-18 learner’s permit. In most states, you need a learner’s permit if you’re under 18 and you want to get your driver’s license. A learner’s permit allows you to drive only if there’s an adult with a driver’s license with you in the car. This is a sort of probationary period where you’ll get real-life practice driving before you apply for your license. [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source If you’re over 18, you’re typically given a provisional driver’s license. So long as you don’t get any tickets or have any accidents, you’ll be given a normal driver’s license after 30 days or so. To qualify for a driver’s license, your normally need to pass an eye and hearing test. In some states, you can’t have a criminal offense on your record pertaining to carjacking. In most states, you have to be 16 years old to begin this process. The big exceptions are South Dakota, where you can start at 14, and Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota where you have to be 15. Some states, like Georgia, only offer provisional driver’s licenses if you’re under 18. The coursework may only take around 70 hours, but you may need to wait a year or two until you’re 18 for a driver’s license. [4] X Research source"

Here’s how the costs typically break down: [5] X Research source Classroom instruction: $50-150 Behind-the-wheel training: $100-300 Driver’s permit: $5-25 Driver’s license test and processing: $0-50"

If you’re still in high school, ask your counselor or someone in the administration if your school offers driving courses—most high schools will have driving courses before or after school. Pay any tuition fees and sign up. If you're over a certain age, you may be able to skip driving school entirely. It varies state by state, but usually, the cutoff is between 18-25. Check your state laws and if you're all cleared to skip driving school, all you have to do is fulfill your state's practice requirements and take the test (which we discuss in steps 4 and 5 of this section). In Tennessee, West Virginia, Wyoming, or Missouri, there are no driving school requirements. You do have to drive with an adult for more than 30 hours in most of those states though, and then you'll need to take the test. [6] X Research source"

They’ll also cover basic vehicle safety, how to change lanes, and how to enter and exit roadways safely. It depends on where you live, but expect your drivers ed coursework to take roughly 4-8 weeks depending on how often your class meets. Your driver’s ed teacher will be the one signing off on your work, so if you don’t pay attention or you fall asleep in class, they may force you to retake the class. You will be tested on what you learn in driver’s ed, so take notes! It’ll help when it comes time to study for your licensing test.

Your instructor will sign off on a timesheet proving that you completed your practice hours. Don’t lose it! You’ll need to turn in your documents when you take the final exam at the DMV. While you have your learner’s permit, you’ll typically be allowed to drive in your spare time so long as there’s an adult with a driver’s license in the vehicle with you. If you live in a state with no driver’s school programs, you’ll need an adult to monitor you drive for 30-60 hours and fill out a form proving they watched you."
