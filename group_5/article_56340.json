      "content": "Use an alternate entrance and exit. If your cat is constantly hanging out by the front door, waiting to make its escape when some unwitting person opens it, try exiting out a different door. For instance, instead of going in and out through the front door, try using the back or garage door. Another good option is to exit and enter via a door with an antechamber. After passing through the first door, close it firmly behind you and look about to ensure your feline friend hasn’t followed you. If your cat does get past the first door, you’ll notice and be able to put him or her back inside before exiting the secondary door which actually leads outside. When you have guests over, put your cat in another room until the festivities are over. This way, when people come through the main door, your cat won’t be around to dart through it."

      "content": "Don’t give your cat any attention at the door. [1] X Research source If your cat thinks that being near the door is a place where you will pet or play with it, your cat will gravitate toward the door. If your cat is in the habit of greeting you and getting a friendly hello right when you walk in, break yourself of that habit. Don’t even look at your cat until after you’ve taken your shoes off, removed your jacket, and moved away from the door. Instead, greet your cat warmly and pat it’s head only in the living room, bedroom, or hallway. This way, the cat will learn to meet you at the place where it knows you’ll give it attention. Do the same thing when you leave. Instead of bidding your cat farewell at the door, do so at your designated hello/goodbye spot."

If you do not have a cat door with a lock or sliding latch, you can easily attach one and open it during certain times of the day when you want to allow your cat to go outside."

If your cat is fixed, on the other hand, it will have no desire to breed and thus be more inclined to stay home. It’s typically safe for cats as young as eight weeks old to be spayed or neutered, but you should always ask your vet if and when it is possible for your cat to be sterilized.

If your cat busies itself with nibbling its treat instead of darting out the door, your problem is solved. You could also give your cat a puzzle feeder on your way out in order to distract it from the fact that you’re leaving. [6] X Research source A puzzle feeder is a small device -- often a rubber ball or oblong shape -- with a small hole and hollow middle into which bits of kibble or cat treats are placed. The puzzle feeder gives the cat stimulation -- potentially for hours -- as well as a yummy snack. The puzzle feeder will keep it from running outside."

Experiment with a variety of entertainment options and see which keep your pet engaged. For instance, bring a few plants inside. These will provide interesting smells for your cat. Avoid plants like amaryllis, chrysanthemums, irises, lilies, and tulips, which can be toxic to cats. Hide some treats throughout the house. You can hide them in puzzle feeders or just easily accessible in unusual locations. [8] X Expert Source Francine Miller Certified Animal Behavior Counselor Expert Interview. 10 September 2020.

If you have Animal Planet, NatGeo, or other nature programming, these are best. DVDs made specifically to entertain cats are also available, featuring footage of other animals."

[10] X Expert Source Francine Miller Certified Animal Behavior Counselor Expert Interview. 10 September 2020. Your cat runs outside because he or she wants to get out and explore. They want fresh air, sunshine, and new, exciting smells! Fortunately, you can reduce your cat’s desperate jailbreak attempts by letting your cat experience a bit of the great outdoors. If you have a screened porch, give your cat access to it. Ensure there are plenty of perches in it so that your kitty can see outside. If you don’t have a screened porch, you can easily obtain some plastic or wire fencing and make a small enclosure which allows your cat to spend time outside without running out the front door. Provide access to the enclosure via a back door or open window. If your enclosure’s walls are at least seven feet high, you do not need to include a roof."
