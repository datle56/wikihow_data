      "content": "Use up vertical space by installing magnetic hooks. Not only are magnetic hooks easy to install and remove, but they also give you a feasible place to hang your gym bag or jacket. All you have to do is open the packaging and press the magnet end of the hook to the inside of the locker—it’s that simple! Place your hooks higher up in your locker to easily store books and other supplies underneath whatever’s hanging."

      "content": "If your locker doesn’t have a built-in shelf, get a plastic or metal locker shelf . A shelf will help you to separate the limited space you have, allowing you to keep books in one place and supplies in another. Basically, it divides your locker in half. [1] X Research source Locker shelves come in many shapes and sizes, so measure your locker before you buy. Pick a locker shelf that matches the color of your locker or is your favorite color. If you can’t find a color you like, try spray painting the shelf to match all your aesthetic needs."

      "title": "Smaller pockets with magnets help you make the most of the small space.",
      "content": "Smaller pockets with magnets help you make the most of the small space. Having handfuls of loose paper floating around is normal throughout the school year. Your locker can become a dumping ground, so why not make the dumping a bit more organized? Stick a magnetic folder holder or basket to the inside wall of your locker. Now, you’ll have a space to neatly place your papers, so they don’t get stuffed under textbooks throughout the day. [2] X Research source If you take multiple classes, try picking an organizer with multiple pockets. This way, you can slide assignments and notes into their corresponding class pocket."

      "title": "A dry erase board is great for writing small notes or reminders.",
      "content": "A dry erase board is great for writing small notes or reminders. Unlike sticky notes or loose paper, a dry erase board won’t clutter your locker space. It’s easy to write on and clean up—a win-win! Simply stick a magnetic dry erase board to the inside door of your locker, and write on it whenever you see fit. [3] X Research source Many locker dry erase boards already come with a dry erase marker, but you can always purchase more so you have more colors to choose from. Keep a magnetic dry erase marker on the door next to your board or store a handful of colored markers in a magnetic cup on the door."

      "title": "Bulkier textbooks and binders are harder to remove from the top shelf.",
      "content": "Bulkier textbooks and binders are harder to remove from the top shelf. Locker organization is all about thinking, “What will benefit me and my locker throughout the day?” Chances are, you’re not going to want to pull down a heavy textbook after a long class. Place your larger books and materials at the bottom of the locker. This way, they won’t fall on you while you try to take them off a high shelf. With this in mind, store your lighter notebooks and supplies on higher or top shelves. Putting heavier items at the bottom of the locker will also keep shelves from warping and bending over time."

      "title": "Keep your supplies organized so your locker stays tidy.",
      "content": "Keep your supplies organized so your locker stays tidy. When you’re in a rush, you don’t want to search for the right books for your next class. Organize your books and supplies from left to right according to the order of your classes—just remember to set everything back in order before the day ends. Try color-coding your books and materials to make things even easier. Designate a color for each class, and pick supplies that match or place a color-coded sticker on the spine. Organize your textbooks and binders with the spines facing out. This way, you can easily identify everything. [4] X Research source Consider labeling the spines of your books and binders if they’re blank. Use a label maker or permanent marker to write out the name of each class."

      "title": "Storage containers can help you organize smaller belongings.",
      "content": "Storage containers can help you organize smaller belongings. Rather than dumping everything in all at once, consider making designated spaces for each type of item. For example, place all your spare pencils in a magnetic cup or pencil bag and store lip balm and mints in a small locker drawer or bin. This way, everything has its home, and you’ll be less likely to lose something. [5] X Research source If you wear jewelry, keep a small dish or plastic container in your locker so you can safely store your jewelry before gym class."

      "title": "Always remember which class is next with a schedule inside your locker.",
      "content": "Always remember which class is next with a schedule inside your locker. Make things easier on yourself by printing out your schedule and putting it on the inside door of your locker. Use tape, sticky tack , or fun locker magnets to hang it up. This way, you’ll be able to reference it whenever you need to! [6] X Research source Slip your schedule into a sheet protector to protect it from any spills or mishaps."

      "title": "Small bits of garbage can easily stack up inside your locker.",
      "content": "Small bits of garbage can easily stack up inside your locker. Solve this problem by keeping a small trash can or bin inside your locker (this is especially handy if your locker isn’t close to a school trash can). Toss old papers, gum wrappers, and/or pencil shavings in your tiny can and empty it once it gets full. This will keep your space clean and save you those extra steps to the trash can. [7] X Research source Avoid throwing food or food wrappers away in your locker as discarded food can leave a foul smell. Consider making your own trash can by painting a small mason jar."

      "content": "Weekly clean-ups will make your locker look and feel more organized. Before you go home to enjoy the weekend, spend a few moments cleaning out any trash and reorganizing your books and materials. Some things may have moved around throughout the week, and that’s totally normal! Simply put everything back in its rightful place so you can start Monday with a freshly organized locker. Take home any extra items you don’t need in your locker right now—you can always bring them back later if you need to!"
