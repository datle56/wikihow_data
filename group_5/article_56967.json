      "content": "Locate a source of iron (III) (iron in the 3 + oxidation state). An iron (III) salt such as ferric chloride will be easy to add to the solution. It is often used for etching copper, so you can buy it online, at a chemical supply store, and sometimes even an electronics store. Also, a fine rust powder would work well. You can collect rust and grind it to a fine powder if you choose to go that route. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a solution containing iron (III).",
      "content": "Make a solution containing iron (III). Add water to the iron (III) oxide source in a beaker (or another glass container of similar size). The aqueous environment (in water) is ideal for the iron (III) and iron (II) molecules to react with each other and with oxygen. It will suspend your iron (III) molecules in solution and make it easy to combine with the iron (II) and oxygen molecules. You do not need to cover the container, but this can help keep out contaminants. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Locate a source of iron (II) (iron in the 2+ oxidation state).",
      "content": "Locate a source of iron (II) (iron in the 2 + oxidation state). Since iron (II) in its pure form is rare under atmospheric conditions, you will likely need to use an iron (II) salt. Iron sulphate, iron (II) chloride, and iron (II) phosphate are relatively common options. Iron sulphate is used in gardening and can be found at most garden supply stores. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make a solution containing iron (II).",
      "content": "Make a solution containing iron (II). Whatever your choice of iron (II) salt, you will need to dissolve it in water. Do this as a separate beaker (or other container) from the iron (III) solution to ensure that the iron (III) has not saturated the water. This will allow the most iron (II) to dissolve into the water. Again, a lid will help keep out contaminants, but is not necessary. [4] X Research source Wear gloves and goggles to protect your eyes and skin from any chemicals."

    {
      "title": "Mix the solutions.",
      "content": "Mix the solutions. Combine the iron (III) solution and the iron (II) solution into the same container. This will allow bringing the iron (III) ions and the iron (II) ions into contact with each other. They will also contact oxygen in the water and the atmosphere, which is needed to produce magnetite.

    {
      "title": "Oxidize the solution.",
      "content": "Oxidize the solution. While the reaction will proceed by mixing the two solutions together, it will proceed very slowly. You can speed up the reaction by adding an oxidizing solution, such as ammonia. Hydrogen peroxide is also a good oxidizing agent. [6] X Research source The addition of an oxidizing agent will allow the reaction to proceed much faster. Times will vary based on the ratios of reactants and oxidizer, but you will likely see some change in just a few seconds. Use caution when working with hydrogen peroxide since it will create heat as it reacts with the water. Storing your iron oxide in a dry place is recommended."

      "title": "Obtain a source of iron.",
      "content": "Obtain a source of iron. Aside from some salts, most iron compounds tend to be in the iron (III) state. This includes things like railroad rails, nails, steel wool, and paperclips. Choose your source based on the amount of iron you need, how fast you need it, and what is available to you. For example, steel wool is cheap and oxidizes quickly, but railroad rails contain a larger mass of iron."

      "content": "Find a power source. You will need to use a battery or other direct current power source to power the reaction. The power source should have a lead connected to the negative side and a lead to the positive side. Choose the size of your power source based on how much rust you are trying to create and how fast you want it. Larger power supplies will generally create rust faster. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Submerge the positive and negative leads.",
      "content": "Submerge the positive and negative leads. The leads should not touch each other. Instead, they should be submerged on opposite sides of your water tank. This will make the water solution part of the circuit and force electricity to flow through the water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Submerge your iron source.",
      "content": "Submerge your iron source. While iron will typically rust under atmospheric conditions without any help, submerging it in water increases the rate of oxidation. Submerging iron in water that is being electrolyzed will increase the rate of oxidation even more since the electrolysis produces hydrogen gas (H 2 ) and diatomic oxygen (O 2 ). Diatomic oxygen is a great oxidizer and readily reacts with the iron to form rust. [10] X Research source"

Be careful not to touch the leads, or touch them together. Also, do not put your hands in the water unless you turn the power off. If you are using a power source without a switch (like a battery), either put the leads in last, or do not hook the leads to the battery until you are ready for power."

      "title": "Choose an oxidizing agent.",
      "content": "Choose an oxidizing agent. Bleach is a great oxidizing agent. Another good choice is hydrogen peroxide. A weaker oxidizing agent is salt water.

      "content": "Expose the iron source to the oxidizer. You can submerge the iron source in the oxidizing solution. Another option is to spray the oxidizer on the iron at regular time intervals (every hour or so). Depending on how fast you want the reaction to proceed and how comfortable you are using strong oxidizers, you can dilute the oxidizer in water (this will weaken it and slow the reaction)."

      "content": "Use a 9-V battery to ignite the steel wool. Touching a 9-V battery to the steel wool will connect the positive and negative leads of the battery. This closes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The steel wool will ignite because more current is flowing through than it can handle, so it heats up until it reaches an ignition point.
