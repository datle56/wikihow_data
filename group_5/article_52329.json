      "title": "Keep it simple, and you'll come off thoughtful and sweet in any situation.",
      "content": "Keep it simple, and you'll come off thoughtful and sweet in any situation. Show him that you notice even a slight change in his appearance. Instead of asking him if he got a haircut (which might leave him feeling exposed, wondering whether or not you actually like it), jump right in and explain that you think his new cut looks amazing. With this, you're sure to make his day. Include his name in your compliment for a heartfelt touch, “Your new haircut looks awesome, Connor.” Point to your hair and say, “I like the new look!” Compliment him in passing for a casual, sweet compliment, “Hey, I just wanted to say that your new haircut looks really good. Talk to you soon!”"

      "title": "Flattery is more effective when it’s sincere and detailed.",
      "content": "Flattery is more effective when it’s sincere and detailed. So, take a moment to think about what exactly you like about his new haircut. Then, let him know in a friendly tone. He'll leave the conversation thinking about how charming you are. [1] X Research source “I love the way your new cut sweeps to the side like that. It looks good!” “The new haircut has a sort of sporty vibe to it. I really like it!” “I really like how the sides are shorter than the top. It looks cool!”"

      "title": "When you reassure him about his cut, you'll put his nerves at ease.",
      "content": "When you reassure him about his cut, you'll put his nerves at ease. When a guy gets a new haircut, he may feel like a fish out of water until he gets used to it. Assure him that the cut totally fits his vibe, essence, or personality and he'll be touched by your thoughtfulness. “Wow, this haircut really fits your cool, edgy vibe. It looks great!” “The new cut makes you look even smarter. That fits, given you’re a total genius!” If you’re afraid to get specific, offer him a more general compliment for the same sweet effect, “That haircut really suits your style, Eric.”"

      "title": "For double the effect, tie your compliment to another flattering comment.",
      "content": "For double the effect, tie your compliment to another flattering comment. If you’re looking to really leave an impression, pair your haircut compliment with another compliment on his style, his eyes, or his overall good looks. Commenting on his new haircut is a subtle way to compliment him, but you don’t have to stop there. Subtly comment on his great looks: “Wow, your cut looks awesome. I mean, you already looked good, but this is even better!” Explain that you’re glad to be able to see his eyes: “Your hair used to cover your eyes a bit. I love this new cut. Your eyes are so green!” Compliment his taste: “You pick out the coolest clothes. Apparently your style extends to great haircut choices as well!\""

      "content": "New haircuts can give guys a refined, polished look. He’ll love it if you let him know he’s rocking that post-haircut glow, so don’t hold back. Explain that he’s totally elevated his old look. Use words like “handsome,” “clean-cut,” “dapper,” and “sophisticated” for the perfect compliment. [2] X Research source “Woah, your new cut makes you look so handsome!” “With your new cut and trimmed beard you look totally dapper. If you were ever considering modeling, I’d take the headshot now!” “Wow, the new look makes you look so polished. You were handsome before, but this is next level!”"

      "content": "Sneakily pretend not to notice his cut for a sweet, effective compliment. Sometimes, guys worry that you're complimenting his haircut just because you noticed it. Tell him this, and he'll believe you really like his hair—because you thought he looked better noticing his cut. Use this if you aim to be casual. You won't earn points for noticing his cut. But he'll love that you boosted his confidence! “Wow, you look great. Is something different?” Study his face for a second and tap your chin like you’re thinking something over, “Why do you look so good today?” Tap a friend and point to your crush, “I’m not crazy right? He looks especially good today for some reason.”"

      "content": "Compare him to a stylish celebrity for a compliment that'll really land. Tell him that he looks like someone known for being fashionable or handsome—or someone you know he admires. This compliment will feel especially meaningful because nothing will get lost in translation. He already admires that celebrity’s look and now he knows that his haircut has the same vibe! [3] X Research source \"Woah, very Zac Efron-esque haircut. I really like it.\" \"The haircut is so sleek! It reminds me of Henry Golding.\" \"Your haircut looks great. You know whose haircut it reminds me of? Jason Momoa."

Use this compliment if you’re a bit nervous and looking for a more subtle form of flattery. You’re just asking for a “friend” after all. Tell him this and he’ll think you’re beyond sweet. [4] X Research source “Woah, I like the cut. I’m looking for a new one actually. What did you tell your barber?” “My best friend is looking for a sporty cut like that—did you bring a photo in? Maybe he could look at it.” “Wow, where’d you get that cut? That’s five-star material. My cousin is looking, actually. I want to let them know where you went!”"

      "content": "If he’s a bit shy (or you are), be extra considerate of his feelings. Use this tactic if you think there’s a chance that a bold or straightforward compliment might embarrass him as much as it flatters him. Wait until he’s alone, then gently let him know that the cut looks great. He’ll think your empathy is super sweet—and you’ll make his day without making him red in the face. “Hey, Arthur. I don’t mean to bother you, but you got a new cut right? I really like it.” “I didn’t want to make a big deal in front of everyone—but I wanted to let you know that your new haircut looks great.” “I hope I'm not overstepping, but I just wanted to say that your new haircut looks really nice.”"

In that case, let him know that you think his new cut is completely swoon-worthy. He’ll probably think you’re being a little silly—but he’ll also definitely feel flattered, too. “You’re KIDDING me. You knew what this new haircut would do to me. I can’t take it...” “Have you seen Too Hot To Handle ? I think you’d make a great contestant with that new cut.” “Hot haircut alert. When you described that to your barber, did you just ask for the haircut of my dreams?”"

If you want to subtly clue him in, explain that you have a hard time focusing on anything besides him (and his sleek new haircut). This compliment is perfect if you're looking to signal your interest without being too obvious. You'll flatter him—and leave him dreaming about you, too! \"I had a hard time focusing in class today. That haircut is great! It really got my attention.\" \"I really love this cut on you, Rufus! I actually couldn't take my eyes off of you to be honest.\" Study his face for a moment and say, \"Sorry, I don't mean to stare! I just think this new haircut looks so nice on you.\""
