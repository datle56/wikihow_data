Cardboard boxes will be the cheapest and easiest to paint and decorate, but they will also be the least durable. Multiple cardboard boxes stacked together may begin to sag beneath the weight of the doll and her furniture after a while. Wood will be more expensive, but they will also be more durable. Depending on the quality of the wood, however, some of the creates will need to be sanded to achieve a smoother finish. Plastic crates may be more expensive than cardboard boxes, but they will be more durable. Depending on the finish, some plastic crates might have to be sanded first before painting or adding wallpaper and flooring; not doing so might result in the paint chipping off and the glued-on pieces falling off."

You will need to create something that looks like a bookshelf, with each floor being at least 20 inches high and 20 inches deep. If you are using wood or plywood, look for something that is between ½ to ¾ inch thick. If you are using cardboard or foam-core, glue 2 to 3 sheets together to make the house more durable. If you wish to add multiple rooms, create walls out of the same materials that you are using for the rest of the house and insert them after you have put the rest of the house together. Each wall should measure the room's height by the room's depth. For example, if each floor is 20 inches high and 20 inches deep, then your walls need to be 20 inches by 20 inches. Since you are building this house from scratch, consider cutting some windows into the outside walls, and doors into the dividing walls. Make sure that the doors are big enough for the doll to fit through."

Colored contact paper or shelf and drawer liner is another alternative to wrapping paper, except that it does not need to be glued down or sealed. Simply measure the areas you want covered, cut sheets of colored contact paper/shelf and drawer liner according to those measurements. Then, peel off the backing and stick the sheet to the walls. Scrapbooking paper comes in 12 by 12 inch sheets and is good for small spaces. You will need to use several sheets of scrapbooking paper to cover large areas.
