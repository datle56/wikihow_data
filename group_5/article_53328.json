      "content": "Wrap the knife blades in newspaper and cardboard. Wrap a few layers of newspaper around each knife, and tape it in place. Then, fold a piece of cardboard tightly around the knife. Tape around edges of the cardboard so the knife stays securely inside.

      "content": "Seal the knives in a cardboard box and put it in your trash bin. Place the knives in another box or container, and write “SHARP” on the outside to warn sanitation workers. Toss the container in your trash bin so it’s picked up on the normal collection day. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you can take the knives directly to a waste collection site if you don’t want to wait until trash day. Some sites may charge a disposal fee, but it’s usually free if you live in the area. Some areas have metal knife surrender bins in public areas. While these are normally for turning in weapons, they’re still a safe place to get rid of your kitchen knives. Check local law enforcement websites to see if there are any bins in your area. You may also take the knives to a police station if you’re worried about someone finding them in your trash. Call the station ahead of time and let them know you’re going to be bringing knives in for safe disposal. If they don’t accept knives, they’ll point you to the proper place to throw it away."

      "content": "Drop the knives off at a local recycling center. While you can’t put your knives into a curbside recycling bin, most areas have recycling plants that accept them. Call the recycling centers in your area and confirm they accept old kitchen knives. If they do, wrap the blades in a few layers of newspaper and cardboard and secure them with tape. Then, drop the knives off at the center. [3] X Research source Some recycling centers charge a fee when you take your knives in, either by weight or the number of items. Look up \"recycling center\" and the name of your city to find the closest facilities to you. Recycling your knives ensures the materials get reused rather than put into a landfill."

Ask people you know first if they need any knives before listing them online to places like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist.

If you’re not getting any interest in your knives, check for knife sharpening shops near you. They may sometimes buy old knives to use as spare parts."

      "content": "Sharpen your knives at least once a year. If your knives are slipping or struggling to cut through food, it’s time to sharpen them . Run the blade at a 20-degree angle against a whetstone , or press the blade into a knife sharpener and pull it towards you a few times. [5] X Research source If you regularly use your knives, then you may need to sharpen them every few months. Clean your knives with gentle soap and dry them right away to help them maintain their edge. Try to store your knives on a magnetic strip on your wall to keep the blade the sharpest. If you need to store your knives in a drawer, put blade guards on them."

Pull the knife up and down at a 15- to 20-degree angle to hone the blade. Put the knife on the other side of the rode and repeat the process. [6] X Research source Honing your knives keeps the blade’s edge straight so it makes smooth cuts."
