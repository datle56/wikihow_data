      "title": "Remove the cork and label from an empty wine bottle.",
      "content": "Remove the cork and label from an empty wine bottle. Grab your leftover wine bottle and discard the cork (or save it for other crafts). Then, use your fingers to peel as much of the label from the bottle as you can. To remove the rest, saturate the label with warm water and dish soap and rub it away with a sponge. If it’s stubborn, sprinkle ½ tsp (3 g) of baking soda over the label and continue rubbing with a sponge until the label is completely gone. [1] X Research source After, rinse the bottle with warm water to remove any residue and ensure the bottle is squeaky clean. Completely removing the label makes cutting the bottle much easier and neater in the following steps."

      "content": "Score a line around the bottle with a glass cutter tool. Wearing a sturdy pair of work gloves and eye protection , place the bottle on a stable surface. Place the cutting edge of the glass cutter tool onto the bottle, about ¾ of the way from the top of the bottle. While applying firm but gentle pressure, roll the bottle away from you, keeping the glass cutter pressed to its surface, to score a straight line all the way around the circumference of the bottle. [2] X Research source Alternatively, cut your wine bottle using a string soaked in acetone. The string is wrapped around the bottle and lit on fire for a few moments, then the bottle dunked in water to split it. Or, use a specialized bottle cutting tool to make the process easier if you’ll be making a few windchimes. Optionally, use a round metal clamp or tie a string around the bottle to act as a guide while you cut."

      "title": "Dip the bottle in boiling water, then ice water to split it.",
      "content": "Dip the bottle in boiling water, then ice water to split it. Heat a kettle full of water to boiling, then pour it over the score in the bottle for 30 seconds while holding the bottle by its neck over a sink. Then, run the score of the bottle under cold water, or dunk it into an ice bath. The rapid change in heat causes the glass to fluctuate, breaking it along the scored line. [3] X Research source Alternatively, dunk the bottle in a pot of just-boiled water, then dunk it in the ice bath, and repeat until it splits. Discard the bottom half of the bottle, or keep it to place candles into or make other crafts with. Just be sure to sand and polish the cut edge for safety."

      "title": "Polish the cut edge with 80-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Polish the cut edge with 80-grit sandpaper. While still wearing your gloves, rub a pad of 80-grit sandpaper against the sharp, cut edge of the glass to file it down and smooth it out. Rub back and forth perpendicularly across the edge, and pay special attention to the sharp corners. [4] X Research source Sand until it’s totally smooth to the touch, or for about 5-10 minutes. Sand the bottle over a sink to catch any debris, and periodically run the bottle under the tap to keep it wet, which helps to prevent chipping and to achieve a smooth finish."

      "title": "Cut a chain or length of string long enough to feed through the bottle.",
      "content": "Cut a chain or length of string long enough to feed through the bottle. This will be the length of chain that the bottle hangs from. Use a measuring tape to measure the neck of the bottle, then add about 12–15 in (30–38 cm) to give the bottle more slack as it hangs. Use a pair of wire cutters or sharp-edged pliers to cut your craft chain to this length. [5] X Research source For example, if your bottle's neck measures 3 inches (7.6 cm) and you want your hanging chain to be 14 inches (36 cm) long, cut the chain down to 17 inches (43 cm). It’s better to cut the chain too long than too short. You can always trim it shorter."

      "title": "Secure a key ring to one end of the chain.",
      "content": "Secure a key ring to one end of the chain. Use a key ring that is wider than the neck of your bottle—about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide should be fine. Feed the ring onto the last link of your chain, or tie it to the end of your string using a strong knot . The key ring will act as a stopper inside the bottle to hold it up. [6] X Research source The key ring must be bigger than the neck of the bottle. If it is too small, it won't hold the bottle up."

      "title": "Feed the other end of the chain through the neck of the bottle.",
      "content": "Feed the other end of the chain through the neck of the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and place the chain inside, holding onto the key ring end. Let the chain fall through the neck of the bottle and out the top. The key ring will sit right inside the neck. [7] X Research source"

Hold the bottle up by the chain and note where the key ring sits inside. Measure from this point down to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom edge of the bottle. [8] X Research source Cut a second piece of chain according to that length. This second length of chain will end at about the level of the cut edge of the bottle."

      "title": "Add the second chain to the key ring inside the bottle.",
      "content": "Add the second chain to the key ring inside the bottle. Reach into the bottle and pull out the key ring. Thread the end of your second chain (or tie your string) onto this key ring, then hold your wind chime up again. [9] X Research source The end of the second chain is about level with the bottom cut edge of the bottle. You will have 2 chains in your bottle. The first chain sticks up through the neck of the bottle, while the second hangs inside the bottle. If you’re using a string or a cord, add some noise to the chime by threading a large, wooden bead onto the cord, then tie a knot below it so that it sits inside the bottle."

You might alternatively use a washer, beads, or any other heavy object that makes a chime when it strikes the glass. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure an ornament onto the key ring.",
      "content": "Secure an ornament onto the key ring. The ornament hangs on the very end of the wind chime and provides some weight. [11] X Research source A chunky necklace pendant with a built-in hook is ideal, or use a large wooden bead and screw a hook into it yourself. Then secure the ornament to the key ring at the bottom of the chain or string. If you like, add another length of chain or string between the third key ring and the ornament to let the ornament dangle even lower. How low it goes is up to you! Alternatively, use a small bell as the ornament to let your wind chime make a bit more noise. Or, add a smaller glass bottle at the bottom by repeating this process and securing the second bottle to the bottom of the first bottle’s chain."
