ADHD children have great difficulty in planning, thinking through procedures, managing time, and other daily life skills. A strongly structured organizational system will be critical to your family's daily life. In other words, creating a routine can prevent the need for discipline in the first place because your child will be less likely to misbehave. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Many of child's actions may be rooted in the characteristic lack of organization that is not fully within the child's control. The family needs to intervene with strong organization and an understanding that the child needs extra help and patience in this area. At the same time, the child should not be held to low expectations, either. This typically includes things such as morning routines, homework time, bedtimes, and things like limits on video games. Be sure expectations are explicit . \"Clean your room\" is vague, and an ADHD child may be confused where even to begin and how to follow through before losing focus. It may be better to break it up into short, clear tasks: \"Pick up toys\", \"Vacuum rug\", \"Clean hamster cage\", \"Put away clothes--in the closet on hangers\"."

As a result, the child with ADHD needs a big projects, such as cleaning their room or folding and putting away clean laundry, to be broken down into many smaller tasks, given one at a time. In the case of laundry, for example, ask your child to begin by finding all their socks and putting them away. You can make a bit of a game out of it by playing a CD and challenging your child to complete the task of finding all the socks and putting them in the appropriate drawer by the end of the first song. Once that is accomplished and you praise them for doing it correctly, you can then ask them to pick out and put away their underwear, PJs, and so on, until the task is competed. Breaking the project into smaller pieces spread out over time not only prevents behavior born of frustration, but also gives parents multiple chances to provide positive feedback while allowing children many opportunities to experience success. The more success experienced—and rewarded—the more a child begins to identify themselves as a success, giving a much needed self-esteem boost and helping them actually become more successful in the future. After all, success breeds success! [6] X Research source Organize Your ADD/ADHD Child: A Practical Guide For Parents by Cheryl R. Carter (2011). You may still need to guide your child's routines. ADHD makes it difficult to focus, not get distracted, and keep going on boring tasks. That does not mean they get to opt out of chores. However, the expectation that they can do it independently may or may not be realistic...this depends very much on your child. It is better to work together on such tasks in an accepting way, and make it a positive experience, than to expect too much and make it a point of frustration and argument."

Help your child to organize their room. Remember that children with ADHD are overwhelmed because they notice everything at once, so the more they can categorize their belongings, the easier it is for them to deal with that plethora of stimuli. [7] X Research source Putting On The Brakes: Young People’s Guide to Understanding Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by Patricia O. Quinn &amp; Judith M. Stern (1991). Children with ADHD do well with storage cubes, shelves, wall hooks and the like to help them separate out items into categories and minimize crowding. Use of color-coding, pictures, and shelf labels also helps minimize visual stress. De-clutter. In addition to overall organizing, purging the \"stuff\" that will distract your child will help make the environment more calming. This does not necessarily mean stripping the room bare. However, getting rid of outgrown toys, clothing they do not wear, and cleaning out shelves of bric-a-brac that does not hold high appeal for the child can go a long way to making a more harmonious environment."

Once they start to do the task, don’t distract their attention from the job by giving additional commands or starting a discussion that diverts their attention. [8] X Research source Make sure your child is looking at you, and you are making eye contact. While this is not a full assurance of attention, it is more likely your message will get through. Angry, frustrated, or otherwise negative talk has a way of getting \"filtered out\". This is often a defense mechanism - ADHD kids tend to get people frustrated with them and they fear being criticized for something they cannot really control. Yelling, for example, may well not get the child's attention. ADHD kids respond well to fun, the unexpected, and whimsical. Tossing a ball will often get attention, especially if it is thrown back and forth a bit before moving onto a request. Saying, \"knock, knock?\" and doing a joke may work. A call-and-response pattern or clapping pattern may work, too. These are all playful manners that typically will get \"through the fog.\" It is difficult for kids with ADHD to focus, so when they do exhibit focus, give them their best chance to keep it by not interrupting them or taking them away from the task at hand."

Making your child feel good about what they do is one key strategy to avoiding the need to discipline them in the first place. Do not be stingy on rewards.

While it might be tempting to give your child a pass on disciplining their behavior because of ADHD, this in fact only increases the likelihood that the behavior will continue. As with most things in life, If you ignore it, it will escalate and get worse. Your best bet is to deal with the problem behavior the first time it occurs and right away. Enact discipline immediately after the behavior so that your child can connect their behavior with the discipline and your response. In this way, they will learn over time that this behavior comes with consequences, and hopefully stop engaging in the specific behavior. Children with ADHD can be impulsive and often do not consider the consequences to their actions. They often fail to realize they have done anything wrong. The cycle is such that if there are no consequences, this problem will get worse. Thus, they need adults to help them see this and learn the wrongness of their behavior and the potential consequences of continuing that behavior. Accept that ADHD children will just need more patience, guidance, and practice. If you compare an ADHD child with the \"typical\" child, you will likely get extremely frustrated. You will have to spend more time, energy, and thought into working with this sort of child. Stop comparing them to other \"easier\" kids. This is critical in having more positive--and thus more productive--interactions and results."

Go to source Many parents have found more success in changing bad behaviors, such as poor table manners at mealtimes, by instead focusing on giving positive encouragement and praise when their children do something right. Instead of criticizing how your child sits at the table or talks with food in their mouth, try praising them when they use their utensils properly and when they are a good listener. This will help your child pay more attention to what they're doing in order to receive praise. Watch your ratio. Make sure your child gets more positive inputs than negative ones. You might have to go out of your way to “catch them being good” sometimes, but the benefits of praising more than punishing will be incalculable."

For instance, if your child is dressed and in the kitchen for breakfast by a certain time, they can choose waffles instead of cereal for breakfast. Offering choices is one way to positively reinforce your child when they behave well. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Consider setting up a positive behavior system that allows your child to earn privileges, such as an allowance bonus, a special day out, or something similar. By the same token, poor behavior results in the loss of points, but points can be earned back with extra chores or other such activities. [14] X Research source Taking Charge of ADHD: The Complete, Authoritative Guide For Parents by Russell A. Barkley (2005). A point system can help give children the motivation they need to comply. If your child is not motivated to pick up their toys before bedtime, knowing they will earn points toward a privilege may be all the incentive they need to comply. The best part of such a plan is that parents are no longer the bad guys when children don’t get privileges—their destinies are in their own hands and they have to take responsibility for their choices. Note that children have more success with a points system when it is clearly specified with a checklist, schedule, and deadlines. [15] X Research source Why Is My Child’s ADHD Not Better Yet? Recognizing The Undiagnosed Secondary Conditions That May Be Affecting Your Child’s Treatment by David Gottlieb, Thomas Shoaf, and Risa Graff (2006). Be aware checklists and schedules have limitations. ADHD makes even motivated children have difficulty staying on task. If the expectations are simply too high or not otherwise suitable, they may not experience success, and the system is useless. For example: A child who is struggling with an essay for homework, and is simply spending so much time on it that she missed the deadline for practicing the violin may be in a terrible bind. Another example: A child has great trouble with a behavior checklist, and he never gets enough gold stars to earn a reward. Without positive reinforcement, he acts out rather than \"buys into\" the system."

Generally, children with ADHD often cannot instantly be able to think of a good behavior to replace the bad one with, so it will be hard to stop. Your job, as a guide, is to remind them what the right behavior is. Also, your ADHD child may not fully hear the \"not\" in your sentence, so the mind may not process what you are saying correctly. [16] X Research source For example: Instead of saying, \"Stop jumping on the sofa\", say, \"We sit on the sofa.\" \"Gentle hands with the cat\" instead of, \"Stop pulling on the cat's tail.\" \"Criss cross applesauce!\" instead of \"Stop getting up.\" Focusing on the positives works well when crafting family rules as well. Instead of “no playing ball in the house,” try “balls are outside toys.” You may find more success with “walk slowly in the living room” than with “no running!” [17] X Research source Organize Your ADD/ADHD Child: A Practical Guide For Parents by Cheryl R.

Thus, you should give your child lots of attention when good behavior occurs, but limit the attention you give bad behavior as it can be seen by your child as a reward. [18] X Research source For instance, if your child gets out of bed to play at night, silently but firmly put them back where they belong without hugs and attention. Feel free to confiscate the toys, but do not discuss it at the time or they will feel rewarded by your attention or that the rules are up for debate. If you consistently fail to reward the bad behavior, it should disappear over time. If your child is cutting up their coloring book, simply take away the scissors and the book.

Consider the little girl who asks for a Coke five or six times in three minutes, all while the parent is on the phone, or dealing with the other baby, or trying to fix dinner. Sometimes it’s tempting - and indeed, easier - to cave in: “Fine—go ahead but leave me in peace!” However, the message being sent out is that persistence will win the day and that she, and not the parent, is in control. ADHD children do not do very well with permissive discipline. These children need firm and loving guidance and boundaries. Long discussions about rules and why we have them do not work.

Most children with ADHD will get easily distracted by their toys and belongings and have a wonderful time...and the \"punishment\" ends up being a reward. In addition, sending your child to their room is generally removed from and unrelated to the specific infraction, and they will have a hard time connecting the behavior with the punishment in order to learn not to repeat that behavior. Consequences should also be immediate. For example, if a child is told that it is to put their bike away and come inside but they continue to ride, do not tell them they cannot ride it tomorrow. Delayed consequences have little or no meaning to a child with ADHD, as they tend to live in the \"here and now\" and what happened yesterday has no real meaning for today. As a result, this approach will like result in a blow-up the following day when the consequence is enforced and the child actually has not made the connection.

Go to source Always follow through on what you say or threaten. Do not give too many warnings or make empty threats. If you give them multiple chances or warnings, make each come with a level of consequence with the final, second or third, accompanied by the punishment or discipline promised. Otherwise, they will test you every time to see how many chances it will be this time. Make sure both parents are on board with this disciplinary plan. In order to change the behavior, your child needs to have the same response from both parents. [22] X Research source Dr. Larry’s Silver’s Advice to Parents on ADHD by Larry N. Silver (1999). Consistency also means that the child knows what to expect when misbehaving no matter the venue. Sometimes parents are afraid to punish their children in public, fearful of how others will perceive the situation, but it's important to show that the particular misbehavior has consequences wherever your child is. Be sure to coordinate with your child’s school, daycare, or Sunday school to make sure everyone there uses consistent, immediate, and powerful consequences as well.

For most of us, when we’re seated, the hands and feet don’t need to be in motion, but the less effective basal ganglia in a child with ADHD fails to inhibit excessive activity, so sitting still is harder for that child.
