While there are some general signs used to identify gender dysphoria, it's not cut-and-dry, and everyone experiences it differently. Some people identify their true gender in early childhood, whereas others don't recognize it until puberty or adulthood. Some people experience severe and distressing dysphoria, while others experience it minimally or not at all. There's no one \"right\" way for someone to experience dysphoria, so gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and it may take time to figure it out. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Gender dysphoria can exist in anyone who's not cisgender, including nonbinary people. [3] X Research source If you're trying to determine whether you're experiencing gender dysphoria, you may find it beneficial to look at forums and social media sites for transgender and nonbinary people, read various people's experiences to see if you relate to them, and read articles such as How to Know if You Are Transgender .

If gender dysphoria has been deeply repressed or buried, it may have resulted in mental health problems.

You don't need to pursue medical transition unless you want to. Not all transgender or nonbinary people undergo surgery, and not all of them take hormones; it doesn't invalidate their gender identity. Talk with your doctor and your therapist to help you figure out what you would feel most comfortable with. It's okay to be uncertain or nervous about certain types of transition. You may have some hangups about starting hormones or undergoing surgery, and this is completely normal - it's a big decision to make. However, don't let a fear of regret hold you back - it's very uncommon for those who transition to regret it. [25] X Research source Many treatments depend on what type of medical insurance you have.

If your child expresses or has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or is uncertain about their gender, one of the best things you can do is show them your support. Make sure they know you love them, and allow them the freedom to express their gender however they choose. Having support while exploring or transitioning is incredibly important for their health and well-being. If they change their name and/or pronouns, call them by their new name and/or pronouns, and apologize and correct yourself if you slip up. Seek out gender-affirming therapy so that your child can figure out their identity. [28] X Expert Source Inge Hansen, PsyD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 19 November 2019. (Gender-affirming therapy does not force your child into transitioning, it just gives them an outlet to figure out their gender.) [29] X Research source Avoid \"conversion\" or \"reparative\" therapy, as these types of \"therapies\" have proven ineffective and traumatic, and have resulted in suicide. [30] X Research source [31] X Research source The decision on whether to allow a teen to medically transition can be difficult on parents. Discuss with your teen whether they want to pursue this kind of transition, and if they do, why. Go with them to talk to their doctor about how puberty blockers and/or HRT will affect their body. While you're not obligated to consent to your teen's medical transition, hearing out their reasons will help you and them both with the decision. Don't express doubt to them, say that it's \"just a phase\", or say things like \"but you didn't act like this as a child\" or \"you're too young to know\". Gender identity is complex and confusing even to adults, and it can take awhile for someone to figure out their real gender identity. And in the unlikely event that it is temporary, your child will appreciate that you gave them the freedom to figure that out on their own.
