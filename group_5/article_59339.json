      "content": "Collect your documents or information. Police will want copies of anything you may have, such as letters or voice mail messages, that could provide evidence of the crime. You can check your state's law to learn the elements of extortion. These elements are what a prosecuting attorney must prove to have someone convicted of extortion. If you don't have evidence of enough of those elements to constitute probable cause that the person committed the crime, police may not investigate your report. [4] X Research source Generally, you should have evidence that the person maliciously threatened you. This could be a spoken threat or a written threat, although written evidence tends to be stronger – unless you have a recording such as a voice mail message of the threats being made against you. [5] X Research source If you don't have recordings or written evidence of the threats, you may have a hard time getting police officers to investigate the situation. Police must have probable cause to search or arrest someone, and your word – without tangible evidence to back it up – is typically not enough to have a warrant issued."

Since extortion typically involves threats of future violence rather than immediate violence, you should file your report in person at the police station rather than calling 911. [6] X Research source If interstate commerce is involved in any way in the extortion – for example, if the person lives in a different state than you do – consider reporting the crime to the FBI rather than to local law enforcement.

Provide as many details as you have so the police have enough information to investigate the crime. Keep in mind that police must have enough evidence to constitute probable cause before charges can be filed against the person. [8] X Research source Typically you must provide basic personal and contact information about yourself, as well as any similar information you may know about the person you're reporting. You also should relate all information you have related to the crime and provide copies of any potential evidence you've gathered.

      "content": "Consider getting an emergency restraining order. Some jurisdictions offer emergency restraining orders to protect you if you feel you are in imminent danger. Emergency restraining orders typically are issued at the police department and provide you with temporary protection until you are able to file for a permanent restraining order at the courthouse. [10] X Research source If the person extorting you has threatened immediate harm to you or someone you love, or if you're afraid the person will harm you or someone you love if he or she discovers you've filed a police report, ask the officer with whom you filed your report if an emergency restraining order is available. [11] X Research source An emergency restraining order will keep the person from contacting you or coming near you or places you frequent such as your school or workplace. The order usually is only in effect for a day or two at most. [12] X Research source Emergency restraining orders may last longer if courts are not in session – for example, if you've reported the extortion on a Friday evening, or just before a holiday.

For example, if you wanted a domestic violence restraining order, you might have to go to a family court. However, if the person threatening you is not related to you (or you've never had any romantic involvement with him or her), you probably need to go to a different court. Civil restraining orders can protect you against someone with whom you have no pre-existing romantic or familial relationship. Keep in mind that criminal restraining orders aren't issued because you file a petition or request. Rather, a judge issues the order during the course of a criminal proceeding. Once a criminal restraining order expires, it cannot be renewed. In contrast, you can renew a civil restraining order if you still feel the person is a threat."

Typically you'll be charged a fee for this service, although in some jurisdictions the sheriff's department will waive process serving fees for restraining orders.

If the person you want the court to restrain doesn't attend the hearing, the judge typically will grant your permanent restraining order provided you can prove the person presents a threat to you and they had legal notice and knowledge of the hearing and failed to attend. Assuming the other side does show up, the judge will listen to both of you before making the decision to grant or deny your restraining order. [31] X Research source"
