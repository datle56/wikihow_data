      "title": "You need 2 Metal to make 1 Metal Ingot.",
      "content": "You need 2 Metal to make 1 Metal Ingot. Metal Ingots can be crafted in Ark in the Refining Forge or Industrial Forge, or on a Phoenix or Magmasaur. To use a Forge, you must supply it with fuel. To craft Ingots on a tame, you'll need to own one of the tames, and you may need a saddle for it."

      "title": "The Refining Forge is unlocked at level 20 and costs 21 Engram Points.",
      "content": "The Refining Forge is unlocked at level 20 and costs 21 Engram Points. You must have unlocked the Campfire before you can unlock the Refining Forge. To use the Refining Forge, place your Metal and desired fuel inside the forge and interact with it to light it. [1] X Research source To craft a Refining Forge, you'll need 125 Stone, 5 Flint, 65 Hide, 20 Wood/Fungal Wood, and 40 Fiber. A Refining Forge can turn a stack of 300 Metal into 150 Metal Ingots in 50 minutes. You can use Thatch, Wood, Sparkpowder, or AnglerGel to fuel your Refining Forge. It's recommended to only put in as much fuel as you need to process your stack of Metal, otherwise you can waste resources. For a stack of 300 Metal, you'll need 400 Thatch, 100 Wood, 50 Sparkpowder, or 13 AnglerGel to fully process it. You can use an online calculator to determine exactly how much fuel you need for your stack of Metal."

      "title": "The Industrial Forge is unlocked at level 80 and costs 90 Engram Points.",
      "content": "The Industrial Forge is unlocked at level 80 and costs 90 Engram Points. You must have unlocked the Refining Forge and Fabricator before you can unlock the Industrial Forge. To use the Industrial Forge, place your Metal and Gasoline (the only fuel the forge accepts) inside the forge and interact with it to light it. [2] X Research source To craft an Industrial Forge, you'll need 2,500 Metal Ingots, 250 Crystals/Primal Crystals, 600 Cementing Paste/Achatina Paste, 400 Oil, and 400 Polymer/Organic Polymer/Corrupted Nodules. You must craft the Industrial Forge inside the Fabricator, which also requires Gasoline to run. One Gasoline can turn 3,600 Metal into 1,800 Metal Ingots in 30 minutes. A fully loaded Industrial Forge can hold 29,700 Metal (taking up 99 of its 100 slots) which consumes 9 Gasoline (taking up 1 slot) to create 14,850 Metal Ingots in 4 hours and 8 minutes."

      "title": "Use a Phoenix tame to turn Metal into Metal Ingots.",
      "content": "Use a Phoenix tame to turn Metal into Metal Ingots. Phoenixes are only found on the Scorched Earth map during a Heat Wave event. They fly high up in the sky and can only be tamed by hitting it with flaming weapons (such as Flame Arrows, a Flamethrower, Oil Jars) or the fire attack from a Fire Wyvern or Ember Crystal Wyvern. [3] X Research source You don't need a saddle to ride a Phoenix, and they cannot land. You must mount and dismount in the air. Place Metal into a Phoenix's inventory to start turning it into Metal Ingots."

      "content": "Use a Magmasaur tame to turn Metal into Metal Ingots. Magmasaurs can be found in Genesis: Part 1, Lost Island, and Fjordur. You can only get a tamed Magmasaur by stealing a Magmasaur egg, hatching it, and raising the baby Magmasaur to adulthood. You must feed the baby Magmasaur Ambergris or Sulfur until it has matured. You must use a Magmasaur Saddle to ride a Magmasaur. The Magmasaur Saddle unlocks at level 95 and costs 35 Engram Points. You can craft it in the Smithy, and it requires 230 Hide, 150 Fiber, 125 Cementing Paste/Achatina Paste, and 400 Metal Ingots. Place Metal into a Magmasaur's inventory to start turning it into Metal Ingots."

      "title": "Mining.",
      "content": "Mining. You can mainly get Metal by destroying rocks with a pickaxe, a mining drill, or an Ankylosaurus (which is the most efficient way to get Metal). Normal rocks can drop Metal, but the chance is very low and you'll get a very small yield from them. Large, smooth rocks that have gold patches/veining are full of metal. Destroy these Metal Rocks to get a good to high yield of Metal Ore. These rocks are usually found on mountain tops, in caves, near rivers and coves, and deep underwater. Blue-veined black rocks in the Luminous Region in the Aberration map will drop a lot of metal when destroyed."

These items fall into a few different categories (though this list is not exhaustive): Saddles Weapons (including Firearms and Ammunition) Traps Metal infrastructure (i.e. foundations, walls, doors, etc.) Armor Structures (i.e. Fabricator, Egg Incubator, Oil Pump, etc.) Vehicles (i.e. Motorboat)"

You can buy 1000 Metal with 120 Molds, or 50 Metal Ingots with 125 Molds. The foundry comes with 1500 Molds, and you can buy more with Ancient Amber."
