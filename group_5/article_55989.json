      "content": "Pay attention to where you are and what’s happening around you. Look around and pay attention to the type of situation you’re in. Take a few moments to focus on each of your senses to take in as many details about your surroundings as possible. Pay attention to what you're seeing, smelling, hearing, and feeling in your environment, Possing recommends. [1] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 13 August 2020. The normal sounds, behaviors, and sights you expect to see in a situation make up the environmental baseline. This gives you a frame of reference for comparing unusual behaviors, sounds, or smells. [2] X Research source For example, look for bags, suitcases, or similar items left unattended in crowded areas. Leaving unattended bags in public places is a common delivery method for explosives."

      "content": "Being distracted makes you more vulnerable. Focusing on one thing so hard – like wearing earphones with the music turned way up or looking at your phone – that you’re too distracted to identify potential threats is called “focus lock.” Jaeger says, “If you're engrossed in your cell phone and walking around, and I'm a criminal that thinks I can take you, your purse, wallet, or laptop…you’re a great target because you have no idea I’m even coming.” [3] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. When you catch yourself experiencing focus lock, draw your attention back to your environment and any potential threats around you."

      "content": "Use your imagination to plan for dangerous situations. Try to visualize how you would react in a threatening situation. [4] X Research source Find any doors or windows to use if you need to escape from danger. If you notice a group of suspicious individuals heading in your direction, think about what you might do if they attempted to attack you or those around you. Imagine someone drawing a weapon or attacking you, then ask yourself what you could do to make it less likely to happen. What will you do if it happens anyway?"

      "title": "Don't assume abnormal behavior doesn't pose a threat.",
      "content": "Don't assume abnormal behavior doesn't pose a threat. People often wait to respond to abnormal behavior because they are unwilling to recognize it as a threat. \"Normalcy Bias\" is the act of ignoring potential threats because it’s more comforting to believe we aren’t in danger. [5] X Research source Take signs of a threat seriously. Don’t tell yourself what you’re seeing “must be normal.” Personal space is usually understood to be a circle around you at about arm’s length. If anyone comes into that area (close enough to make contact with you), quickly identify any possible threat they may pose. [6] X Research source Look at their face to see if they are focused on you or if they’re simply passing by. Notice where their hands are and what they are doing with them. If they plan to attack you, their hands may be balled into fists or carrying a weapon. Look for “imprints” or outlines of concealed weapons on the clothing of suspicious individuals. Check near the waistband for a shape that could be a concealed weapon. Identify people who may be armed with weapons of opportunity or items not usually considered weapons but could do serious harm. Common examples are baseball bats or chains."

      "title": "Pay attention to how long strange behavior lasts.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how long strange behavior lasts. Keeping track of the time helps you notice trends in a person’s behavior that may not otherwise have seemed unusual to you. For example, if you notice someone walking laps around an area at regular intervals, pay attention. There’s nothing inherently dangerous about a person walking, but they could be waiting for you to lower your guard. Noticing they’re nearby can help you avoid a dangerous situation . Keep track of how long it has been since you last saw the people you are with. Waiting for your child outside of a public bathroom, for instance, is a situation where you may want to keep track of how long it’s been since you’ve seen them."

      "title": "Keep your brain sharp by getting enough sleep and eating well.",
      "content": "Keep your brain sharp by getting enough sleep and eating well. Getting plenty of sleep helps you stay alert . Fatigue makes it extremely difficult to remain attentive and focused. When you’re hungry, dehydrated, or tired, you grow distracted and less aware of your surroundings. Also, reduced blood sugar levels caused by prolonged periods of not eating can make you just as groggy as a lack of sleep. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Take notice of the signs of fatigue as they set in. It may get harder to pay attention, your temper is shorter, or your vision may blur slightly. Alcohol and prescription drugs can also cause fatigue, so make sure you drink responsibly and follow your doctor’s recommendations for medications. Possing recommends including meditation in your daily routine to help with overall awareness and observational skills. “Just slowing down and taking a breath – which sometimes means literally pausing for one second and taking one breath – is enough to open up your field of awareness…[so you] actually notice what's in your space.” [8] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020."

      "title": "Take necessary precautions in your everyday life.",
      "content": "Take necessary precautions in your everyday life. Be alert to possible danger, even in environments where you feel very comfortable, like your home or a favorite restaurant. If you have a regular jogging route or morning routine, change it up every so often. That way, you’ll avoid becoming so comfortable in your daily activities that you ignore threats around you. [9] X Research source When you come home, check your property for signs of a break-in, like broken windows. Leave your outside lights on and close your blinds at night. If you suspect someone is following you, don’t go home. Drive to a public place or police station to ask for help."

      "title": "Use your peripheral vision to identify threats.",
      "content": "Use your peripheral vision to identify threats. Looking directly at a suspicious person may draw unwanted attention. In some extreme cases, a possible threat may become a real one if a person or even a threatening animal interprets your gaze as a challenge. Because of this, practice scanning your surroundings from the sides of your vision. [10] X Research source Some individuals may approach you or even become hostile if they notice you looking directly at them. Using your peripheral vision means any dangerous individuals in your vicinity won’t know exactly what you’re looking at, allowing you a slight tactical advantage."

      "title": "Use your situational baseline to anticipate danger.",
      "content": "Use your situational baseline to anticipate danger. Create an image in your head of what normal looks, sounds, and smells like in your location and situation. Then, use that baseline to predict what happens next so it doesn’t take you by surprise. Also, knowing what should happen in a scenario helps you identify unusual occurrences. [11] X Research source If you see a truck pull into a parking lot near you, expect to hear its doors opening and closing or the beeping of its backup alarm. If you’re driving behind a school bus, predict that it may stop at any time to let children off in front of you. If you notice people behaving in an aggressive manner toward one another, be aware that they could fight, which may be a sign to leave the area."

      "title": "Pay attention when a situation feels off.",
      "content": "Pay attention when a situation feels off. Even when you’ve identified the situational baseline, assessed any possible threats, and come up with a strategy to get away from danger, you still might feel like something’s wrong. Trust your intuition . You may be unaware of how your body is interpreting stimuli surrounding you, but humans have evolved to sense danger. If you feel uneasy but don’t have objective reason for feeling that way, it’s possible your subconscious has noticed something you missed. [12] X Research source In a classic case of “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” trusting your gut about a situation and leaving may prove to have been unnecessary, but it’s better to be wrong about it a hundred times than to have been right once without acting."

      "title": "Position yourself to see threats coming.",
      "content": "Position yourself to see threats coming. Where you stand can improve your ability to maintain situational awareness in a given situation. For example, if you’re in a crowded room with too many people to keep track of, try to stand with your back to a wall. That way, no one will be able to sneak up behind you. [13] X Research source Different situations may require different positioning, but always try to put yourself in a place that allows you to identify any possible threats as they approach. Positioning yourself near exits may make it easier for you to quickly escape if a situation takes a turn for the worse."
