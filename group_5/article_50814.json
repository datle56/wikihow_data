      "title": "Know the law.",
      "content": "Know the law. The law is different everywhere so know your location and what laws immediately affect you. For example, if you are in a busy metropolitan city there usually are laws against putting up any temporary shelter. Many cities have outlawed sleeping outdoors and have placed precautions including having police harass anyone they suspect of living outside. Many homeless people find shelter in a doorway, tunnel or under a bridge. Be careful not to get fined as cities know that these are popular places of refuge. Visit the local library, search online, talk to a paralegal, visit the local courthouse, or city hall. Local laws are limited to the vicinity to which they apply so there may not be a lot of written information available to the public except for online resources. [1] X Research source"

Your clothes must protect you from the elements with little to no maintenance. You do not want to stick out with tattered or dirty rags after you have been drifting for some time. Black is a good colour that keeps its integrity without having to wash frequently. It also gives you a sleek profile if you need to carry a lot of items in pockets. For example, find garments that are waterproof especially shoes. You may be walking a lot so shoes need to be comfortable and durable.
