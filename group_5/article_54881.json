      "content": "Release your rear foot from its binding. Unfasten or step out of your rear binding before you get on the chairlift. It must be your rear! Again, make sure your front binding is fastened tightly as well as making sure the leash is attached. Also, be sure to fold down the back part of the rear binding. This is to prevent it being broken by the weight of the chair when you sit down."

After you slow down skate out of the way of the lift and strap your rear foot back onto the board. Don't attempt to turn while you are coming off the chairlift as it will risk the odds you fall down. Just go straight till you slow down naturally."
