      "content": "There’s no guarantee that your boyfriend will change, so try not to get your hopes up. While people with narcissistic traits do have the potential to change their ways a little bit, they usually need professional help to do it. Try to take your boyfriend at face-value and let go of the hope that he’s going to make any drastic changes in your relationship.

      "content": "Don’t let your boyfriend’s need for attention trump your own needs. When you’re dating someone with narcissistic traits, you might notice that his needs almost always get put first. If your boyfriend has been professionally diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), it’s possible that he genuinely struggles with empathy, so it may not come naturally to him to consider and prioritize your needs. Remember to prioritize yourself, too, and don’t let him steamroll you. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can do this with big things, like where you want to live, or even small things, like where you want to go to dinner. The more you put your own needs first, the better you’ll feel."

      "content": "Let his words roll off your back so they don’t hurt you. Some people may belittle their loved ones or call them names in order to feel like they’re better than them. If your boyfriend does this, remember that it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. [3] X Research source It can be really hard to stay calm and not react when someone is saying mean things about you (especially when it’s your partner). If you need to, walk into the other room and take some time for yourself before talking to him again."

      "title": "Boundaries",
      "content": "Boundaries tell your boyfriend what you are and aren’t okay with. When you’re dating someone with narcissistic qualities, you might notice that your partner tries to push your boundaries to see just how far you’ll let things go. Tell him your boundaries clearly, and set real, actionable consequences that you can follow through with if he disregards them. [4] X Research source “If you belittle me in public again, I’m leaving this relationship.” “I’m not going to talk to you if you keep calling me names. Let’s revisit this conversation once you’ve calmed down.”"

      "title": "Make your boyfriend feel heard to calm him down.",
      "content": "Make your boyfriend feel heard to calm him down. Many people who have been officially diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) struggle with feeling like no one truly gets where they’re coming from. If your boyfriend tries to pick a fight with you, calmly tell him that you see why he’s upset, and try to relate to him. The more you can convey that you understand him, the more comforted he’ll feel. [5] X Research source “I understand why you feel upset. I’d probably feel the same way.” “I totally get why you’re angry. That would make me mad, too.”"

      "title": "Stand firm in your sense of self so it doesn’t get warped.",
      "content": "Stand firm in your sense of self so it doesn’t get warped. People who consistently display narcissistic behaviors tend to believe that their version of reality is the only reality. When you’re in a relationship with someone like this, it may often feel like you’re going crazy—your partner might blame you for things you didn’t do or tell you about conversations that didn’t happen. This behavior is called “gaslighting,” and it’s a common manipulation tactic used in unhealthy relationships. [6] X Research source If you ever feel like you’re remembering something wrong, try writing it down. That way, you have concrete evidence of what happened that you can look back on. Or, repeat a mantra to yourself, like, “My version of reality is right. No one else can tell me what happened to me.”"

      "title": "Positive reinforcement makes a person more likely to change.",
      "content": "Positive reinforcement makes a person more likely to change. If your boyfriend does something that you can tell takes a lot of effort, praise him for it so he can see that you’ve noticed. Not only will your behavior possibly feed his ego, but you’ll let him know that he should do the same thing in the future. For example, you might say something like: [7] X Research source “These flowers are beautiful! Thank you so much for thinking of me while you were out and about.” “I really appreciate you giving me so much grace when I messed up earlier. I can tell that wasn’t easy.”"

While it’s unlikely that someone who’s been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) can change all of their ways, talking to a mental health professional can help your boyfriend find coping mechanisms and better ways to handle his emotions.
