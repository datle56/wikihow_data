      "title": "Get a color remover.",
      "content": "Get a color remover. Color remover gets into the hair shaft and strips artificial coloring while leaving your hair's natural color pigments. You can find color remover at beauty stores, drug stores, and some supermarkets. This option can be a bit harder on the hair, but it's usually more effective. Because you used semi-permanent dye, make sure that your color remover is meant for semi-permanent dye, not permanent dyes or demi-permanent dyes. [1] X Research source Check the products' labels for signs that the color remover is ammonia and bleach-free. Color remover can damage your hair as is, but if a product's formulas include either of these chemicals, they may be more harmful. To help battle hair damage when removing a dye, look for products that have butters, oils, silicones, keratins, or proteins. These are all strengthening and hydrating ingredients and should help reduce damage."

      "content": "Mix your color remover and the provided activator in a bowl. Your color remover kit should come with a color remover and an activator. Use your kit's brush or mixing tool to stir the two together until they're fully combined. Your box may include specific instructions you should follow, so read those carefully before you begin. Use gloves if they're provided and throw on some grubby clothes when you start working with the mixture. Color remover can stain clothes, and gloves will help keep your hands clean throughout the process."

      "content": "Perform a strand test. Tie back your hair except for one thin strand. Then, apply the color remover mixture to that strand with a dye brush and wrap foil around it (to trap heat in). Let it sit for 1 hour, or however long the instructions on the box specify, before washing it out with shampoo. If you’re satisfied with the color, you can move on to doing the rest of your hair. [2] X Research source Doing a strand test can be a little annoying, but it’s better to test the color remover on a small piece of your hair instead of your whole head in case you don’t like the resulting color!"

Combining baking soda, an abrasive, with anti-dandruff shampoo , a clarifying product, creates a mixture that can help strip dye out of hair . Start 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of baking soda and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of anti-dandruff shampoo. Depending on how long and thick your hair is, you may need to use larger amounts—just be sure to keep the ratio equal. Stir them together in a bowl until they’re thoroughly combined.

Combined with clarifying shampoo , it can help strip the dye and get your hair a few shades lighter. Using a pill crusher , a mortar and pestle , or a bowl and spoon, crush the tablets into a fine powder. [10] X Research source You can also buy 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of ascorbic acid powder instead of 15-20 vitamin C tablets.

[11] X Research source Depending on how long and thick your hair is, you may need to increase the amount of shampoo and vitamin C powder you use. Just be sure to keep the ratio the same. For example, if you originally used 15 tablets and 1 tbsp of shampoo, try doubling it by using 30 tablets and 2 tbsp of shampoo."

If necessary, apply a clarifying shampoo to help lift the color further. Repeat this process about 2 times per week until you achieve your desired hair color. [16] X Research source Expert hair stylist Courtney Foster recommends following up a clarifying shampoo with a moisturizing one. “If you use clarifying shampoo and follow up with a moisturizing shampoo,” she says, “then you know all of the product is out of your hair and you can start with a blank canvas.” Note that you likely won’t see immediate results with this method, as ACV often lightens hair more gradually. If you really want to remove your hair dye within a day, stick with one of the methods listed above."

      "content": "Mix lemon juice and water. Squeeze the juice of 3 fresh lemons (about 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of juice) into a spray bottle and add 1 cup (240 mL) of lukewarm water. Some sources say to use equal parts of water and lemon juice, but lemon juice is very acidic and can easily dry out your hair and irritate your skin, so it might be better to start with a more diluted amount. [17] X Research source Lemons contain vitamin C, which helps lighten hair. For extra moisture, add a small amount of coconut oil or conditioner to the mixture."

Then, go outside and let your hair air dry in the sun for 30 minutes to 2 hours. The sun’s rays aid the lightening process. While you should always wear sunscreen outdoors, it’s especially important when using this hair-lightening method. The chemicals in lemons react harshly with the sun, often leading to painful sunburns. This method may not be best for those with sensitive skin. [18] X Research source This method will likely only work if exposed to the sun. The sun’s UV rays open up the hair cuticles and allow the citric acid to break down and reduce the pigment in your hair."

If you notice skin irritation, do so less often or use another lightening method."

[19] X Research source To do a hot oil treatment , pour a small bowl of olive oil and warm it in the microwave or on the stove. Check it every few seconds, as you want the oil to be warm but not hot. Dab some on your wrist to make sure it’s a comfortable temperature. Note that using olive oil may give your hair a warm tint or even make it look yellow. You can also try this method without heating the oil. Simply coat your hair with a few tablespoons of olive oil and let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour before rinsing."

      "content": "Mix raw honey, cinnamon, and conditioner. Start with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of raw honey and 1 tsp (2.6 g) of cinnamon and let the mixture sit for about 30 minutes so the ingredients have time to interact. Then, to thicken the combination into a hair mask, add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of conditioner. [21] X Research source You may need to adjust these measurements depending on the length and thickness of your hair. Make sure the ratio stays the same as you adjust. If the mask is too sticky, try adding 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of water. To add moisture, throw in 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil. As the ingredients interact, they create hydrogen peroxide, which is what lightens your hair. This is a gentle, natural alternative to bleaching."

      "content": "Wrap your hair, let it sit overnight, then wash it. Use a hair cover like a shower cap to keep your hair protected and avoid making a mess. The ingredients will slowly lift the dye and make your hair smell incredible. The next morning, all you have to do is wash it out. [23] X Research source If you can’t leave the mask on overnight, do so for at least 4 hours. You may need to repeat this process several times before you notice a change in your hair color. This isn’t recommended for a quick fix to a botched hair color. The more cinnamon you add, the more likely you are to notice a change in your hair. This method may also result in a reddish tint."
