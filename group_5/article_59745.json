      "content": "Measure 2 teaspoons (8.4 grams) of your preferred salt into the bowl. Salt helps to bring out the flavours in the sausages, preserves the meat, and binds the ingredients together. It is important to use a good quality to salt to ensure that the sausages are well preserved and maintain their taste. Canning salt, kosher flake salt, and purified salt are good options that work well in sausages. Avoid using iodized salt in sausages as it isn’t pure enough."

      "content": "Mix in your favourite combination of herbs and spices. Ground spices are the best choice when making your own seasoning as they provide an even flavour throughout the sausages. Add a total of 4 teaspoons (7 grams) of your favourite herbs and spices into a bowl and mix all the ingredients together with a spoon. Experiment with different combinations to find your favourite. Paprika, basil, and thyme is a delicious combination. A mixture of sage, marjoram, and chilli works well."
