      "content": "Ask your Sagittarius if he sees a future in your relationship. A Sagittarius will appreciate an open conversation, even if it's difficult. This is the zodiac sign that most respects honesty and straightforwardness, both in themselves and in others. [1] X Research source He'll probably let you know how he really feels. This is a sign that doesn’t like stringing people along, and opening up a straightforward conversation is the easiest way to see where your relationship is at. Saying something like, “Would you ever be interested in a relationship with me?” is a good way to open this kind of conversation. [2] X Research source If he isn’t messaging you unless it’s already night, he’s probably not looking for anything more than a casual fling. A Sagittarius that wants something more won’t just talk to you only when he wants a hook-up."

      "content": "A Sagittarius that’s interested in someone will be scared off by nothing. When an Archer knows what he wants, he doesn’t let anything stop him, and so if he’s always coming up with flimsy reasons why he can’t be with you, it’s a sign that you might not be a priority for him.

      "title": "When a Sagittarius has feelings for you, he’ll let you know.",
      "content": "When a Sagittarius has feelings for you, he’ll let you know. Keep in mind that sex might just be sex to a Sagittarius. These signs are straightforward, and won’t lie to you, but if he hasn’t said that he sees you as more than a hook-up, don’t assume that he secretly does. [4] X Research source If he hasn’t said anything about any feelings he has about you, he could just be thinking of your relationship as a passing diversion. Or, he could just be waiting to get to know you some more—sometimes only time will tell! Reader Poll: We asked 407 wikiHow readers and 54% agreed that they feel special and appreciated when a Sagittarius shows that they care about their comfort and happiness. [Take Poll] If you're feeling confused or frustrated by your Sag man's actions, he may not be that invested."

      "content": "Being straightforward means that a Sagittarius won't play hard-to-get. If you suspect that your Sagittarius is playing this game, take this as a cue that he isn’t interested in taking things further. [5] X Research source Some signs love the mystery and excitement of playing hard-to-get, but not a Sagittarius. They grow frustrated with this game very quickly, and will exit a relationship fast once it’s clear that the other person is playing games with them. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Think about if your Sagittarius has been interested in ‘the real you. ’ Check in with yourself about whether he’s ever asked you questions about yourself, your life experiences, or your goals. Sagittarians are known for their irresistible bravado, but that doesn’t mean he should only be thinking about himself. [7] X Research source If your Sagittarius doesn’t seem interested in really getting to know you, this could be a sign he’s more interested in pulling you into his orbit than sharing a life with you."

      "content": "If a Sagittarius keeps you away from his adventures, he could be playing you. Sagittarians want to settle down with an adventurous companion who will join them in their constant movement. If he’s avoiding bringing you along while he's checking out new places, this could be a sign that he doesn’t see you as a romantic partner yet. [8] X Research source This doesn’t mean that he needs to invite you to everything he does—a Sagittarius will always want to have an independent circle of friends, and will want you to as well. But if he’s not making an effort to have new experiences with you, chances are he’s not interested in a deeper relationship. [9] X Research source"

If your Sagittarius is still talking about their life without any indication they would want to share it with another person, believe them. No one can force a Sagittarius to settle down when he doesn’t want to! [10] X Research source When a Sagittarius is ready to settle, he’ll be loyal and a wonderful partner. But getting to that point might take a while! Being ruled by playful Jupiter means that the childlike sensibilities of a Sagittarius outlast a lot of the other signs, which can keep them away from commitment. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Think through your conversations with your Sagittarius. Then, ask yourself whether there was ever a time when he got more serious, and wasn’t just flirting. It can be tough to tell sometimes, since Sagittarians are often funny, even while discussing serious subjects. [12] X Research source Sagittarians love to flirt, and they’re good at it too. These charmers can sweep you off your feet with their self-confidence and wit. But part of what makes them such good flirts is that they treat flirting like a game, and since it is a game to them, they can back out at any time. If you aren’t able to identify a moment when he ever got more real with you, this could be a sign he hasn’t decided to commit his feelings to you yet. [13] X Research source"

He wants to collect as many different experiences as possible, and he might lose interest after one great night out with you. This doesn’t mean that he doesn’t like you—in fact, Sagittarians often count former flings as close friends. [14] X Research source This sign can have a very one-and-done personality, moving on to the next thing very quickly. If he seems reluctant to keep going out with you, try not to take it personally. The Sagittarius will think of his time with you fondly, and will hope you will too. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Sagittarians love two-way conversations with people they’re interested in. [16] X Research source If you’re feeling brushed aside in your more abstract discussions with a Sagittarius, that could be a sign that they’re more interested in showing off than a long-term commitment. Ruled by philosophical Jupiter, Sagittarians love deep talks about politics, philosophy, and art, and will want to have a romantic partner that can contribute to these conversations. A Sagittarius will want to get to know how you see the world if he’s really interested. Ask him what kinds of movies or books he likes, and see how he responds when you tell him about your own opinions. [17] X Research source"

Even though they are notoriously honest, they’re only honest because they see honesty as the best way to help other people. [18] X Research source Sagittarians have a reputation for brashness, but this doesn’t mean they lack empathy. In fact, being ruled by the philosophical Jupiter makes this sign extremely good at putting himself in other people’s shoes. [19] X Research source"

If a Sagittarius has traded in his trademark honesty for keeping you in the dark, he isn’t showing you the respect you deserve. Lying to you about who he’s been talking to and where he’s been is a big red flag that he’s just playing you, so don’t let him get away with it. [20] X Research source"
