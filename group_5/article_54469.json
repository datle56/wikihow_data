      "content": "Note that the problem is probably the bulb if only one light is flickering. When lights start flickering, the first question is whether the problem is from your wiring or the lightbulb itself. Wiring problems would affect multiple fixtures and maybe even the whole building. Check the other lights in your home. If only one or two are flickering, then the problem is probably not with your home’s wiring. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn off the flickering light and let it cool down before touching it. Whether the flickering light is on a fixture or appliance, start by turning the switch off. Then wait a few minutes for the bulb to cool down so you don’t burn yourself. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to wait for the bulb to cool, you could wrap a towel or oven mitt around your hand to protect it from the heat. Never try to adjust electrical appliances while the power is on. Always turn the power off first."

      "content": "Tighten the bulb so it fits snugly in the socket. A loose lightbulb flickers because it forms an incomplete circuit with the electrical socket. [3] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. Tightening the bulb should fix this problem. Turn the bulb clockwise to tighten it. [4] X Research source Stop turning the bulb when it won’t go any further. Overtightening can damage the socket or even crack the bulb. You could cut yourself if the bulb breaks in your hand. Some lightbulb sockets spin along with the bulb, so you need two hands to tighten it. Hold the socket with one hand to keep it still while you turn the bulb with the other hand."

      "content": "Turn the lights back on to see if they’ve stopped flickering. If the lights were flickering because the bulb was loose, then the problem should be fixed when you turn the lights back on. If the flickering continues, the problem is probably with the light switch or your home’s wiring. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. This is especially common if you have a dimmer on the switch. Test your light switches by jiggling the knob. If the lights flicker while you do this, you probably have a loose connection in the switch. [7] X Research source Slowly raise the dimmer up and down as well. See if the lights dim and brighten consistently, or if there are quick jumps in brightness."

[8] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. Go to your breaker box and find the circuit breaker that powers the room you’re working in. Turn it to the Off position to cut the power to the room. [9] X Research source Test the switches in the room to make sure the power is off. Note that in this method you'll be working with wires. If you aren't confident in your ability to work with electricity, call a professional electrician."

      "content": "Unscrew the wall plate and light switch to expose the wires. There are 4 screws holding the light fixture to the wall. The first 2 secure the wall plate over the fixture. Remove them and take off the plate. Then remove the next 2 that hold the fixture itself to the wall. [10] X Research source Use a flathead screwdriver for this step. Since you're working with wires, use a screwdriver with a rubber handle. Keep track of all the screws you remove so you can replace them when you're done."

Take your screwdriver and tighten each screw so it's snug. [11] X Research source Don’t overtighten the screws. Some might be tight enough and don’t need an adjustment. Don’t push the screws further if they stop spinning easily."

      "content": "Install an LED-compatible dimmer if you have LED bulbs. Flickering is common when LED lights don’t have an LED-compatible dimmer. If you use a dimmer and LED bulbs, your dimmer may not be LED-compatible. If your dimmer is already installed, you probably can’t tell just by sight if it’s designed for LED use. Try looking at the model number on the dimmer and doing an internet search for it. If you can’t find any information, contact the manufacturer and ask. [12] X Research source Change the dimmer switch to an LED-compatible one to fix the flickering problem. When buying a new dimmer, look at the packaging for text indicating that it is LED-compatible. If you aren’t sure, ask a store employee for help."

[14] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. The main breaker is a larger switch than all the other circuit breakers. It is usually in the middle or on the top of the breaker panel. Switch it to the Off position before proceeding. [15] X Research source Note that this will cut power for your whole home. Turn off any appliances and make sure no one needs the electricity before you do this. Have a flashlight or battery-powdered lamp with you so you can see what you’re doing. To confirm the power is off, use a voltage tester to make sure there is no electric current in the breaker box. If you're unfamiliar with working on wires and electrical panels, call a professional electrician for this job."

There will probably be 4 or 6 screws, depending on how the panel was installed. Then carefully lift the housing off when all the screws are removed. [16] X Research source Use a flathead screwdriver with a rubber handle for this step. Keep track of all the screws you remove so you can put them back when you’re done."

Near where the wire enters the breaker is a screw that holds the wire in place. If this screw is loose, it could cause flickering lights. Work your way down the breaker panel and tighten every screw. Use a flathead screwdriver and turn the screws clockwise. [17] X Research source Many of the screws might not tighten easily. This means they are already tight enough, so don’t force them. You only have to tighten screws that have loosened up over time."
