      "content": "Ask yourself what is causing you to feel jealous. It’s important to identify the root of your jealousy. While you may initially believe that you are jealous of something superficial, once you begin to look at your feelings of jealousy more deeply, you may realize that there is likely one specific root of your jealousy, which you can then change, or at least talk about. [1] X Research source Often, what you’re jealous of points to something that makes you unhappy about yourself. For example, if you’re jealous of someone’s hair, it might mean you’re unhappy with or ashamed about the way your own hair looks. Once you have figured out what specifically you are jealous of, you can begin to work on yourself to overcome that jealousy."

      "title": "Separate your emotions from the situation.",
      "content": "Separate your emotions from the situation. We sometimes confuse how we feel about something with the way it actually is. Examine your feelings of jealousy and separate them from the reality of the situation. Often you are jealous of something fleeting and trivial—ask yourself if what you're jealous of will matter a year from now. Jealousy is a natural feeling, but it’s important not to let it take control of your life. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re jealous of someone complimenting your friend, remind yourself that just because your friend got a compliment, it doesn’t mean they’re better than you, or that the two of you are competing. It just means that someone said something nice about them!"

      "title": "Stop comparing yourself to others.",
      "content": "Stop comparing yourself to others. When you live your life constantly comparing yourself to others, you create insecurities and recognize disparities that breed jealousy. Instead, try to compare yourself only to yourself. After all, you’re your own person, with your own positive and negative qualities. Life isn’t a competition! [3] X Research source Try this: Take a break from social media until your self-esteem is better. Social media gives you a false impression of other people’s lives, but they struggle just as much as you do; they’re just not usually posting those struggles to social media. Make a list of your own successes, goals, and how far you’ve come. This will help focus your energy into a productive mindset that will let you think about yourself rather than other people."

      "title": "Explore your past trauma.",
      "content": "Explore your past trauma. Oftentimes, jealousy is a self-defense mechanism your mind learned to protect you from something that might have happened in the past. Ask yourself if your jealousy is a response to a traumatic event in the past, and explore ways to heal from that trauma, like therapy. [4] X Research source For example, a past loved one may have hurt you somehow, and now you expect the same behavior from your current loved ones. Recognize that each person is different, and it’s unfair to think less of yourself or someone else just because of what another person did in the past. Keep a journal of your thoughts as you consider why and how you might feel things. This is a good way to externalize your feelings and get a better idea of exactly what you feel. Talk to someone you trust, like a guardian or a friend who isn’t involved. Often, having an outside perspective helps to sort out your feelings."

      "title": "Consider and take advantage of your insecurities.",
      "content": "Consider and take advantage of your insecurities. Take some time to identify your insecurities, and then focus on building them into strengths instead, which will lessen feelings of jealousy. Working on your own characteristics takes your focus off of other people and back onto yourself. [5] X Research source For example, perhaps you’re lonely and want to make more friends, but you’re not very social. Practice being outgoing and friendly toward strangers and eventually you’ll have become a more confident, assured person. Keep a positive mindset while identifying areas in which you are insecure. Remind yourself of things you do feel confident in or like about yourself."

I think I’m feeling a little jealous and could use a little help.” “Can you help me draw as well as you do? I just love how skilled you are, and I want to be the same!”"
