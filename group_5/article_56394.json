      "content": "Keep your breath fresh and your lips soft . If you plan on kissing your boyfriend, you’ll want to have fresh breath. Before a date or whenever you know you’ll be alone together, take the time to brush your teeth, use mouthwash, eat a breath mint, or chew some gum. You should also use lip balm regularly to keep your lips soft and hydrated. [2] X Research source Don't use lip gloss, as it is not the same as lip balm. While lip balm absorbs into your lips and makes them soft, lip gloss sits on your lips. The sticky texture may be a turn-off."

      "content": "Pick a moment when you have privacy. Public displays of affection can make people feel uncomfortable, so it’s a good idea to wait until you are alone with your boyfriend to kiss him. Even if you only have a few minutes alone together before school or after practice, you can make them count by giving him a gentle kiss. [3] X Research source This doesn't mean that you have to wait until you are completely alone in your room. An empty hallway or a quiet park would be just fine!"

Before diving into a kiss, it’s a good idea to break the touch barrier and make sure he is comfortable first. Reach out to grab his hand, give him a hug, or snuggle in close to him. Watch his reaction to see if he’s ready to take things a step further. Remember that if he ever seems uncomfortable, pulls away, or asks you to stop, you should respect his wishes. [7] X Research source Be mindful of his body language while leading up to the kiss. People can change their minds or start feeling uncomfortable once things start to progress."

      "content": "Gaze into his eyes, then look at his lips. Look directly into your boyfriend’s eyes for a few seconds. If he returns the gaze, he probably wants to kiss you, too.

[8] X Research source This simple body language will cue him into your next move."

      "content": "Tug him gently closer to you. Don’t be rough or yank on him, just gently pull him closer. You can put your hands around his neck or on his chest. He may put his hands on your waist. Do whatever feels comfortable for you both, rather than worrying about what you “should” do. [9] X Research source Be mindful of his body language at this point. If he stiffens up or tries to pull away from you, he may not be feeling comfortable. Save the kiss for another time."

      "title": "Tilt your head slightly and press your lips softly to his.",
      "content": "Tilt your head slightly and press your lips softly to his. Turning your head will prevent your noses from knocking together which could make this intimate moment awkward. Keep your lips soft and barely puckered. Don’t press too hard; use minimal pressure. [10] X Research source Again, try not to think too much about the motions. Let them come naturally."

      "title": "Pull away after a few seconds.",
      "content": "Pull away after a few seconds. A gentle kiss should be short and sweet. If he leans back in after you both pulled away a bit, then he probably wants to kiss you again. If you’re okay with that, lean in and give him another kiss. [11] X Research source Don't force another kiss on him, especially if he doesn't lean in for a second one. If you don't won't want a second kiss, give a gentle sign, such as leaning back, pulling away, or turning your face to the side. Shoving him away is not a good option."

For example, if the 2 of you are cuddling on the couch, snuggle into him and press a light kiss to his neck."
