      "title": "Cut stems back if your penstemon plant starts looking rough around the edges.",
      "content": "Cut stems back if your penstemon plant starts looking rough around the edges. While you can just let penstemon grow naturally, the stems may grow uneven and may not look as cosmetically pleasing. Use a pair of gardening sheers and place them up to one-third down from the tip of the stem. Squeeze the handles together to cut the stem at a 45-degree angle so water doesn’t pool on top. Continue trimming any other stems that are longer than the others. Never trim off more than one-third of the growths during the growing season, or else your penstemons may not bloom."

      "content": "Deadhead the flowers to promote a second round of blooms. Wait until after your penstemon blooms and the flowers begin to wither. Place a pair of pruning shears or a gardening knife just below the set of healthy leaves closest to the bloom. Make your cut at a 45-degree angle to prevent the stems from rotting. [1] X Research source Flowers usually appear sporadically after deadheading, so you may not get a full second bloom."

      "content": "Prune one-third off of each stem's height in the fall to winterize the plant. As soon as the flowers start withering and turning brown, you can prune your penstemons. Hold a pair of pruning shears a third of the way down the stem from the tip. Keep the shears at a 45-degree angle to the stem and make your cut. Work your way around the plant, cutting back all of your stems so they’re only two-thirds their original height. [2] X Research source Leave the remaining growth from the summer when you’re pruning, or else you may risk your penstemons dying during the winter."

      "title": "Start trimming your penstemon after the last frost in spring.",
      "content": "Start trimming your penstemon after the last frost in spring. Leave the remaining growth on your penstemons over winter to protect them from any harsh weather and help them survive. Check online for the last estimated frost date in your area or climate so you know when to start cutting. When the weather starts warming up and there’s no risk for frost, it’s safe to cut the stems. [3] X Research source You can find the last expected frost date for your area here: https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates . If you cut back your penstemons any earlier, they may not grow during the next season."

      "title": "Trim growths that are dead or don’t have new shoots down to the base.",
      "content": "Trim growths that are dead or don’t have new shoots down to the base. Examine your penstemon’s stems to see if they have any fresh green shoots growing from them. If you notice a stem that doesn’t have any shoots, place your prunings shears just above the soil and make your cut. Then check for any stems that are cracked, withered, or damaged and remove them since they won’t produce any healthy shoots. [4] X Research source Be sure to check the stems in the middle of the plant as well to help thin it out."

Place your pruning shears at a 45-degree angle just above the node for the lowest shoot on the stem. Snip through the stem to cut it off of the plant. Check the remaining stems on your penstemon and cut them back the same way.

Look at the ends of the stems and find a few that don’t have any flowers growing from them. Put your pruning shears 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) from the tip of the stem just below one of the nodes with leaves growing from it. Make a 45-degree angle cut to take your cutting.

      "content": "Pull the bottom leaves off your cuttings. Locate the 2–3 leaves that are closest to the cut end of your cutting. Pinch the base of the leaf and gently pull it from the stem. That way, you expose more of the stem to help promote healthy root growth.

      "content": "Dip the cut ends into a rooting hormone. Rooting hormone helps stimulate the plant’s growth and helps protect the roots from fungus. Pour some rooting hormone into a dish and place the cut ends of the plant in the powder. Coat the exposed node where you removed the leaves as well so they will sprout new roots. Apply the hormone to all of the cuttings you took so they’re more likely to survive. [9] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source You can buy rooting hormone online or from your local gardening supply store. Throw away any rooting hormone that’s left in the dish rather than putting it back in the container. Otherwise, you could contaminate it and potentially spread diseases harmful to your plants."

Set a large plastic bag over the bamboo poles to help trap the moisture so they’re more likely to grow. Alternatively, you can keep the pot inside an unheated propagator to maintain the humidity.
