      "content": "This saying means that someone wants to enjoy life without worry. Being “here for a good time” means that someone intends to have fun. The second half of the phrase, “not for a long time,” means that life is short, and so we should take full advantage of it. The phrase also sometimes implies that someone wants to have fun, even if it puts their safety or well-being in danger, since the risk is worth the reward, and we all die someday, anyway. For example: Person 1: “Why do you stay out late all the time? You always look so tired.” Person 2 “Because I’m here for a good time, not a long time.”"

      "content": "In Tinder bios, it means the person is looking for casual flings or hookups. When you see this phrase on dating apps like Bumble, Hinge, or Tinder, the person is usually saying that they’re not looking for a serious long-term relationship (hence, “not a long time”). Instead, they probably want something more carefree and temporary like a few casual dates, hookups, or maybe a friends-with-benefits situation. [1] X Research source They may also just be looking to flirt or chat and aren’t looking for anything serious."

      "content": "Say this when you do something reckless for the sake of enjoyment. Maybe you’re dancing on top of a table, or jumping out of a helicopter to ski down a mountain, or just eating one more cookie after you’ve already had enough. Say “I’m here for a good time, not a long time,” to explain that you want to have fun, even if there are potentially negative consequences. “Yes, I know that jumping into a frozen lake is dangerous, but it looks fun, and I’m here for a good time, not a long time.”"

      "content": "Use the phrase to help others loosen up and enjoy themselves. Sometimes it’s good to remind other people that life is short, and if they don’t take the occasional opportunity to enjoy themselves, their life might pass them by. Tell them, “We’re here for a good time, not a long time,” to let them know you think they should lighten up. Person 1: “There’s no way I’m going bungee jumping with you! What if I died?” Person 2: “You’re going to die someday anyway! We’re here for a good time, not a long time, so let’s have a good time.”"

      "content": "Use the phrase on dating apps to signal casual intentions. On apps like Tinder, Bumble, and others, you might add “Here for a good time, not a long time” to your bio to let others know that you’re not looking for anything serious, and would prefer more temporary or casual hangouts, hookups, or even a brief relationship, rather than a long-term commitment. That said, the phrase is pretty common on dating apps, and might not set you apart from the crowd. Consider coming up with something new for a bio , or adding something to “here for a good time…” to make you stand out."

      "content": "“Live fast, die young.” This means the same as “Here for a good time, not a long time,” but with a more aggressive or direct connotation. When someone says this, they mean that they intend to get the most out of a short life, rather than live a long life. “You could die at any moment anyway, so why not live fast and die young?”"

      "title": "“You only live once.”",
      "content": "“You only live once.” This also has a similar meaning to “here for a good time, not a long time.” Here, though, the speaker wants to enjoy their life, because they say they won’t get another, so they must take advantage of the one they have. [2] X Research source The phrase is often abbreviated to “YOLO” and was popular in the mid-2000s. “YOLO” is often used ironically to make fun of people who say it excessively, or to justify doing something someone knows they shouldn’t. “Hold my drink while I ask out this girl. YOLO.”"
