However, there are longer Reels since many older videos shorter than 15 minutes were converted to a Reel. You cannot make Reels longer than 90 seconds now. [1] X Research source If you upload a video (longer than 90 seconds but shorter than 15 min), it'll be shared to Reels.

      "content": "The best length for you depends on your goals. Are you trying to catch potential consumers' eyes or want to tell a story? These Reels have very different purposes and aren't all the same length. Look at your goals to figure out how long the Reel should be: Get attention: 3-7 seconds. Keep the content simple and energetic. A Reel without those two components will most likely mean that your target audience is bored and swipes down for another Reel. Most Reels intended to grab attention are usually 3 seconds long, so you want to stick around that number. Increase views: 3-10 seconds. But you can get away with longer videos using different tricks, like including an element of surprise at the end; that way, people want to watch your Reel multiple times to see if they can spot hints at the ending before it happens. You can also use another trick, like putting text over a fast-paced video. This ensures that your audience will have to re-watch the video to know to pause it so they can read the text on the screen. Get more comments or shares: 15-30 seconds. Remember, the first 3-5 seconds are the most important, where you need to hook your audience . You can do this multiple ways, but you can rely on clickbaity titles, ask an intriguing question, or say something wild and unexpected. Your main goal is to keep your audience's attention until the end of the video, where you have your call-to-action; Comment now!, share this with your friends!, leave an answer in the comments!, comment on your best trip/whatever the video is about!, share your worst experience!, etc. Build a connection: 60-90 seconds. Stories are one of the most powerful forms of advertisement or short clips that we can get out there. If you tell a story in a Reel, you will likely build more authentic bonds with your audience. Sometimes, you can get away with uploading shorter videos if you can tell the entire story in less time. But don't go overboard and bore your audience with unnecessarily long Reels, either!"
