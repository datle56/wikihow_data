      "content": "A cotton swab or cotton bud works best for lash extension removal. Put a small dot of petroleum jelly—about the size of a grain of rice—onto the tip of your swab. Remember that you can always add more if you need, but you risk accidentally getting jelly in your eye if you use too much at once.

      "content": "The petroleum jelly needs time to fully dissolve the lash adhesive. After you’ve massaged it into the lash glue, allow it to sit while it absorbs into the extensions and softens the adhesive. Wait 3 to 5 minutes before gently wiping your lashes to see if they’re loose enough to come off. [5] X Research source If you feel resistance when you test a lash, wait a few more minutes or add a tiny bit more petroleum jelly to fully dissolve the glue."

      "title": "If the adhesive is dissolved, the lashes should slide off without drama.",
      "content": "If the adhesive is dissolved, the lashes should slide off without drama. Use a small brush, like an eyebrow brush or a mascara wand, to gently wipe the lashes away. [6] X Research source Brush across your lashes at a downward angle, repeating strokes until all of the extensions are off. [7] X Research source Alternatively, use your cotton swab to gently slide the extensions down and off your eyelid. The extensions might even start to come off as soon as you apply the jelly. Try not to tug or pull on stuck lashes. If they’re resistant, wait longer for the jelly to dissolve the adhesive."
