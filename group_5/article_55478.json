Before purchasing a pot rack, get a tape measure and measure the area where you're planning to hang the rack. Most people hang pot racks somewhere in the kitchen, often above a stove or counter. See how much space you have and select a pot rack that will fit within that space."

      "content": "Use a stud finder to locate the ceiling joists. After measuring your area, you'll need to find ceiling joists. These are horizontal supporting members above your ceiling. You will need to install screws to fasten the pot rack into the ceiling joists. A dry wall ceiling, on its own is not strong enough to support a pot rack. To find ceiling joists, you can use a stud finder, which you can purchase at any hardware store. A stud finder is a small handheld device that you run across a surface like a wall or ceiling. When a stud or joist is located, the stud finder usually lights up or makes a noise. Run your stud finder along the ceiling until you locate a ceiling joist. When it lights up, you've found a joist. You should find at least two joists, as you'll be drilling four or more holes in a rectangular shape to hang your pot rack. If you don't have ceiling joists, you'll need to use anchors to attach the rack to your ceiling. [1] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020."

You will use this template as a guide to drill holes in your ceiling. Trace the outline of the rack with a pencil. There should be four or more hooks on your pot rack, which is where the chains are hung to secure the rack from the ceiling. Mark where the hooks are located on the cardboard. Use a sharp object, such as a knife or a pair of scissors, to make a small hole where each chain will be hung."

Refer to the instructions manual that came with your pot rack to see what size drill bit you need. There is no standard size drill bit for hanging pot racks. In depends on your specific rack. Once you've drilled the holes, you can screw the hooks that came with the pot rack into the ceiling.

These are bolts that anchor through dry wall, allowing you to hang the rack without the support of joists. Toggle bolts are a type of anchor recommended for hanging a pot rack as they can support a fair amount of weight and are fairly easy to install. Most hardware stores sell toggle bolts. [2] X Research source Check how much weight toggle bolts can support before making a purchase. It should say on the package how much weight a specific type of toggle bolt can hold. Make sure the bolts are strong enough to support your pot rack. It's a good idea to use anchors that will hold a lot more weight than you thing you'll need. [3] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. For this to be accurate, you will need to also determine the type of ceiling you have. Some ceilings are 1/2 inch thick dry wall, others 5/8 inch, the latter will hold much more weight than the former. Other ceilings may not be suitable for any installation, such as acoustic tile."

To do so, lay your pot rack on a piece of cardboard. Trace the rack, making a template. Mark where the chains fall and use a sharp object, like a pair of scissors or a knife, to cut small holes where the chains fall. Place your template against the spot on the ceiling where you intend to hang the rack. Use a pencil to draw a small dot where each chain will fall."

The idea behind a toggle bolt is that you'll push the toggle through the wall when it's closed. Then, it will open on the other side of the dry wall, anchoring itself to the ceiling. You want to drill a hole in the drywall big enough that the toggle can pass through closed. You should refer to the instructions on your toggle bolt package to figure out the precise size hole you'll need. Then, drill a hole of that size into your ceiling."

If you simply nail a pot rack into dry wall, as you would nail it into a ceiling joist, the rack will inevitably fall. This can cause a lot of damage to your ceiling and kitchen and potentially hurt a pet or person standing near the rack when it falls. Always use ceiling anchors when attaching a pot rack to dry wall."
