[8] X Research source First of all, your vent must be heavy metal, not plastic or metal foil. Select the route that follows the straightest/most direct path to the outdoors, with as few elbows/turns as possible. Bent the vent carefully so as not to hinder its effectiveness. Use clamps to seal all joints, and in terms of the vent's \"elbows,\" a 45° angle is much more effective than 90°. Exhaust vents in mobile homes must be securely fastened to a flame resistant portion of the home and the vent's ending should be outside the structure itself. Remember, improper venting can cue moisture damage to woodwork, furniture, wallpaper, etc., so as you move on be sure to follow all instructions exactly."
