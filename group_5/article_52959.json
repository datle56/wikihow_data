      "content": "Defeat 25 Taken bosses or minibosses. This task may sound like a massive undertaking, but it can be completed quickly if you use the right quests. The final phases of The Blind Well tend to include several Taken bosses, so running that quest a few times could help you complete this portion of Darkness in the Light rather quickly. An alternative approach is to visit the Shattered Throne dungeon in the Dreaming City. Start the encounter and you will see a yellow bar “Labyrinth Architect”. Once you defeat it, you can collect some ammo and jump off the side of the map. Your checkpoint will conveniently spawn you in front of the Labyrinth Architect, so you may continue to farm this enemy type over and over until your task is complete."

This strike is made available after completing The Last Wish, but a special version of the strike is unlocked after completing the City of Secrets portion of the Darkness in the Light quest. You can access The Corrupted strike via The Dreaming City map, so boot it up to get started. While the strike is not the most challenging, there are still sections of it that are best completed as part of a Fireteam. Consider teaming up with others instead of starting the strike solo."

You will definitely want to assemble a strong Fireteam for this one, as you need to win 10 Gambit matches and then drop off 400 Motes.

Be sure to deposit the Motes you collect after each wave ends, as any Motes you lose in combat will count doubly against your total. You must complete both parts of this objective to progress past the Business as Usual stage of the quest. Stay focused on winning and collecting across your 10+ matches!"

We have recommended that you team up with others a few times throughout this guide, but it is absolutely imperative during this final portion of the Darkness in the Light quest. Your objective is to either: Kill 25 Guardians in Gambit Kill four enemies during one invasion Kill four enemies with a Fireteam during three separate invasions. If you find a friend who is especially good from long range or with a Rocket Launcher, you should accomplish this third option in no time."

If you still decided to play solo, you will need to be aggressive in wiping out opposing Guardians as you pursue a total of 25. We recommend using Super or Heavy weapons.

The Malfeasance's exotic perk Explosive Shadow allows you to blow up enemies after you hit them with five consecutive shots. When playing as a Fireteam, this perk impacts your teammates' weapons as well. The Malfeasance also deals increased damage to Taken enemies and invading Guardians in Gambit. [2] X Research source"
