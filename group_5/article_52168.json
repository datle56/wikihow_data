Some experts recommend wearing disposable gloves and a dust mask to prevent the spread of toxoplasmosis, a coccidial organism that some cats carry and transmit through fecal matter.

[5] X Research source If you let solid wastes build up in the litter box, your cat may refuse to use the litter box, even if the litter was only changed a few days ago. Use a special scooper, available at most pet stores. These scoopers have a grated bottom, so you can collect solid waste while the surrounding litter falls through the grates and back into the litter box."

Some experts recommend scrubbing the box at least once every week, while other experts recommend scrubbing at least once each month. [11] X Research source How often you wash your cat's litter box will depend on how many cats use the box and what kind of litter you use.

      "content": "Choose the right litter . Cats generally prefer clumping litter over non-clumping litter. Most cats find that it's more comfortable to walk on clumping litter because it's made of finer-grained material, and it's generally easier for your cat to bury his waste in. Plus, clumping litter will make it much easier for you to keep the litter box clean. [19] X Research source However, some cats do prefer traditional, non-clumping clay litter. Take note of what your cat seems to prefer, and try to cater to his choice in litter. [20] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Do not use a clumping litter if you have a kitten. The curious kitten may investigate the litter with their mouth and accidentally swallow some. Clumping litter can cause a dangerous bowel obstruction in your kitten's intestines, requiring emergency care. The Humane Society cautions against using litter with perfume or deodorizer added to it, as this may irritate your cat or trigger an allergic reaction. If odor is a concern, adding baking soda to the litter box is a safe, odor-absorbing alternative to scented litter.

Too much litter will make a mess when your cat steps in and out of the box, and some cats (especially long-haired cats) are actually reluctant to use a box that is too full of litter. [23] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source But using too little litter can make your cat feel like he won't be able to bury his waste, which can lead to out-of-box elimination. Insufficient litter can also lead to odor problems in your home. [24] X Research source Most cats only need about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of litter.

If there's a lot of noise, like in a laundry room, or a lot of traffic coming through, like your home's living room, your cat may become reluctant to use the litter box.

If you believe your cat is not eliminating, or if he is eliminating with blood in his urine or stool, take him to a veterinary emergency clinic immediately.
