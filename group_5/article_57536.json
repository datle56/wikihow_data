Just remember that lighter fabrics will rip if you carry something heavy or sharp, so select a fabric based on your intended uses for the tote. [1] X Research source If you want to upcycle old clothes , try using denim from an old pair of jeans. If you’re going to use the tote to carry heavy items like books, choose a sturdy fabric like heavy cotton , corduroy , or some type of thick polyester fabric . Choose any color or pattern based on your preference. If you plan to decorate your tote bag, go with a solid color to offset the decorations. If you’re using brand-new fabric, wash and iron it first so it doesn’t shrink after you make the tote. Note that heavy fabrics require stronger needles and/or a heavy duty sewing machine ."

Repeat with the other rectangle, and sew a straight stitch 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) below the folded edge of the fabric on both rectangles. [4] X Research source It’s easiest to hem the top edges of the tote, which will become the two edges at the opening, before you sew the body of the tote. Use either a sewing machine or work by hand to sew the straight stitch . If you sew an uneven line, use a seam ripper to rip out the stitch and start over."

Flatten the handle with an iron. When deciding on length, keep in mind that the handles will be looped. When attaching the wire to the end of the tube, you can either hook or tie it.

Take your time and make sure it’s secure before moving on to the next step. To avoid getting glue on your iron, leave about a quarter of an inch around the edge of your fabric free of interfacing.
