      "title": "Watch for limping in the morning.",
      "content": "Watch for limping in the morning. Arthritis in dogs often displays as your dog limping. For instance, your dog may favor one leg if it is hurting more. This symptom is likely to be more noticeable when your dog first gets up, as moving around a bit can ease some of the stiffness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice reluctance to move certain ways.",
      "content": "Notice reluctance to move certain ways. If your dog has arthritis, it may not want to move around as much. You may notice it doesn't want to jump in the car, for instance. If that's something it used to do regularly, that could indicate your dog has arthritis. You may also notice that your dog isn't able to walk for as long as it used to."

      "title": "Look for problems with the spine.",
      "content": "Look for problems with the spine. Arthritis can also present in the back or hips, not just the legs.

      "title": "Check for loss of muscle mass.",
      "content": "Check for loss of muscle mass. Another symptom of arthritis in dogs is the loss of muscle mass over time. Your dog may lose muscle mass because it's not using its muscles as much. Your dog may look skinnier or not as bulky when it loses muscles, though your dog may also gain more fat due to less activity. One management for arthritis is helping your dog build muscle mass.

      "title": "Watch for changes in your dog's appetite.",
      "content": "Watch for changes in your dog's appetite. A dog doesn't feel good when it's in pain, and when your dog doesn't feel good, it doesn't want to eat. Therefore, you may notice a decrease in your dog's appetite if it has arthritis, although this symptom alone can indicate any number of conditions, not just arthritis. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don't ignore odd behavior.",
      "content": "Don't ignore odd behavior. Any kind of odd behavior for your dog could indicate arthritis. One of the main kinds of odd behavior your dog may display is it suddenly having more accidents around the house, likely because it doesn't want to make the painful trip outside. [5] X Research source You may notice other signs, such as less excitement about going on a walk. If you feel like something just isn't right with your dog, you should have vet evaluate it."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to your dog being more tired.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your dog being more tired. Many things can make your dog more tired, so tiredness alone does not indicate arthritis. However, taken in conjunction with other symptoms, tiredness can be a symptom of arthritis, so be on the lookout for it. For instance, your dog may not have much interest in playing. [6] X Research source Your dog may gain weight, in fact, because it's not moving around as much."

    {
      "title": "Look for odd positions when your dog is sitting or lying down.",
      "content": "Look for odd positions when your dog is sitting or lying down. Your dog is going to try to get comfortable, despite the pain. You may notice it roll around more or end up in very odd positions to try to get more comfortable for sleeping. If you notice some new sleeping or sitting positions for your dog, that may indicate it's in pain. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Listen for whimpering.",
      "content": "Listen for whimpering. You may notice that your dog is whimpering or whining more as it moves around. Just like humans, dogs will complain about pain, and they do it by making these noises. If you notice your dog is whining more, you may need to talk to your vet. [8] X Research source Other dogs may take to growling more, especially if they're touched in spots that are painful for them."

      "title": "Notice crankiness.",
      "content": "Notice crankiness. Your dog doesn't like to be in pain any more than you do. Therefore, when it's in pain from arthritis, you may notice that your dog is crankier. For example, your dog may snap at you, particularly if you pet an area that's in pain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Talk to your veterinarian. If you suspect your dog has arthritis, it's important to discuss it with your veterinarian. Your veterinarian can make sure it's arthritis and not something else, as well as provide ways to help manage pain. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Expect a physical exam.",
      "content": "Expect a physical exam. Part of diagnosing your dog will include the veterinarian giving your dog a physical exam. Basically, your vet will visually inspect the dog, as well as feeling the dog in several places (like joints) to help determine the cause of the pain. [10] X Research source Your vet will also use things like your dog's past medical history and age to help determine if your dog has arthritis. Bring a list of symptoms you've noticed in your dog to help your vet diagnose the problem."

      "title": "Ask about x-rays.",
      "content": "Ask about x-rays. Often times, a vet will give your dog x-rays if they suspect arthritis. X-rays can help determine how bad the arthritis is in your dog, which can help decide treatment. If your vet doesn't suggest x-rays, ask if that's an option your dog needs. Keep in mind, though, x-rays will be extra as far as cost goes, especially if your dog needs to be sedated for them. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't give your dog human medications. While dogs can sometimes take human medications, it's best to talk to your veterinarian before dosing your dog with any medication. Some human medications can be harmful or even fatal to dogs, so you could unintentionally poison your dog. Any medications your dog takes should be prescribed by a veterinarian. Your vet may prescribe your dog steroids like prednisone and dexamethasone. They may also prescribe dog-friendly NSAIDs, like Etogesic, Rimadyl, and Metacam. [12] X Research source If your dog has severe arthritis, your vet may prescribe a pain-reliever like Galliprant or Amantadine. [13] X Research source"
