      "content": "Protect your hands and eyes with safety equipment. Slide on a pair of work gloves, ideally made of leather or some other thick material. Additionally, slip on a pair of safety glasses to cover your eyes. Since you’ll be working with broken glass, you don’t want any shards flying into your eyes or cutting your skin. [1] X Research source If you don’t have any safety equipment on hand, check a hardware or home improvement store."

      "content": "Pry away any loose pieces of glass with a flat tool. Take a flathead screwdriver, ice scraper, or some other flat tool and use it to pull away any remaining pieces of glass. Keep a trash bag or waste bin on hand to catch any loose pieces of glass so they don’t litter the ground. [2] X Research source You might have to use a little bit of force to pry off the glass. You don’t have to remove the extra shards of glass, but it might help you install the new window more smoothly."

      "title": "Spritz the plastic backing with glass cleaner.",
      "content": "Spritz the plastic backing with glass cleaner. Take a sprayable cleaner and coat the plastic backing and frame for the mirror, as well as any leftover glass pieces. Rub in the cleaner with a dry wash rag, or with a sheet of paper towel. As you work, focus on removing any spots of dirt, dust or grime that are visible on the window. [3] X Research source While you don’t have to clean off the plastic surface, it helps make your car look cleaner."

    {
      "title": "Apply a thick layer of rubber sealant around the edge of the frame.",
      "content": "Apply a thick layer of rubber sealant around the edge of the frame. Use a spoon, scoop, or knife to smooth sealant around the edges of your mirror’s plastic backing. Don’t put any sealant in the center, as the mirror’s adhesive backing will go there. Try to apply the product in a relatively thick layer, keeping the sealant 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in from the edge of the frame. [5] X Research source While your new glass cut should come with adhesives, this sealant helps secure the glass into place."

    {
      "title": "Put 2-4 adhesive circles on the back of your new glass.",
      "content": "Put 2-4 adhesive circles on the back of your new glass. Remove the protective backing paper from the adhesives and arrange them evenly along the back of the mirror. Follow the instructions that came with your new mirror to determine the exact way to position them. Once the pads are all in place, remove any other layers of backing paper or tape. [6] X Research source Focus on covering the center of the mirror’s backing, instead of the edges."

    {
      "title": "Press the new mirror into the frame.",
      "content": "Press the new mirror into the frame. Line the mirror up to the plastic frame and apply some pressure. Continue pushing until the adhesives stick to the frame, and the perimeter of the mirror sticks to the sealant. [7] X Research source While installing a new mirror, look to the opposite side view mirror as a model. Try to install the mirror immediately after applying the sealant."

    {
      "title": "Hold the mirror in place with masking tape until the sealant dries.",
      "content": "Hold the mirror in place with masking tape until the sealant dries. Cut or rip away 2 in (5.1 cm) strips of masking tape and arrange them around the edge of the mirror. Work your way around the mirror, using as many strips as you need to hold the glass in place. [8] X Research source If needed, cut or rip away longer strips of masking tape. Try not to use duct tape, as this tape is a lot stronger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the masking tape after 24 hours.",
      "content": "Remove the masking tape after 24 hours. Read the label on your sealant to see how long the product takes to dry. To be safe, wait at least 1 day before lightly tapping on the sealant to check its firmness. If the sealant is dry, remove all strips of tape from the mirror. [9] X Research source Once the sealant is firm, you’re ready to drive with your new mirror!"

      "content": "Search online to find a mirror that fits your car. Go to an auto shop or online auto parts store and look for a replacement side mirror that fits the make and model of your car. Perform a rough estimation and see if the new cut is a good fit or replacement for the old glass before you do anything else. If the glass doesn’t fit your mirror, try re-measuring the dimensions of the frame and ordering a different cut of glass. [11] X Research source If you’re getting a new mirror for a vehicle with heated side mirrors, purchase a piece of plastic and metal-backed glass that fits your exact car model."

      "title": "Pull the cover off and away from the side mirror.",
      "content": "Pull the cover off and away from the side mirror. Use both hands to grip the loosened mirror casing and fully separate it from the mirror frame. Along the back hinge of the case, look for 2 more clips. Remove the cover with a gentle amount of force, so the old casing can naturally disconnect from these clips. [19] X Research source Since you’ve already disconnected the other 4 clips, the casing should come off fairly easily."
