      "content": "Understand the difference between Apple Cash and Apple Pay. Before trying to get your money back after being scammed, it is important to understand the differences between Apple Pay and Apple Cash: Apple Pay is the contactless payment technology you may use at various merchants, while Apple Cash enables you to send and receive money via the Messages app. If you believe you were scammed, this likely happened through Apple Cash, as Apple Pay is only accepted at verified merchants. Unfortunately, Apple Cash does not include any buyer protection. Apple is not responsible for any fraudulent payments sent through Apple Cash. You can create a virtual Visa card for your Apple Cash to use at online and in-person merchants. This card works via Apple Pay, so you may be eligible for a refund if you see an unauthorized charge there."

Of course, it is unlikely for a scammer to return the funds, but this is your only recourse if scammed via Apple Cash. Because Apple Cash works through Messages, you may consider reporting the scammer's phone number to local authorities, although the number may not actually belong to them."

Of course, it is possible, but it is more likely to be scammed via Apple Cash. Neither Apple Pay nor Apple Cash offer buyer protection, so Apple is not responsible for any scams pulled off through such services. You may still see an unauthorized transaction, and want to be reimbursed. While this is not technically a scam, it can still be a frustrating experience, and may entitle you to compensation."

While many sellers on these sites are legitimate, be careful when making purchases in this way. Selling on these marketplaces can also be dangerous. Be on the lookout for overpayment scams, in which a buyer will use a stolen check to \"accidentally\" overpay for an item you have for sale, then request the surplus money back. In the end, you will lose both the original amount and the amount you returned."
