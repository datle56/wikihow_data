      "title": "Spiritual warfare is the fight against evil forces to protect your soul.",
      "content": "Spiritual warfare is the fight against evil forces to protect your soul. If you are a Christian, you are a “soldier of the Cross” and part of God’s army. Your enemy is Satan, who will either lead you to focus too much on the earthly pleasures of this world or to feel complete despair about your life. When you pray to invoke the Lord and wear His armor, you’ll be led to victory. [1] X Research source Ultimately, spiritual warfare is a way to resist Satan. The Devil, the “roaring lion,” looks to devour the souls of the righteous (1 Peter 5:8). Since Satan will try to launch spiritual attacks to weaken your faith, it’s important to remain spiritually strong so he can’t influence you. When you honor your Creator, He will guard your soul."

      "content": "Create a “war room” as a sacred space to pray and defend yourself. Choose a quiet space that's free of clutter or distractions. Make sure that its only purpose is to focus on the Lord and call out to Him. Whenever you feel weakened or in doubt, enter this \"war room\" or \"prayer closet.\" It will allow you to shut out to the world and connect with God. [6] X Research source Think carefully about the design of your war room. For example, will pictures and framed quotes help your spiritual practice, or will they distract you? Create a sacred space that's comfortable and serene. You might lay down a rug to protect your knees while you pray. Even though it's called a war room, it's perfectly acceptable to make it a sanctuary, as well. When your mind is at ease, it will be able to focus on prayer."
