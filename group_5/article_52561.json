Before broccoli is frozen it is blanched (cooked in boiling water and then placed in an ice bath to stop the cooking process). Since the frozen broccoli is precooked, you only need to reheat the broccoli. [1] X Research source"

Place the pot on a burner over medium heat. Allow the water to come to a simmer. To check the water level, insert the steamer basket or sieve into the pan before bringing the water to a boil. If the water level is too high, pour out some water. You must use at least 1 cup water."
