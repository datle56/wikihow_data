      "title": "They miss deadlines and appointments.",
      "content": "They miss deadlines and appointments. It’s hard to overstate how important deadlines are to court cases. In many cases, failing to file the proper motions in time and meeting key time requirements can be the difference between an acquittal, a dismissal, and a conviction or judgment. If your lawyer seems to consistently miss key deadlines, it’s time to look for a new lawyer. [1] X Research source Even if your lawyer isn't missing deadlines, they might be procrastinating by continually asking for a continuance (asking the judge to extend the deadline). This could be a trial strategy or it could be a sign that they're putting your case on the back burner."

    {
      "title": "They seem disinterested in your case.",
      "content": "They seem disinterested in your case. If your attorney isn’t engaged when you two meet, they cut your sessions short, they don’t seem to listen to details, or they seem to forget things you tell them, it’s a sign that they're not very engaged with your case. You're paying your lawyer to advocate for you and a strong advocate is engaged and interested. [2] X Research source Even if you’ve got a public defender for a criminal case, they’re legally (and morally) obliged to do their best for you. They may seem tired or overworked, but they shouldn’t be disinterested. If you do think your public defender isn’t doing their job, you may want to consider hiring a private attorney. Unfortunately, you don’t get to choose who your public defender is. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They’re pushy about settling.",
      "content": "They’re pushy about settling. If you don’t want to settle, your lawyer shouldn’t keep harping on it. Settlements are often a good idea if your lawyer can get a good deal, but they only go forward with your say-so. If your lawyer won’t stop pushing you to settle, it could be a signal they’re just trying to get the case over with. [4] X Research source If your lawyer seems good outside of this one specific issue (trying to get you to settle), they probably seem pushy because they genuinely believe it’s the best move. Ask them why they’re so intent on pushing. Maybe they just haven’t explained it properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "They don’t explain what they do for your case.",
      "content": "They don’t explain what they do for your case. Part of a lawyer’s job is to walk you through everything they’re doing. Court rules and procedures can be complex, but a good lawyer will break everything down as it happens and let you know what's going to happen next and where you are in the process. If your lawyer isn't doing that or if you're confused about what's going on with your case, it might be time to look for a different lawyer. [5] X Research source Your lawyer should cover everything that happens with each appearance. A single case could have dozens of meetings and hearings, but you should get a summary of each one from your lawyer. Your lawyer should also explain your options whenever your case reaches a decision point. If the other side offers to settle, your lawyer is obligated to tell you about it."

    {
      "title": "They’re unresponsive.",
      "content": "They’re unresponsive. A good lawyer calls you back or replies to your emails promptly. If you have to leave a dozen messages before your lawyer bothers to call you back, you might want to look for a lawyer who communicates more frequently. [6] X Research source Attorneys are bound by professional ethics rules that require them to communicate regularly with their clients. The rules don't dictate how an attorney has to keep their clients updated, though. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source When hiring an attorney, let them know your preferred method of communication and find out what theirs is as well. That'll make it easier for you to keep in touch through the course of their representation."

    {
      "title": "They aren’t upfront about the costs or bills.",
      "content": "They aren’t upfront about the costs or bills. Lawyer fees and costs can be confusing, so good lawyers will make sure there are no surprises by breaking everything down ahead of time. Some lawyers charge an hourly fee and require you to pay for a certain number of hours up front (this is a \"retainer\"). Other lawyers don't charge you anything to take your case, but get a percentage of any award or settlement you receive. [8] X Research source You can try negotiating a lawyer’s fees. Just be clear about what you can afford and put everything in writing ahead of time. If you’re ever confused by the cost, ask your lawyer for an itemized receipt. Any decent lawyer will give you a breakdown of the fees. If you can’t afford a private lawyer, research your local legal resources to see if you qualify for free help. Some lawyers will also work with you on a payment plan."

    {
      "title": "They don’t seem confident.",
      "content": "They don’t seem confident. The legal profession requires a lot of confidence if you want to be successful. Your lawyer might not necessarily be selling you out if they don't seem confident, but they probably aren't the best lawyer—and you could probably do better. [9] X Research source This applies to your specific case as well. If your lawyer doesn't seem confident about your chances of winning your case, you're probably better off finding a lawyer who will fight for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "They don’t make you feel comfortable.",
      "content": "They don’t make you feel comfortable. A good lawyer has to be part therapist in a lot of ways. Cases often touch on personal and emotional issues. If you don't feel comfortable talking about what you need to talk about with your lawyer, they're not going to be an effective advocate for you."

    {
      "title": "Get recommendations from people you trust.",
      "content": "Get recommendations from people you trust. If you have any friends or family members who have had good experiences with lawyers in the past, consider reaching out to them. You can read as many reviews as you want, but at the end of the day, there’s no good substitution for a recommendation from someone you trust. [10] X Research source Don’t be embarrassed about asking people for lawyer recommendations. Millions of people go to court every year for a variety of reasons—it’s a lot more common than you’d think."

    {
      "title": "Look at multiple review sites.",
      "content": "Look at multiple review sites. Don’t trust the first set of reviews you stumble across. Look at Yelp, Google Reviews, and Avvo, which is a site designed specifically for reviewing lawyers. If a lawyer has dozens (or even better, hundreds) of positive reviews, they have a reputation to uphold and will likely work diligently for you. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source Don’t trust any reviews you find on a lawyer’s website. It’s not that they’re necessarily fake, but they’re probably cherry-picking the most positive quotes."

      "title": "Meet with the attorney for an initial consultation.",
      "content": "Meet with the attorney for an initial consultation. Most attorneys offer a free consultation that allows you to get to know them and see what they're like in person. This gives you the opportunity to see if you feel comfortable opening up to them. The atmosphere of their office also helps you understand more about how they operate. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source Your lawyer should also seem passionate. If they sound completely bored or exhausted when you talk with them, they probably aren’t the best lawyer for you. A good lawyer should also be able to follow your legal situation and explain it back to you. If you don’t like an attorney, don’t hire them. You should personally get along with the person representing you. Some lawyers do charge an initial consultation fee. So long as they’re upfront about it, there’s nothing wrong with this—it’s pretty common among larger law firms."
