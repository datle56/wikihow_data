      "title": "Set up the receiver indoors.",
      "content": "Set up the receiver indoors. Most outdoor speaker systems run off an existing indoor receiver. Since the receiver is a sensitive piece of electronics, you almost always want to set the receiver up indoors. A multi-zone receiver allows you to have music playing outside while something else plays inside."

      "title": "Install a volume control box outside.",
      "content": "Install a volume control box outside. Make sure that it is in a sheltered location. You will be running the speaker wire from the receiver to the volume control box, and then from the volume control box to the associated speakers. Most volume control boxes can be easily mounted on an outdoor wall. Consider multiple volume control boxes for multiple pairs of speakers. This will allow you to control the volume across multiple zones."

      "title": "Install a multi-channel amplifier if you are running multiple pairs of speakers.",
      "content": "Install a multi-channel amplifier if you are running multiple pairs of speakers. Each pair you add increases the chance of overloading the receiver's built-in amplifier. You can install the amplifier right next to the receiver and then run the speaker wire out of the amplifier."

    {
      "title": "Obtain enough speaker wire.",
      "content": "Obtain enough speaker wire. 16-gauge is fine for less than 80 feet (24 m), but longer wires should be 14- or 12-gauge. If you don't use the right gauge for your speakers, your audio quality will suffer. The longer the wire, the more degradation will occur. Four-conductor wire allows you to connect two pairs of speakers with one wire, potentially saving you the hassle of running a lot of wire. For outdoor speakers, CL2 and CL3 speaker wire complies with US in-wall standards, which means it can be safely ran through walls without causing issues with other electronics or posing a fire risk. This wire can also withstand elements, which is essential for an outdoor setup. Add an additional 10-15% to the length for snags and slack. You don't want your speaker wire to be pulled tight, as crimps in the wire can affect sound quality."

      "title": "Run your speaker wire from the receiver to the outside area.",
      "content": "Run your speaker wire from the receiver to the outside area. Drill a hole low in the wall to run the speaker wire from the inside to the outside. Make sure to seal the hole with silicone to maintain your house's insulation. Run the speaker wire to the volume control box, and then run a second wire from the box to the speakers. Don’t run speakers through windows or door jambs. This can cause your speaker wire to get crimped, causing audio issues. Some modern speaker setups are completely wireless, and operate using Bluetooth. If you are using a setup like this, you don't have to worry too much about wiring. You just need to ensure that your receiver supports Bluetooth speakers, and that the speakers are setup relatively close to the receiver. Bluetooth can reach about 150 feet (45.7 m) if there is nothing impeding the signal. Walls between the receiver and speaker will shorten the effective range."

      "title": "Place your speakers in sheltered areas.",
      "content": "Place your speakers in sheltered areas. Even though most outdoor speakers are designed to withstand the elements, you will get a lot more life out of them if you protect them a little. Try to place your speakers under eaves or underneath the patio roof to help protect the speakers from the weather."
    },
    {
      "title": "Space your speakers out.",
      "content": "Space your speakers out. Speakers should be about 8-10 feet (2.5-3 m) apart. If the speakers are too close together, the sound will be muddled and the speakers will overlap. If the speakers are too far apart, it will be difficult to hear and you will lose any stereo effects."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternate channels.",
      "content": "Alternate channels. A pair of speakers covers two channels: left and right. The two of these together creates a stereo sound. When installing more than a single pair of speakers, it is important to alternate left and right channels to ensure a proper stereo mix. This becomes especially important if you are installing a large number of speakers. If you are installing more than one speaker along a wall, alternate left and right channels along that wall. If you are installing speakers in a box around your patio, install the two left channels in opposing corners, and the two right channels in the other opposing corners."

      "title": "Listen to the speakers before mounting them.",
      "content": "Listen to the speakers before mounting them. Make sure that the sound quality and projection is acceptable before mounting the speaker. Listening before installing can save you a lot of time and headache when you turn the system on for the first time. More speakers is better than higher volume. If you are having difficulty hearing the sound everywhere you want, consider adding another pair of speakers instead of trying to crank the volume to the max."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mount the speakers high, but not too high.",
      "content": "Mount the speakers high, but not too high. Mounting your speakers high allows the sound to project much further, which can give you more coverage for less speakers. If you mount them near or above 10 feet (3 m), however, you will lose a lot of the bass. Try to keep your speakers between 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) off the ground."

      "title": "Tilt the speakers down to promote drainage.",
      "content": "Tilt the speakers down to promote drainage. This will also provide a better listening experience, and help minimize noise pollution for your neighbors. Most brackets allow you to mount at an angle, and many contain swivels that you can position exactly how you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mount according to the instructions.",
      "content": "Mount according to the instructions. The mounting process will vary depending on the type of bracket, but you'll usually need to drill into the mounting location. This may mean you will need a drill bit that can penetrate masonry. Only mount speakers on solid wood or masonry. Avoid mounting on cedar or aluminum siding, otherwise the speakers may start to sag. This can cause vibrations, which will lower the sound quality, or the speakers can fall entirely. Use the included brackets. Outdoor speaker brackets are already treated for weather. If you try to replace the brackets with ones not designed for outdoor use, they may rust and become weak."

      "title": "Connect speakers using banana plugs.",
      "content": "Connect speakers using banana plugs. These provide a much more reliable connection than bare wire, which is essential for outdoor speakers. Banana plugs connect directly into the speaker wire clips on the back of the speaker and receiver. To install banana plugs, you will need to strip the end of the speaker wires. Each speaker wire has two wires: a red and a black. Pull them apart to separate them and give you some room to work. Each of these will need to be stripped about 3/4 of an inch from the end of the wire. Once the wire is stripped, unscrew the end of the banana plug and slip the exposed wire into the end. Once the wire is inserted, tighten the banana plug screw. Repeat this for the other exposed wire."

      "title": "Check your speaker and receiver specifications.",
      "content": "Check your speaker and receiver specifications. There are a variety of factors that could potentially be causing your speakers to sound distorted or fuzzy. Mismatched equipment is one of the most common factors. Check that the amplifier and receiver support the ohms that the speakers draw, and that the speakers can handle the wattage output of the amplifier. Check the documentation for all of your equipment to ensure that everything matches."

      "title": "Check the connections.",
      "content": "Check the connections. If you've accidentally swapped the positive and negative wires on your speakers, you likely will not hear anything coming out of them. Double check all of your connections, and ensure that the black cables are inserted in black clips, while the red cables are inserted in the red clips. [1] X Research source If the speaker is too far away and you aren't using a proper gauge wire, you can experience a lot of distortion. Try to move the speaker closer to the receiver and then shorten the wire, or run newer, lower-gauge wire. Crossed wires can short out your speakers and cause serious damage. Make sure the black and red wires are not touching when bare at the ends."

      "title": "Look for physical damage.",
      "content": "Look for physical damage. Check that the speakers are not physically damaged. A blown-out speaker can sound terrible, so ensure that the woofers on the speaker aren't torn. If you see any physical damage, try replacing the speaker."
