      "title": "Make sure you have robust antivirus/antimalware software installed.",
      "content": "Make sure you have robust antivirus/antimalware software installed . According to computer and hardware expert Luigi Oppido installing a good antivirus/antispyware application, such as Norton , AVG, Malwarebytes, and Avast!, can check files before they get to your file system. Make sure you use a program that can scan files as soon as they are done downloading. Antivirus software is one of the best things you can do to protect your computer . Most modern operating systems have their own antivirus software already installed. You need to make sure you have it turned on and that you pay attention to any warnings it gives you."

      "title": "Download files from official sources only.",
      "content": "Download files from official sources only. If you are downloading a file from the official website of a well-established company, like Microsoft, the file is less likely to contain dangerous malware. If you are downloading a file from a lesser-known company or untrustworthy website, the chances of downloading a virus or malware is much greater. Avoid downloading files from untrustworthy websites."
    },
    {
      "title": "Download from the official digital distribution platform.",
      "content": "Download from the official digital distribution platform. Most operating systems have their own digital distribution store you can use to download programs. Windows has the Microsoft Store and macOS has the App Store. Software goes through a thorough vetting process before it can go up on these platforms. Downloading software from these platforms is always safer than downloading software from the open internet."

    {
      "title": "Make sure the URL is correct.",
      "content": "Make sure the URL is correct. Some shady websites will try to spoof official websites to convince unsuspecting users to download malicious software. Check the URL of the website you are downloading from to make sure it is the correct website. Look for slight variations in the spelling or domain name (i.e. \"microsoft.co\" instead of \"microsoft.com\")."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for red flags on the site itself.",
      "content": "Look for red flags on the site itself. If a website looks like it was poorly designed, that can be a red flag. If a website is has a lot of pop-up ads and false download links, and links to spammy websites, that could be another red flag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check if the website is using SSL/TLS certificates.",
      "content": "Check if the website is using SSL/TLS certificates. Websites that have SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificates have a secure connection and communicate with the servers over an encrypted connection. A website that is using SSL/TLS certificates will have \"HTTPS\" in the URL (as opposed to just \"HTTP\"). There should also be a padlock icon next to the URL in the address bar. [1] X Research source If you are using Google Chrome, click the icon that resembles two slider bars next to the URL in the address bar. If the website is using SSL/TLS certificates, it should say \"Connection is secure\" in the drop-down menu."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be aware of what you are downloading.",
      "content": "Be aware of what you are downloading. Are you downloading pornography or a warez (cracked) program from a torrent file? Or are you downloading Photoshop from the Adobe website? There's a much greater chance that a file downloaded from a porn website or torrent file is going to contain dangerous malware or viruses. What's the file? If it is illegal or suspicious-looking, it's probably dangerous."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to pop-up warnings.",
      "content": "Pay attention to pop-up warnings. Most modern web browsers have some sort of safe browsing and antivirus feature built-in. Your computer may also have antivirus software running in the background. If you see a pop-up warning you that a website is not safe or if a file maybe risky, take it seriously and do not proceed unless you know the website and the file is safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for comments and feedback.",
      "content": "Check for comments and feedback. Are there other people that have downloaded the file? If there's a forum attached to the site that has people saying they've downloaded said file and have not experienced any problems, chances are, you aren't going to be downloading a Trojan or worm. You can also try checking other forums, such as Reddit or Quora for user feedback."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the size of the file.",
      "content": "Look at the size of the file. If the file size is too small, there's a good chance it doesn't contain the software you want and has a virus or malware instead. If the file is too big, it may or may not contain the software you want, but it may contain a few other surprises you don't want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch out for executable files.",
      "content": "Watch out for executable files. These can include '.exe', '.bat', ,msi', '.pif', ',msi'; and '.scr' files. Torrent files can also contain malicious software. Hackers can even spread malicious code through PDFs, Office documents (i.e. Word and Excel files), and image files. If you download one of these, you are potentially opening yourself up to anything on that file once you activate it. One common trick used by hackers is to have a 'double extension' such as '.gif.exe'. Said file is actually a '.exe' file, not a '.gif' file. According to computer and hardware expert Luigi Oppido, opening a '.exe' file is basically giving that file super-user access to your computer and allowing it to control your system and your preferences. Opening a '.exe' file when you don't know what's in it is very dangerous. Executable files are fine if they come from a trusted source and you know what they are. Most installation files on Windows are executable files."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check if the file is digitally signed.",
      "content": "Check if the file is digitally signed. If you are downloading an executable (.exe) program on Windows, running it will usually open a license warning. If the executable is unlicensed, it is most likely a threat to your computer and privacy. Note that not all unlicensed executables are bad, nor are all licensed executables good. If unsure, refer to the Tips section."
