      "content": "Consider the age and skill of those involved. Creating a parallel circuit is an excellent and easy experiment for students learning about electricity. This method of building a parallel circuit is excellent for younger students: they may have limited dexterity, and you may not want them to use sharp tools. If you are making a parallel circuit as part of a lesson plan, it may help to have your students or child make a list of questions, predictions, and hypotheses about what they'll be observing."

Cut the foil into 4 narrow strips: 2 8 in (20 cm) pieces, and 2 4 in (10 cm) pieces. They should be narrow, about the width of a drinking straw."

Take the 2 shorter 4 in (10 cm) strips and wrap one end of each around the long strip coming off the positive terminal. Place one 4 in (10 cm) strip near the top of the strip, and the other about 3 inches (7.6 cm) down toward the battery. [3] X Research source Wrap the loose ends of the shorter strips around your 2 light bulbs. You may find it helpful to secure the strips with electrical tape."

      "content": "Choose this method for a slightly advanced project. While creating a parallel circuit is not complicated, this method requires you to use wire and a switch; it may be suited for slightly older students. For example, this method will require you to strip wires, but if you lack the necessary tools for this or don't want young ones performing this task, you may prefer to read the method explained above."

      "content": "Gather the main components of a parallel circuit. You don't need much to complete this project: You need a power source, a conducting material, at least 2 loads (the items which use electricity), and a switch. Use a 9-volt battery as the power source. You'll be using insulated wire as your conducting material. Any kind will work, but copper-wire should be easy to find. You'll be cutting the wire into several pieces, so make sure you have plenty (30–40 inches (76–102 cm) should do it). For the load, use light bulbs or flashlight bulbs. You should be able to find a switch (as well as all of the other materials) at any hardware or home improvement store."

      "title": "Prepare your wires.",
      "content": "Prepare your wires. The wire is your conducting material, which will create the circuits between the power source and your leads. Cut the wire into five pieces (between 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) will be fine). Carefully remove approximately 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of the insulation from both ends of all your wire pieces. Wire strippers are the best tool for removing insulation, but if you don't have these, scissors or wire-cutters will work; just be very careful not to damage the wires."
