      "content": "Add regular dish soap to the dishwasher’s detergent cup. If you find out that you’re out of dishwashing detergent when the dishwasher’s already full, start by adding three or four drops of regular dishwashing soap to the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Any brand or type of dish soap will work as long as it’s a liquid. [1] X Research source If you’re cleaning a particularly dirty load of dishes, you may want to bump the soap up to four or five drops."

      "title": "Fill the cup with baking soda.",
      "content": "Fill the cup with baking soda. After you’ve placed the dish soap in the washer’s detergent cup, add baking soda. You’ll want to pour enough baking soda into the detergent cup to fill it up approximately ⅔ full. [2] X Research source To avoid spilling baking soda all over the interior of the dishwasher, use a spoon to carefully fill the detergent cup rather than pouring the baking soda straight from the box."
    },
    {
      "title": "Top off the cup with salt.",
      "content": "Top off the cup with salt. Once the dish soap and baking soda are in the detergent cup, reach for a container of regular table salt. Add enough salt to the dish soap and baking soda mixture to completely fill the detergent cup. [3] X Research source If you only have sea or kosher salt, you can substitute either for the table salt."

      "title": "Run the dishwasher as you normally would.",
      "content": "Run the dishwasher as you normally would. When you’ve completely filled the detergent cup with the mixture, close the compartment. Set and run your dishwasher as you usually do, and when the cycle is done, you’ll have clean, sparkling dishes without any suds overflow. [4] X Research source Not only is this dishwasher detergent easy to make, it’s cheaper than store-bought versions. Most people usually have dish soap, baking soda, and salt in their kitchen, so it’s a convenient alternative to the usual dishwasher detergent."

      "title": "Combine the borax, washing soda, citric acid, and kosher salt.",
      "content": "Combine the borax, washing soda, citric acid, and kosher salt. Add 1 cup (237 g) of borax, 1 cup (237 g) of washing soda, ½ cup (118. 5 g) of citric acid, and ½ cup (124 g) of kosher salt in a large bowl or pot. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it is well blended. [5] X Research source Borax is a natural mineral that is often used in cleaning products. You can find it at most grocery and big box stores in the aisle where laundry or cleaning products are sold. Washing soda is a water-soluble sodium salt of carbonic acid that works as a natural cleaner or cleaning booster. You can find it at many grocery and big box stores in the laundry or cleaning products aisle. If you can’t find it locally, it’s also available at online stores. Citric acid is a natural compound found in citrus fruits that is an ideal disinfectant in cleaning products. You can find it in many grocery stores where canning or brewing supplies are sold, or at health food stores and pharmacies."

      "content": "Place in a jar or jug with a lid. Once the detergent mixture is fully combined, transfer it from the bowl or pot to a jar or jug with an airtight lid. To avoid spilling the detergent all over your work surface, you may find it easier to pour the mixture into the container with a funnel. [6] X Research source The detergent may clump if it’s exposed to moisture, so try to keep in a cool, dark closet or pantry with low humidity."

When you’re ready to wash a load of dishes, take 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the detergent mixture and place it in the detergent cup in your dishwasher. Run the dishwasher as you normally would.

Stir the mixture so all of the ingredients are well combined. [8] X Research source If you don’t have sea salt, you can substitute kosher salt."

      "content": "Place the mixture in a jar. When the detergent ingredients are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a jar or other container. Make sure to choose a container with an airtight lid because the borax-free detergent is especially prone to clumping when exposed to high humidity. [9] X Research source If you live in an area with high humidity, place 2 tablespoons (30 g) of powdered bentonite clay inside a piece of cheesecloth or pantyhose. Secure the fabric so the clay won’t spill out, and throw the packaged clay into your container of detergent. The clay will absorb the excess moisture so the detergent doesn’t clump."

Stir the mixture with a spoon until it begins to clump together. [11] X Research source You can substitute baking soda for the washing soda. When you mix in the vinegar, there may be some slight fizzing. That is normal."
