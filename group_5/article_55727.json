If you're subscribed to Bumble Premium , you can further customize your stack with Advanced Filters, which let you search by height, smoking preference, star sign, education, kids, and more.

      "content": "You'll occasionally see matches who fall slightly outside of your filter preferences. If you run out of people to swipe through, Bumble automatically relaxes your filters so you can check out users who are close to your preferences, but don't fall neatly within your boundaries. [3] X Research source For example, if you have your distance range set to 30 miles and someone is 31 miles away, you may see them at the end of your stack when you run out . If you want to stick to your hard limits, you can tell Bumble not to relax your filters at all—just tap the filter icon at the top-right corner of your Hive and deselect \"See other people if I run out.\""

      "content": "Bumble may penalize you if you swipe right on too many users. If your strategy is to swipe right on everyone and wait for people to swipe back, there's a chance your profile might be shown to fewer people. Since Bumble keeps their algorithms private, this isn't a scientific fact. However, many Bumble users have speculated that their profiles were pushed to the back of the queue after right-swiping sprees, resulting in lower profile visibility and fewer potential matches."

While Bumble doesn't say much about their algorithm, many surmise that profiles who get more right swipes are shown to more people, much like Tinder. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source This type of collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on majority opinion, which means that if a lot of users swipe left on a particular profile, that profile will be shown to fewer users. Having great photos is key to getting right swipes. [7] X Research source To improve your chances of a right swipe, add 4 to 6 attractive and well light photos to your profile, using your best close-up shot as your main image. Bumble has found that using Basic Info Badges on your profile can increase your chance of making matches. [8] X Research source"

According to Bumble's support team, Bumble shows you profiles you've already swept left on in case you made a mistake or changed your mind. It's also possible that someone you're seeing a second time has deleted and recreated their profile , which would add their new profile to your stack as long as they fall within your filter requirements."

      "content": "You've hit the swipe limit. Are your filters loose enough but you're still getting the \"All caught up\" message? If you swipe too many profiles in a 24-hour period, you'll have to wait another 24 hours before you can see the next profiles in your deck. [10] X Research source The swipe limit only affects free accounts—if you subscribe to Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you'll get unlimited swipes. Bumble doesn't specify how many swipes you get per day, but many users think it varies depending on how you're using the app. For example, if you're swiping right on everyone , you'll run out of new people to swipe on sooner than you would if you were putting more effort into looking at people's profiles."
