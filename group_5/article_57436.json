[1] X Research source Use a permanent marker to mark the string with your desired length. [2] X Research source Bracelets are, on average, 7 inches (18 cm) long. [3] X Research source The type of string you use is entirely up to you, but the key is making sure that the string or yarn you’re using is very durable. It should be more of a cord, instead a string or an embroidery floss. You can also use a kind of elastic stretch cord with a little bit of sheen and finish to it, because the idea is to wear it for a while, but as long as the pony beads can fit onto the string, you’re golden."

Here are some of our favorite design ideas: Alternate between your favorite colors in an ABAB design. Create a gradient pattern starting with dark beads and ending with light beads. Use every rainbow color to create a colorful rainbow for your wrist. Pick out your favorite sport team’s colors to match their uniforms. Try a mix of opaque and glow-in-the-dark beads . Place letter beads that spell out your name or an inspiring word at the center of your design, and frame them with beads of your favorite color."

[11] X Research source Pull the cord tight enough that there are no gaps between your beads, but not tight enough to make the beads warp.
