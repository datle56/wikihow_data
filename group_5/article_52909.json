      "title": "Get your hair damp.",
      "content": "Get your hair damp. For best results, cut these layers on damp hair. A good time to cut is post-shower, right after you've towel-dried your hair. Another option is skipping the shower and misting your hair with a water-filled spray bottle. You can approach it either way. When deciding the length of your layer, you'll be going with an adjusted measurement to account for spring-back. [1] X Research source Curly hair should be wet, not damp, before being cut. Wet your hair in the shower or under a sink tap. If you decide to use a spray bottle, make sure that you provide an even layer of water from the roots to the tips to dampen the hair."

      "content": "Detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb. Before you start cutting on your hair, it's important that you detangle it thoroughly.

If you have curly hair, cut at chin-level. [4] X Research source You can always go back and cut more if you aren't happy with the results."
