      "content": "Acknowledging the problem is the best way to start solving it. To truly mend your relationship, be honest about what needs to change. It’s best if you can meet face to face for this conversation, so pick a time and a place where you both feel comfortable. Break the ice by telling them that you want to have an open conversation. [4] X Research source Maybe the friendship went awry because your crush started to spend time with someone they’re dating. You could try saying something like, “I feel like we’ve drifted apart since Sam came into your life. I get that, but I want you to know that I’d really like us to get back to the way we were.” Or, for example, maybe your friend just stopped hanging out with you and you're not sure why. That can feel hurtful, but maybe they are dealing with something that you don't know about. Try saying, \"Hey, you haven't been responding to my texts lately. Is everything okay? Let me know how you're doing.\" Your friend might have a different perspective on the issue, so make sure you’re willing to listen to their side, too."

Say something like, “I’m really sorry that I wasn’t more supportive of you. I pulled away because I felt awkward. I know that probably hurt, and I’d really like us to work on rebuilding our friendship.” Only say sorry if you mean it. Don’t apologize for something that you didn’t do."

      "content": "Get ready to move on from the past in order to rebuild your relationship. Forgiveness is just as important as apologizing. It can be really tough to get over it if your crush accidentally crushed your feelings. But if this friendship is important to you, you need to be willing to move on. If they offer you an apology, receive it with an open mind. [6] X Research source This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to forgive right away. Just be open to the possibility of healing.

[9] X Research source It’s okay to let them know that you have a crush on them (if they didn’t already know). Just explain that you are comfortable being just friends.

      "content": "Being a good listener shows you’re committed to making this work. Friendship is a two-way street, so remember that it’s not all about you. Your crush might have some things they want to share with you, so listen to them with an open mind. Let them initiate conversations and take the lead sometimes. [10] X Research source Make eye contact when they talk and nod your head at times to show that you are really listening. Ask follow-up questions if you’re not sure what they mean or if you need them to elaborate. You can even say something like, “We haven't hung out much lately. Did I do something to bother you?”"

Those are traditional signs of flirting, so it's best to avoid them. [11] X Research source If they are flirting with you, nicely ask them to stop. Say, \"If we really want to keep this friendship going, we've got to stop flirting. I hope you understand.\""

[12] X Research source This might sound hard, but try not to stress. You're not cutting them out of your life, you're just taking a breath. If you used to meet up once a week, try scaling back to once every other week. Maybe you used to text every single day. Try only hitting them up a couple times a week while you work things out."

If you really want to be friends with this person, they need to be able to trust that you won’t ditch them if they start dating. You don’t have to listen to every detail of their crush, but you should be able to let them know that you’re cool with their choice to date. [13] X Research source You can tell them, “I get that you might start dating someone. I just want to let you know that’s not going to impact our friendship.” If you don't want to hear about their relationship, or you're not ready to be introduced to their new partner, it's totally okay to say that. Those are perfectly fine boundaries to set. If this feels too tough to you, you might not be ready to have a real friendship with this person. That is okay! Take some time to focus on yourself.

[15] X Research source Maybe you used to love going to movies together. Ask your friend if they’re up for a double-feature and offer to buy the popcorn.

That’s okay. Be patient and keep trying to connect with your friend. [16] X Research source Make it a point to check in with your friend and ask them how they are doing. You might want to do this once a week, or maybe even every couple of weeks. Do what feels right for you. Set aside time to spend with them on a regular basis. This is a personal decision, but make sure to not let several weeks or even months go by without hanging out. That could create distance, and that probably won't help fix the friendship.
