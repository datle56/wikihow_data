    {
      "title": "Write down your main interests related to your field of study.",
      "content": "Write down your main interests related to your field of study. Since you’ll likely spend 2 years or more working on your thesis, it’s best to pick something that interests you. Plus, this topic could shape the path you take in the future by directing where you go for your further studies or what type of job you get. To generate topics that interest you: [1] X Research source Review all of the classes you've taken and the subjects you've covered. Think about why you got into your field of study. Consider what you like to read about in your free time, especially things related to your field. This might be books, news articles, or blogs. Think of people in your field who you admire or aspire to be like. Then, ask yourself what you like about them. Consider if you'll continue your academic studies after graduation, as well as what you'd want to study."

      "title": "Go through your past coursework to find papers you enjoyed writing.",
      "content": "Go through your past coursework to find papers you enjoyed writing. You may be able to incorporate a paper you wrote as part of your coursework into your thesis to give you a jumping off point. Sort through the papers you’ve written in your last 2 years of study and identify any that stand out to you. Think about how much you enjoyed researching the topic you were writing about, as well as which topics felt easy. [2] X Research source Consider any lingering questions you had working on past projects as a starting point for your new thesis. It’s best to stick to your recent work because it will better reflect your current knowledge and abilities. You can use the same topic you used in your prior work, or you can use your old work to point you in the direction of a new topic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Research current events to see what's happening in your field.",
      "content": "Research current events to see what's happening in your field. Read the news to see what’s happening in the world right now. Then, do a search on an academic database, like EBSCO or J-STOR, about your field of study or your interests and review the top results. Look for topics that are getting a lot of attention or where people are asking questions. These topics might be good for your thesis. [3] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re studying politics. You might read about current presidential candidates and reflect on how their platforms have diverted from the historical platforms for their political party. If you’re writing a literature thesis, look at the novels that are being nominated for this year’s literary awards and consider their genre, theme, or style. For a thesis on psychology, you might look for news about PTSD research or read articles about pop psychology that people are sharing on social media. For an aeronautical engineering thesis, you could read up on what SpaceX is currently working on, or look into NASA’s most recent experiments. Check prominent research journals in the field you’re interested in to see what current academic conversations look like. Make a list of keywords that show up during your searches so you can look up published theses using sites like ProQuest. That way, you know what topics have already been covered."

    {
      "title": "Look for gaps in current research related to your field.",
      "content": "Look for gaps in current research related to your field. Your thesis should add something new to your field of study, which might seem daunting. However, reviewing current research can help. Consider which areas leave a lot of questions unanswered, then add those topics to your list of potential ideas. [4] X Research source You don’t need a topic that’s completely absent from research, as this would be difficult to examine. One way to find a unique angle is to combine 2 topics together. Alternatively, you can build on someone else's work. For example, let's say you're studying clinical psychology and want to write about PTSD. You might find that not much research has been done into how people with PTSD cope with workplace conflicts. Similarly, let's say you're studying politics and want to look at how political party platforms evolve. You might find that there's a gap in research when it comes to evaluating how voters react to platform changes."

      "title": "Ask your professors which topic they think is right for you.",
      "content": "Ask your professors which topic they think is right for you. Your instructors have a lot of insight into your field of study, as well as prior and current research. Additionally, they likely know a lot about you. They can help you understand the best paths of study for you, so find out what they think. Tell them about your goals, then ask for advice. [5] X Research source For instance, you might say, “I’m hoping to be a research professor one day, and I want to focus on modern poetry. Which of these thesis topics do you think would make me most attractive to doctoral programs?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your classmates about their lingering questions.",
      "content": "Talk to your classmates about their lingering questions. This might help you recognize areas that need more research. Ask your classmates if they had any questions come to mind during the classes you took together. Additionally, consider asking to see their notes. Look for areas where they seemed to be confused or wrote questions in the margins. [6] X Research source Focus on questions that can be researched and don’t have a simple answer. For instance, a question like, “How can we motivate people without offering them extrinsic rewards?” can be researched and doesn’t have a simple answer. Conversely, the question, “When did free verse poems start to become mainstream?” is easy to answer with a simple Internet search."

      "title": "Think about what type of work you plan to do in the future.",
      "content": "Think about what type of work you plan to do in the future. Your thesis may shape your future path because it can lead to other research opportunities. Plus, you’ll build deeper knowledge and understanding about this topic, making it an asset on your resume. List the goals you have for yourself in the future, then come up with topics that can help you reach those goals. [7] X Research source You don’t need to plan out your whole life. However, it’s good to have an idea about where you’re going. Think about the type of work you want to do, the job title you want to attain, or the types of organizations you want to work with. For instance, if you want to be a university professor, you might choose a topic that you plan to continue researching through your doctorate and career as a professor. As another example, let's say you want to be a project manager for an engineering firm. You might choose a topic that encompasses both your knowledge of engineering and your interest in motivating other engineers to produce their best work."

      "title": "Make a list of 5-10 topics that might be interesting thesis topics.",
      "content": "Make a list of 5-10 topics that might be interesting thesis topics. Include the best topics you generated during your brainstorming session. Try to include a range of ideas, as you’ll eliminate most of them as you narrow your focus. However, having multiple ideas will make it easier to find one that offers a lot of opportunity for research. [8] X Research source Undergraduate theses may be more broad, while master’s or Ph.D. theses should be more specific. Choose the best topics that came to you while you were brainstorming. You might enjoy doing this activity with a classmate who’s also working on their thesis. You can bounce ideas off of each other. For example, you might write down things like \"evolution of political party platforms,\" \"effect of civil war on cultural norms,\" \"themes of literature immediately before and after a social crisis,\" \"effects of robotics on the workforce,\" \"mission to Mars,\" or \"building intrinsic worker motivation.\""

      "title": "Eliminate topics that don’t seem to offer avenues for new research.",
      "content": "Eliminate topics that don’t seem to offer avenues for new research. If a topic has already been well-researched, then it might not be great for your thesis. Think about what you can add to a topic. If you don’t see a lot of room for growth, go ahead and cross that topic off your list. For instance, you might love William Shakespeare, but finding a new area of research about his work could prove difficult. Similarly, if you're studying psychology, you'll likely want to avoid writing about older ideas that aren't widely supported anymore, like dream analysis."

      "content": "Choose your thesis supervisor once you have a general idea of what you’ll research. Look for a professor who has expertise in the areas you want to study. Then, talk to them to see if they’d be willing to be your thesis supervisor. Tell them why you chose them specifically, as well as which topics you’re considering pursuing. [9] X Research source Say something like, “Hi, Dr. Gomez. I know you’re really knowledgeable about morality politics. I’m planning to write my thesis about a topic related to morality politics, so I hoped you might be my thesis supervisor.”"

Bring your thesis supervisor a short list of topics you’re considering. Then, explain why each topic interests you and ask for their advice. [10] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I'd like to write my thesis about modern American haiku structure, autobiographical expression in contemporary 21st-century poetry, or poetry in the Internet age.\" Your thesis supervisor will likely want you to choose a topic that they know well and are interested in themselves."

      "title": "Conduct research into your topic.",
      "content": "Conduct research into your topic. You need to fully understand your topic before you can formulate a thesis question. Use your library, Internet databases, journal articles, books, and other research materials to learn about your topic. As you read, annotate the materials by writing notes and questions in the margins. [11] X Research source This will help you figure out what types of questions to ask about your topic. If you can, highlight or mark important passages and summarize sections of text in the margins of the work. Talk to your librarian. They can help you find materials that might be of interest to you, and they can pull books or journals related to your topic."

After you have several that interest you, rewrite each question so that you can argue one side of the issue. Then, phrase your questions using clear, concise wording. Here are some example questions: [12] X Research source How did 20th-century warfare alter literary themes? How have expanding cultural norms impacted the criteria for literary awards? What social changes have impacted diplomatic exchanges among world leaders? How does detaching morality from public policy affect the efficacy of legislation? How does culture adapt in the aftermath of a civil war? How can robotics enhance early childhood education? What are the best ways to motivate employees to work harder? What treatment protocols can enhance recovery in PTSD patients?"

To determine the best question to focus your thesis on: [13] X Research source Think about the process you'd need to use to research the topic, such as a digital search, social experiments, or lab testing. Then, decide if you'd be able to complete these tasks with the time and resources you have. List the research materials you have available to you, such as computer databases, library materials, or a laboratory. Consider your thesis supervisor’s area of expertise.
