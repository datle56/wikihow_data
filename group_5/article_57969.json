      "title": "Decide what psychological subjects you're interested in.",
      "content": "Decide what psychological subjects you're interested in. Psychology is the study of the human mind, but there are many different sub-topics within it, like child development, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and clinical psychology. If you want to learn about psychology, you should ask yourself if there's anything specific you'd like to learn. [1] X Research source If you do decide there's something specific you'd like to know about, do some preliminary internet research on psychology to see what sub-topics within psychology are most closely related to your interests. Websites of university psychology departments or the website of the American Psychological Association can be reliable places to do some of this preliminary research. For instance, if you decide that you want to know how Psychologists treat patients, you will want to focus on learning about clinical psychology. Or if you decide that you'd like to know about human interaction, you will want to learn about social psychology."

      "content": "Develop a reading list of popular psychology books. Once you've decided what you want to learn about, you should look for books on your chosen topic. You can search for books on your own on the internet or go to your local library and ask a librarian for assistance. You will want to make sure you select books that are intended for readers looking to learn the basics rather than for advanced readers. [2] X Research source You can determine who is the intended audience for a book by paying attention to its title and publisher's description. If a title sounds uninviting or overly specific, it is probably intended for expert readers. For instance, a book titled A Study of Stimulus Response in Males Aged 19-21 , would almost certainly be intended for readers already very familiar with psychology. The publisher's description for a book often will tell you about the book's intended audience. For instance, if the back of a book says something like “this book is great for students and curious readers,” it will most likely be intended for readers like you who are not already experts. Some popular psychology books written for a wide audience include: The Social Animal by Eliot Aronson; Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman; The Art of Choosing by Sheena Iyengar; Drive by Daniel H. Pink; and The Power of Habit by Charles Dugigg."

If you think you learn better by listening or simply don't have the time to read, you can learn about psychology through podcasts. You can find podcasts on your phone through apps like iTunes (for iPhones) and Podcast Republic (for Androids). There are many podcasts out there, so you should read descriptions of some to find out which discuss topics most closely related to your interests. Anyone can create a podcast, so to ensure that you choose a podcast with accurate information, investigate who makes it. Podcasts produced by psychology experts (people with degrees in psychology) or podcasts produced by well-regarded institutions, like NPR, should be the most reliable. Some popular Psychology podcasts include: “Shrink Rap Radio,” “School of Psych,” and “The Psychology Podcast.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose between online and traditional psychology courses. If you would like to learn about psychology in a more structured way, you can take psychology courses at a college or university. If you are not already a full-time student, you will want to decide whether you want to try to enroll in a course at a nearby school or take a course online. Online courses offer considerably more flexibility, which can be great if you already have a tight schedule. The more rigid structure of traditional courses, though, can help some students stay motivated and learn more effectively. Community colleges often offer courses at a relatively low price and do not require students to study full-time. Many colleges and universities offer online classes, but if you do not need college credit you can take courses online through websites like Coursera. If you are interested in taking a psychology class but do not want to be graded on the material, you can ask the professor if you may audit it—meaning that you sit in on the classes and do the readings but do not have to complete graded assignments. You will not receive college credit for auditing however."

Instead of psychology 101, you may try to take a class on social psychology or neuropsychology. However, advanced classes often require specific prerequisite courses, so you will have to check with the professor to make sure you are eligible to take any advanced class that interests you.
