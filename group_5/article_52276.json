Each operating system has its own editors already installed (Windows has Notepad, Linux distributions have Kwrite etc), but consider getting another. Notepad++ is an excellent editor you can use (and not only to write C code)."

Go to the directory of that file and type gcc test.c -o test gcc: the command that orders GCC to compile your code. test.c: the name of the file you want compiled. -o: a flag that stands for output . Tells GCC to actually compile your file. test: the name of your executable. Once compiled, type test to run it"
