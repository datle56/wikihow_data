Keep the 2 sets of aces, kings, queens, jacks, 10s, and 9s so you have a 48-card Pinochle deck for your game.

Shuffle the Pinochle deck and deal cards clockwise around the table, starting with the player to your left. Deal 3–4 cards at a time to each player until everyone has 12 cards in front of them. If you have any leftover cards, place them face-down in the middle of the table. [2] X Research source If you’re playing in teams of 2, sit across from your partner. You cannot look at your teammates cards. 2-player rules: After dealing out hands to each player, flip over the top card of the deck to reveal the “trump” suit, which is the most powerful suit for the rest of the round. 3-player rules: Deal 18 cards to each player instead. Set 3 cards face-down in the middle of the table. These cards may be won by a player during the next part of the game. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Melds Melds are specific combinations of cards that earn points if you have them in your hand. During a 3- and 4-player game, you’ll count points from all of your melds before you play the cards in your hand—this informs how high your bid can be in the bidding portion of the game. In a 2-player match, you’ll be able to play a meld if you win a turn during the round (since 2-player Pinochle doesn't have a bidding round). There are 3 types of melds, and each card can only be used in 1 meld of each type. Some melds depend on the trump suit. The melds are: [4] X Research source Type 1 Royal Marriage (K and Q in trump suit): 40 pts Common Marriage (K and Q in non-trump suit): 20 pts Dix (9 in trump suit): 10 pts Bare Run (A, 10, K, Q, and J in trump): 150 pts Run with extra king (A, 10, K, K, Q, and J in trump): 190 pts Run with extra queen (A, 10, K, Q, Q, and J in trump): 190 pts Run with extra marriage (A, 10, K, K, Q, Q, and J in trump): 230 pts Double Run (A, A, 10, 10, K, K, Q, Q, J, and J in trump): 1,500 pts Type 2 Jacks Around (1 J of each suit): 40 pts Queens Around (1 Q of each suit): 60 pts Kings Around (1 K of each suit): 80 pts Aces Around (1 A of each suit): 100 pts Double Jacks Around (2 J of each suit): 400 pts Double Queens Around (2 Q of each suit): 600 pts Double Kings Around (1 K of each suit): 800 pts Double Aces Around (2 A of each suit): 1,000 pts Type 3 Pinochle (1 jack of diamonds and 1 queen of spades): 40 pts Double Pinochle (2 jacks of diamonds and 2 queens of spades): 300 pts"

      "content": "Tricks A \"trick\" is a single turn during a round of Pinochle where each person plays 1 card. Someone wins the played cards each turn and adds them to a trick pile for scoring. After you play through all the cards in your hand, you’ll tally up points from the cards you won. [5] X Research source Aces, 10s, and kings are all worth 10 points when they’re in your trick pile. Queens, jacks, and 9s are worth 0 points. There are a total of 240 points from winning tricks."

      "content": "Place bids on how many points you think your team will earn. Count up the total number of melds you currently have in your hand and estimate how many points your hand is worth (in addition to your partner's). Use this number to decide how high or low you're willing to bid for the round. The player to the left of the dealer starts with a minimum bid of 250 points. Continue clockwise around the table either raising the bid in increments of 10, or passing. Once a player makes a bid and everyone else passes, the player with the highest bid wins. 2-player rules: Skip the bidding phase of the game. If you’re playing a 4-player game, you and your teammate make separate bids based on your individual hands. Don’t try to outbid your teammate because you may have trouble earning that many points during the round."

After that, then pass aces, 9s, or 10s. Try to avoid passing cards that are not the trump suit if you’re able to. 3-player rules: If you’re the highest bidder, take the 3 cards in the middle of the table and add them to your hand.

These points aren’t part of your score yet but will be added at the end of the round. After you count the points from melds, put the cards back in your hand. [8] X Research source Example: If you lay out an ace of each suit as well as a king, a queen, a jack, a 10, and a 9 of the trump suit, you’d earn 250 points (100 for Aces Around and 150 for a Bare Run). 2-player rules: Do not lay out your melds yet.

If you’re not able to play a card matching the lead suit of the trick, then you must play one in the trump suit if you have one. Otherwise, you’re able to play any card from your hand.
