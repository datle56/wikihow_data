      "content": "Eepy is a shortened, baby-talk version of the word “sleepy.” “Eepy” leaves the “S” and “L” off of the word “sleepy,” creating a cute internet slang term used all across social media. [1] X Research source It’s primarily used to describe sleepy-looking animals and babies, but some may use it to talk about themselves or their tired partners. For example, this TikTok by @montythecuddledog shows clips of an adorable blue heeler with the caption “so eepy.” This Instagram post by @rartcattos shows an image of a tiny orange kitten with the text “so eepy” over it. TikToker @georgialynnrose made a video of her girlfriend walking down the stairs with the text “pov: my gf takes a 3 hour nap while i’m at her house.” The caption says “she’s eepy.”"

      "content": "”Eepy” comes from a misspelled Twitter (X) post of a sleepy kitten. On November 21, 2021, user @AnimalsCaption posted a GIF of a kitten falling asleep on the edge of a mug of coffee, captioned with “and why he eepy 😂.” The GIF went viral, inspiring other users on Twitter and other platforms to post photos and drawings of other “eepy” animals. [2] X Research source For example, on March 2, 2022, Instagram user @matthew.niverse posted a new video over the original GIF of a different cat falling asleep on a bed. In September 2022, Instagram account @monkey.posting posted a screencap of the GIF with an image of a sleeping chimp pasted over it. A TikTok sound made by user @jorblorn that says “The missile is very tired. He is eepy.” helped spread the term over the platform. Other users began using the term “eepy” out of context, creating a new slang term for any cute and sleepy animal (or person)."

      "content": "The “Why he eepy?” meme is a reference to “Why he ourple?” The “Why he ourple?” meme came from a comment on a TikTok of a cat with inexplicably purple spots.

In January 2022, iFunny user Hey_Kaminari posted a screenshot from the game Five Nights at Freddy’s of the purple protagonist Micheal Afton walking by while another character says “and why he ourple? 😂”"
