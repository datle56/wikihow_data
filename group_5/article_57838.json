      "title": "Choose anchors and bolts that support your TV’s weight.",
      "content": "Choose anchors and bolts that support your TV’s weight. When hanging a TV on drywall, normal screws aren’t enough to support its weight. Special anchors like toggle anchors and molly bolts can support more weight, making them great to use on drywall. However, not all anchors and bolts support the same amount of weight, so select ones that can withstand your TV’s weight. [1] X Research source Most anchors and bolts list how much weight they can carry on the packaging. Toggle anchors and bolts have metal clasps or toggles at the end that expand once they’re placed in drywall. The clasps hook onto the back of drywall, which better supports and distributes the TV’s weight on the wall. Anchors made for a lighter load can crack and rip your drywall when supporting too heavy objects. If the wall anchors are not rated for the weight of your TV, you need to cut open the wall and install solid wood blocking in between the studs so you could utilize that to screw the TV mount into it."

      "content": "Choose a TV mount that’s compatible with your TV. Different TVs have different bracket patterns on the back, so search for your TV type along with “bracket” or “mount” to find the recommended mount to buy. Additionally, make sure the mount you choose can support your TV’s weight. Most mounting packages and online listings specify the weight limits that they can carry. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use any kind of mount you want.",
      "content": "Use any kind of mount you want. Some TV mounts are stationary, meaning they stay firmly against the wall, while others can tilt up and down and swivel side to side. However, when mounting a TV on drywall, some argue that it's best to use a stationary mount, although that's debatable. You can buy stationary TV mounts from most retailers, or make your own from wood, called a French cleat. [3] X Research source You can use a flat mount or you can use an articulating mount. As long as it's supported properly and installed properly, it doesn't matter which one you use. Hanging your TV from the ceiling is another popular mounting choice when wall studs aren’t available. Both swivel and fixed mounts are great to use with ceiling mounts."

      "content": "Hang your TV on a sturdy section of wall. When finding a place to hang your TV, inspect your walls for any damage. Since you won’t be using strong wall studs to hang your TV, your drywall needs to be free from any cracks, crumbles, and decay. [4] X Research source"

Use a level to make sure the mount is straight on the wall. Then, mark the hole positions on the mount onto the wall with a pencil. [5] X Research source"

Then, pull the plastic tab back towards you to force the toggle to expand and lay flat against the back of the drywall. [7] X Research source You might need to jiggle or shake the tab a bit to get the toggle to expand. The metal toggle at the end of the anchor fastens to the back of your drywall. This better disperses the weight of your TV. When it is hung up, all of the drywall resists its weight instead of one fixed point."

      "content": "Push the plastic anchor against the wall and snap off the tab. At the end of the plastic tab is a circular, plastic anchor. Pull the tab back to make sure the toggle is tight against the wall and push the anchor all the way to the wall. Make sure it’s as tightly fastened to the wall as possible, then snap off the tabs that are still extending from the wall. [8] X Research source In place of toggle anchors, use molly bolts . These bolts are similar to toggle anchors, except they need a setting tool to fasten the anchor to the wall. Place the molly bolt inside the hole and hook a setting tool over the screw. Then, squeeze the handles of the tool. This pulls the screw towards you and extends the bolt’s butterfly backing, fastening it to the drywall. [9] X Research source"

You will be left with 2 pieces of wood: one with the 45° angle facing up and the other facing down. These pieces interlock to create the French cleat. The piece of wood with the 45° angle facing up is drilled into your wall while the piece angled down screws into your TV."

Position your piece of wood so the thicker, shorter side of the wood is facing up and the thinner, longer side is flat on your work area. Measure your piece of wood and subtract it by the distance of your TV’s bracket holes. Then, divide the difference by 2. This gives you the distance to mark a hole at on each end of the wood. [15] X Research source For example, your piece of wood might be 40 inches (101 cm) long and the distance between the bracket holes on your TV is 30 inches (76 cm). Subtract the bracket distance from the total wood length, which is 10 inches (25 cm). Divide that by 2, which is 5 inches (12.5 cm). So, you’d make a hole mark 5 inches (12.5 cm) from each end of the wood."
