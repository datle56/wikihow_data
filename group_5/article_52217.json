If your AeroGarden has other parts that can be disassembled, like a tray that separates into two parts, disassemble these parts as well. Some models of AeroGarden have a tube in the back that connects the device to its water supply. If yours does, unplug it. [1] X Research source Be sure to separate as many components as possible—roots can get everywhere in the device, including between plates and in small crevices."

      "content": "Clean out any visible roots by hand. If you’ve been using your AeroGarden for a while, it’s likely that there’s already quite a lot of root buildup. Pull off any roots you can see by hand, then dispose of them. If there’s grime attached to certain parts of your AeroGarden, like its tray, you may need to scrub it with your fingernail or steel wool."

To remove it for cleaning, you may need to use a small screwdriver to unscrew it from the rest of the bowl. Pull off any roots that have gotten into the cracks of the filter. [2] X Research source If your filter is worn out and seems like its falling apart, purchase a new one . This will preserve the longevity of your pump."

[5] X Research source If you removed the tube for the water pump, you can now plug it back in. Keep in mind that you’ll need to do this deep cleaning process every time you plan on growing new seeds. Otherwise, they may not grow as well as they should."
