      "content": "Mix your bleach and developer together. Pick up some powder bleach and liquid developer (20 volume is usually good for most hair types). Check the back of the package to find the ratio, then mix the products together in a plastic hair dye bowl. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply the bleach to the ends of your hair with a brush. Put on gloves to protect your hands and grab a hair dye brush. Carefully scoop up the bleach mixture and brush it onto the ends of your hair, dragging the bleach up as high as you want it to go. Work in small, 1 in (2.5 cm) wide sections to fully saturate every strand of hair. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the bleach in foils before rinsing.",
      "content": "Cover the bleach in foils before rinsing. In each section of hair, carefully slide a piece of aluminum foil over the bleach and fold it in half. Let the bleach process for 20 to 45 minutes before rinsing it out with cold water. [3] X Research source Bleach works with heat. If there is no heat, you cannot lift enough color. The aluminum foil helps to conduct the heat of your scalp more evenly into the sections you are highlighting and makes the bleach work faster."

      "title": "Bleach won’t ruin your hair, but it may damage your ends.",
      "content": "Bleach won’t ruin your hair, but it may damage your ends. The ends of your hair are naturally more dry than the tops, since they don’t get the natural oils from your scalp. If your hair is relatively healthy, bleaching the ends won’t ruin it, but it might make it a little more dry or frizzy. [4] X Research source This is especially true if you have naturally curly hair. In general, curly hair is a little more dry than naturally straight hair."

      "title": "Yes, but you should wait a while in between applications.",
      "content": "Yes, but you should wait a while in between applications. Bleach really dries out your hair, and bleaching more than once in a day can damage your ends a lot. If you want your hair to be lighter, you can apply the bleach 1 to 2 more times, but try to wait at least a week in between each application. [5] X Research source If your ends look yellow or brassy, consider using a toner instead of more bleach. Toners can help remove the yellow or orange tones in your hair, leaving it look silvery or platinum blonde."

      "content": "Use a hydrating hair mask right away. Give your hair some moisture back with a hydrating hair mask. Focus the product on your ends and let it sit for as long as you can before rinsing it out. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep using conditioning treatments once a week.",
      "content": "Keep using conditioning treatments once a week. Your hair might take a few weeks to get back to normal after bleaching. You can help it out by using a deep conditioner or a hair mask at least once a week until your ends look smooth and shiny again. [7] X Research source"
