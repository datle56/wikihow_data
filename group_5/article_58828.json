From general incontinence to sexual fetishes, learning about the myriad needs for adult diapers can help you react positively and support your spouse. Your spouse may be wearing diapers because: They suffer from urinary incontinence. This can arise from a broad range of conditions including menopause, enlarged prostate, urinary tract infections, pregnancy, childbirth, hysterectomy, and neurological disorders such as stroke or brain tumor.

This can arise from conditions such as damage to the rectum, nerve damage to the sphincter, chronic constipation, diarrhea, surgery, or rectal prolapse. They suffer from stress incontinence.

      "content": "Ask why your spouse is wearing diapers. In a non-confrontational and gentle manner, ask your spouse why she is wearing diapers. Wearing diapers can be a very sensitive and embarrassing subject for many adults, and simply asking her may help you better understand and eventually support her diaper use. Ask your partner about ways that can help them feel supported, comfortable, and accepted by you when it comes to wearing incontinence briefs and any information they feel would be helpful for you to know. If your spouse has been ill or experiencing other medical issues, broach the subject by saying something such as “I remember your doctor mentioned that incontinence may be a side effect of your injury. Are you having trouble?” If your spouse’s diaper use doesn’t come from an obvious condition, tread lightly in asking. For example, you could say “I found these diapers in the bathroom. Are you having some kind of issue with which I can offer you support?” This allows your spouse to answer honestly if he likes and also demonstrates your support no matter what the reason for wearing diapers."
