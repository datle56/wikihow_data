      "title": "This face suggests resigned sadness.",
      "content": "This face suggests resigned sadness. If you get this emoji from someone, they’re a little dissatisfied, a little miffed. Not ripping-their-hair-out-sad, but definitely disappointed-sad. You might receive this emoji after telling someone you’re not free to hang out, or after they confess they failed their recent math test. There’s the sadness of the basic frowny, but with a hint of grumpiness. Respond in kind to show support. Send along a sad emoji of your own to convey solidarity—but then follow it up with an emoji to express hope or love, like a heart (❤️) or some flowers (💐) if your relationship isn’t in heart-territory. And don’t forget the power of a few comforting words: “I’m sorry you’re bummed! You want to talk about it?” If your crush sends you this face, it’s a sign they trust you enough to share their emotions with you. Be sure to increase intimacy by inviting them to open up further, or to ask if you can do anything to help them."

      "title": "This face’s eyes are as big as its heart.",
      "content": "This face’s eyes are as big as its heart. The doe-eyed emoji is often used in flirty text exchanges: if you get this puppy-faced emoticon from your crush or someone you’re dating, they’re trying to come off innocent and cute. They might send this in response to a kind gesture or compliment, or because they’re trying to lure you into giving them a compliment in the first place—who could turn down that face? Reply with a flirty emoji, such as the heart eyes face (😍) or a kissing closed eyes face (😚), and your compliment of choice—for instance, “Aw, you know you’re a cutie!” or “I can’t say no to you!” If you’re dating (or getting close to dating), try replying with 2 kissing faces (👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩). The kissing faces come in multiple genders, so you can tailor your emoji as needed. Some people might also send this emoticon after they’ve made a mistake and want to downplay the issue or lightheartedly convey their shame or remorse. In that context, this face says, “I’m sowwy, can u forgive me?” In this case, if it’s a tiny faux pas, consider replying with a kissing heart face (😘) or a wink (😉) to show there’s no hard feelings. If the offense is more serious, consider saying so directly: “I’m actually really hurt by what you said. Can we talk about it?” or “I think I’m just gonna take some space for now.”"

      "title": "The pensive face is somber and subdued.",
      "content": "The pensive face is somber and subdued. This face is a bit remorseful and regretful, but it also displays some grace under duress. The tiny upturned brows on this face, paired with the delicate, flattened frown, suggest the sender of this emoji is quietly considering where everything went wrong. On the other hand, some people use the pensive sad face jokingly to express a sort of faux-martyrishness. For example, “I cannot attend the premiere of Barbie because I have to work, but such is the life of a hustler. 😔” If you suspect the emoji was sent in jest, reply with the pensive emoji in return, maybe with a joking “That’s harsh” or “Praying 4 u” or something similar. If the pensive face is sent sincerely, respond with a show of support, like a heart, a happy tree or flower, or a simple “I’m here for you.”"

      "title": "The basic, no-nonsense disappointed face.",
      "content": "The basic, no-nonsense disappointed face. If you get this little guy in a text message or DM, you can be sure the sender is feelin’ a little bummed out right now. Things are simply not going their way. [1] X Research source The open eyes and basic downturned mouth suggest an innocence, a “Why is this happening?” that other sad faces don’t necessarily express, and the lack of tears indicates the situation isn’t sob-worthy. If someone sends you this face, respond with a show of support in the form of a heart (❤️) or maybe a “*hug*”. Let the sender know you care, and ask if there’s anything you can do. If your crush sends you this emoji, they may want you to ask them what’s wrong because they see you as someone they can turn to for support."

      "title": "The face of a tender crying bébé.",
      "content": "The face of a tender crying bébé. What the crying sad face expresses is a sort of quiet sorrow. This single-tear emoji may be used by someone feeling not only sad, but a bit tired as well, a bit sensitive. Someone who wants you to know they’re sad, but they’re not going to make a huge deal out of it. This emoji’s upturned eyebrows and single tear imply a level of stoicism, as if the sender is heartbroken, but knows they can make it through. [2] X Research source Respond with the same emoji or perhaps the broken heart ( 💔) to show sympathy , or ask, “Is there anything I can do for you?” Avoid sending a smiley, as these can come off passive-aggressive or dismissive of the person’s sadness."

    {
      "title": "This face says “Nothing has ever been sadder or cuter, or both.”",
      "content": "This face says “Nothing has ever been sadder or cuter, or both.” The sobbing face is the sort of emoji one might send in response to a video of 2 old married people exchanging valentines, or of a horse who’s decided a pig is her baby. The appropriate response to a cathartic gut punch. If someone sends you a cute or sad video with a sobbing face, respond with a sobbing face in return, obviously. You’re not a monster. This face may also occasionally be used to express frustration or sadness. Someone might use the loudly crying face when they’re having a difficult day and just can’t take it anymore. If a friend sends you this face out of frustration, the appropriate response is something mega supportive, like a series of hearts (❤️❤️❤️❤️) or an offer to DoorDash them their favorite dinner. If you get this emoji from your crush when they’re having a tough day, tell them you’re there to listen if they want to talk. If they know they can emotionally rely on you, they may develop romantic feelings for you in return. If you’re feeling bold, follow up your text with a single heart."

      "title": "This emoji expresses empathy towards the receiver.",
      "content": "This emoji expresses empathy towards the receiver. The droplet on this emoji’s face may be a tear, but it could also be sweat due to the sender’s anxiety over the receiver’s personal well-being. You might get this emoji from someone after you tell them all about the rotten day you had to convey that they’re a shoulder to cry on. If you get this emoji from your crush, it’s a sign they care about you and your emotional well-being. They’re offering sympathy and may even be available to talk you through your problems. If they offer to chat and you feel comfortable with it, take them up on their offer—they mean it! If they send this face alone, send back a single emoji that shows you appreciate their concern, such as the pleading face (🥺)."

      "title": "The frowning person adds a bit more human detail to your sad emoji.",
      "content": "The frowning person adds a bit more human detail to your sad emoji. People use the frowning person emoji to express disappointment or regret, maybe at the end of a long rant about the rotten day they had. It usually comes in different genders and races, so you can customize your emoji as you’d like. If someone sends you this emoji, it’s usually accompanied by a description of something that’s upset them. The frowning person will more likely be used to express bitterness, resignation, or frustration—dry-eyed disappointment—than depression or heartbreak. Reply to this emoji with the facepalm emoji (🤦) if they’re venting about something that annoys them (e.g., “I can’t BELIEVE I have to work tomorrow”). Respond with a more supportive emoji—like the heart hands or a simple heart—if they’re expressing more serious sorrow (e.g., “We had to take Buddy to the vet last night, and I’m not sure he’s going to make it”)."

      "title": "Just like a crying face, only it’s a cat.",
      "content": "Just like a crying face, only it’s a cat. The cat face emojis are popular among cat-lovers, but aside from this difference, they’re used in pretty much the same way as the non-cat faces. The single-tear cat face may be used to express sorrow, grief, or regret, but it shows the sender also has a bit of a cute and cuddly side. If your crush sends you any of the cat face emojis, be sure to use the cat emojis in your response back! There’s a variety of them, including the smiley cat (😺), heart eyes cat (😻), and kissing cat (😽). If you get the crying cat face, despite the fact that it’s a cat, take the sender seriously! They may be using the face to express their emotions at a sad video or the death of a fictional character, but plenty of people use the crying cat to indicate they’re going through a rough time."

      "content": "The sad blue emoji is used for a popular TikTok trend. This sad emoji isn’t actually an emoji at all, but one in a series of blue emoji designs that have become part of a meme on TikTok. [3] X Research source The trend follows this basic formula: TikTok users post a video that begins with a smiling or laughing blue emoji overlaid with text reading, “Who even listens to this song?” (or something similar) and ending with the sobbing blue emoji and text reading, “Oh wait, I do.” The video might be accompanied by any song the video’s creator loves. [4] X Research source The sad blue emoji was created as part of a series of 40 different emojis by artist Tanya Mau in 2009 and 2011. [5] X Research source"
