      "content": "Find a suitable piece of wood for the stock and barrel. The stock and barrel of your rubber band rifle should be made of a material soft enough that you can cut a groove into it. Wood is likely the cheapest and most readily available option, though bamboo and similar materials can also make an effective stock. Your stock should be about two feet (60 cm) in length. You can find suitable wood for your stock from a sturdy tree branch, a hardware store, or a lumber yard. Spare handles for tools, frequently sold at hardware stores, are an excellent option to consider."

      "content": "Attach a clothespin to your stock to act as your release. [1] X Research source The best placement for your clothespin depends on the kind of rifle you intend on making. A high powered rubber band rifle can be made by attaching your clothespin farther back on the stock. Normal rifles should have the clothespin attached â…” of the way from the front toward the back of your stock. To attach your clothespin: Mark your stock with a pencil or knife at the location you plan on attaching your clothespin. Use a glue, like wood glue, superglue, or hot glue, to attach your clothespin to your stock. Allow sufficient time for your glue to fully dry. Note: the farther back you put your clothespin, the more pressure your rubber band will exert on the pin. If you place your pin too far back, your clothespin might not be strong enough to hold your rubber band in place."
