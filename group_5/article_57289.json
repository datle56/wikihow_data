      "title": "Purchase about 1–2 yd (0.91–1.83 m) of 2 different fleece patterns.",
      "content": "Purchase about 1–2 yd (0.91–1.83 m) of 2 different fleece patterns. Select and purchase 2 lengths of fleece . 1 yd (0.91 m) is perfect for a child’s blanket, while about 2 yd (1.8 m) of fleece makes a good throw-sized blanket. That said, make your blanket as large or as small as you like. [1] X Research source Use 2 different fleece patterns or solid colors that you think pair well, and cut them to equal sizes. Note that your final blanket will be about 8 in (20 cm) smaller than the fleece you start with. You can also repurpose 2 old fleece blankets to make an eco-friendly recycled blanket."

      "title": "Lay the 2 fleece lengths flat on top of each other.",
      "content": "Lay the 2 fleece lengths flat on top of each other. Spread the fleece on a large flat surface so that the softer and more vibrant sides face out, and the smooth (raw) sides touch. Position the fleece so that all 4 edges are aligned. [2] X Research source Use an empty kitchen table or a clean floor to allow for enough room to spread out your fleece. The sides don’t have to align exactly or be perfectly straight; any rough or uneven edges will be concealed by knots. Optionally, fasten both lengths of fleece in place with safety pins to keep them aligned."

      "title": "Cut a 4 in (10 cm) square out of each corner of the fleece.",
      "content": "Cut a 4 in (10 cm) square out of each corner of the fleece. With a ruler or measuring tape, measure 4 in (10 cm) from the corner of one edge. From that point, use scissors or a rotary cutter to cut 4 in (10 cm) into the blanket, perpendicular to the edge. Make a similar cut on the other side of the fleece’s corner, so that the cuts meet, and you’re left with a 4 in (10 cm) square of fabric. Repeat this step for the other 3 corners. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble, cut along the long edge of a notecard to help you measure your cuts. Note that these empty squares won’t show up in the completed blanket—we cut them away so that we have 4 even edges to tie."

    {
      "title": "Cut 1 in (2.5 cm)-wide strips into all 4 edges of the fleece.",
      "content": "Cut 1 in (2.5 cm)-wide strips into all 4 edges of the fleece. Cut 4 in (10 cm) into the fabric, and be sure to cut both lengths of fleece. Once you’re finished, your lengths of fleece will have an equal number of strips on each edge, forming an even fringe. [4] X Research source Don’t worry if you find that some strips are a bit wider or narrower than the rest. You won’t be able to notice after you tie your knots! For a braided edge, only cut your strips 2 inches (5.1 cm) deep."

      "title": "Tie the strips together with a single overhand knot.",
      "content": "Tie the strips together with a single overhand knot. At this point, each strip on the top length of fleece has a twin strip beneath it. To secure the fleece strips with a simple knot, wrap a pair of strips around your index finger, then feed the end of the strips through the loop created with your finger to create an overhand knot . Tug the strips gently to tighten them, and repeat this knot for every pair of strips on your blanket. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie the strips together with a double overhand knot for a different look.",
      "content": "Tie the strips together with a double overhand knot for a different look. Tie the top strip and bottom strip together by wrapping the top strip over and under the bottom strip, then wrapping the bottom strip over and under the top strip. Tug on the strips to tighten and secure them. Tie a double overhand knot with each pair of strips on the blanket. [6] X Research source Tie double overhand knots about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) away from the base of the strip to avoid wrinkling the surface of the blanket."

    {
      "title": "Or, secure the strips with a looped edge.",
      "content": "Or, secure the strips with a looped edge. To give your blanket a looped edge, use scissors or a rotary cutter to make a 1 in (2.5 cm) incision at the base of each pair of strips. Then, feed the tips of both strips down through the incision (like threading a needle), and tug gently to secure them. Repeat this process for each strip along the edge of your blanket. [7] X Research source Make the incision with scissors by folding the strips in half, and cutting 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) into the middle of the fold."

      "content": "Or, feed the strips through each other for a braided edge. Cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) incision into the center of each pair of strips, at their base. Starting at one left-hand corner, feed the first pair of strips through the incision of the pair to its right. Then, feed the second pair through the incision to its right, and so on all the way around the blanket. [8] X Research source Finish the edge by feeding the last pair of strips through the incision in the first pair of strips."

      "title": "Machine wash your fleece tie blanket with cool water and mild detergent.",
      "content": "Machine wash your fleece tie blanket with cool water and mild detergent. Cold water, gentle detergent, and a delicate wash cycle will ensure your blanket stays soft through many washes. In addition, it’ll be gentle on the knots, and prevent them from coming untied. [9] X Research source Only wash your fleece when it’s become noticeably dirty, or smells a bit musty."

      "title": "Air dry your fleece blanket for a few hours, or machine dry it on low heat.",
      "content": "Air dry your fleece blanket for a few hours, or machine dry it on low heat. After washing, hang your fleece blanket in an area with good air circulation, like outside on a line or inside near a window. Allow it to rest for a few hours, or until completely dry. Alternatively, machine dry your blanket on low heat or on “tumble dry” to avoid damaging it. [10] X Research source Larger blankets will take longer to dry, so check your blanket every hour or after every drying cycle to ensure all the moisture has been removed."

      "content": "Remove fleece pills with a razor. Fleece materials are prone to pilling, which is when the material rubs up against itself and creates small beads of fibers. You can easily remove these pills by gently running a shaving razor over the pilled area. Avoid pressing into the blanket or applying too much pressure; a light tough is all you need.
