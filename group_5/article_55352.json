      "content": "Ask yourself what you want to manifest. Are you feeling discouraged or unsure and in need of a personal boost? Are you hurting financially and could use some money magick? Clarifying your vision will help you manifest it. Try saying your goals aloud, or writing them down in a journal. Being able to translate your goals into words can help you make them more concrete instead of letting them float around abstractly in your head. You might say (or write) something like, “I want to manifest a new, higher-paying job” or “I want to cultivate a thriving social life.”"

Depending on the time of the day, week, month, or year you perform your candle ritual, you may achieve better results. Green candles are more effective on Fridays, the day associated with the goddess Venus, so why not unwind at the end of a long week with a little candle magick? Perform your ritual during the New Moon to add a little positivity to your spell. The New Moon carries powerful manifestation properties."

You can dress your candle using any oil you’ve got around the house, like jojoba or olive oil or essential oils."

Making a spell can be as simple as just saying what you want out loud and then lighting your candle to ignite its magick. But you can also enhance the efficacy of your spell with a few tricks: Create a song or a chant about what you want to manifest. Music and rhythm will add special power to your spell. You don’t have to get too wild or creative with it—you could even just sing or chant the same sentence over and over again. (And no, it doesn’t matter if you’re a terrible singer.) If you've written down what you want to manifest, you may opt to burn the paper during your ritual. Just be sure not to catch anything else on fire!"

Place relevant crystals around your candle to enhance its strength. For instance, if you want to bless your finances, add some citrine; if you’re looking for general good fortune, try malachite or green aventurine. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Interpret the candle’s aura. Focus on the candle’s aura—the movement of the flame and the light it casts on your surroundings. Different movements and sounds will help you interpret the flame's meaning . Continue to sing or chant for as long as you feel moved to. Once your attention starts to wane, blow out the candle. If the flame is tall and stable, the ritual is successful. If the candle sizzles or pops, this could mean a spirit from the beyond is trying to communicate with you. To interpret their message, try to tell what words the crackles sound like. Don’t overthink it—just go with the first thing you hear. Stare at the flame until your eyes go out of focus. What images do you see in the fire? What visions is the candle sending you? If the candle refuses to light, or if the flame is weak or falters, it could indicate there are negative forces interfering with your ritual and you may want to try again later."

      "content": "Choose candles made from natural ingredients, if possible. Everyone loves candles...but unfortunately, some candles don't love us! Scented candles in particular may contain chemicals that carry toxic carcinogens, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your favorite fragrances: just look for candles that are phthalate-free and made with 100% essential oils. Keep in mind that just because an ingredient is synthetic, it doesn't mean it's toxic. [7] X Research source Look for companies that are transparent and list their ingredients in full. Paraffin wax has gotten a bad rap, but studies actually show the health risks posed by all types of candle wax are minimal and pretty much identical. [8] X Research source Still, if you want to be on the safe side, look for candles made with 100% natural wax, such as soy wax, coconut wax, or beeswax."

In any case, while different colors carry different magical properties, don't discount the power of personal preference. Much of the effectiveness of this spell lies in your ability to follow your instincts and desires, so if a particular fragrance catches your eye (er, nose), then don't overthink it: add it to the ritual, even if it's not green. Scent is a powerful tool and has the ability to affect our mood and behavior, so the right-smelling candle can help with that.
