      "content": "Identify your valet switch. The valet switch is either a toggle switch or a push button that disarms all alarm functions except the remote panic and remote door lock functions. This eliminates the need to hand your remote to garage mechanics and valets, giving the switch its name. Usually this switch is located somewhere under the dash, perhaps on the left kick panel. [1] X Research source A valet switch is a standard piece of equipment with most factory and aftermarket alarm systems. Using the valet switch should serve to reset your alarm. Your alarm should stay shut down as long as you are in valet mode. You should be aware that this disables you alarm system, meaning that your car is unprotected if you use it as a long term solution."

The detector looks like a plunger switch pointing upward. It will be pressed down when hood is closed, telling your alarm that nobody has tampered with the hood. The plunger will usually be enclosed within a rubber boot. If your battery is not under your hood, it is not necessary to have the hood open and manually depress the hood position detector. You can simply close the hood."
