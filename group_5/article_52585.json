      "content": "Soak your soybeans overnight. Place soybeans in a large bowl and cover with water, and add some salt. Use 3 cups (700 milliliters) of cold water and 1 teaspoon of salt for every 1 cup (200 grams) of soybeans. Put the bowl into the refrigerator, and allow your beans to soak overnight (8-10 hours). [2] X Research source Make sure to refrigerate your beans while they soak—don’t simply leave them out on the counter! Refrigerating the beans will keep them from fermenting, especially in warmer climates. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your soybeans in a large pot and cover them with water.",
      "content": "Place your soybeans in a large pot and cover them with water. Make sure that your pot is large enough—the cooking process will create a lot of foam, which could overflow if your pot is too small. Your dried soybeans should only reach about 1/4th of the height of the pot on their own, and once the water is added, it shouldn’t reach more than 1/3rd of the pot’s height. [4] X Research source Use 4 cups (950 milliliters) of water for every 1 cup (200 grams) of soybeans. [5] X Research source Add 1 tsp (6 grams) of salt for flavor, if desired."

      "content": "Bring the water to a boil, then simmer for 4-6 hours. First, bring the water to a boil over high heat. As soon as it starts to boil, reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Allow the beans to simmer over this heat for about 4-6 hours, until they are tender. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Skim off the gray foam periodically.",
      "content": "Skim off the gray foam periodically. As your beans are cooking, keep a close eye on them. You’ll likely see a lot of foam forming, and it may boil over if you aren’t paying attention. Use a slotted spoon to periodically scoop out the foam and any floating hulls. [7] X Research source Over time, the water will start to evaporate. Add more water to the pot as needed to replace the evaporated liquid. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Drain the beans and remove their hulls. Once your beans are fully cooked, their loose hulls will rise to the surface. Skim off these hulls with a slotted spoon, then pour your beans into a colander to drain. [9] X Research source Let the beans cool for a few minutes, then use your fingers to remove any leftover hulls that you see. And that’s it! Your soybeans are now fully cooked and ready to serve or add to other recipes. You can store your cooked soybeans in small containers or resealable bags in the freezer, or you can refrigerate them in an airtight container. [10] X Research source"

Unlike dried mature soybeans, which are yellow-ish in color and require a long cooking process, edamame beans are bright green and require only a few minutes of boiling. Fresh edamame pods are available in the produce section of most grocery stores [22] X Research source Here’s a breakdown of how to cook them: Start by scrubbing the pods with salt to get rid of the fuzz, then rinse them under running water. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the edamame pods to the boiling water, and cook for 5 minutes. Drain the edamame pods and add salt to taste. Allow the edamame pods to cool, then serve. Note: You may be able to find shucked edamame beans in the frozen section of the grocery store, as well. To cook, simply add the frozen beans to boiling water and boil for around 2-3 minutes.
