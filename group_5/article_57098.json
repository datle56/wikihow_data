      "content": "Find a shoe that you'd like the pattern to be made for. Drape the cloth pattern over the shoe and use the binding clip to attach it to the top of the shoe. The cloth pattern used should be slightly longer and slightly taller than the shoe."

      "title": "Use the scotch tape to attach the cloth to the back of the shoe",
      "content": "Use the scotch tape to attach the cloth to the back of the shoe and draw a vertical line indicating where the pattern will end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do the same to the front.",
      "content": "Do the same to the front. The seam should run down the middle of the laces . Cut off any excess fabric outside the line, and tape the cloth pattern to the shoe. Run your hands along the fabric to take any bumps out of the pattern and ensure the cloth is tight enough to create a good cover. Decide how low you want to top of the spat to go from the top of the shoe. In this model, the top of the spat will hang slightly lower than the top of the shoe."

      "content": "Decide where you want the buttons to go. Draw another line indicating this. Because the lines drawn on the pattern will likely be shaky and not visible in certain areas, go back through and darken the lines to strengthen the pattern outline."

      "title": "Trace the pattern directly onto the pattern paper.",
      "content": "Trace the pattern directly onto the pattern paper. Cut off the excess cloth and draw the pattern on the paper. Weights can be helpful in keeping the pattern completely still to ensure a steady hand and correctly dimensional pattern."

      "content": "Cut the same cloth in half and trace the two pieces onto another section of tracing/pattern paper. This will create the other side of the spat. On the parts of the boot where the two segments of leather are sewn together (front and back), a half-inch seam allowance is necessary to create leeway."

Do not use pins when sewing, because pins create permanent holes in the leather. Instead, just hold the pieces together and feed it through.
