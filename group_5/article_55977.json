      "title": "Check your bra size.",
      "content": "Check your bra size. Wearing a bra that is too big will not make your breasts look larger. That is why it is important to wear the right size bra for you. You can visit a lingerie shop and have them measure you to help you fit a bra to your size, or measure yourself before you shop for a new bra to ensure that you get a good fit. [1] X Research source Use a flexible tape measure, like one found in a sewing kit. Wrap the measuring tape around the top of your rib cage just below your breasts. Check the measurement and then round this measurement to the nearest even number to determine your bust size. Measure around your body and across the nipples to find your cup size. The difference in inches between your bust measurement and this measurement is what determines the cup size. If you have less than an inch of difference, then you are an AA cup, a difference of one inch is an A cup, a difference of two inches is a B cup, a difference of three inches is a C cup, etc. Your breast size will change as you grow and gain or lose weight. Re-measure yourself periodically when you feel you may have had a change in your breast size and need a new bra."

      "content": "Look for a padded bra. One way to increase your breast size with your bra is to look for a bra that is padded. Some bras even promise that they will make your breasts look like they are a full cup size larger. Look for a padded bra that provides the level of padding that you are looking for. Try on a few different padded bras to find the padding level that works for you."

      "title": "Consider different types of padding.",
      "content": "Consider different types of padding. Padding comes in a variety of materials, so you can also look for a bra with a specific type of padding. Foam or silicone rubber padding is common, effective and comfortable. Gel and liquid padding was created to give a more natural breast-like feel to the touch. Some padded bras have a pocket which allows you to remove the padded inserts if you choose."

      "title": "Go for specific bra types.",
      "content": "Go for specific bra types. Some bras are more effective than others at increasing your breast size. Try to choose a bra that will give your breasts the lift and support they need to look larger. Some popular choices include: Demi cup bras. Demi cup bras are cut lower and closer to the nipple to allow more of your breast to spill over the top. The extra exposed skin will provide more cleavage. [2] X Research source Push-up bra. The wires in an underwire push-up bra run along the bottom of the breasts in the front of the bra. Some people find underwire push-up bras uncomfortable, but they lift and support your breasts, which can make your breasts look larger. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist your bra at the center.",
      "content": "Twist your bra at the center. A simple trick to bring your breasts closer together and create more cleavage is to give your bra a twist. This will pull the cups a little closer together and add a little more cleavage. Before you put the bra on, turn one cup all the way around from top to bottom to create a twist in the front of the bra between the cups. Then, just put on the bra as you normally would without undoing the twist."

    {
      "title": "Tighten the straps.",
      "content": "Tighten the straps. When you tighten your bra straps, you press your breasts closer to your body, which gives them a lift. This is an especially helpful technique when you are trying to even out the size of your breasts. If one breast is larger than the other, fit your bra to the larger breast and tighten the strap of the smaller breast to even out your chest. Experiment with different levels of tightness to see what works for you. Just keep in mind that making your straps too tight can be uncomfortable."

      "title": "Wear two bras.",
      "content": "Wear two bras. Wearing two bras will make your breasts look as much as three times their normal size. Just put on one bra and then put on another bra over the first one. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that wearing two bras can be a bit uncomfortable, so you might want to save this technique for a special event. Do not do this with two sports bras. Wearing two sports bras will flatten your chest even more. To get the best results, wear two padded bras."

      "title": "Stuff your bra.",
      "content": "Stuff your bra. Stuffing your bra is a classic way to create the appearance of larger breasts. However, it is important to stuff your bra with the right materials, or the result can be sloppy. [5] X Research source Use socks. Socks are a great option because they are soft and you probably already have lots of them. Just fold a sock in half and place it near the bottom of your bra cup. Buy gel inserts. You can also purchase silicone gel inserts to pad your bra. You can slip these inserts into the bottom of your bra to make your breasts look a full cup size bigger. Avoid tissues and cotton balls. Tissues and cotton balls may slip out more easily than other materials. They can also fall apart and create a lumpy appearance."

      "title": "Choose tops that make your bust look bigger.",
      "content": "Choose tops that make your bust look bigger. Some of your tops might be more flattering to your chest than others. To ensure that you are making your breasts look as big as possible, choose tops that have the desired effect. Some good options include tops that have: Ruffles around or near the chest. Lighter colors on top and darker colors on bottom. Horizontal stripes around the chest area. Gathered material or pleating around the neckline."

      "title": "Work on your posture.",
      "content": "Work on your posture. Sitting or standing up tall can also make your breasts look larger and fuller. [6] X Research source Try to remember to stand up and sit straight to ensure that your breasts will look as big as possible. Try setting a reminder on your phone to “stand up straight.” Every time the reminder goes off, pull yourself up to your full height and push out your chest."

      "title": "Wear accessories that hang right on your breasts.",
      "content": "Wear accessories that hang right on your breasts. Some carefully chosen accessories may also help to enhance your breasts. For example, you can choose items that draw the eye towards your chest, rather than away from it. Skip the dangly earrings and go for necklaces and brooches instead. Try wearing necklaces that hang down to the area between your breasts or just above your cleavage. Or, try wearing a brooch right on the edge of a scoop neck or v-neck sweater."

      "title": "Use makeup to create the appearance of cleavage.",
      "content": "Use makeup to create the appearance of cleavage. You can also use makeup to contour the areas just above your breasts, which can make it look like you have cleavage or enhance your existing cleavage. To create the appearance of cleavage with makeup, use a light brown eyeliner to draw two arcs just above your breasts. Then, use a fluffy brush to blend the lines with some matte bronzer. [7] X Research source Use a bronzer that is a couple shades darker than what you would normally wear. Be sure to blend until the arcs are barely visible; they should provide just a shadow that resembles cleavage but not be too obvious."
