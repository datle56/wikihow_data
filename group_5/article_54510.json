      "content": "Buy a bathtub chip repair kit that matches your tub’s color and material. You can either buy a 1-part compound kit or a 2-part compound kit that requires you to mix the two bottles before applying. There are epoxy compound repair kits for all kinds of tub materials, including ceramic, porcelain, fiberglass, and enamel. Most kits come in shades of white, black, or gray to match the most common bathtub colors. [1] X Research source Repairing a small chip in your bathtub usually costs $10 to $35 for the entire project. Home renovation and repair specialist Art Fricke says that if your tub “has a lot of scratches or is discolored or has a lot of dings and dents,” you may want to get it refinished instead. [2] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. Art Fricke also says that a steel or acrylic tub “can't really be sanded and recoated.” You may want to replace it instead. [3] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. If your tub is leaking, overly worn, or cracked, you may have to replace it instead. [4] X Research source The repair might not match your tub completely. Sanding it down helps blend out the patch, but you might still see a difference between the tub and the compound."

      "content": "Clean the damaged area and apply painter’s tape around the chip. Use warm water and dish detergent or a household tub cleaner to clean the chipped area. Thoroughly dry the area with a clean lint-free cloth. Use painter’s tape or masking tape to outline the edge of the chip and protect the rest of the area from the epoxy compound. [5] X Research source If the chip is on the wall of the tub, apply extra pieces of tape to the area below it to catch any dripping epoxy. You can also use acetone or rubbing alcohol to clean the area. Any product that removes grease and soap scum can work to clean the chip."

      "content": "Follow the directions in your epoxy kit to mix the components. For 2-part compounds, follow the instructions to mix together both parts on a scrap piece of cardboard or paper until the compound reaches an even color and consistency. [6] X Research source For 1-part compounds, mix the bottle according to the directions—this typically requires shaking the bottle. Some 2-part epoxy compound comes in a putty, while others come in a paste. [7] X Research source Each kit can make several repairs, so try not to use the compounds all at once."

      "content": "Apply a thin layer of compound with a small paint brush or plastic knife. Scoop up a small amount of the epoxy with your chosen utensil. Spread it in a thin layer over the chip by working in 1 direction and smooth out any spots where it pools. [8] X Research source Start with a small amount of epoxy and add more layers so you don’t put too much on, which takes more time to dry and can cause the epoxy to run. If the color of the epoxy is slightly off when you put on the first coat, it might be the metal showing through. However, if it seems like the color is way off, stop and order a different color. Make sure that anything you use to apply the epoxy is disposable. It can be difficult to get the epoxy off of anything it touches."

Remove the painter’s tape around the chip and spray the area with water. Gently sand the surface with 400- or 600-grit sandpaper until it feels flush with the rest of the tub. [9] X Research source Some epoxy compounds set within 2 to 3 hours. Other kits may advise you to wait up to 24 hours before sanding. If you can still feel the chip after sanding, apply more compound and repeat this process. After you’re done, rinse away any dust from the sanding process or wipe it down with a damp towel and your tub is ready to use!"

If your kit only comes with paint, you may need to purchase additional supplies. Buy a caulk gun and shower caulk to finish the job. [10] X Research source Check that the kit comes with a durable resin coating for your tub. Some cheaper kits come with an epoxy coating, which can chip and discolor faster. Refinishing kits can cost from about $30 to $150. The average cost to hire a professional is about $480. [11] X Research source Tub refinishing kits work to refinish all kinds of bathtubs including ceramic, porcelain, acrylic, fiberglass, and enamel tubs. The kits will provide a new porcelain-like finish to these kinds of tubs."

Starting with the lowest-grit sandpaper, sand the whole surface in circular motions by hand or with an electric sander. Work your way up to the highest-grit sandpaper. If your kit comes with etching powder, apply it to the bathtub and use an abrasive pad to dull the finish. [21] X Research source Sanding the tub dulls the finish on the existing coating so it’s easier for the new coating to bond with the tub.

Let it dry for at least 2 to 3 hours before you start to paint on the new finish. [26] X Research source If your refinishing kit only comes with a reglazer, then you don’t need a primer. Priming the surface is an important part of ensuring that the new finish adheres correctly so that you end up with the correct texture.

Most bathtubs can be refinished with just 2 coats, but if you’re concerned that the layers are too thin, apply a third coat.

If you don't let the finish dry long enough, you could end up with streaks and bubbles in the new coating and may need to start the process over again. Move the caulk gun along the edges of the tub slowly to ensure an even bead, then allow the caulk to dry at least 24 hours before you use it.
