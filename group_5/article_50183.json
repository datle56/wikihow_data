[1] X Research source If you have instant yeast, there is no need to activate the yeast: Just mix it in with your dry ingredients. If you have active dry yeast, it helps to activate the yeast first.

      "content": "Fill a vessel with some warm water. The water needs to be between 100 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). If the water is too cold, the yeast will not \"wake up.\" If the water is too hot, you run the risk of killing the yeast. Make sure the amount of water you use is not greater than the amount called for in your recipe."

      "content": "Let the vessel sit for 1 to 10 minutes. [4] X Research source This process is called \"proofing\" the yeast, and it means you are allowing the yeast to begin metabolizing the sugar and propagate. A minute or 2 is sufficient for most applications, but if you really want to be sure your yeast are alive and well, wait 10 minutes and then check on the yeast. If the water has a little bit of bubbly froth at the top, your yeast are healthy and working."

      "content": "Add the yeast solution to your dry ingredients. Finish executing your recipe as planned. If you are using dried brewer's yeast to brew beer, follow the same process listed above. As an alternative, you can pitch the dried yeast directly into your wort, although by doing this you run the risk of under-pitching, as many of the yeast can be killed if the temperature is not perfect."
