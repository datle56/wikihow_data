      "content": "Wear it with a top bow instead. Alternatively, place the middle of your bandana strip on the center of the hairline on the back of your neck. Move your two hands toward the edges of the strip and pull it onto the top of your head. [2] X Research source Tie a double knot on top of your head. Take the short ends sticking out of the knot and open the folds of the bandana to create your bow. Flip your head over if you’ve decided to wear your hair down. Once you’ve pulled the corners to the top of your head, flip your head back over so you can see what you’re tying."

Take the corner closest to you (the bottom corner) and fold it up so that the point hits the center of the bandana. [4] X Research source If you have a smaller bandana, make this fold smaller—don’t make it reach to the center. This will give you more fabric to stretch over your head."
