      "title": "Real leather has marks and imperfections.",
      "content": "Real leather has marks and imperfections. Look for small discolorations and minor imperfections like wrinkles, scars, and markings on the leather. Fake leather tends to have a uniform, flawless surface. No two samples of Italian leather will be exactly the same because of the treating process and the individual hide used to make them. Keep in mind that these minor imperfections aren't actually damage. They're just marks caused by the natural tanning process used to make the leather."

      "title": "Genuine Italian leather will have a rich, earthy aroma.",
      "content": "Genuine Italian leather will have a rich, earthy aroma. Fake leather, on the other hand, will have a chemical smell or no smell at all. Other leathers sometimes use chemicals in the treating process that mask or hide the smell of real leather, but Italian leather does not."

      "title": "Real leather has slightly uneven and rough-looking stitching holes.",
      "content": "Real leather has slightly uneven and rough-looking stitching holes. The stitching holes on fake leather are typically uniform. Check the seams and edges of the leather to find the stitching holes and examine them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Italian leather will wrinkle when you press on it.",
      "content": "Italian leather will wrinkle when you press on it. This wrinkle pattern will briefly appear when you press on the leather and then fade away when you let go. Fake leather won’t wrinkle like this when you press on it. Fake leather can also feel like vinyl or plastic, but not always. New imitation leather is sometimes hard to tell apart from the real deal just by the way it feels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Real leather will absorb the water.",
      "content": "Real leather will absorb the water. Just add a drop of water to the leather, then wait a few minutes. If the leather absorbed the water, it's real. If it didn't, it's most likely fake. Water will pool on top of fake leather."
    },
    {
      "title": "Genuine Italian leather will come with a certificate tag so you know it's the real deal.",
      "content": "Genuine Italian leather will come with a certificate tag so you know it's the real deal. The tag should say something like “100% Italian leather” or “certified Italian leather.” A reputable company that stands by their product will include a tag like this. No certificate of authenticity is a red flag. Any quality manufacturer will include one. Check online to see if the seller or company that made the leather is legit. If they have bad reviews (or no reviews at all) or they don't have a website, they're probably not trustworthy."

    {
      "title": "Real Italian leather isn't cheap.",
      "content": "Real Italian leather isn't cheap. Compare the price of the item to other similar items made with Italian leather. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. You could be looking at fake leather. For reference, an Italian leather handbag can cost between $170-$300 USD. Sometimes you can get lucky and find something made with real Italian leather at a thrift store. In that case, it very well could be underpriced! You don’t necessarily have to go with name-brand Italian leather. There are lots of smaller and lesser-known manufacturers that produce great, authentic Italian leather."

    {
      "title": "Most Italian leather goods come with some kind of warranty.",
      "content": "Most Italian leather goods come with some kind of warranty. A warranty shows that the manufacturer stands behind their product. Purchase Italian leather that comes with a warranty if you want to be sure that it’s the real deal. Not all Italian leather products come with a warranty, but a warranty can be a helpful sign that the leather is authentic."
