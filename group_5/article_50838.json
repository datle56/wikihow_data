      "content": "Suggest a unique date. One way to ensure you'll be memorable is to pick a date that you know will set you apart. Instead of going to dinner and a movie, pick something that will make you stand out compared to other dates you've been on. Ask your date to an art show, or invite them to a painting class. Ask them to go to an arcade. If you're into music, invite your date to a record store to talk about music and your favorite bands. Make a picnic and spend time feeding ducks in the park. Reader Poll: We asked 2380 wikiHow readers about which first date they’d like to go on the most, and only 8% said going rock climbing . [Take Poll] So, suggesting a casual but unique activity, like seeing a show, might be more fun for your date."
