      "content": "Click Create a Blend. It should be at the very top of your screen. This is also where any previously created Blends will show up. Since the feature is currently in beta, some users report that they do not have the option to create a Blend. If this is the case, try updating your Spotify app. If the option still does not appear, you may have to wait to take advantage of Blends."

      "title": "Send an invite to a friend.",
      "content": "Send an invite to a friend. The Create a Blend landing page includes an Invite button. Tap it to receive a unique link that you can send to someone else. Spotify Blends only work between two users, so you cannot send the link to a group chat or post it on social media in hopes of creating a mega-playlist. Each Blend link is single-use, so you will need to send a new link to each individual person with whom you want to create a Blend."

      "title": "Tell your friend to join your Blend.",
      "content": "Tell your friend to join your Blend. Once you send your link to a friend, all they have to do is click the link to accept your invite. Spotify will then generate a playlist combining both of your musical interests. Spotify Blends include songs that you already know and love, as well as suggestions based on your listening preferences."

    {
      "title": "Explore your new Spotify Blend!",
      "content": "Explore your new Spotify Blend! Each Blend you create will remain listed at the top of your Made for You page, so you can revisit the playlists anytime. As you scroll through the curated playlist, you may notice both your profile picture and that of your friend next to each song. Spotify tracks how each user influences the playlist. If both of your icons are next to a track, it must be a perfect match! Spotify Blends are not static. They evolve over time to reflect how you and your friend’s listening habits may change."

      "content": "Do it again! Feel free to create as many Spotify Blends as you would like. They are a great way to discover new music, and determine what kind of musical interests you and your friends may have in common! Anyone can accept a Spotify Blend invitation, even if they are not able to send one themselves. Users with Spotify Premium or Spotify Free accounts can both participate."
