      "content": "Work outside or in a ventilated area. Bleach fumes can be a little overwhelming, especially if you are working indoors in close proximity. Either find a place to set up your items outside or open up all the doors and windows you can to keep your lungs safe. [1] X Research source If your room doesn’t have a lot of doors or windows to open, set up a large fan to blow away the fumes."

      "title": "Choose a black, 100% cotton sweatshirt.",
      "content": "Choose a black, 100% cotton sweatshirt. Bleach shows up best on dark fabric that is made of mostly, if not all, cotton. Read the label on your sweatshirt to see what it is made out of and avoid fabrics like spandex and nylon. [2] X Research source Bleach can also damage more delicate fabrics like silk or satin. If you don’t want to use a black sweatshirt, you can dye a dark navy or dark gray one instead."

      "content": "Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands. Bleach is a harsh chemical that can cause skin irritation even when it is diluted. Protect your hands with rubber kitchen gloves and try to avoid getting bleach on your skin as much as possible. [3] X Research source You can find rubber kitchen gloves at most home goods stores."

      "content": "Spread out a drop cloth or newspapers to protect your surface. Bleach will discolor most surfaces that it touches, so it is important to keep it contained as you work. Lay down an old towel, a drop cloth, or some newspaper to protect your work surface. [4] X Research source You may want to wear old clothes that you don’t care about in case you get some bleach on them while you work."

      "content": "Scrunch the entire sweatshirt up towards the middle for a traditional design. Grab the outermost parts of your sweatshirt one at a time, including each arm, the hood, and the pocket area. Scrunch them in towards the center of your sweatshirt so that it forms a loose ball and attach 3 to 4 rubber bands around your sweatshirt to keep it in place. [6] X Research source Your scrunching doesn’t have to look perfect, since random folds will create an interesting pattern."

      "content": "Roll your sweatshirt from the bottom up for a striped pattern. Fold the arms of your sweatshirt in on top of the middle. Grab the very bottom of your sweatshirt and roll it upwards on top of itself to create a tight sausage roll. Attach 5 to 6 rubber bands around the entire sweatshirt to secure it in place. [7] X Research source This design has more bleach on the bottom and less on the top for a nice gradient effect."

      "content": "Put rubber bands around the middle of your sweatshirt for a bullseye. Pinch the middle of your sweatshirt upwards and attach 1 rubber band around it so that it sticks up. Keep adding rubber bands to your sweatshirt downwards until the entire sweatshirt is in 1 straight line with the middle portion at the very top. Space your rubber bands out about 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart to leave room for the bleach. [8] X Research source This will create a bullseye design across the torso of your sweatshirt."

      "content": "Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of bleach with 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a spray bottle. Find an empty spray bottle that has not been used to hold chemicals before. Fill it with water and bleach and shake it slightly to mix up your ingredients. [9] X Research source Certain chemicals like ammonia can react with bleach and create dangerous fumes. Always use a clean spray bottle to avoid any safety issues."
