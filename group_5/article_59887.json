Since this is a plain text file, you can edit it with your preferred text editor (like Nano or Vim) to create any custom welcome banner you wish. [1] X Research source Use sudo to edit the file. For example, sudo vim /etc/issue.net . /etc/issue.net is only shown to remote users. If you want the pre-login welcome message to be displayed to local users as well, edit /etc/issue instead, and delete (or rename) /etc/issue.net By default, the file displays the current version of Ubuntu."

If not, scroll to the bottom of the file and create a new line beginning with the word \"Banner,\" followed by the path to /etc/issue.net. The new line (or uncommented Banner line) should look like this: Banner /etc/issue.net"

      "content": "Navigate to /etc/update-motd.d. To customize the banner that appears to remote users after they log in to your Ubuntu server, you'll need to edit the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d. Instead of using a single file, MOTD (Message of the Day) concatenates banner fragments from a series of scripts in this directory. [2] X Research source You can edit the existing scripts and create your own to appear along with them. Use ls in /etc/update-motd.d to see the names of the scripts—notice that all begin with two numbers (00, 10, etc.). The number preceding each script's name determines the order in which it appears in the banner. For example, 00-header is the first part of the banner, and all subsequent numbers appear after it in order. To see your current MOTD banner, use the command run-parts . to run all scripts in the directory."

By default, you'll find 00-header, 10-help-text, 50-motd-news, 91-contract-ua-esm-status, 91-release-upgrade, and 92-unattended-upgrade, all of which are combined into a single banner message in that order. Other packages may also add their own scripts. You can edit these scripts individually by opening a script in your text editor with sudo. Unlike the welcome message you can create in /etc/issue.net that appears before login, these files must be shell scripts —not plain text files."

For example, if you want your new addition to appear just beneath the header, you might call it 01-my_custom_msg . Remember, this must be a shell script, not plain text. After creating your script, make it executable so it can run . Use chmod +x <filename> to do so. To remove a script from the banner, make it non-executable ."

In our example, we'd actually need to escape all backslashes (\\) and pipes (|) in the art by placing a backslash before each. But don't worry—the added slashes won't appear in your banner."
