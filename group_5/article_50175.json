      "content": "Wear comfortable clothing. You're at a rave to have fun... not to show off your body, to get a person's number, or to flirt. Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in and what you can move freely without getting caught on things or other people. Once you get accustomed to space, it will be a little easier to make your wardrobe more eccentric."

Trade some with others if you decide to make your own. [4] X Research source Be cautious that loose kandi may fling off from your arm while dancing. Some ravers don't like kandi ravers because of the associated stereotype of immaturity. There are different groups of people in the rave scene that subscribe to different styles of raving, most of them defined by different styles of music, dance, or fashion."
