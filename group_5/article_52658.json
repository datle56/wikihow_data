      "content": "Go with a retractable fabric awning if you want flexibility. You can extend a retractable awning whenever you want to cover your balcony from rain or sunlight and then retract it when you want an open-air balcony. Awning fabrics come in a variety of colors, so you'll be able to find one that matches the color of your home's exterior. [1] X Research source Awnings are made of acrylic-coated synthetic fabrics and are 100 percent waterproof and mildew-proof. [2] X Research source A retractable fabric awning will be great at shielding your balcony from rain and sunshine, but may not be able to withstand high winds."

      "content": "Opt for a lean-to structure if you want a permanent yet affordable cover. You can find light roof structures made of either PVC sheets or fabric. If you choose to cover your balcony with a lean-to type structure, you won't be able to cover and then uncover it on a day-by-day basis, as you can with a retractable awning. Compared to full-roof covers, however, they're relatively cheap and easy to remove if you ever decide to change your balcony's design. [3] X Research source Select a lean-to made of PVC sheets if you'd like a cover that will allow sunlight to reach your balcony. Choose a fabric-covered lean-to if you're looking for a more affordable option."

      "content": "Select a full-roof cover to give your balcony an indoor feel. A full-roof cover is the most expensive option. You'll need to pay for the materials of the cover and professional installation. A full-roof cover, however, is more durable than the other 2 options. [4] X Research source A tempered-glass roof is an especially popular choice. With a tempered-glass roof, you can choose between clear glass and tinted. Tinted glass can help shield your balcony from harmful UV rays, but clear glass will preserve your balcony's view. You can also find full balcony covers that you can retract and extend with a remote control. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Shield your balcony from strong rains with transparent PVC blinds. Transparent, outdoor PVC blinds will keep your balcony completely dry even during torrential rainfalls, while still allowing sunlight to pass through and brighten your outdoor space. Scratch-resistant, these blinds are perfect for areas that frequently experience strong winds. [6] X Research source PVC stands for Polyvinyl chloride (or vinyl). Transparent PVC blinds look like sheets of plastic."

      "content": "Enhance your balcony's design with PVC imitation-wood blinds. If you'd like to shield your balcony from horizontal slats of rain but don't like the look of transparent PVC blinds, you might want to check out PVC imitation-wood blinds. These blinds look like they're made of natural wood but are more durable and waterproof than the real thing. [7] X Research source Imitation-wood blinds shield light as well as rain, which will help keep your balcony cool but may also make it darker than you want. Go with imitation-bamboo blinds if you want to give your balcony a tropical look."

Fabric blinds come in a variety of colors so you can choose one that complements the color of your home's exterior."
