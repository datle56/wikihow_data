      "content": "Offer your child verbal and emotional support. A child may feel scared or ashamed about what happened, and pressing them for details may traumatize them. Allow them to share as they wish and do not pressure them. They may be very reluctant to open up about any type of sexual abuse. When your child suggests possible abuse, be open to listening and responding with care. [1] X Research source Listen attentively to what your child is saying. They are unlikely to directly state abuse. Give them time to talk about what is bothering them. Acknowledge their feelings of being hurt and feeling guilty. When your child talks with you about abuse, communicate with understanding and care. Consider responding by saying, \"I'm sorry about what happened. I'm glad that it's ending. It's not your fault that it happened. I am here for you.\" Make sure that you do not respond with doubt or disbelief no matter what. This can add to your child’s trauma. Make sure to stay calm when you are around your child and express feelings of anger around other adults only. Expressing extreme emotions around the child may upset them further."

      "content": "Provide a safe and supportive environment for your child. Establish a family safety plan to address boundaries, open up communication, and educate all your children in the family. Create a home and school environment that supports your children's sense of safety and resilience. [4] X Research source Discuss with your family about concerns about sexualized behaviors. Teach them it's okay to talk about their feelings if they feel upset or worried about any sexualized behaviors. Provide education to your children about what is sexual abuse, both touching and non-touching forms. Teach children to understand their different body parts. Discuss boundaries of touching, particularly for young children, who need to understand that no one has a right to touch their private parts (except for medical care) and they do not have rights to touch anyone else's. Establish ground rules for hugging, kissing, and touching among family members. If a child feels uncomfortable around a certain relative or adult, discuss with that adult about boundaries of interacting with your child. Be an advocate for your child. Your child may not feel as comfortable as you about certain types of affection. Keep in mind that your child may begin to behave differently or have fears about things they never had before. It is important to do what you can to help make them feel comfortable. For example, if your child expresses that they are afraid to sleep alone, then let them sleep in your room. If they express to you that they need a hug out of the blue then give them a hug no matter where you are."

Allow them the freedom to talk about what happened. [5] X Research source Tell them that you believe in them. Say things like, \"This must be hard to talk about. I believe you and want to help.\""
