An upper GI tract X-ray helps diagnose symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, chest and abdominal pain, acid reflux, unexplained vomiting, severe indigestion, and blood in the stool.

There are two types of arthrography imaging: indirect and direct. [16] X Research source Indirect arthrography requires contrast material to be injected into the bloodstream. Direct arthrography requires contrast material to be directly injected into the joint. The procedure can be done to look for abnormalities, pain, or discomfort in the different joints in your body. Arthrography may also be done using computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If your doctor orders an arthrography, no special preparation is required – just follow the steps mentioned in the first section. In some cases you may need to fast, but only if you are getting a sedative. An arthrography usually takes about 30 minutes. You will experience a pinprick and may feel burning if an anesthetic is used to numb the joint area. You may also feel pressure or pain when the needle is injected into the joint.
