      "content": "Decide who serves first. This can be determined in many ways––you can flip a coin or you can volley. To volley is just to toss the ball and play it until someone scores if you score then it is your serve, but when you volley the ball has to be hit three times in the match before some scores."
    },
    {
      "title": "Serve",
      "content": "Serve from any side of your table. Hit the ball on your side once and have the ball go over the net to hit their side. In doubles, serve from the right side of your table and have the ball go across to the left side of table. When serving, either every 2 points scored or every 5 points scored, switch serves between teams. When playing doubles, you will usually play up to 21 but you can play up to 15 as well."

      "title": "Alternate between you and your teammate in serving.",
      "content": "Alternate between you and your teammate in serving. When you serve five times or two times whatever is decided, then the other team will serve and when they serve two or five times, then it will be your teammates turn to serve. When serving, if you are person A and you are serving the ball to towards person C on the other side, then when it is person C's turn to serve, she or he has to serve to your teammate person B. When it is person B's turn to serve, she or he has to serve it to the other team person D. So, after your turn to serve is over, then switch spots with your teammate so that he or she returns the serve to the person that was just returning your serve."

      "content": "Alternate. When hitting the ball, you and your teammate have to alternate hits. If you return the serve when the other team returns the hit, then your teammate has to return that hit. Therefore, you can't hit the ball twice in a row."

      "content": "Learn the scoring . Every time you score it is worth 1 point If you return the ball but it does not hit the other team's side. it is the other team's point If the ball hits your side twice, it is their point. If a serve does not go over the net, it is the other team's point. If a serve hits the net and goes over, it is a reserve. If anyone hits the ball twice in a row it is automatically the other teams point If you hit your own side trying to return the ball, it is the other team's point. If the game is tied up at the score limit, namely it is 15-15, you keep playing until one team has a lead of two points and that team wins by 2. If you touch the table or you move the table, the other team gets a point."
