[1] X Research source Be aware of the risks of breeding guinea pigs and consider if this is the right decision for your animal and for you. Never breed guinea pigs for fun. Breeding guinea pigs is risky and can harm or kill your beloved pet. [2] X Research source Guinea pig sows have a high mortality rate associated with pregnancy ketosis, which is a metabolic problem where the sow slowly poisons herself and dies of blood poisoning. The piglets are also large, which can cause problems when giving birth (but toxaemia is the main cause of death). [3] X Research source If you are considering breeding your sow, stick to the breeding age suggestions to help minimize the risk of complications. [4] X Research source If you sow needs a caesarian section because of birth complications, the survival rate is very low. [5] X Research source Unless you have designated homes for pups or animals you don’t want to keep after breeding, don’t breed them. Many people who say they’ll take pups conveniently disappear once they’re born. [6] X Research source"

Ensure that you have sufficient supplies to care for breeding animals and their pups. [7] X Research source You will need enough cage space to house all of the animals. Keep in mind that you will also have to separate males and females to keep them from breeding. [8] X Research source The cage space will require proper bedding and hay, so consider purchasing extra and keeping a reserve for when you clean the guinea pigs’ area. [9] X Research source Also consider purchasing more accessories such as toys or hiding holes for your guinea pigs to enjoy. Make sure you have enough food pellets and water bottles to help keep you guinea pigs healthy. [10] X Research source Allot enough time to properly clean the guinea pig cages on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to help keep your pigs healthy. [11] X Research source"

Choosing the right guinea pigs can help ensure their health and continuation of quality breeding stock. [12] X Research source The breeding plan “best to the best” is often employed by professionals when considering mates. This means that only outstanding sows, or female guinea pigs, are bred with outstanding boars, or male guinea pigs. [13] X Research source Where possible, check the parentage of both guinea pigs. There are several hereditary diseases that could affect the guinea pigs and their pups or cause a so-called “lethal,” or a pup with severe deformities. [14] X Research source Ensure that the boar and sow are an appropriate age to breed. [15] X Research source If you are unsure of the sex of your guinea pig, you can check directly above the anus while gently holding the guinea pig on its back. A male will have what appears to be a slit or visible testes. A female will have a skin fold that is in a Y shape above the anus. [16] X Research source"

[18] X Research source The average age for most boars to mate for the first time is 5 months.

Also make sure to wash your hands whenever you touch animals and their feed or bedding. [29] X Research source Do not allow the guinea pigs to interact during the quarantine.
