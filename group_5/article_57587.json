      "title": "Select a bag for your emergency supplies.",
      "content": "Select a bag for your emergency supplies. Choose a bag that’s large enough to fit all your supplies, and preferably something that has a strap or handles for easy transportation. You’ll probably be bringing this kit with you everywhere, so make sure the bag is comfortable to carry and suitable to your taste. Consider a bag with a few separate compartments and pockets to make it easier to organize your kit. A small backpack, a large makeup case, purse, or tote bag would all work well for your emergency kit."

      "title": "Have emergency money ready.",
      "content": "Have emergency money ready. No matter where you go, who you’re with, or what you’re doing, you should always have at least $10 to $20 in emergency money on you at all times, as well as some change. On top of having some money in your wallet, keep extra emergency money in your kit, preferably in a secure or secret zippered pocket. Change can be used at a payphone in case your cell phone dies, for an emergency snack from the vending machine, or to buy a pad or tampon from the bathroom dispenser. Even just $10 can be enough to get you out of a jam, whether you need a meal, cab fare, or anything else."

      "title": "Compile a list of your medications and allergies.",
      "content": "Compile a list of your medications and allergies. Make a list of all the medications you take on a daily basis and write down your known allergies. This is in case there is a medical emergency and a doctor or nurse needs this information. Keep a copy of the list in your emergency kit. Update this copy whenever needed."

      "title": "Assemble the medications you need throughout the day.",
      "content": "Assemble the medications you need throughout the day. Keep the medications together in a separate case or pocket.

    {
      "title": "Pack emergency period products.",
      "content": "Pack emergency period products. Always have enough supplies on you for at least a few hours of protection. Pack whatever product you prefer, such as pads, liners, tampons, or a menstrual cup. Consider keeping an extra pair of underwear on you as well. These supplies are just as important even if your period hasn’t started yet. Instead of being caught off guard, you’ll be ready if it comes when you aren’t home."

      "title": "Select a larger bag.",
      "content": "Select a larger bag. To be prepared for a larger emergency or disaster, you’ll need a larger bag than you did for your everyday kit. This is the type of thing you can keep in your locker or ready to go in your closet at home. You can even have two or three of these lying around, such as one at school and one at home. Don’t forget to keep emergency money in your ready-for-anything emergency kit as well as your everyday kit."

      "title": "Pick out smaller cases to organize your kit.",
      "content": "Pick out smaller cases to organize your kit. Even if your emergency kit bag has pockets and compartments, it’s still a good idea to organize the contents of your kit to make everything easier to find. After all, the last thing you need during an emergency is the added stress of not being able to find something you need! Makeup cases will work well for organizing your kit. Consider color coding your individual cases based on their contents. For instance, you could keep medical supplies in a reddish colored container because of the association with the Red Cross. Opt for cases that have zippers so that you can keep your kit neat, tidy, and separated. You will probably need between four and seven smaller cases, depending on how you want to organize your kit. It’s also a good idea to have a hard-shell case for sewing items."

[6] X Research source You can also include a mini stain remover to treat spills and stains. Keep these items in a hard-shell case so you don’t stab or prick yourself with pins and scissors."

Throw in a few paper clips too, which in a pinch can serve hundreds of purposes, such as a: Makeshift hair barrette Bra strap holder Zipper pull."

      "content": "Locate a second phone charger. Having a mobile phone can be a lifesaver in an emergency, but only if it has enough battery life to connect you to the outside world. A spare phone charger for your emergency kit is a worthwhile investment that means you’ll always be able to reach people if you’re in need. Ask friends or family if they have compatible chargers lying around from old phones they don’t use any more."
