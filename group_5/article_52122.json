Once your mattress is bare, vacuum over the entire surface with a handheld vacuum or the upholstery attachment of a regular vacuum. Pay special attention to the crevices, seams, and folds in the mattress, as dirt and dust may be hidden in these places.

Use a commercial enzyme cleaner or make your own cleaning solution by mixing 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) mild dish detergent and 1 cup (240 ml) water in a spray bottle. Apply the spot cleaner to any stains you see on the surface of the mattress, then dab the areas with a wet cloth until the stain lifts. [9] X Research source For sweat, urine , and blood stains, it’s usually best to use a store-bought enzyme cleaner, but the homemade cleaning solution will also work. Stains like red wine or coffee tend to be more difficult to remove and may require a stronger spot cleaner. For these situations, try mixing equal parts cold water and hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle. [10] X Research source"
