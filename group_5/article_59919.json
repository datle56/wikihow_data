      "content": "Connect your printer to your home network. The process for this will vary from printer to printer. If you are connecting your printer via Ethernet, connect the Ethernet port on the printer to an open port on your router or network switch. This is typically all you'll need to do for an Ethernet printer. If you are connecting a wireless printer, you'll need to use the printer's display screen to connect to your wireless network. You'll need to select your wireless SSID (network name) and enter the password if it is secured. The exact process will vary depending on the printer, so refer to your documentation for exact instructions. If you don't know which method of connecting your printer uses (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), the manual should state this. If you don't have a home network to connect your printer to, you'll need to skip to the method that covers connecting your printer to another computer and sharing it."
