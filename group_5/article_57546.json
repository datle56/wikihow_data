      "content": "Line the insides of two toilet paper tubes with aluminum foil. Use a pen or ruler to help unroll the foil inside of the tube. Leave an inch of excess foil on the lip of the tube. Fold it over the lip to secure the foil. [1] X Research source Aluminum is known as a neurotoxicant, meaning it can cause negative effects to the brain. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some studies suggest that high exposure to aluminum may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. [3] X Research source Use with caution."

      "content": "Cinch an oven bag over the funnel and secure it with twist ties. Fix the open mouth of an oven or turkey bag over the large end of the funnel. Secure the bag to the tube with a twist tie . Then, fold the edges of the bag over the tie and secure it again to the tube with another. This helps ensure the bag is snug against the nozzle, so no vapor can escape. [5] X Research source The bag collects the vapor as you heat it. Pass the bag around. Use your thumb, a cloth, or a paper towel to plug the hole when you're not using it."

      "content": "Place the toilet paper tube over the nozzle of a heat gun. Now it's time to assemble the vaporizer! Aim the heat gun straight up in the air, placing the extra toilet paper tube (without the funnel) over the heat nozzle. Fill a tea ball with grounded marijuana, resting atop the toilet paper tube. Fix the tube with the funnel on top. [6] X Research source Opt for a heat gun that can heat between 350°F to 400°F (176°C to 204°C). The ideal target temperature is 375°F (190°C). [7] X Research source To grind your marijuana , simply place a bud in a grinder and twist clockwise. If you don't have a grinder, chop small bits of weed with scissors inside a glass cup."

      "content": "Switch the heat gun to the \"ON\" position. Watch the bag slowly inflate with vapor. It may not be easy to see, but trust that it's there. When the bag fully inflates, switch the heat gun to the off position. Lift the tube with the funnel quickly and inhale the vapor through the bottom end. Take turns inhaling until there's no more vapor in the oven bag. [8] X Research source When using a heat gun, never touch the hot metal nozzle or vape while it's on. Allow it to cool for a few seconds before using it to limit the risk of injury or burns. [9] X Research source"

Set the tea candle in the middle of the box to prevent any fires. [10] X Research source Use larger candles if you have a large box."

It helps to keep the flame low enough not to scorch the tin too badly. [11] X Research source You can use any heat-resistant tray or even the top lid of a candle."

Inhale as if you were using a bong or smoking a joint. [13] X Research source Use your thumb to cover the tube as you pass it around or between hits to avoid wasting the vapor. Smoking is harmful to lung health, regardless of whether you're burning wood for a fire or smoking tobacco or marijuana. Smoking may cause chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, and more.

It may help to use an utility knife to create two big \"X\" slits on the cap. Slide a straw through one slit. This is what you'll use to smoke out of. Ensure the hole is airtight; if not, roll some tight around the sides of the straw. [15] X Research source"

You'll use this to attach to the light bulb, acting as the vaporization chamber. [16] X Research source If you're concerned about BPA-related issues with smoking out of plastic, you can substitute any non-plastic tube into the bulb that fits. The stem of a small metal flashlight might work nicely."

      "content": "Use a serrated saw blade to cut off the base of a lightbulb. Wrap the lightbulb in a clean towel; be careful not to squeeze too tightly to avoid breaking it. The towel will act as a protective barrier against glass injury. Cut the glass slowly where the glass meets the metal, and rotate the bulb as you cut through. [17] X Research source You may need to pull the rest of the metal off with pliers. Extract the filament and interior components of the lightbulb so the glass chamber is empty. Opt for clean, clear glass lightbulbs and change them out regularly. For instance, compact fluorescent light bulbs contain a small amount of mercury, which can be highly toxic.

Carefully pour grounded marijuana into the bottle opening before screwing the cap on. Ensure all the contact points are well sealed. Add more tape as necessary.

Use your finger to block vapor from escaping through the open hole. Rotate the bulb to avoid scorching the weed. Look for a misty haze to form inside the bulb before uncovering the hole to inhale.
