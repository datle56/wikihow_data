      "content": "Use a hole punch to make 2 holes in 2 small paper cups. Punch 2 holes in each cup. Make the holes close to the rim of the cups and on opposite sides. [1] X Research source If you don’t have paper cups, make the buckets for your balance scale with plastic cups instead. For a sturdier hold, punch out 2 additional holes on the opposite sides of the cup so you have 4 holes total on each cup."

      "content": "Cut 2 pieces of twine that are each around 1 foot (30 cm) long. Any kind of twine will work, but a thick, strong twine will make the balance scale more durable. After you cut the twine pieces, lay them next to each other to make sure they’re the same length. If they're not, cut them with scissors to adjust their lengths. [2] X Research source If you made 4 holes in your cups, cut out 8 pieces of twine."

      "title": "Tie the ends of the twine through the holes in the cups.",
      "content": "Tie the ends of the twine through the holes in the cups. Use 1 piece of twine per cup. Pull one end of the twine through one of the holes and tie it in a knot around the lip of the cup. Then, loop the other end of the twine through the other hole and tie it in a knot. When you’re finished, the twine pieces should form thin handles on the cups, like the cups are little buckets. [3] X Research source If you made 4 holes in your cups, loop 1 piece of twine through each hole and tie the end to the cup. You should have 4 pieces of dangling twine for each cup."

      "content": "Find a notched clothes hanger. A plastic, metal, or wooden hanger works well, as long as it has a notch on both sides of the hook. Otherwise, the paper buckets might slip and fall right off the scale. If you don’t have a notched clothes hanger, simply use some more twine to tie the handles on the paper buckets to the bottom of a regular clothes hanger so they don’t fall off. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Hang the buckets on the clothes hanger using the twine handles. Hang the cups on opposite sides of the clothes hangers in the notches. When you're finished, lift up the scale and hold it by the top to examine the buckets. Both buckets should be hanging at the same level — if one is higher than the other, you'll need to adjust the twine handles. [5] X Research source If you made 4 holes in your cups, tie the ends of each string in a knot at either end of the hanger."

      "content": "Let your kids decorate the buckets on their new balance scale. Get out stickers, markers, and crayons and let your kids personalize the scale. They'll enjoy playing and learning with it more if they get to add their own personal touch. One way to decorate the scale is to help your kids write their names on it. Don't attach anything too heavy to the buckets or it could interfere with how the scale works."

      "content": "Hang your balance scale on a doorknob. Doorknobs are great to hang balance scales from because they’re low enough for kids to reach them. If you can’t find a doorknob to use, look for any kind of handle or bar you can hook the clothes hanger onto. [6] X Research source For instance, hang the scale on the back of a chair, a coat rack, or a shower rod. If you can’t hang the balance scale anywhere low enough for your kids, make the twine pieces longer so they can still reach the buckets."

Some fun objects you could try weighing are: Your kids’ favorite small toys. Different rocks that your kids find outside. Small fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and grapes."

When the object in 1 cup weighs more than the object in the other cup, the heavier cup will sink and tip the scale. Explain to your kids that the lower bucket has the heavier object, and the higher bucket has the lighter object. [7] X Research source"
