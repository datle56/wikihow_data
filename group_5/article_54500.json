      "title": "The speaker cone is the main part of a speaker.",
      "content": "The speaker cone is the main part of a speaker. This is the main active area that transforms vibrations from the speaker’s voice coil into audible sounds. If the speaker cone is damaged, it won’t be able to reproduce those vibrations without sound distortion. [1] X Research source Most minor tears and holes in speaker cones can be repaired with a thin, white glue mixture. Extensive damage may require re-coning, which is a complete cone replacement better suited for a professional."

      "title": "The surround is the foam protecting the speaker.",
      "content": "The surround is the foam protecting the speaker. This is what connects the cone to the housing of the speaker. It’s often the first component to become damaged since it endures a lot of mechanical stress. If the surround is damaged, you will need to replace it. Surrounds are available in many common sizes. Be sure to measure your speaker before purchasing any replacement parts."

      "title": "The voice coil allows sound to vibrate against the cone.",
      "content": "The voice coil allows sound to vibrate against the cone. Without a properly working voice coil, your speaker will not be able to produce the sounds it needs to. Voice coils can overheat and melt. In this case, you will need to replace the voice coil entirely."

      "title": "Turn on the speaker.",
      "content": "Turn on the speaker. Make sure all power sources are connected and all cables are secure. For car speakers, make sure your car stereo display is active. Flickering car displays can indicate a problem with the power, faulty wiring, or loose connectors within the unit. For handheld speakers, make sure the device is fully charged and the light indicator is on."

      "title": "Test the sound.",
      "content": "Test the sound. Play a song or video to check the audio. Avoid playing the radio since the natural static may interfere with your test. Play a familiar song that has a broad range of sound. This will help you determine which part of your speaker needs attention. [2] X Research source Listen once at medium volume, then again at a higher volume. Avoid testing in areas with excessive noise. This may affect your sound test."

This should be done if you don’t have the necessary tools for the job or if you think you may damage the speaker further by trying. Car stereos and systems will experience wear and tear over time. Take your car stereo to a car audio specialist. For Bluetooth speakers, the replacement parts may end up costing more than the speaker itself. In this case, it may be better for you to shop for new speakers ."

Avoid making the adhesive layer too thick since this could impact its pliability. A 1:1 ratio of white glue to water works great. This makes the glue more pliable. You can also use Flex Seal to repair the tears. Use a paintbrush or a steady hand to apply the glue over the damage. Apply the glue to the front and back side of the tear.
