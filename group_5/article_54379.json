This information is often missing on certificates from before the 1930s, or from cities with fewer than 100,000 people. In the United Kingdom, times of birth are only recorded for multiple births (twins etc.), or in some Scottish hospitals.

If you believe that astrology can predict your future based on your birth date and time, you might have already constructed a star chart or hired someone to do so. If your birth time is based on your mother's memory, if it was rounded to the nearest hour on your birth certificate, or if you have no idea what it is, your star chart may be based on incorrect information. These online calculators below will tell you how likely it is that a given type of star chart, or part of a star chart, is accurate. Enter the number of hours you think your birth time guess could be off by, such as \"3\" if you only know the general time of day, or \"12\" if you do not know your birth time. If there is a high chance of your star chart matching the predictions anyway, you may want to skip the arduous process below.

Look at remaining events, and see whether they are concentrated when celestial bodies arrive at specific degrees.

Compare recent outer planet (Jupiter through Pluto ) transits to recent life events, to see which house appears to influence you. [7] X Research source"
