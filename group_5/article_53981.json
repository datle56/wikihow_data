      "content": "Decide what the uranium will be used for. Most mined uranium contains only about 0.7 percent 235 U, with most of the rest being the comparatively stable isotope 238 U. [3] X Research source What type of fission reaction the uranium will be used for determines what the level of 235 U must be raised to for the uranium to be used effectively. Uranium used in most nuclear power plants needs to be enriched to a level of 3 to 5 percent 235 U. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source (A few nuclear reactors, such as the CANDU reactor in Canada and the Magnox reactor in the United Kingdom, are designed to use unenriched uranium.) Uranium used for atomic bombs and warheads, in contrast, needs to be enriched to 90 percent 235 U."

      "title": "Convert the uranium ore to a gas.",
      "content": "Convert the uranium ore to a gas. Most of the methods currently in existence for enriching uranium require the ore to be converted to a low-temperature gas. Fluorine gas is normally pumped into an ore conversion plant; the uranium oxide gas reacts with the fluorine to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF 6 ). The gas is then acted on to separate out and gather the 235 U isotope."

Of these, gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge are the two most common, but the laser isotope separation process is expected to replace them. [6] X Research source"

Uranium dioxide used as fuel in nuclear reactors is made into centered ceramic pellets encased in metal tubes to make 4m (13.12-foot) long rods"

      "content": "Force the gas through a porous filter or membrane. Because the 235 U isotope is lighter than the 238 U isotope, UF 6 containing the lighter isotope will diffuse through the membrane faster than the heavier isotope."

      "content": "Repeat the diffusion process until enough 235 U is collected. The repeated diffusion is called a cascade. It may take as many as 1,400 passes through porous membranes to get enough 235 U to enrich the uranium sufficiently."

      "title": "Condense the UF6 gas into liquid form.",
      "content": "Condense the UF 6 gas into liquid form. Once the gas is sufficiently enriched, it is condensed into a liquid and then stored in containers, where it cools and solidifies for transport to be made into fuel pellets. Because of the number of passes required, this process is energy-intensive and is being phased out. In the United States, only one gaseous diffusion enrichment plant remains, located in Paducah, Kentucky. [7] X Research source"

The 235 U-rich gases are sent to a centrifuge where still more 235 U is extracted, while the 235 U-depleted gas goes to a different centrifuge to extract still more of the remaining 235 U. This enables the centrifuge process to extract much more 235 U than the gaseous diffusion process can. [8] X Research source The gas centrifuge process was first developed in the 1940s, but was not brought into significant use until the 1960s, when its lower energy requirements for producing enriched uranium became important. At present, a gas centrifuge processing plant exists in the United States in Eunice, New Mexico. [9] X Research source In contrast, Russia currently has four such plants, Japan and China have two each, while the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany each have one."

The gas is blown into the cylinders in such a way that it is induced to spin in cyclonic fashion, producing the same kind of separation between 235 U and 238 U as is achieved in a rotating centrifuge. One method being developed in South Africa injects the gas into the cylinder on a tangent. It is presently being tested with light isotopes such as those in silicon."

This process was investigated in 1940 as part of the Manhattan Project, but was abandoned while still in an early stage of development when the more efficient gaseous diffusion process was developed.

These ions can be isolated to enrich uranium. This method was used to process uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 and was also the enrichment method Iraq used in its nuclear weapons program of 1992. It requires 10 times more energy than gaseous diffusion, making it impractical for large-scale enrichment programs."
