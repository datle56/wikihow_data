      "content": "Use a fork if you are at a restaurant or fancy social gathering. Use a small fork to gently spear the shrimp while it is on the serving dish. If the shrimp is arranged over the side of a bowl like it is commonly served, you may need to support one side of the bowl with your other hand while you get the shrimp. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick the shrimp up with your fingers if you are in a laid-back setting. If etiquette or manners aren’t an issue, it’s okay to use your fingers to grab a hold of the shrimp. For health reasons, just make sure your hands are clean if you are using them to eat with."

      "title": "Dip the shrimp in sauce if you want to add extra flavor.",
      "content": "Dip the shrimp in sauce if you want to add extra flavor. Cocktail sauce is traditionally served with cocktail shrimp. It is a tomato base (similar to ketchup) mixed with horseradish and can be a little on the spicy side. [2] X Research source Other sauces used for dipping cocktail shrimp include avocado crema, which features avocado and lime; or remoulade, which has mayonnaise, capers, and hot sauce. Some people prefer plain ketchup, ranch, or lemon juice."

      "title": "Eat the shrimp in one bite if it is small enough.",
      "content": "Eat the shrimp in one bite if it is small enough. Cocktail shrimp are usually served already cleaned and peeled, so there shouldn’t be any extra work required. Simply pop the whole shrimp in your mouth. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut the shrimp in half it if is too large to eat in one bite.",
      "content": "Cut the shrimp in half it if is too large to eat in one bite. Spear the shrimp with your fork and place it on your plate. Hold it in place with your fork, and use a knife to saw the shrimp in half. You can then dip each half into some sauce if desired. [4] X Research source If you are in a casual setting and eating a large shrimp with your fingers, you can either bite the shrimp in half or just take it as one large bite."

    {
      "title": "Remove the shrimp head if it is still intact and you don’t want to eat it.",
      "content": "Remove the shrimp head if it is still intact and you don’t want to eat it. Use one hand to hold the shrimp in place on your plate with a fork. Take a spoon in your other hand and use it to cut just below the bottom of the head. Put the heads onto a separate plate or receptacle if one has been provided. You can also ask someone else if they want your heads—some people like to eat them. If you want to use your hands to remove the head, which is quite messier, hold the body of the shrimp in one hand and use your fingers on your other hand to pinch the head of the shrimp. Snap the head off of the body by pulling your hands in opposite directions. It is a good idea to remove all of the shrimp heads at once so that you get the messy part out of the way."

    {
      "title": "Peel the shrimp with your hands if it hasn’t been peeled prior to serving.",
      "content": "Peel the shrimp with your hands if it hasn’t been peeled prior to serving. Some shrimp dishes are served with the shell still intact. To remove the shell, hold the shrimp in one hand and use your thumbnail on the opposite hand to slide it under the shell near the top of the shrimp. As the shell begins to lift, gently wiggle your thumb back and forth to work the shell free. [5] X Research source The shell may not peel off in one large piece. It will probably peel off in smaller pieces, and that’s okay. Discard the shell onto a separate plate or receptacle that should be provided."

      "title": "Pull the shrimp out of the tail with your teeth if you are eating it by hand.",
      "content": "Pull the shrimp out of the tail with your teeth if you are eating it by hand. Once the shrimp has been de-shelled (or if it was served that way) put the whole body of the shrimp in your mouth. Use your fingers to gently squeeze the bottom of the tail as you slide the shrimp out with your teeth. Put the empty tail onto a separate plate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use utensils to remove the shell and tail if you are in a fancier setting.",
      "content": "Use utensils to remove the shell and tail if you are in a fancier setting. Pierce through the back of the shrimp with a fork to hold it in place on your plate. Hold a spoon upside down and gently slide it underneath the shell near the top of the shrimp. After the shell begins to loosen, use the spoon to apply pressure to the tail end. Do not cut through the tail. [6] X Research source Still applying pressure to the tail, use the spoon to slide the tail away from the body. This should remove the entire shell and tail from the shrimp."

      "title": "Protect others if you are squeezing lemon over your shrimp.",
      "content": "Protect others if you are squeezing lemon over your shrimp. No one wants to get shot in the eye with lemon juice! To prevent this, use your opposite hand to cover the lemon wedge while you squeeze. [7] X Research source Any stray squirts will get on your hand instead and you can just wipe it off with a napkin. Alternatively, hold a spoon in front of the wedge to block it from squirting others. You will get less coverage, but it looks nicer."

      "title": "Spoon sauce onto your plate if you are sharing the sauce with others.",
      "content": "Spoon sauce onto your plate if you are sharing the sauce with others. This is just good manners. You’ll then dip your shrimp into your own private dollop of sauce. You may also skip the dipping by spooning the sauce directly over the top of your shrimp. [8] X Research source If the sauce is served in an individual bowl, feel free to dip away."
