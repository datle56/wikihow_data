Read the instructions that come with your keyboard so you know what all of the keys do and what shortcuts may be useful to you. [1] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. Once you understand what all of the keys do, try to create a visual layout of the keyboard in your mind that you can call upon when you’re typing. Many keyboards are equipped with time-saving keys that provide shortcuts for common commands or keystrokes. Be sure to read up on your keyboard's shortcuts to help increase your speed.

      "content": "Arrange your fingers properly. The most important step to improving your typing speed is ensuring that you place your fingers correctly on the keyboard. Rest the index finger of your left hand on the “F” key and the index finger of your right hand on the “J” key. These two keys usually have slight bumps on their surface, so you can feel for them without actually looking at the keyboard. The other three fingers on your left hand should rest on the “A,” “S,” and “D” keys, while the other three fingers on your right hand should rest on the “K,” “L,” and “;” keys. Place your thumbs on the space bar. The row with the “A,” “S,” “D,” “F,” “J,” “K,” “L,” and “;” keys is known as the home run because it’s the row that your fingers always start at and return to while you’re typing. When you arrange your fingers on the keyboard, curve them slightly, but keep your hands relaxed. Make sure that your keyboard is centered directly in front of your body."

      "content": "Use the proper fingers to strike the other keys. When you’re typing, you will hit all of the keys on your keyboard from the home position. That means certain fingers are designated to strike certain keys for the most efficient typing. In most cases, you’ll use the same fingers from the home row to hit the keys that line up in the rows above and below. [2] X Research source Strike the “1,” “2,” “Q,” and “Z” keys, in addition to the “A” key, with your left pinky. Strike the “3,” “W”, and “X” keys, in addition to the “S” key, with your left ring finger. Strike the “4,” “E”, and “C” keys, in addition to the “D” key, with your left middle finger. Strike the “5,” “6,” “R,” “T,” “G,” “V,” and “B” keys, in addition to the “F” key, with your left index finger. Strike the “7,” “Y,” “U,” “H,” “N,” and “M” keys, in addition to the “J” key, with your right index finger. Strike the “8,” “I,” and “,” keys, in addition to the “K” with your right middle finger. Strike the “9,” “O,” and “.” keys, in addition to the “L” key, with your right ring finger. Strike the “0,” “-,” “=,” “P,” “[,” “],” “‘,” and “/” keys, in addition to the “;” key, with your right pinky. Hit the “Shift” key with the pinky on the opposite hand from the finger that you’re using to strike the other key. Hit the spacebar with whichever thumb feels most comfortable to you."

      "content": "Keep your eyes on the screen. Your natural instinct may be to look down at the keyboard as you’re typing. However, looking at the keys actually slows down your typing and increases the chance of errors. As you type, keep your eyes on the screen instead to use the technique known as touch typing . You may see a slight increase in errors when your first start using this method, but you’ll quickly learn the layout of the keyboard and the position of the keys, which will improve your typing speed. [3] X Research source When learning how to type without looking at the keyboard, consider covering your hands with a cloth, piece of paper, or cardboard, so you're unable to see the keys even if you peek. While you should try to keep your gaze on the computer screen as much as possible, it’s okay to cheat occasionally and glance down at the keyboard to ensure that you know where the keys are.

      "content": "Practice regularly. As with most skills, the only way to truly improve your typing speed is to practice on a regular basis. The more that you type, the more comfortable you’ll become with the layout of the keyboard and the proper positioning of your fingers. You'll also develop muscle memory when you're typing common letter combinations, so your typing will become faster and more accurate. [4] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. One of the best ways to practice is to repeatedly type sample passages over and over again. You can find plenty of passages online that are geared toward improving your typing accuracy and speed. When you're practicing, focus on accuracy first. Make sure that you're typing each word correctly and achieving proper spacing and punctuation. Once you feel like your typing has become accurate, you can work on improving your speed. Practice doesn’t just mean taking online typing tests. Writing emails to friends and family and posting on online forums can help sharpen your typing skills and increase your speed."

      "content": "Make sure your back is supported. Setting up an ergonomically correct workstation often starts with supporting your back. When you’re typing, it’s important to choose a chair that provides proper support for your back. The best type of chair is one that features a slightly curved backrest so it helps maintain your normal spine curvature. It also helps to use a chair that has a cushion built in near the bottom of the backrest to provide support for your lower back. [7] X Research source You may prefer reclining slightly in your chair to help take pressure off your back. However, keep in mind that typing in a reclined position may cause shoulder and neck strain. Moving your chair closer to the desk can help alleviate some of that stress. If your chair doesn’t have a built-in cushion for your lower back, you can place a small pillow between your back and the chair for additional support.

      "content": "Relax your neck and shoulders. As you sit in your chair to type, make sure to keep your shoulders and neck relaxed. In most cases, you can accomplish this by sitting back against your chair’s backrest. It will help support your neck and shoulders, so you don’t have to put stress on them to keep them straight. [8] X Research source If you’re not sure that your shoulders are relaxed, breathe in and out slowly. The position that your shoulders naturally fall in as you breathe out is usually relaxed."

You may want to use a chair that has adjustable armrests that make it easy to keep your elbows comfortably at your sides. [9] X Research source You don’t have to use your chair’s armrests if you don’t want to. Just make sure that your elbows remain close to your sides even without the added support."

      "content": "Place your feet flat on the floor. Once you’re settled in your chair, it helps to sit up straight with your feet planted flat on the floor so your lower body is supported. Crossing your legs or folding one underneath you makes it more difficult to maintain proper posture. If you have a chair with an adjustable seat, adjust the height until your feet comfortably reach the floor. If your chair doesn’t have an adjustable seat, you may want to purchase an ergonomic footrest that makes it easier to keep your feet in a flat position."

      "title": "Keep your wrists and palms off the desk.",
      "content": "Keep your wrists and palms off the desk. When you're typing, you'll be able to work more quickly and accurately if you avoid resting your wrists or palms on the desk or other surfaces that your keyboard is on. Keep them elevated, but don't bend them up or down because that may cause discomfort. Instead, keep your wrists in a neutral position, with your thumb in line with your forearm and your wrist slightly bent back so they’re level with the keyboard. Some keyboard and keyboard trays are equipped with wrist pads, but they're not there for you to rest your wrists on as you type. They're only for brief breaks when you're not typing. If you must rest your hand on the wrist pad, try to place your palm on it rather than your wrist. If your chair has adjustable armrests, set them so that your forearms are parallel to the floor and your wrist is in a neutral position."

      "title": "Ensure that your keyboard is at the right height.",
      "content": "Ensure that your keyboard is at the right height. For the most effective typing, your keyboard should be just above lap level, which is lower than most people actually set theirs up. The benefit to placing your keyboard at this height is that it allows you to tilt your arms down so your elbows are in an open, 90-degree angle. You may want to invest in an adjustable keyboard and mouse tray that you can attach to your desk or work surface. That will allow you to position the keyboard at the most comfortable height. If you don't have a keyboard tray, try adjusting your chair's height to make your position more comfortable."

      "content": "Take regular breaks. While practicing is key to improving your typing speed, make sure to take breaks as needed. If you push yourself too hard, you run the risk of wearing yourself out, or even worse, suffering an injury, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. When you start to feel any discomfort in your hands or wrists, stop typing for a little while to give yourself time to rest. [10] X Research source To keep yourself from working too hard, set up a practice schedule by designating a certain amount of time each day to practice your typing. However, build breaks into your schedule to keep yourself fresh. For example, you might decide to type for 30 minutes each day, taking breaks every ten minutes or so."

If you aren’t typing effectively with your current keyboard, you may want to test some ergonomic keyboards to find one that offers more comfort while you’re working. [11] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2019. Keep the size of the keys in mind. The larger they are, the easier it will be to type. That means you may want to look for a keyboard where the keys that you use most often, such as the letters and numbers, are larger than other keys. [12] X Research source A keyboard with concave keys that fit the shape of your fingers is a good option if you're looking to eliminate errors in your typing as you try to increase your speed. It's best to choose a keyboard with keys that have strong tactile feedback, which means they offer enough resistance to alert you that the stroke has registered. The resistance also keeps you from accidentally hitting keys as you're typing, so you can type more quickly."

      "content": "Learn about the different keyboard layouts. Keyboards come in a variety of sizes, each with a different amount of keys. There isn’t a standardization of keyboard sizes, meaning that one company’s “compact” layout may differ from another company’s “compact” form. They are often referred to by a percentage of keys, the number of keys, and a nickname. Here are a few of the most common layouts: [13] X Research source 100% (104-key) Full Sized: Great for individuals that need a full set of keys. This includes a numbers key row and number pad, function keys, and arrow keys. 80% (87-key) Tenkeyless: A more compact layout with everything in 100% except for the Numpad. If you don’t use the Numpad often, this size lets you have more room for your mouse! (If you’re a right-side mouse user). You can always plug in a separate standalone Numpad if you end up needing one. 65% (68-key) Compact: This layout combines the number and function rows into one, similar to many laptop layouts. The action keys are often smaller and in a single column."
