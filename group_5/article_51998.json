      "content": "Gather all the pertinent information. For both in-line and bibliographic citation, you’ll need to know basic information about its creation. Journal Articles: You’ll need to copy down the author’s name, title of the article, name of the journal, volume number, issue number, date of publication, page numbers of the physical copy, and the web address of the journal article. Ebooks: You’ll want to know the author’s name, the title of the book, the publisher, place of publication, year of publication, date accessed, and website where the ebook can be located. On occasion, publishers of physical books will out-source the production of ebooks. If this is the case, a separate publisher will be listed for the ebook version. You’ll need to have information for both publishers."

      "content": "Choose which style you want to use. The most commonly used styles in academic and professional writing are MLA, APA, and Chicago Manual of Style (sometimes also called “Turabian” after the style manual’s editor). Choose the style used by your field, or the style stated as preferred by your profession or workplace. Use MLA if you study literature, arts, or the general humanities. Use APA if you study psychology, education, linguistics, or other social sciences. Journalism and communications often use APA style as well. Use Chicago Manual of Style if you study history, political science, information science, or journalism and communications. Publishing and editing commonly use a form of Chicago style. In certain cases,the publisher may request a specific citation style that is not commonly used in the field, or may refer you to their own “in-house” style guide. Use whatever is appropriate for your writing. [1] X Research source"

Your goal is to tell the reader that the information just presented is taken from another author. It shows the reader that you are well-versed in the existing literature and that you are interested in building off of others’ work.

If the author is mentioned in the statement, just put the page number in the parentheses: According to Spiers, college has become too expensive (48). Otherwise, use a parenthetical with both the name and the page number at the end of the sentence or quotation: Some argue that college has become too expensive (Spiers 48). [4] X Research source If there are two authors, put both last names in parentheses with \"and\" in the middle followed by the page number: Dogs have evolved alongside humans (Draper and Simpson 68). If there are more than two authors, use commas to separate the authors’ last names followed by the page number: Embroidery should be considered a “fine art form” (Kozinsky, King, and Chappell 56). If no author is listed, use the institution’s name: Dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago (Smithsonian 21). If no institution is credited, just start the citation with the title of the piece: According to experts, energy drinks should not be over consumed (“Impact of caffeine consumption” 102). MLA in-line citations should not indicate whether or not your source is in a PDF file. In all of these scenarios, the parenthetical citation goes before the final punctuation of the sentence.

If your document has fixed page numbers, use them.. If there are no page numbers, do not try to give them. You can cite by chapter or section instead. For example, to cite a PDF without page numbers that is divided into sections, you can cite it by section: According to Blankenship, caffeine intake should be limited to 200mg per day (ch. 2). If the PDF or ebook is not divided into any identifiable sections, cite the file as a whole and do not give page numbers: Blankenship’s study on caffeine consumption, “Too Jittery, Joe?” suggests that caffeine intake should be limited to 200mg per day."
