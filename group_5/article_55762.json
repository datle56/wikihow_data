      "content": "As long as you communicate with your partner, there’s no right answer to this. For some couples, having sex every day is the norm. For other couples, once or twice a month might be their sweet spot. [1] X Research source The important part here is to talk with your partner about their preferences and your own preferences. On average, most couples have sex about once a week. If you or your partner is going through something (loss of a loved one, depression, high stress levels, etc.), sex might temporarily take a backseat. Rest assured that once you’re both feeling normal again, your sex life will likely improve. If sex is on the backburner right now, focus on building intimacy in other ways. Cuddle with each other, have deep conversations , and stay connected as a couple. Reader Poll: We asked 311 wikiHow readers how they like to discuss their needs with their partner, and 62% of them agreed that they prefer open and honest communication without judgment. [Take Poll] Remember, your partner wants you to be happy, so don’t be afraid to tell them what you want or need in regards to intimacy."

[4] X Research source While the end of the honeymoon period can sound a little sad, it just means that you and your partner are truly close and connected. Instead of discovering new things about each other, you can now grow and evolve together as a couple."
