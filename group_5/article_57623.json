      "title": "Try to be your best self instead of turning into someone you're not.",
      "content": "Try to be your best self instead of turning into someone you're not. For example, instead of trying to transform into an alpha when it's not your style, play to your strengths while brushing up on your weaknesses. Try to become a better version of the man you already are. Set specific goals if you're working on self-improvement. \"Be more sigma\" is vague. \"I'm going to fight negative self-talk\" or \"I'm going to improve my listening skills\" give you direction. Sometimes, people focus too much on whether a man is dominant. But traits like listening, humility , helpfulness , and emotional intelligence are important for your success in work, romance, and more.

Some far-right online spaces push the idea of a rigid social hierarchy and use it to promote victimizing, misogynistic views. [12] X Research source Don't fall down any toxic rabbit holes. Focus on the type of life that feels right for you."
