      "content": "“Jebaited” means somebody has been manipulated or tricked in a game. This internet slang term is primarily used while gaming, especially during Twitch livestreams. Jebaited can be used as a verb to describe what someone’s done or a noun to describe someone. All in all, the term is used light-heartedly to say that someone’s been fooled, trolled, or baited during play. [1] X Research source Here are some ways “jebaited” may be used in a sentence: My viewers like to jebait me. Don’t listen to them. Are you jebaiting me? Guys, I think he’s trying to pull a fast one. This one gives off jebaiter vibes. I don’t like it. I’ve been jebaited! I repeat, I’ve been jebaited! The treasure isn’t in the castle! Many Twitch users have Custom Emotes to relate jebaited feelings. Emotes are visual graphics (think of them as animated emojis) that users can use if they’re subscribed to a channel.

JEBAITER! Bro, they’re playing you! Mark is totally jebaiting Zoe. It’s so obvious."
