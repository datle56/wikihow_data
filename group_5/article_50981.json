      "title": "Make sure they know they’ll be in the nude before you hire them.",
      "content": "Make sure they know they’ll be in the nude before you hire them. You can search for models that are professionally nude, or you can hire ones that are comfortable with lingerie and states of undress. If you’re working with a newer model, be sure to tell them exactly what they’ll be doing and how nude you’d like them to be. [1] X Research source If you don’t have much experience with nude photography, consider hiring an experienced nude model. They’ll need less direction and posing, which can make it easier to get the shots that you want."

      "content": "Pick out shots from a magazine that you want to emulate. Send them to the model to make sure they’re comfortable with the type of shoot you’d like to do. Some nude photos are more artistic, while others are a little more risqué, and it’s up to your model to decide whether or not they’d like to continue. [2] X Research source Be sure to send over shots that you actually want to shoot, not ones that you think will make the model feel comfortable. Switching up your style halfway through a shoot is bad practice, and it can make the model feel uncomfortable."

      "title": "Not everyone wants to be nude in front of the camera.",
      "content": "Not everyone wants to be nude in front of the camera. If you’d like to photograph someone in particular and they aren’t okay with being fully nude, have them keep their underwear on. You can cover up their undergarments with bed sheets, curtains, long hair, or even other parts of their own body. [3] X Research source This is a great strategy for boudoir photoshoots, since the subjects usually aren’t professional models."
    },
    {
      "title": "No need to stare as they disrobe or get undressed.",
      "content": "No need to stare as they disrobe or get undressed. You can ask the model to strip down as you set up your camera and focus on the lighting. Try to only have your model get nude when you’re ready to shoot so they don’t have to stand around in a state of undress for no reason. [4] X Research source It can help to think about the model as an art piece instead of a nude human."
    },
    {
      "title": "It’s something most photographers don’t think about!",
      "content": "It’s something most photographers don’t think about! Your nude model will probably be a little chilly, especially if the room is big. Turn the heat up and ask the model if the temperature is okay before you start shooting. [5] X Research source This can also help eliminate ripples in the skin. If your model is cold, they could get goosebumps, which can make their skin look bumpy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try not to touch the model throughout the shoot.",
      "content": "Try not to touch the model throughout the shoot. If you need to redirect them, try mirroring the pose with your own body or explaining it in words. Most nude photographers caution against touching your model at all, so keep it hands-free as much as possible. [6] X Research source Most experienced nude models will have a few poses that they know look good, too. When in doubt, trust your model."

    {
      "title": "Keep the mood of the room light and happy.",
      "content": "Keep the mood of the room light and happy. Crack a few jokes, share a smile, and make sure your model is having fun. The more comfortable they are, the better photos you’ll get! [7] X Research source You could even try playing some music to keep the mood up."
    },
    {
      "title": "It’s all about consent.",
      "content": "It’s all about consent. If you ask the model to do something they don’t want to, respect their boundaries. Pushing a model into doing something is not okay, and they’re allowed to deny any request that you give them. [8] X Research source It’s nice to check in with your model periodically to see how they’re doing. Just a simple, “Hey, you doing okay?” is a nice way to make them feel more comfortable."

      "title": "It’s easy to get distracted by the human form in front of you.",
      "content": "It’s easy to get distracted by the human form in front of you. Oftentimes, nude photographers focus too much on the human body and forget about everything else. Make sure the rest of the photo looks good, too! [9] X Research source Framing, lighting, and posing are essential, even in nude photographs. It helps to have a really great set to work with. Brick walls, flowy white curtains, and bed sheets are all fun to play around with in nude photography."

    {
      "title": "They don’t need to be naked if you're not photographing them.",
      "content": "They don’t need to be naked if you're not photographing them. Keep a robe or a blanket nearby so they can cover up when they’re not posing. It will help them feel comfortable and keep the shoot more professional. [10] X Research source If you don’t have anything on-hand, ask the model to bring something along to cover up with. It will help keep the model warm, too!"
