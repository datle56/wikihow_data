      "content": "Meditate with an orange candle to restore motivation and attract change. If you’re hoping for a new beginning in some aspect of your life, an orange candle meditation can help provide clarity and propel you toward your goal. It's particularly helpful if you’re thinking of switching career paths or going after a new business goal. [2] X Research source Pick a quiet, peaceful place to perform your meditation, and limit distractions (put away your phone, turn off the T.V., dim the lights, etc.) Place your orange candle in front of you at eye level. For example, you could sit cross-legged on the floor and place the candle on top of a low coffee table. Light the candle and gaze at it. Try to focus on only the candle, silencing other thoughts or distractions. Stay in this meditative state for about 10 minutes. If you feel your attention drifting, slowly bring it back to the candle. When you feel ready, gradually take in your surroundings and leave your meditative state. [3] X Research source Use a candle snuffer or your fingers to extinguish the candle flame instead of blowing it out, as this can dissipate the energy of your meditation."

      "content": "Decide what you want to manifest. Before starting your ritual, take some time to think about what you want to achieve with your spell. In pagan traditions, orange candles attract energy, joy, and motivation into your life, so these types of intentions work best with orange candle magick. [4] X Research source Try to sum up your intention in one sentence—clarifying your goal will help you successfully manifest it . Here are some examples: “I want to experience a burst of creativity and inspiration to push past writer’s block and finally finish the book I’m writing.” “I want to manifest motivation and energy to overcome the feelings of burnout I’ve been having.” “I want the right career opportunity to cross my path, so that I can reach my fullest potential.”"

      "content": "Prepare your space for the ritual. Pick a quiet, serene place to perform your spell. Cleanse the space with sage or palo santo by lighting a bundle of either, then blowing out the flame and wafting the smoke around. You can also simply open a window and air the space out if you don't have palo santo or sage. Next, set up any crystals you'd like to use around your candle. Here are a few crystals with healing properties that combine nicely with an orange candle spell: Citrine : promotes prosperity and creativity [5] X Research source Clear quartz : energizes and promotes healing Orange calcite : boosts motivation and can help you get out of a rut [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Dress your candle. To prepare your candle for the ritual, dress it with an essential oil. Using your fingers, rub the oil of your choice into your candle. This connects you to your candle and amplifies the power of your spell. [7] X Research source If you don’t have any essential oils on hand, you can also use any natural oil, like olive, coconut, or almond oil. If your intention is to let go of something (such as doubt, fear, or anxiety) rub the oil into your candle from the top downward. If your intention is to manifest or attract something, rub the oil into the candle from the bottom to the top. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Light the candle and recite your intention. First, take a moment to visualize your goal. For example, if your intention is to manifest the perfect job, imagine yourself already thriving in your new position. Then, once the image is clear in your mind, speak your manifestation aloud (“I want to get a job I’m passionate about”) and light your candle."

      "content": "Assess the candle’s flame. Study the size and strength of your candle’s flame to interpret its meaning . Different flame behaviors can reveal whether or not your ritual was successful. A strong, tall flame : Your intent is clear, and you’ve successfully performed your spell. A weaker flame : Your intention may have been unclear, and the spell may be less strong. Refocus your intention and picture the thing you’re manifesting. Hissing, popping, or sizzling : A spirit or entity could be near, and they may be answering your spell or trying to communicate with you [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Snuff out the candle or let it burn out. When you’re ready to extinguish your candle, use a candle snuffer or pinch the flame with your fingers. Don’t blow out your candle, as this can blow away your intention and make the ritual unsuccessful. [10] X Research source You can also simply wait for the candle to burn out, if you have the time!"
