Only players in the Second Sea will see the message, see the sky darken, and hear lightning strikes. Find Darkbeard at the Dark Arena. As long as you do at least 10% damage, you'll get $50,000, 1,500 Fragments, 3 levels, and a Dark Fragment. You might even get the Dark Coat drop. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Defeat a Sea Beast or check chests. These are the only 2 ways to get a Fist of Darkness. Although the chance is low for it to drop from a Sea Beast, it's probably easier than opening a chest every four hours. To find Sea Beasts, ride around in a boat for one to spawn randomly. If you summon a Sea Beast, it won't drop the Fist of Darkness. Finding a Fist of Darkness in a chest is similar to getting God's Chalice from a chest. You have to wait 4 hours between opening each chest, and it is a good idea to be on a private server to do this so others don't ruin your drop chances. Getting it from a chest will grant you the \"Forbidden One\" title. Note that you can only use this item 3 times, and it will disappear from your inventory if you die."

      "content": "Summon Darkbeard. To spawn the boss, go to the Dark Arena, northeast of the Kingdom of Rose, and use the Fist of Darkness at the altar in the middle of the arena. Buddha is a great Fruit to use against Darkbeard. Since most of Darkbeard's moves are ground-based, you should stay airborne and hit him with ranged attacks. It's possible to solo this boss using this Fruit. Darkbeard spawns for only 10 minutes at a time."

If you insert Fist of Darkness into the dark blue chamber of the Secret Laboratory at Hot and Cold, you have a chance to get a Core Brain drop from another boss, which is required for the Cyborg race. The drop is low, so you might need to do this several times before you get the Core Brain."
