However, many Pilates first-time triers and enthusiasts have experienced muscle growth, especially around the upper and lower body and abdominal muscles, in the beginning before hitting a plateau.

      "content": "Pilates is great for developing overall strength, flexibility, and balance. Pilates focuses on the concentration of specific movements, especially around the abdomen and lower back muscles, through precise movement and controlled breathing. It combines some of the ideas and movements of Yoga and Barre to strengthen specific muscles to become more flexible and balanced. While Pilates is a form of strength or resistance training, what makes it different is the lack of outside resistance. While you may add weights, you can only add so much. In the 1920s, personal trainer Joseph Pilates created a series of exercises to strengthen overused muscles to prevent injuries.

Many refer to the five essentials of Pilates, which include breathing, cervical alignment, rib and scapular stabilization, pelvic mobility, and utilizing the transverse abdominis. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source But, to accomplish this fusion, consider these key six principles of Pilates: [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Centering: The core, or “powerhouse” of the body, is where all the energy begins and radiates outward to the other parts of your body. Concentration: Focus your mind on the entire body with every exercise. Consider how it moves, how you’re holding the position, and most importantly, how you’re breathing. Control: It’s important to keep a tight core when moving in and out of different positions to get the most out of every movement. Breath: One movement, one breath. Pilates believed each exercise should be done with full and rhythmic breathing to “purge all cellular waste.” [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Exhaling can help activate your muscles deeper. Precision: Instead of doing a bunch of movements half-heartedly, focus on a select few and execute them correctly. Fluidity: Pilates aims to seamlessly link your moves with your breath so you can easily flow from one exercise into another."
