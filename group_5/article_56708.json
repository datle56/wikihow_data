      "content": "Make yourself taller with the right shoes. One easy way to look older is to be taller. Try wearing high heels. Adding an inch or two to your height can give a more mature appearance. This can be done with \"high heeled shoes\" but also more easy-to-wear footwear such as wedges or boots. [1] X Research source Be able to walk confidently in heels. In some cases, wearing especially high-heeled shoes may actually make you come off as immature. You do not want to look like a girl wearing mom's shoes. Teetering and tottering while walking looks like you are inexperienced and therefore childish rather than mature."

      "title": "Buy more sophisticated clothes.",
      "content": "Buy more sophisticated clothes. Clothing is one of the easiest ways a person can control his or her appearance. Wearing clothing that indicates maturity is one way to project an \"aged up\" look. Blouses and dress shirts often look more adult than T-shirts or other types of tops. While people of all ages love wearing T-shirts, they tend to project a spirit of youth, rather than someone with a job. Wear tailored tops with collars instead. Avoid novelty clothes. This includes T-shirts with cartoon characters, band logos, or jokes on them. Avoid embellishments. Juvenile clothing tends to have bows, sparkles, beads, and other such flourishes. Adult clothing does not have nearly as much. Pick subdued colors, rather than flashy colors. Older women tend to wear neutrals: black, grey, brown, white, and so on. (Of course they can wear any color, but these tend to be staples of an adult wardrobe). Avoid colors that tend to be worn by children, such as bubblegum pink. Nice cottons and denims, cashmere sweaters, silk shifts, and linen dresses are all good choices for people who want to look like they've got some life experience. Put away the polyester, rayon and stretch pants. Keep athletic wear for workouts. Most athletic-style wear looks casual, and that tends to give off a vibe of youth. The possible exceptions are polo shirts and good-quality golfing or tennis clothing. If you're a teenager and you normally shop in the juniors' section of the department store, go to the adults' section next time for good examples of the kind of clothes that'll make you look a little older."

      "content": "Wear subtle, classic patterns. Adults wear patterned clothing, but they are not typically as whimsical as clothes designed for children. Stick with classic patterns such as florals, stripes, plaids and paisleys. Polka dots and animal prints (such as leopard print) are classic choices, but may still come off as youthful. Wear jewel tones instead of pastels. Pastels and neon bright colors tend to look more childlike than bold colors (red, navy blue) and muted color schemes (such as mauve or beige)."

      "content": "Avoid wearing blatantly childish clothes. Wearing clothing with Hello Kitty or Disney characters on them scream childish. Younger styles will make you look younger, simply put. If you naturally have a young-looking face, wearing clothes that fit you well and cover more of your body might be the key to looking a bit older. Avoid the following clothes and styles: \"Daisy Dukes\": denim shorts cut extremely high in the leg and tight fitting in the posterior. Mini-skirts Novelty T-shirts: T-shirts with cartoon characters, jokes, advertising, and so on. Baseball caps Baggy jeans Brands or logos associated with children (even though many adults love them): Disney, Hello Kitty, Pok√©mon. Converse shoes"

      "content": "Consider going \"professional,\" if you can pull it off or it would be appropriate. Depending on the age you're shooting for, and the age you are, it might be good to dress up to a significant degree, or it can look like you're playing \"dress up.\" It's a good idea to experiment some with dressier clothes, to see if you can pull off a mature, workplace look, or if that'll just make you look even younger. [2] X Research source This will work if you are more-or-less an adult. An 11 year old wearing a business suit will not pull off the look, but am 18 year old just might. If you're trying to just look 18 or 21, focus on adding height and using make-up to make yourself look older. If you want to look more \"mature,\" because you're an adult with a younger face, try out a dressier wardrobe."

Note the colors and patterns they wear, the fit of their clothes, the type of shoes they have on. Check out the whole package. Start looking for similar items to create your own grown-up wardrobe."

      "content": "Wear pants, not shorts. While guys of all ages wear shorts, they're less formal and more commonly associated with boys and athletic wear. To look a little older, it's best to wear good quality, form-fitting pants, and to leave the shorts for the gym. It's especially important to avoid baggy cargo shorts and athletic shorts of any kind. Especially baggy shorts will always look young."

Plaid shirts or plain-printed dress shirts are good looks, whether you want to look 17 or 70. Make sure the shirt isn't too big for you, or you'll end up looking like a kid wearing his dad's clothes. The sleeves of collared shirts need to come to the wrist when your arms are out straight at your sides. No further."

If you're trying to pass as older, wear some more adult shoes. You don't have to wear old-man penny loafers, but more basic leather or faux-leather shoes will always look older than sneakers. If you're shorter than you'd like to be, you can make yourself taller with Doc Martens, or motorcycle or cowboy boots that have heels, or slightly-raised platform soles."

      "content": "Get a more mature haircut. Some haircuts can make people's faces look a lot younger, while others give the impression of success and power. Here are a few things to keep in mind next time you go to the salon or barber shop: Stay away from little girl bangs. Straight bangs that are cut above the eyebrows are cute, but they make people look young. Sweep yours across instead for a sophisticated look. [3] X Research source Don't go for the shaggy look. This gives the impression that you are unkempt, whether you're a guy or a girl. Keep your hair trimmed and neat. Try a bob or a fade. These are both haircuts you might see on people who go into politics or medicine. Choose a haircut that makes you look assertive and powerful, in spite of your years. Experiment with a darker hair color. Hair often naturally darkens over time, and a darker hair color therefore makes you look older. Do not go overboard, however, as this might not give the effect that you want. A good rule is to stay within two shades of your natural hair color. Guys should experiment with facial hair. [4] X Research source Men who can grow it in thickly look older with some facial hair, but if yours is wispy, stay clean-shaven."

Take the time to comb your hair and either put it up in a chignon, apply gel to define your curls, or straighten it. Skip bows and barrettes, which look childish. Don't wear pigtails or braids. These can look good, but will always look young. Wearing your hair up can emphasize your youthful features, and look like a much younger style than wearing your hair down, which can help to elongate your face and frame it to make it look a lot more adult."

Go for a classic application of foundation, eye shadow, eye liner, and blush, with a lip that's just a few shades darker than your natural color. Stay away from blue eye shadow or other funky colors, which make you look like a little kid playing with makeup. Skip the glitter and shimmer and wear matte products instead."

Even if your physical appearance, unique personality, or social skills aren't as old as you wish they were, that doesn't have to stop you from projecting the confidence of an older person. Be the age you want to be. Who's the most confident looking person you know? Come up with a confident \"anchor\" or persona that will help you play the part, possibly building on a confident role model that you admire, a Clooney or an Angelina. Use that confident persona as an anchor inside every action. It might sound silly, but try to imagine how that person would stroll through the room, and attempt to embody that confidence. Walk like you're confident. Pour a glass of water like you're confident."

Talk more about other people than yourself, and know when to let silence do the talking. Listen closely to what others say. Few things demonstrate maturity as well as a being a good listener . Be a good conversationalist who is interested in what people are saying; try to add occasional comments if you think they make sense."
