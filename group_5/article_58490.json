      "content": "Clean the stones with soap and water if the quartz is dirty. Add a few drops of dish soap to a glass of water. Dip a rag or a small brush (such as an old toothbrush) into the water. Scrub the rock with the soap solution until you remove all the dirt and grime left from digging them out of the ground.

      "content": "Scrub off any iron deposits with an abrasive powder and brush. If your crystals are \"stained\" red with iron, you may need to scrub them a little harder than if they just have dirt on them. Try an aluminum or steel scrubbing brush, and scrub these areas thoroughly with a scouring powder, such as pumice. [2] X Research source Identify stained quartz by finding the red and brown patches on the crystals. Quartz is a very strong stone, and it will hold up to scouring while you scrub the red away."

      "title": "Grind away the roughest edges with a small rotary tool after the stone is clean.",
      "content": "Grind away the roughest edges with a small rotary tool after the stone is clean. If your quartz has large pieces you want to remove, cut off them off by sawing through them with a cutting wheel. Place the edge of the wheel against the part you want to cut away, then apply gentle pressure to grind through it. Don't press too hard, as you could harm yourself or the tool. For sharp edges in areas you don't want, use a grinding tool to wear away at the edge. [3] X Research source Also, take the time to \"shape\" the stone into roughly what you want the final stone to look like; grind off any areas you don't want. Use diamond-crusted or edged tools for this project, as quartz is very hard. Put on goggles and protective gloves to protect yourself."

      "title": "Sand the stone down to begin polishing it, starting with very coarse sandpaper.",
      "content": "Sand the stone down to begin polishing it, starting with very coarse sandpaper. Pick a very coarse, hard sandpaper for the first round, such as a 50 grit. Work on sanding down the stone's rough edges. As they get smoother, use finer sandpaper, such as 150-grit, and sand it again. Keep moving down to progressively finer paper until the stone is fairly smooth. [4] X Research source At the end, use very fine grit sandpaper."

    {
      "title": "Polish the stones with a rough fabric.",
      "content": "Polish the stones with a rough fabric. Rub the stone thoroughly with the fabric, working on it until you start to see it shine. Quartz has a natural luster, so it should pick up a shine fairly quickly. [5] X Research source Denim, corduroy, or upholstery fabric work well for this."

      "title": "Place the quartz in the barrel of the tumbler.",
      "content": "Place the quartz in the barrel of the tumbler. Fill the tumbler 3/4 full with your quartz rocks. You'll need room for water and grit, so don't pack it completely full of rocks. Plus, the rocks need space to tumble. Keep in mind that each stone will lose about 30% of its mass. [6] X Research source For home use, you have the options of a toy rock tumbler with a plastic barrel or a hobby tumbler. For quartz, a hobby tumbler is better as it is a tough rock to tumble.

Pour in 1 tablespoon (24 grams) of 60/90 coarse grit aluminum oxide for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of rocks. Pour in 1/2 a teaspoon (3 grams) of baking soda if you have a small barrel or 1 teaspoon (6 grams) if you have a larger one.

      "content": "Tumble the rocks for at least 2 weeks before checking on them. Turn the tumbler on and let the rocks turn in the barrel. When time is up, open it to look at the rocks. If any of them are fully polished, take them out. If others still need polishing, leave them in. [9] X Research source If you take any stones out, replace them with new ones or use plastic pellet fillers to make the tumbler 3/4 of the way full. Add another 1 tablespoon (24 grams) of aluminum oxide for each 1 pound (0.45 kg) of rocks."

Scrub it down with soap and water and then put it back together. [10] X Research source Save the plastic pellets and write down that you used 60/90 grit on them. You can use them again but only with that grit level."

Add enough rocks to equal 3/4 of the barrel along with 1 tablespoon (24 grams) of grit per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of rocks, 1/2 teaspoon (3 grams) of baking soda, and water to cover the rocks. [11] X Research source Run it for 1-2 to weeks before cleaning and switching to 500 fine polish in the same proportions. Run it for another 1-2 weeks."

Check it in an hour to make sure the rocks have enough water to move around in and then check the rocks after a week to see if they have the shine you want.

Don't use ones with bleach or ones that are heavily acidic. However, gentle kitchen cleaners are perfectly fine. [16] X Research source You can even use glass and surface cleaners on these counters.

      "content": "Avoid using scouring pads. Scouring pads could remove some of the natural shine that quartz has. Opt for dishrags or even microfiber cloths instead, which are less likely to damage the countertops. [20] X Research source Similarly, skip harsh cleaning chemicals. Quartz countertops have resins holding them together, and the chemicals could damage those. Skip polishing quartz countertops. These countertops are a composite of resin and quartz rock, so they don't need polishing. They don't require sealing either. All in all, they are relatively low maintenance. [21] X Research source"
