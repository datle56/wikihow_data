      "content": "Lay down a piece of plastic sheeting. Pick a big, open floor area to paint your backdrop. It needs to be big enough to lay everything flat. Put down a plastic sheet and use painter’s tape to secure it to the floor so it doesn’t move around. [1] X Research source The sheeting needs to be big enough to go under your backdrop, with a little extra room for additional protection. You can find large plastic sheets at the hardware store. This process will work best on a hard surface. If you only have a carpeted space, try putting a large piece of cardboard down."

      "title": "Put a piece of canvas material on top of the sheet.",
      "content": "Put a piece of canvas material on top of the sheet. Unfold the material and pull it over the plastic. Make sure to leave space around each edge on the plastic so you have room to paint the canvas’s edges. You’ll need at least 1 foot (0.30 m) on each side. Secure the canvas to the plastic by rolling pieces of painter’s tape in on themselves to create double-sided tape, then attaching the tape to the back of the canvas. [2] X Research source You can purchase canvas from craft stores or buy a linen canvas drop cloth from the hardware store. The exact size is up to you, but 9 by 12 feet (2.7 by 3.7 m) is a good starting point. It should allow you to shoot full-body shots with small groups of people. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply gesso primer/sealer to the canvas. Roll the primer onto the canvas, moving in one direction. Let it dry for 30 minutes, then apply another coat perpendicularly to the direction you went the first time. For the third coat, repeat the process in the same direction you went with the first coat. Make sure to let it dry completely before moving on to the next step. [4] X Research source You can also use 1 part PVA sealer mixed with 5 parts water. You may only need 2 coats with PVA. [5] X Research source You may want to wear gloves for this process!"

      "title": "Paint a dark base color for the background.",
      "content": "Paint a dark base color for the background. This color will show up behind your other colors, so pick something neutral, like dark gray, dark brown, or even midnight blue. Use a can of indoor acrylic paint for the best results. Apply the paint in an even coat across the canvas using a paint roller. Paint in a v-shape as you move up and down the canvas. [6] X Research source An extended roller will make this process easier. Make sure this is your darkest color, as it will allow the other colors to pop out in front. [7] X Research source Apply more than 1 layer to get an even coat. Wait for the first layer to dry completely before moving on to the next coat. It may take up to 24 hours. Then wait for the second coat to dry completely, too."

    {
      "title": "Add 2 to 4 more colors.",
      "content": "Add 2 to 4 more colors. There are lots of different ways to add other colors to your canvas. Create a fun, splotchy effect by watering one color down by 50% so it doesn’t apply an even coat. Try sponging or splattering the paint to create an interesting texture, or if you want to blend the colors, use a clean string mop to rub them together in a circular motion. Make sure to blend the colors while they’re still wet. [8] X Research source You can also splatter additional paint on after you’ve blended your other colors well. Choose colors that add depth to the painting but don’t stand out too much. For instance, if you start with a midnight blue background, try adding a dark gray or a muted olive green."

      "title": "Let the canvas dry for 24 hours before moving or rolling it.",
      "content": "Let the canvas dry for 24 hours before moving or rolling it. Typically, your canvas will need at least 24 hours to dry completely, but 2 days is even better. With so many layers of paint, you want to be sure everything is solid before trying to move it. When you do roll it up, place an extra sheet of plastic on top of the canvas, then roll it up with the layer of plastic underneath. Stick it in a cardboard tube made for backdrops and store in a cool, dark location. [9] X Research source You can buy these tubes online or at photography stores."

      "content": "Attach your backdrop on a stand or hang it on the wall. For the most professional option, get a backdrop stand to attach your backdrop to. Or, you could simply use tacks, nails, or staples to adhere it to the wall. Another option is to staple rope or twine to your ceiling, then hang the backdrop from the rope using binder clips.

      "content": "Make a cheap, playful backdrop out of paint and plastic tablecloths. Lay a plastic tablecloth (of any color) out on the floor. Then, pour some paint of a contrasting color onto a sponge; washable or acrylic is fine for this. Sponge the paint all over the tablecloth, let it dry, and then go over it with another color if you want. Use binder clips to hang your tablecloth on a piece of string or rope, and you’re done! [11] X Research source For instance, try a blue tablecloth and sponge purple and gray paint on it. If you don’t want to use paint, string multiple tablecloths next to each other so they hang down like gathered curtains. This creates vertical stripes of color, and you can use a variety of colors for a rainbow effect."

      "content": "Tape up a sheet or piece of fabric to create an easy, large backdrop. Pick a pretty sheet or curtain with a fun pattern or solid color based on your personal preferences. Use painter’s tape to adhere the fabric to the wall, and make sure to smooth out any wrinkles. Let it hang down to the floor—your subject can even stand on the ends of the fabric. [13] X Research source You can also buy 1 to 2 yards (0.91 to 1.83 m) of fabric from a craft store. It's fairly cheap, and you won't need much to make a pretty backdrop."

      "title": "Glue or tape streamers onto a string for a whimsical look.",
      "content": "Glue or tape streamers onto a string for a whimsical look. Measure out a length of string equal to the width you want your background to be. Pick up streamers in the colors of your choosing, then cut them to the length you want with 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) extra for taping. Wrap the top of the streamer over the string and tape or glue it in the back. Add more streamers in alternating colors until you have enough to form the width of the backdrop. Knot the ends of the string and hang it up with tacks or hooks. [14] X Research source The length of the streamers depends on what kind of shot you’re doing. If you want a full-length body shot with an adult, it should be 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m). If you’re taking pictures of a child, it may only need to be 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) in length. At a minimum, the backdrop should be 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) wide. For a backdrop you can use over and over, try tying lengths of ribbon on the string instead, as ribbon is sturdier than streamers."

Buy a selection of colorful paper, then make paper flowers by folding, rolling, and gluing the paper into petal shapes. Tape the flowers up on the wall, covering as much of the wall as you can. Try alternating different colors for a fun and festive look. [15] X Research source If you don’t have that many flowers, fill in the space behind them with extra sheets of paper. You could even cut them into hearts!"

      "content": "Make a sparkly background using glitter foil curtains. Start by hanging up dark-colored plastic tablecloths on the wall with painter’s tape; these will provide a nice contrast to the curtains. Then, tape glitter foil curtains across the top of the wall and let them hang down. You can leave the backdrop like that or cut out fun shapes to hang from the top. [16] X Research source For instance, cut hearts or stars out of metallic paper and hang them in front of the curtain at various heights. You can also hang them from the ceiling with string of a similar color."

Blow them up, then use painter’s tape or clear tape to stick them to the wall in a pattern you like! Rows work really well, particularly if you’re alternating colors. [17] X Research source For even more color, hang thin streamers from the ceiling to fall down in front of the balloons."
