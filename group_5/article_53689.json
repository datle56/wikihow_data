      "title": "Draw a hexagon on a piece of paper.",
      "content": "Draw a hexagon on a piece of paper. A hexagon has 6 sides that are all the same length. The bigger you make the hexagon, the bigger your snowflake will be. Use a ruler to draw the hexagon so the lines are straight and even."

    {
      "title": "Draw a line from each corner of the hexagon to the corner across from it.",
      "content": "Draw a line from each corner of the hexagon to the corner across from it. You should draw a total of 3 lines, which will all intersect in the center of the hexagon. Use a ruler so all of the lines are straight."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a 6-pointed star in the center of the hexagon.",
      "content": "Draw a 6-pointed star in the center of the hexagon. Since your hexagon is divide into 6 equal sections by the lines you drew connecting the corners, you should draw 1 point of the star in each section. Try to make the points of the star about half way between the center and outside of the hexagon. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Sketch the outline of a snowflake over the lines you’ve drawn so far.",
      "content": "Sketch the outline of a snowflake over the lines you’ve drawn so far. At this point, you can get creative and draw your own snowflake formation. However, it’s a good idea to make your snowflake symmetrical so it looks realistic. Draw the long points of the snowflake over the long lines connecting the corners of the hexagon. Draw the short points of the snowflake over the star that’s in the center of the hexagon."

    {
      "title": "Erase the extra lines around your snowflake.",
      "content": "Erase the extra lines around your snowflake. Now that you’ve drawn the outline of your snowflake, you can go back in and erase the hexagon lines and 6-pointed star that you drew earlier. Once you erase these extra lines, all you’ll have left is your snowflake!"

    {
      "title": "Color in your snowflake with white, blue, and purple.",
      "content": "Color in your snowflake with white, blue, and purple. Although snowflakes are mostly white, you can still add some blue and purple to make it look reflective and realistic."
