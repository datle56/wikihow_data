      "content": "BBW has become a pornographic fetish. Though BBW is typically used as a compliment, some women have expressed extreme distaste for the term due to its recent role in porn. Some claim that BBW is a “fat fetish” and that it draws in men who only have an interest in sex. [4] X Research source Sociologist Abigail C. Saguy argued in a 2002 study that the objectification of women's weight reinforces the cultural emphasis on their appearance, thereby preserving gender inequality. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid calling a woman a BBW unless she says otherwise.",
      "content": "Avoid calling a woman a BBW unless she says otherwise. While BBW is generally considered to be a good thing, it's still a term that calls out someone's size. You may address someone a BBW as a way of complimenting her beauty, but all she might hear is the word \"big.\" To avoid any hurt feelings or disrespect, only use the term BBW on someone you're absolutely sure would find it to be a positive thing. Steer clear of using the word BBW in any professional settings. BBW, ultimately, is a slang term and not an official acronym."
