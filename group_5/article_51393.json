      "content": "Multiply the house perimeter by the roofline height to measure the exterior. To calculate the area of exterior walls, measure the perimeter of the house, or the combined length of all exterior walls. Exclude porches or other “appendages.” Multiply the perimeter by the height of the roofline, or the spot where the top of an exterior wall meets the roof. If your house has gables (peaked parts of the roof), add half the height of a story to the total roofline height to get a ballpark approximation of the area including gables. [1] X Research source Most houses have a height of 9 feet (2.7 m) per story. Add 4.5 feet (1.4 m) to account for any gables. For example, if your house is 24 feet (7.3 m) by 35 feet (11 m) and 2 stories tall, the area in square feet would be (24 + 24 + 35 + 35) x (9 + 9 + 4.5) = 118 x 22.5 = 2,655."

Measure the perimeter of the room (the combined lengths of all sides of the room) and multiply it by the height of the ceiling. [2] X Expert Source Archie Guerrero Commercial & Residential Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. [3] X Research source For example, if the perimeter of your room is 55 feet (17 m) and the ceiling is 10 feet (3.0 m) high, the area of the walls is 550 square feet (51 m 2 ). If the room has any doors and windows, measure the area of each and subtract it from the wall area for a more accurate estimate. Multiply the length of each door or window by its width to find the area."

      "content": "Measure any doors, windows, and trim you plan to paint. In addition to the walls and ceilings, you may wish to paint your doors and doorframes as well as other trim, such as baseboards. To save the trouble of measuring each of these individually, you can use these tricks to get a good estimate: [5] X Research source Most doors are 21 square feet (2.0 m 2 ), so simply multiply that area by the number of doors you plan to paint. Likewise, the average window is 15 square feet (1.4 m 2 ). While you won’t be painting the windowpanes, the amount of paint you’d need to cover them should also be roughly how much you’d need to cover the window frames and door frames in a given room. To estimate the area of your baseboards, calculate the perimeter of the room and subtract 3 feet (0.91 m) per door. Multiply that by the trim width of your baseboard (e.g., .5 feet (0.15 m)."

While the exact coverage you can expect will vary depending on the kind of paint you’re using and the surface you’re painting on, this is a good rule of thumb. Divide the total number of square feet you have to paint by 400 to determine how many gallons of paint you need. [6] X Expert Source Archie Guerrero Commercial & Residential Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. [7] X Research source For example, you can cover 850 square feet (79 m 2 ) with 2.13 gallons (8.1 L) of paint (or 3 gallons (11 L), rounding up to the nearest gallon). For smaller areas, you can use the rule that 1 US quart (0.95 L) of paint covers 100 square feet (9.3 m 2 ). If you need multiple coats of paint, multiply your estimate by the number of coats you plan to use. For example, if you need to use 2 coats of paint in a 400 sq ft (37 m 2 ) area, you’ll need 2 gallons (7.6 L) of paint."

[9] X Expert Source Archie Guerrero Commercial & Residential Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. For example, you might want to use matte water-based paints on most interior walls, but use glossy, water-resistant oil-based paints in your bathroom and kitchen. For exterior surfaces, like your siding or your deck, you’ll need heavy-duty latex paints that can stand up to the elements. Look for a combined paint and primer that will adhere well to most surfaces. [10] X Research source You’ll likely want at least one exterior paint color and at least one interior paint color, plus at least one additional color for trim."

[14] X Research source For example, according to the Painting and Decorating Contractors of America, it costs between $3,000 and $5,000 to paint the outside of a 2,500 sq ft (230 m 2 ) house, and between $3,750 and $7,500 to paint the interior of a house of the same size.

[17] X Research source Work with your painter to get an estimate of how much it will cost to paint your house based on the amount of work they’ll need to do as well as the size of the area they have to cover. Many painters charge about $20 per hour in labor costs. Labor includes not only the time spent painting, but also time spent doing preparatory work such as power washing, scraping away old paint, or taping off areas you want painted in a different color. The total cost will likely be roughly twice the basic cost of materials and labor. This is because your painter may also need to cover the costs of things like marketing, insurance, subcontractors, and other expenses not directly associated with your paint job. They need to factor those things into their prices to make a profit."
