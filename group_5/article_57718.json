[4] X Research source Always start at the furthest edge to be sure you get an accurate reading. Rectangular and oval trampolines are measured by width and length, so your trampoline size would be something like 10’x12’ or 3x4 meters. For oval trampolines, take a second to determine where the trampoline is at its longest and widest. Take the measurements a few times to be completely sure they’re accurate."
