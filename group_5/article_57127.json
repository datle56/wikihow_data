However, you can also get Kegs from a few other sources: Bundles: If you're playing with standard Community Center bundles, completing the Artisan's Bundle will get you a Keg. If you're playing with remixed bundles, you'll get the Keg from finishing the Brewer's Bundle. Prize Machine: There is a 50% chance of getting 4 Kegs as the 19th reward from the Prize Machine.

To take Wine from a Cask before it has reached iridium quality, hit the Cask with an Axe, Hoe, or Pickaxe. The Cask recipe is obtained by getting the final Farmhouse upgrade. It takes 20 Wood and 1 Hardwood to make a Cask. [2] X Research source . Casks must be placed in the cellar (which is added to the Farmhouse with the final upgrade) to age Wine. The cellar can hold 33 Casks. It takes 14 in-game days to age the Wine to silver quality, 28 in-game days to age the Wine to gold quality, and 56 in-game days to age the Wine to iridium quality. Many players fill their Casks with as much Wine as possible, then sell the surplus until the Casks are done aging. To maximize profits, place your highest-value Wine in your Casks (such as Starfruit, Ancient Fruit, Pineapple, or Melon Wine)."

As the value of Wine depends on the base price of the fruit, Starfruit yields the best profits because it's the highest-valued fruit in the game. A normal-quality bottle of Starfruit Wine yields 2,250 gold (3,150 gold with the Artisan profession). Stockpile as many Starfruit Seeds as you can to grow in the Greenhouse. This will ensure you have a steady stream of Starfruit when it's not Summer so you can make Starfruit Wine year-round. Starfruit Seeds can only be reliably purchased at the Oasis, so it isn't the best choice for players who haven't gotten that far in the game yet."

      "title": "The best fruit for players in their first year varies by season.",
      "content": "The best fruit for players in their first year varies by season. While you can't start making Wine right away, you can start stockpiling fruit to turn into Wine once you unlock Kegs. As such, the best fruit changes depending on what season you're in: Spring: Strawberries will yield a normal-quality Wine worth 360 gold. They grow quickly, and one plant yields multiple harvests. Summer: Melons will yield a normal-quality Wine worth 750 gold. They take a bit longer to grow, but the seeds are readily available to new players. You should also stockpile Melon seeds during Summer to use in the Greenhouse before you get access to the Oasis for Starfruit seeds. Fall: Wild Plums will yield a normal-quality Wine worth 240 gold. This is a lower yield than some other Fall fruits, but Wild Plums can be foraged for free. Pomegranates and Apples have a higher value (420 gold and 300 gold, respectively), but saplings are expensive (between 3,000 and 7,000 gold each, depending on which one you buy and from which store), take a long time to mature, and take up 9 tiles, which may not be feasible for a first year player. Winter: Crystal Fruit will yield a normal-quality wine worth 450 gold. Like Wild Plums, Crystal Fruit is foraged, so the yield from Crystal Fruit wine is 100% profit. Unlike Fall, though, you can't grow anything in Winter, so foraged fruit is your best bet for Wine. However, if you happen to have the Greenhouse unlocked by Winter, you should use that to grow fruit (ideally Melons) to make Wine out of."

These factors are the value of the base fruit (at normal quality), whether the Wine is aged or not (which increases the Wine's quality), and whether you have the Artisan profession. [3] X Research source You can calculate a Wine's value with the following expression: 3 x [base fruit price] x [quality modifier] x [Artisan profession modifier] The base fruit price is the price of the fruit at normal quality, and doesn't include the Tiller profession value increase. The quality modifier is 1 for normal quality, 1.25 for silver quality, 1.5 for gold quality, and 2 for iridium quality. The Artisan profession modifier is 1.4 because it increases the value of your artisan goods by 40%."
