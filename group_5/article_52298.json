If you want to provide comfort to the best of your abilities, understand that it may take months or even years to deal with the loss. Offer support at the beginning, but keep him or her in mind later as well. Many people's support will fall off after a while.

Be a sympathetic ear, to the extent that you can, if he or she needs to express the painful set of emotions. He or she may want to talk about his or her relationship with the sibling while still alive. This can be a good way to memorialize the sibling. Avoid interjecting too much of your own feelings and experiences. You may have had a similar loss, but be mindful of being a burden with your own past. Your friend may need emotional space."

Helping him or her understand that a strong emotional reaction is both \"normal\" and \"understandable\" is a good way of showing support. [7] X Research source For example, you can say \"It's okay for you to be sad right now. I understand. I would feel the same way.\" You can also tell him or her that it's understandable if they have specific painful feelings related to being siblings (like guilt).

For example, you can say \"I'm worried about [name]. I think [he or she] is taking the loss really hard and needs support.\" Be mindful of other people's suffering.

[11] X Research source Memorize these steps so that you can figure out where your friend is at in the process and try to help with each specific step. Remember that people are different and some do not go through the stages in order and can revisit past stages before reaching acceptance. Denial is first. Denial of the reality of the loss is a normal reaction. It may seem like he or she doesn't realize the death of her sibling. It may not have set in yet. Anger comes next. Once the reality of the loss does set in, it's normal to experience anger over the loss. He or she may be angry at the sibling, at herself, or at someone else. Bargaining is third. This shows up as a desire to change the situation, such as wishing that he or she had done something differently. Depression is the fourth step. This is the stage where people mourn the loss and bid the person farewell. It's an essential step in the process of grieving. Acceptance is the final stage. After all of the stages of resistance to loss, acceptance is the stage where people finally come to terms. It's not happiness, but it is calm compared to the stages before it."

When talking to your friend or loved one and doing things for him or her, be aware of these difficult issues associated with the loss of a sibling.
