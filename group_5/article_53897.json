For example, you might say, “I’m writing to expression my opposition to House Bill 1248, which is currently up for debate in the House.” Stick to one issue. The more focused your email, the more likely it is to be read and taken into consideration by your representative or senator."

For instance, if you are a veteran and you are concerned about a proposal to reduce subsidized housing for veterans, say, \"As a veteran I am personally acquainted with the social and financial consequences of PTSD.\" Be sure to mention that you are a constituent of this senator or representative. If you will be adversely effected--or if you stand to benefit--from a congressional action, mention this and explain the likely ramifications."
