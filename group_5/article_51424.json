To begin, you must be able to identify what specific outcomes are possible. You should either list these or create a table to help define the results. [1] X Research source For example, suppose you have a standard deck of 52 playing cards, and you want to find the expected value, over time, of a single card that you select at random. You need to list all possible outcomes, which are: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, in each of four different suits."

Others may be self-evident numerical values, which would be the case for many dice games. In some cases, you may need to assign a value to some or all possible outcomes. This might be the case, for example, in a laboratory experiment where you might assign a value of +1 to a positive chemical reaction, a value of -1 to a negative chemical reaction, and a value of 0 if no reaction occurred. [2] X Research source In the example of the playing cards, traditional values are Ace = 1, face cards all equal 10, and all other cards have a value equal to the number shown on the card. Assign those values for this example."

      "content": "Determine the probability of each possible outcome. Probability is the chance that each particular value or outcome may occur. In some situations, like the stock market, for example, probabilities may be affected by some external forces. You would need to be provided with some additional information before you could calculate the probabilities in these examples. In a problem of random chance, such as rolling dice or flipping coins, probability is defined as the percentage of a given outcome divided by the total number of possible outcomes. [3] X Research source For example, with a fair coin, the probability of flipping a “Head” is 1/2, because there is one Head, divided by a total of two possible outcomes (Heads or Tails). In the example with the playing cards, there are 52 cards in the deck, so each individual card has a probability of 1/52. However, recognize that there are four different suits, and there are, for example, multiple ways to draw a value of 10. It may help to make a table of probabilities, as follows: 1 = 4/52 2 = 4/52 3 = 4/52 4 = 4/52 5 = 4/52 6 = 4/52 7 = 4/52 8 = 4/52 9 = 4/52 10 = 16/52 Check that the sum of all your probabilities adds up to a total of 1. Since your list of outcomes should represent all the possibilities, the sum of probabilities should equal 1."

These calculations will look like this: 1 ∗ 4 52 = 4 52 {\\displaystyle 1*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {4}{52}}} 2 ∗ 4 52 = 8 52 {\\displaystyle 2*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {8}{52}}} 3 ∗ 4 52 = 12 52 {\\displaystyle 3*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {12}{52}}} 4 ∗ 4 52 = 16 52 {\\displaystyle 4*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {16}{52}}} 5 ∗ 4 52 = 20 52 {\\displaystyle 5*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {20}{52}}} 6 ∗ 4 52 = 24 52 {\\displaystyle 6*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {24}{52}}} 7 ∗ 4 52 = 28 52 {\\displaystyle 7*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {28}{52}}} 8 ∗ 4 52 = 32 52 {\\displaystyle 8*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {32}{52}}} 9 ∗ 4 52 = 36 52 {\\displaystyle 9*{\\frac {4}{52}}={\\frac {36}{52}}} 10 ∗ 16 52 = 160 52 {\\displaystyle 10*{\\frac {16}{52}}={\\frac {160}{52}}}"

[5] X Research source For the example of the playing cards, the expected value is the sum of the ten separate products.

For example, EV applies well to gambling situations to describe expected results for thousands of gamblers per day, repeated day after day after day. However, the EV does not very accurately predict one particular outcome on one specific test. [6] X Research source For example, when drawing a playing card from a standard deck, on one specific draw, the likelihood of drawing a 2 is equal to the likelihood of drawing a 6 or 7 or 8 or any other numbered card. Over many many draws, the theoretical value to expect is 6.538. Obviously, there is no “6.538” card in the deck. But if you were gambling, you would expect to draw a card higher than 6 more often than not."

As with any EV problem, you must begin by defining all possible outcomes. Generally, real world situations are not as easily definable as something like rolling dice or drawing cards. For that reason, analysts will create models that approximate stock market situations and use those models for their predictions. [7] X Research source Suppose, for this example, that you can define 4 distinct results for your investment. These results are: 1. Earn an amount equal to your investment 2. Earn back half your investment 3. Neither gain nor lose 4. Lose your entire investment"

The assigned value of each outcome will be positive if you expect to earn money and negative if you expect to lose. In this problem, the four possible outcomes therefore have the following values, relative to the $1 investment: 1. Earn an amount equal to your investment = +1 2.
