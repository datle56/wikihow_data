      "content": "Capricorn men crave a deep, mental connection with their partners. Feel free to share your opinions, dreams, and experiences with your Capricorn man. Just be your transparent, straight-shooting self around him he'll relate to what you’re saying. The conversation between you two will drive itself, so don’t try to force anything. [1] X Research source Here are a few more conversation tips: State your opinions concretely. Try something like, “I don’t like reality TV” instead of “well, I don’t know, sometimes I don’t think reality TV is for me.” Use his name and make eye contact while you talk so he knows you’re interested in what he has to say. Clear, direct communication wins the day with this sign. If he responds to you in a similar way, it means he’s liking the conversation. Reader Poll: We asked 420 wikiHow readers what type of compatibilities are most important in a relationship, and 45% of them said emotional and trust. [Take Poll] There's no better way to build trust than sharing what you really think."

      "content": "A shy Capricorn man will be in awe of your tales of adventure. He’s normally reserved and practical, but your Sagittarius wanderlust and curiosity will pique his interest in exploring the world himself. Tell him all about your cross-country road trip or your last European backpacking trip and watch his eyes fill with wonder as he considers traversing the globe by your side. Give him exciting details to paint a vivid picture, like: “I had to run through the airport like a maniac with Chanel luggage so I could board on time” instead of “I almost missed my flight.” “I could barely keep my eyes open because all the ice was reflecting the sunlight back up at me” in place of “It was really sunny.” “This all-inclusive resort had me feeling like the tipsy Queen of California all week” instead of “the place I stayed was super nice.”"

      "content": "A quiet Cap will be fascinated by your ability to shine in the spotlight. As a Sagittarius, you know how to work a room, so invite your Capricorn guy to spend an evening with you and your friends. Let him watch as you dazzle everyone with your charisma and great conversation, and he’ll be dying to get to know you better. Caps are a bit shy and often socialize well only with their few close companions. [2] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. Take time to bring him into conversations so he can shine too. If your friends are squabbling over what the best wine is, you could say, “John’s dad used to work on a vineyard. Maybe he can settle this debate…” Be careful that your socializing doesn’t look like flirting with other guys. Your Capricorn will retreat back into his shell if he thinks he can’t hold your attention."

      "content": "Capricorn has a dry, sarcastic humor under his no-nonsense facade. As an outwardly funny jokester, you can prod him into loosening up and revealing more of his personality. He has a unique perspective on the world that he’ll share once he feels comfortable around you. [3] X Research source Try a joke about current events, like “Can I get a Blue Origin rocket on Amazon?” Or a satirical comment on something in pop culture, like “When I get out of bed, I’m an absolute monster before I have my morning viral TikTok.” Or just ask a whacky question, like “Do you think my new air filter will trap the ghost in my house?”"

His practical, business-like mind will appreciate a no-nonsense proposal, so take your shot, Archer! Try something short and sweet, like: “Hey! We should grab dinner this week.” “Do you want to grab coffee sometime this weekend?” “Nice Bulls jersey! We should watch the next game together.”"

      "content": "Capricorn men are sensitive and take offhand comments seriously. As a Sagittarius, you tend to be honest and a little blunt without thinking (it’s part of your charm!). He’s likely to misinterpret a comment as mean or a joke at his expense, so think before you say something about his appearance or behavior. Keep your thoughts inside if you think you’re at risk of offending him. A Capricorn man is pretty private and doesn’t like to broadcast himself to others. Be careful what you share about him to friends and family, since he might view your harmless talking as gossip about him."

      "content": "A Capricorn man tends to be a homebody rather than a party animal. This might shock your Sagittarius sensibilities, since you prefer to be out and about whenever you can. Compromise from time to time and stay in with him. He may be enthralled by your free spirit, but his needs and wants should be acknowledged too. These opposite tendencies are what attract you to each other. Please him by staying in occasionally, but don’t be afraid to prod him into joining you for a night out on the town too."

Your Sag wanderlust can’t be squashed, so invite your Capricorn man to join you on your next expedition, whether it’s across the ocean or just a few towns over. It might take some convincing, but if you can open him up to these feelings and show him the world, he’ll be hooked on you. Capricorn is more likely to let loose on a trip if he knows there’s a solid plan to follow. It might not be your style, but put together a travel itinerary to lure him out of the house and onto a flight."

      "content": "A Capricorn man is a workaholic who always contributes his fair share. The ever-wandering Sagittarius, on the other hand, has a tendency to get distracted and shirk some responsibilities. Make sure he knows you’re putting equal effort into your relationship, even if it means traveling a little less and staying in more. [4] X Research source Split everyday tasks evenly too. A Capricorn might grow resentful if he feels he is putting in most of the work towards cleaning, date planning, or unreciprocated favors for you. Capricorn men are usually reserved with their money. If you can, save up a bit and offer to pay for a date or go Dutch to share financial responsibilities too."

      "content": "You’re both natural communicators who aren’t coy when it comes to sex. As a fire sign, you tend to be more vibrant and flexible in bed than his earth sign, who sticks to a few moves that he does well.

PSA about PDA: Capricorn men prefer to keep physical affection in private and get uncomfortable with public romancing or touching. Since you’re more open and affectionate, be conscious of keeping your hands to yourself (until you’re alone together)."

      "content": "A Cap man is an ambitious worker that’s driven to meet his goals. He expects his partner to be too, and this is great news since you tend to thrive in your own life, with or without a partner. Continue being your successful, independent self at work and in your social life. The more you flourish personally, the more seriously he’ll consider you a potential partner. This is good news for Sagittarius women who love to travel and go out. Just remember that you might need to stay in with your Capricorn (or take him along) from time to time so he doesn’t feel neglected."

By the time you hit your goal, he’ll be head over heels for you. [7] X Research source Some example projects might be: Training for a 10K race together if you’re both athletic or competitive. A home improvement project, like painting the kitchen or rearranging the living room furniture. Raising money for a charity or nonprofit you both care about."
