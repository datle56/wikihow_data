      "title": "The Empress",
      "content": "The Empress The Empress is maybe the most significant card when performing a pregnancy tarot reading. Even when you’re not asking questions about pregnancy, the Empress signifies fertility, birth, and motherhood—she’s usually depicted as pregnant, after all. What’s more, she also represents acceptance, suggesting that you’ll be content and happy in your motherhood. [1] X Research source The Empress also signifies the cycle of motherhood and alludes to your own mother. The Empress often comes as a reminder not to make your own mother’s mistakes, so keep that in mind as you proceed with your reading. Similarly, The Emperor represents fatherhood, and may come up in readings for men or those with husbands to suggest that he may soon become a father. Love tarot?

      "title": "The Fool",
      "content": "The Fool The Fool is often depicted as a carefree youth setting off on a journey, accompanied by a dog and usually walking close to the edge of a cliff. [2] X Research source Despite its name and appearance, though, this is a favorable card to draw in a pregnancy reading. It suggests that you may have some anxieties about your current pregnancy or the prospect of motherhood, but your companions (your partner or friends) will help you every step of the way. The Fool might also suggest that it’s time to set off on your adventure. If you’ve been waiting to conceive, now may be the right time."

      "title": "The Sun",
      "content": "The Sun The Sun doesn’t have direct ties to pregnancy, but it does signify that a hope or a dream you’ve had for a long time will soon come to fruition. [3] X Research source When you’re doing a pregnancy reading, then, it’s likely that your dream is conception, and here comes the Sun to shed light on that dream. Or, if you’re currently pregnant, drawing the Sun suggests that you’ll have a safe and healthy pregnancy. The Sun also offers solace in infertility. If you’ve had trouble conceiving, this card may be asking you to find relief and joy in the other aspects of your life."

      "title": "The Moon",
      "content": "The Moon The Moon governs the tides and the rhythms of life. [4] X Research source Often, we’re unaware of those rhythms until they show themselves in an obvious way. In a pregnancy spread, drawing the Moon might suggest that you may be pregnant already and not yet know it. Or, it might simply be that pregnancy is in your future, when you hadn’t previously expected it. The Moon also represents healing, but only when you’re ready to receive it. If you’ve recently experienced a tragedy regarding pregnancy, this card might indicate good energies coming your way."

      "title": "The World",
      "content": "The World The World indicates that things are coming to fruition or to their natural conclusion. [5] X Research source This card often appears for women who are already pretty far along in their pregnancy, and affirms that their pregnancy journey is about to come to a safe and sound conclusion. If you’re not yet pregnant, the World may indicate the closing of one chapter of your life the start of the next—it could be that that next chapter includes pregnancy."

      "content": "The Hanged Man The Hanged Man is often associated with periods of suspension, waiting, or anticipation.

      "content": "Page of Pentacles This page represents manifestation through careful planning. [11] X Research source If you’ve been anticipating and working toward a pregnancy, it may signify that your goals are about to be achieved.

[15] X Research source When drawn in a pregnancy spread, it may mean that what you’ve been working hard for has been or will soon be achieved—most likely conception or pregnancy.

      "content": "Two of Cups This card represents a deep and profound bond between 2 souls. [18] X Research source While it’s often read as a romance card, in a pregnancy context it might symbolize the bond between a mother and her child. Alternatively, it might suggest that those 2 souls are, in fact, twins! Generally, the Two of Cups suggests good health, so long as you surround yourself with loved ones. Keep your family close during this period of waiting."

      "content": "Six of Cups The Six of Cups is associated with intense joy and your inner child. [19] X Research source Often, this is meant in a figurative way to represent your younger self, but in a pregnancy reading it might be taken literally—your “inner child” may literally mean a child growing within you, which is a positive sign for a pregnancy reading.

Remember that your cards are never working against you or revealing a certain future, only illuminating your own thoughts and spiritual state.

If your draw the Two of Cups, your pregnancy journey will bring your closer to another soul, whether that’s a child, a partner, or a friend. Note: If you draw the Death card at any point, don’t panic! It’s an ominous card, we know, but it has more to do with transformation and change than actual death. The Death card likely represents the significant lifestyle change that comes with being a mother."
