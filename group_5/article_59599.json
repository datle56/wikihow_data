      "content": "Run some warm up laps. You'll want to run at least a mile to prepare your body for the real race. Another strategy you might use is to jog moderately for a mile or two. You can then follow your jog with a final mile of form work. Keep your breathing even and controlled throughout your warmup. You'll want your arms to drive forward without deviating to the left or the right. Each arm should be parallel to the track. Your head should be relaxed with a slightly lowered chin, but your eyes should be up and alert. Shoulders should be back which should thrust your chest into a slightly taller position. When running, your chest should be tall, but not overextended in front of you. [1] X Research source"

These can be added to your warm up laps, or you can dynamically stretch after your lap work. There are many dynamic stretches you might use when warming up, but a few to consider include: Front lunges Reverse lunges High steppers (also called high knees), where you raise your knees as high as possible while jogging or at a light run. Butt kickers, where you kick your feet toward your butt each time one passes behind you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pre-hydrate lightly and take accepted supplements. Of course, you shouldn't take any illegal performance enhancing substances, which can be dangerous to your health. However, some runners take energy gel caps to give themselves a legal boost. You should also drink a little bit of water, but you probably shouldn't drink any more than an 8 oz glass. Drinking too much water before your race can affect your performance and may even cause you to get sick during or after the race. Avoid overloading on carbs the night before. Instead, you should eat reasonable portions of carbs, like pasta, several days before your race. Wake up a little earlier than usual and eat a leisurely, balanced breakfast several hours before your race to sustain your energy levels.

      "content": "Start strong and beeline for lane one. The inside two lanes are the strongest positioning due to the fact these give an advantage in the turns of the race. After you receive your start signal, you should run the first 10 to 20 meters at a pace a little faster than normal. As soon as you are able to get to the inside two lanes without impeding anyone, do so. Lane one, the innermost lane, is the lane with the best advantage. You should stick in lane one whenever possible. If your race makes use of a staggered start for runners, also called a waterfall start, make your way to the inside lanes as soon as possible."

      "content": "Avoid getting boxed in. Runners get “boxed in” when they are surrounded by others and cannot break free of the grouping without changing their rhythm. Getting boxed in early can lead to your best pace being hindered by other runners. There is also the risk that other runners may intentionally hedge you into a less favorable position for later in the race. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Moderate your pace for the first lap.",
      "content": "Moderate your pace for the first lap. Off the blocks, you and the other runners will likely be at a slightly faster pace than normal. This is a result of adrenaline and is completely normal, though you should be careful not to overexert yourself. Doing so can create difficulty for you later in the race when your energy starts flagging. Though you don't want to be caught up in the adrenaline rush and burn yourself out on the first lap, you should also be careful that the pack does not pull too far ahead of you. Your first 400 m, which is also your first lap, should be no faster than four or five seconds under your target splits. Your split time is your total time for any point during your run. In a mile race your split times might look like 1:05, 2:10, 3:15 and 4:20 for each lap. Split times gauge your time according to specified waypoints (turns, miles, laps), as though your run had ended there. Remember to stay in lane one whenever possible.

      "content": "Plan your speed by turn. If you aim to make a 4:20 minute mile, it may help you to escalate your speed with regard to turns. Your first lap (which is made up of two turns) was likely a little fast, probably about the pace of a 4:00 minute mile, or a 1:00 minute split. Lap two you should ease up, but by the time you go into your third turn, you should be at a 4:10 minute pace. In your fourth turn, you'll want to be back at a 4:00 minute mile pace. Your second lap should be significantly slower than your first, but not so slow that the pack pulls too far ahead of you."

Boxing out other runners at this point can put you in better positioning for the end of the race. Keep your surge short to conserve energy and prevent your body from slipping into the anaerobic zone. Limit any surge you do at this point to a maximum distance of 20 m. Any farther and you run the risk of inducing your body's anaerobic response. You'll want to save anaerobic effort for later in the race. [11] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source"

This is because you can't kick your pace into high gear yet, but since you're already half a mile into the race, your body will be hurting. You should begin to gain on other runners at this point. Conserve your energy, but close gaps and pass everyone you can without pushing yourself too hard. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Control your breathing. You will be breathing heavily at this point, but you shouldn't be gasping out of control. Lap three is oftentimes the slowest lap. Aim for your pace to be two or three seconds above race pace, maximum. Your split for your third lap should be 1:08, which is the slowest possible to keep you a contender for finishing your mile at a respectable 4:20 minute pace."

      "content": "Accelerate steadily for the last 400 m lap. A good tactic at this point will be for you to set your focus on a runner ahead of you. Start your acceleration as soon as you cross into the final lap. The first 100 m should be taken in a stride. Keep your elbows at 90º and pump your arms parallel to the track. When the first place runner crosses the start line into the final lap, also called the bell lap, a signal will be given, like a gunshot. Your head position should be straight with your chin in a slightly downward position and your eyes up and focused. Keep your shoulders back to keep your posture strong and your chest tall. You'll want to be light on your feet and you should keep your knees up. [13] X Research source"

You should feel a wave of adrenaline at about the 1400 m mark; use this to your advantage to push your speed to the limit in the last 200 m. In the last 100 m, you should be running at your top speed. Keep your form tight and clean; sloppiness is common due to exhaustion. Your final lap should be almost as fast, if not faster, than your first lap.

      "content": "Hydrate to replenish your fluids. Some individuals sweat more than others, but after you've heated up for the race, run the race, and cooled down, it's likely you've been sweating pretty consistently for at least 20 minutes. This is a considerable amount of lost moisture that you'll need to replace. Once you feel well enough, you should drink some warm water to rehydrate. [17] X Research source Warm water is gentler on your system and won't cause your stomach to spasm or clench uncomfortably. These sensations in your stomach can lead to nausea or vomiting if you're not careful. Your body will also have lost electrolytes, which are important minerals your body needs to function. The primary electrolytes you'll need to be concerned with replenishing are sodium (salt) and potassium. Sodium replacement tablets are an excellent resource for serious runners, but regular salt can also be dissolved in water, salty snacks consumed, or raw salt eaten to restore your body's sodium levels. Potassium can be restored through eating certain potassium rich foods, like bananas, avocadoes, and beans.
