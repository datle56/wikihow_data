Shake the bottle so the two ingredients mix together. [2] X Research source Keep the water and vinegar in proportion with each other. If you use 2 cups (470 ml) of vinegar, also use 2 cups (470 ml) of water. For most shower doors, a small spray bottle that you can pick up from a supermarket is perfect.
