Smoothen the edges of the drywall with coarse sandpaper and a sanding block. Utilize homemade 2-by-4 T-braces to assist yourself and a partner when installing the drywall. Rent a cradle lift for assistance if you are installing the drywall panels yourself. Nail the drywall into place, leaving 6-inch (15 cm) intervals between the nails. Dimple the drywall by giving the nail an extra hit to break the surface material."
