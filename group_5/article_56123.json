      "content": "Check neighborhood rules. Before building a fence, it will be important to determine if you are allowed to build a fence at all. Building one in an unapproved way can get you a fine and require you to tear the whole thing down. Before building, check what your local neighborhood rules or homeowner’s association rules are regarding fences. If the fence will be built on a shared property line, then try talking with your neighbor to find out if they’d be willing to share the cost of the fence with you."

      "content": "Check city codes. Cities often also have rules about building fences. You will need to check what they are before building one. Some cities require permits to build a fence of any height, some only above a certain height. Find out if you need a permit or if there are any other restrictions on your building."

      "content": "Obtain a permit. If you find out that you do need a permit, get one before building. These usually cost a little money and can be obtained from your local City Hall or Planning Department. [1] X Research source Make sure to call the Digline at 811 before you start digging."

      "title": "Choose your materials.",
      "content": "Choose your materials. It is important to decide what kind of fence you want. There are many different types of materials, all with different benefits and downsides. You will need to consider how much time you want to spend on upkeep, how much money you have to spend to build the fence, and how long the fence will need to remain in its location. [2] X Research source A wood fence is the most common. These last between 5-20 years, depending on the type of wood (cedar will last longer than pine, for example), and are they relatively inexpensive. Wood fences may be difficult to clean, however, if they get paint on them. Vinyl fences will last much longer than a wood fence, up to a lifetime if using quality vinyl. They can come in a variety of colors that should not fade over time and are easily cleaned if they get paint on them. They are, however, slightly more expensive in terms of upfront costs. Brick is an option if you dislike the look of wood or vinyl fences, or if you feel the need for something more sturdy. You can use actual brick or you can use concrete block . The concrete block can be further covered in cobble or plaster for a \"Southwestern\" look. Concrete blocks can also be turned perpendicular to each other to create planters in your wall. Any kind of masonry construction, however, will be much more expensive than the other options, although it will last longer than wood. Growing or green fences are a great option if your city is very restrictive about permits or permits are very expensive. They are also good if you would prefer more greenery in your yard, rather than looking at a fence. You can plant Arborvitae, an evergreen shrub which grows three feet a year, put in an iron or chain fence and train ivy on it, or grow more standard hedges like holly. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Find post locations. Using string tied to stakes, determine the perimeter of your fence and mark the corner locations, as well as measuring and marking the locations of the intermediate posts (if they are needed). The distance between posts is up to you but keep in mind the normal spacing is 8 feet (2.4 m) from center to center. Mark all locations with spray paint or stake holes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Dig post holes. Using a post-holer, dig holes at least ¼ to ⅓ the height of your intended fence. Make sure you follow the rules stipulated in your permit, as many cities have rule regarding hole depth. You don’t want to hit a water main! [5] X Research source Remember to call the Digline at 811 before you dig! [6] X Research source Water mains are usually placed at least 4 ft in the ground so in most cases a 16 to 24 inch deep posthole should be safe. You can use a manual digger or a motorized auger. Both can often be rented from your local hardware store."

      "content": "Place posts. Use 4x4 posts at your preferred height (factoring in the depth of the hole) and place them one at a time. This may require a helping hand. Varying the depth of the hole to keep the height of the posts the same is much more labor intensive than digging the post hole to approximately the same depth of each hole and cutting off the top of the posts after they have set for 24 hours. It is also important to seal the tops of posts to protect them from rainwater damage."

Pour in the concrete, mix with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and continue to use the level as it sets to be sure that it stays straight. Alternatively, mix the quick-set concrete in a bucket or wheelbarrow and then pour it in. You will want to continue to use string to make sure the posts are in line with each other."

With that marked, nail the 1x4 flat to the end of the top and bottom (and possibly middle) rails. The rails should then be perpendicular and as a 90° turn from the 1x4 board, looking a little like a T (if viewed from the side, you should see the 1” side of the 1x4 and the 4” side of the 2x4). Do this for each end of the rail."
