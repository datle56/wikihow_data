      "title": "Back your device up before downloading new software.",
      "content": "Back your device up before downloading new software. Beta software is unstable, and sometimes this can lead to some big headaches on your end. You have a few ways of storing your device’s contents in case something goes wrong. The easiest way is to upload your data to iCloud through your device’s settings menu. [3] X Research source On a Mac, use the preinstalled Time Machine program to back up your data. You can also use iTunes to back up most iOS devices. If you do not back up your device, you may end up losing important data, such as pictures and phone numbers stored on your device."

You may find some new features to play around with, but mostly you use your device as you normally would. When you find bugs or broken features, use the Feedback Assistant app to send a message to Apple. [5] X Research source The app is included with any software updates you receive from Apple. You can access the Feedback Assistant through other apps. Simply open the app’s help menu and press “Send Feedback.”"

This program is different from the Beta Software program because you get exclusive access to new, unreleased software programs and features.

Getting an invitation depends on what products Apple has available and how suited you are to testing them. This isn’t guaranteed, so you may need to wait an indefinite amount of time. [9] X Research source While you wait, you can learn more about testing. The more you know about operating digital devices, the likelier you are to be chosen as a tester.

[10] X Research source Apple will give you questionnaires and bug reports to complete. They also give you access to a discussion forum online. If you want to be chosen for future testing, make sure you give all the feedback Apple wants."
