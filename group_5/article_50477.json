      "content": "Trim the tape to fit your nails if you’re using fashion tape. Since fashion tape comes in a long roll, you’ll need to use scissors to cut the pieces to fit your nail. Your nails are all different sizes, to try to cut each piece to fit an individual nail, rather than cutting them all the same size. If it’s easier, you can stack 2 layers of tape together and cut 2 pieces at the same time. For instance, if you measure the piece for one of your thumbs, you could cut out 2 thumb pieces together, since they’ll probably need to be about the same size."

However, avoid using colored polish, because it will be visible if some does come out from beneath the nail when you apply it. Alternately, you can apply the polish to your natural nail first."
