      "title": "Dead battery",
      "content": "Dead battery The battery is the source of power that helps the starter turn over, so if you turn the key and literally nothing happens, your battery is likely dead. This is easily the most common cause of an engine not turning over—especially if you haven’t driven the vehicle recently, there’s corrosion on the battery terminals, or it’s extremely cold out. [1] X Research source Car batteries typically need to be replaced every 3-5 years, just for future reference. The fix : The battery needs to be replaced. Luckily, this is a very cheap DIY job. Purchase a new battery for your vehicle and install it using a wrench. If you prefer, have a mechanic do it for you. The cost : A new car battery usually costs around $150. A mechanic shouldn’t charge more than $250 or so."

      "title": "Loose battery connection",
      "content": "Loose battery connection If the battery is fine but you’re still not getting any noise or reaction when you turn the key in the ignition, your battery may not be connected properly. With a cold engine, inspect the terminals on the battery to make sure the cables are secured. Then, follow the cables to ensure they aren’t torn or damaged. [2] X Research source The fix : If the cables are damaged, see a mechanic to have them replaced. Otherwise, use pliers or a wrench to tighten the terminal connections. The cost : If you do need new cables, expect to spend $100-400 depending on how complex the wiring is."

      "title": "Bad ignition switch",
      "content": "Bad ignition switch The ignition switch completes the electrical circuit running from the starter to the batter so that voltage can flow. If you know for a fact that the battery is okay and the terminals are properly connecting, no noise when you turn the key over points to a bad ignition switch. [3] X Research source The ignition switch is also likely to blame if your car is also stalling. When an ignition switch starts to go bad, the car will tend to lose power and stall randomly. The fix : See a mechanic to have a new ignition switch installed. The cost : This isn’t a pricey repair. Expect to pay a mechanic $150-300."

    {
      "title": "Dead starter",
      "content": "Dead starter The starter is a small motor that fires when the ignition switch turns over. It sends the initial burst of energy to the spark plugs so that your engine can start. If the starter is dead, your car won’t turn on. Normally, a dead starter should cause a clicking noise when you turn the key, but it’s possible you don’t hear it or you have a silent model that isn’t making any sound. [4] X Research source The fix : The starter needs to be swapped out for a new one, so see a mechanic. The cost : You’ll pay anywhere from $80-350 depending on how complicated the repair is."

      "title": "Bad starter solenoid",
      "content": "Bad starter solenoid The starter solenoid is a small electromagnet that activates to kick the starter motor on. If it’s not working, nothing will activate when you turn the key—even though the starter itself is perfectly fine. As a note, a bad solenoid will normally cause the ignition to click once instead of not making any noises at all. [5] X Research source The fix : The solenoid needs to be replaced, so see a mechanic to have them install one. The cost : You’ll likely pay $80-150 for a new starter solenoid."

      "title": "Dead starter relay",
      "content": "Dead starter relay The starter relay is a component of the starter motor. It’s the electrical piece that actually sends the charge produced by the starter to the engine. If it’s bad, your starter’s energy won’t make it to the spark plugs. A dead starter relay will normally click when it’s bad, but it’s possible you won’t hear anything depending on the starter’s position and model. [6] X Research source The fix : The starter relay needs to be swapped out. Depending on the age of your starter, your mechanic may recommend simply replacing the entire starter. In any case, see a mechanic. The cost : A bad starter relay will cost about the same as a new starter. Expect to pay $150-300."

      "title": "Bad automatic shutdown (ASD) relay (American cars only)",
      "content": "Bad automatic shutdown (ASD) relay (American cars only) In Fords, Chevys, Jeeps, and other American brands, the ASD relay powers the ignition coils, fuel injectors, and alternators. If the ASD relay is no good, your car won’t start or make noise. The fuel injectors and coils won’t be able to power on so nothing will happen when you turn the key. [7] X Research source The fix : See a dealer mechanic. A non-specialized mechanic may struggle to catch this one. The relay needs to be replaced but it’s a professional repair. The cost : The automatic shutdown relay is a relatively fringe component to go bad, so the cost varies dramatically from make to model. You may spend anywhere from $150-1,000 on this."

      "title": "Missing ground",
      "content": "Missing ground The starter, alternator, and battery all generate current. But if there’s a missing ground connection somewhere in any of those three systems, the current will fizzle out immediately. Because batteries are grounded via the negative terminal and chassis and you don’t need the alternator to start the car, a missing ground along the starter system will cause nothing to happen when you crank the engine. [8] X Research source This is especially likely to be the case if you’ve got an older car or you’ve done any work on the car yourself. The fix : The entire starter system needs to be inspected by a professional. Every make and model has its own wiring setup, and grounding an electrical system can be tricky, so see a pro. The cost : It really depends on your make and model. You’ll likely spend $200-500 depending on how complex the starter system is."

      "content": "If the battery is brand new, the issue is most likely starter-related. If you’ve swapped the battery out and nothing happens when you crank the engine, the odds are very high that the battery was never the issue in the first place. The starter system is almost positively the problem if you’re cranking the engine and you don’t hear anything happening. [9] X Research source It is possible that you didn’t install the battery properly, so double-check your work there first before assuming anything"

      "title": "No clicking means the starter isn’t engaging at all.",
      "content": "No clicking means the starter isn’t engaging at all. That clicking noise is the starter motor engaging. It’s basically a big magnet that spins around. When it spins, it clinks against the housing. Since you aren’t hearing anything, it means that magnet isn’t moving at all, so there’s some issue with the starter. Either the starter itself is bad, or the battery isn’t feeding any power to the starter. [10] X Research source"
