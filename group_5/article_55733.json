      "content": "Inside your device and a wireless charger there are metal coils. The coil in the charger is called a \"transmitter coil\" and the coil in the device is called a \"receiver coil\". The transmitter coil sends a signal to find a receiver coil, and once it senses one, an electromagnetic field is created that generates an electrical current, which is then converted into direct current (DC) by the device. This current will then charge the device's battery. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "There are two types of wireless charging, called inductive and resonant. Inductive charging requires the device to be in contact with the charger, such as being set on a mat or using a MagSafe charger connected to the back of your device. Resonant charging requires the device and charger to be close, but they don't need to be touching."
