Use a foundation brush or makeup sponge to buff your favorite full coverage foundation all over your face. [1] X Research source For a smooth, pore-less look, apply primer before your foundation. Apply full coverage concealer under your eyes to cover dark circles. For a brightening effect, use concealer that’s 1 shade lighter than your natural skin tone. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Bright pink blush was the standard for most 80s looks. Start high on your cheekbone and sweep the color along the bone and up, all the way to your temple. Once you hit your temple, use circular motions to blend the blush out toward your hairline. If it’s easier, start applying blush at your temple and brush it down along your cheekbone in a “C” shape."

      "content": "Try vibrant blue or bright pink eye makeup for high drama. Use the most pigmented eyeshadow you can find! Cover your entire eyelid with medium blue or pink and blend it up to your brows. Brush the color under your eyes to define the lower lashes. Then, sweep a darker version of the original shade in your crease and on the outer third of your eyelid, blending out to your temples. Finish with bold pink lipstick. [3] X Research source For a Blondie vibe, try mauve or dark pink eyeshadow. Her cheeks and eyes often matched, so you use your blush as eyeshadow! Finish with matte or frosted pink lipstick. For more glam rock inspiration, check out images of Grace Jones and glam metal bands like Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, or KISS. For super sharp, angled cheeks, contour your cheeks with bronzer before adding blush on top."

Crimp each section top to bottom, then tease your hair gently and lock the style in place with hairspray. [11] X Research source You can still buy crimpers online and at big box stores."
