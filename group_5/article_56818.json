Make sure that they are completely cold. If you wish, you can even swirl different frostings together as long as they have the same consistence, for example buttercream and chocolate ganache. Or, you can use the same kind of frosting but of different colors. Layer your frostings on a piece of plastic wrap, and then roll it like a sandwich. If you wish, you can put some filling inside your cupcakes. Use an apple corer to make the hole in the cupcake, then fill them with whatever you like using a piping bag."
