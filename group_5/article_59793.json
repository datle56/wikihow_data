      "title": "Try to play with your budgie.",
      "content": "Try to play with your budgie. If your budgie doesn't seem interested in any of its toys and isn't interested in playing with you, this could be a sign that your bird isn't feeling its best – especially if it's normally active and playful. [1] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. A budgie that's feeling under the weather may seem sluggish or lacking in energy, even if it does make an effort to respond to you or play with you. If your budgie bites you when you stick out your finger or attempt to play with it, this is another sign that it might be sick. Budgies don't usually bite, but if they are sick they may bite because they are scared or in pain. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Listen for changes in vocalization.",
      "content": "Listen for changes in vocalization. Budgies are normally fairly talkative. However, changes in the way your bird normally vocalizes may signal that it's ill or stressed. Screaming or screeching may be a sign that your bird is in pain. On the other hand, if your budgie stops vocalizing as much as it normally did, that could also be a sign that your bird is ill. [3] X Research source Screaming or screeching may also be a sign that your bird is bored or unhappy for some other reason. Look at its environment for clues. If it hasn't had its favourite food in a while, or if it can't access its favourite toys, it may simply be upset or bored. If a non-vocal bird also seems lethargic, this is a strong sign that your bird is feeling sick."

      "title": "Monitor your budgie's eating.",
      "content": "Monitor your budgie's eating. If your budgie is sick, it likely won't eat. A decreased appetite is a common sign of a medical problem. If your budgie isn't eating, it will start to lose weight, which can cause additional health problems and put a lot of stress on your bird. [4] X Research source Distinguish eaten seed from edible seed in your bird's food dish. Hulls can be mistaken for whole seeds, so it may look like your bird has plenty of food when in fact it has none."

    {
      "title": "See how long your budgie remains silent and motionless.",
      "content": "See how long your budgie remains silent and motionless. A healthy budgie is seldom stationary when it is awake. If your bird sits still and quiet for long periods of time, this may be a sign that it isn't feeling well. [5] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Because budgies are prey animals, if they're sick they instinctively avoid attracting attention. They know that predators will go after birds that are sick or weak. If your budgie is keeping to itself and trying to avoid attention, it likely isn't feeling well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for changes in perching behaviour.",
      "content": "Check for changes in perching behaviour. Budgies are creatures of habit and may have a favourite perch that they like to use. They also tend to perch higher up in the cage. If your budgie is hanging out on the floor of the cage, it's likely ill. [6] X Research source If you have several birds, one who is sick will typically want to isolate itself from the others. This often involves hiding on the ground where the other birds won't bother it."

    {
      "title": "Move well away from the cage to observe your bird.",
      "content": "Move well away from the cage to observe your bird. Because budgies are prey animals, they may try to act normal and disguise their true weaknesses if you're nearby and they know you're watching them. [7] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. This is a survival instinct because predators target weak prey. You may notice more strange behaviour if you put some distance between yourself and the birdcage, or sit where the bird won't be aware of your presence. If you have a webcam or other video monitor, you might set that up with a view of the cage and watch from a distance that way. If you're in another room, the budgie won't have any idea that you're watching it."

      "title": "Notice how often your budgie puffs up its feathers.",
      "content": "Notice how often your budgie puffs up its feathers. A healthy budgie will puff up its feathers to get warm or as a way to relax before going to sleep. However, if your budgie puffs up its feathers will awake and stays that way for a longer period of time, it may also be sick. [8] X Research source Check the ambient air temperature in and around the cage as well. The temperature should be between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C). If the cage is near a draft, it may be too cool for your budgie at certain times of day."

      "title": "Look for poorly preened feathers.",
      "content": "Look for poorly preened feathers. Look for feathers that are ragged or greasy looking. Since proper grooming of feathers is essential for a bird's survival in the wild, poor grooming is a strong sign that your budgie is sick. [9] X Research source If there are faces sticking to your budgie's vent feathers, that can also be a good sign that your bird is under the weather."

      "title": "Check to see if your budgie is underweight.",
      "content": "Check to see if your budgie is underweight. Provided your bird will let you touch it, feel for the bone that runs down the centre of its chest – known as the keel bone. If it sticks out like a razor, this indicates the bird is starving. If your bird is healthy, you should barely be able to even feel this bone when you run your finger down the bird's chest. [10] X Research source Significant weight loss can be dangerous to small birds like budgies, and indicates that your bird is in poor health."

      "title": "Examine the colour and consistency of your budgie's droppings.",
      "content": "Examine the colour and consistency of your budgie's droppings. Loose or runny droppings can be a sign that your budgie is sick. [11] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Lumpy droppings with undigested food also signal that your budgie's digestive system isn't working properly. If the colour or consistency of your budgie's droppings has changed, take a sample with you to the vet for further analysis. If you have several birds, you may need to isolate the bird you think is sick so you can more easily determine which bird's droppings have changed."

      "title": "Check if your budgie's nose (cere) is abnormally wet or crusted over.",
      "content": "Check if your budgie's nose (cere) is abnormally wet or crusted over. Your budgie's nose is just above the widest part of its bill. Normally, it should be dry and clear. If you notice discharge or wetness around the nose, or if dried moisture has crusted around it, that's a sign that your budgie has respiratory problems. [12] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. Occasional sneezing is normal in budgies, just as it is in people. But if your budgie is sneezing consistently or its nose is always moist, your bird is probably sick."

      "title": "Listen for rapid breathing.",
      "content": "Listen for rapid breathing. If your budgie is breathing rapidly out of its mouth, this may be an additional sign that its nose is clogged up and it's having difficulty breathing. A budgie that is breathing out of its mouth typically sits puffed up with its beak partially open. [13] X Research source If your budgie is bobbing its tail up and down as it breathes, this is another sign that it's having difficulty breathing."

      "title": "Take your budgie to an avian vet as soon as you notice signs of illness.",
      "content": "Take your budgie to an avian vet as soon as you notice signs of illness. Budgies frequently hide symptoms that they're sick, especially in the beginning stages of an illness. By the time the signs are obvious enough for you to notice, your bird may be extremely ill. [14] X Research source Budgies tend to go downhill very quickly. Consider any sign of illness to be a medical emergency."

      "title": "Quarantine your sick budgie from other birds.",
      "content": "Quarantine your sick budgie from other birds. If you have several birds, separate the sick one as soon as possible so the sickness doesn't spread to the others. Even if you only have one budgie, it's a good idea to move it to a smaller cage so it can recover from the illness. [15] X Research source Thoroughly clean the cage and replace all food and water before allowing any of your birds back. This helps prevent the spread of disease. Watch your other birds carefully to make sure none of them caught the illness from your sick budgie."

    {
      "title": "Place your budgie's cage in a warm, quiet spot while it recovers.",
      "content": "Place your budgie's cage in a warm, quiet spot while it recovers. While budgies are normally fine in ambient temperatures of between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C), a sick budgie needs a little more warmth. Unless your budgie is running a fever, keep its cage in a small room with a temperature of up to 90 °F (32 °C). [16] X Research source You can use a heating pad under the cage or heat lamps to increase the temperature in the cage. If you use heat lamps, don't leave them on at night."

    {
      "title": "Expose the recovery cage to natural sunlight.",
      "content": "Expose the recovery cage to natural sunlight. Sunlight provides your bird with vital vitamin D, which can improve its mood and hasten its recovery. Expose your sick bird to as much as 8 hours of direct sunlight a day. If you live in an area where you don't get much natural sunlight, try full-spectrum lamps to provide your sick budgie with the UVA and UVB rays it needs."

    {
      "title": "Reduce stress on the bird as much as possible while it recovers.",
      "content": "Reduce stress on the bird as much as possible while it recovers. Place the cage out of the way, where the sick bird won't be disturbed by people or other pets. Keep a cover over one side of the cage, lowering it over the entire cage at night. [17] X Research source A sick bird should get at least 12 hours of sleep each day. Limit handling of the bird and make sure the bird's sleep is not interrupted. Don't put any toys or other distractions in your budgie's recovery cage. These items may keep the bird from sleeping or encourage it to be active. If you have perches in the recovery cage, they should be low enough that your budgie won't be injured if it falls off."
