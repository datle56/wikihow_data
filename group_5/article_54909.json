      "content": "The faster you start treating the stain, the better the result. Poop stains, especially the yellow kind from breastfed newborns, can be tougher to remove when they set in. Quickly remove the clothes from your baby and place them in cool water if you can’t immediately treat the stain. This will keep the stain from setting in.

      "content": "Removing solid poop by hand makes cleaning much easier. Since washing the clothes with a lot of poop on them can cause the poop to spread, use a paper towel or baby wipe to take out as much poop as possible. Gently pick the poop off the clothes, trying not to rub it in, as this can make the stain worse.

      "content": "Cold, running water can wash away additional poop particles. Take the clothes to a sink, then turn on the cold water faucet. Let the stream of water pour through the side of the clothes that wasn’t pooped on, so that it can push additional poop particles down the drain. The running water will help you remove more poop than you may have been able to reach by hand.

      "content": "Pre-treat the poop stains for 30 minutes to break them down. Since poop stains are protein-based, it’s best to use an enzymatic cleaner . Spray the enzymatic cleaner on the stains, and allow it to sit for about 30 minutes. The cleaner will break down the protein particles in the poop, allowing it to wash off much more easily. [4] X Research source Many parents swear by Fels Naptha as a miracle when cleaning up poop stains. When the clothes are wet, rub this laundry bar on the stain and allow it to sit for a few minutes. [5] X Research source If the stain is older or more set-in, soak the clothing in the enzyme cleaner for several hours or overnight. [6] X Research source For heavy-duty poop stains, you may need a more intensive pre-treatment. If there’s a lot of poop, soak the clothes in a bucket of hot water mixed with a scoop of OxiClean for a couple of hours.

A harsh heat cycle in the dryer can make these stains permanent, so air-dry the clothes for at least an hour before transferring them to the drier. If you still see stains, run the clothes through the wash one more time, pre-treating the stain again beforehand. [14] X Research source"
