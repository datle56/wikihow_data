In APA style, you should be as precise as possible. Use title case capitalization. That means that you capitalize important words, such as nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives, but that you don't capitalize unimportant words, such as articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Basically, you don't capitalize words that are three letters or fewer unless they are at the beginning of a title or after punctuation. [2] X Research source"

Generally it should be fewer than 50 characters long. Use your document's running page numbers to add a page number to the upper right-hand corner. You only need to add the number, not \"p.\" or \"pg.\" To add a header in most newer word processing systems, simply double click in the header area at the top of the page. You won't be able to see the area before you click. However, just double-click near the top of the page, and it should bring up the header section. You will also have to click \"Different First Page\" at the top of the screen, as your other headers will omit \"Running head:\" and just use the title of your paper in all capital letters."
