      "content": "Pisces tends to be fragile and easily offended. Being sensitive is a good thing, but water sign Pisces takes sensitivity to a whole new level. These soft-hearted folks are idealistic and a bit insecure, so constructive criticism and even neutral comments can sometimes upset them. By nature, Pisces is extremely empathetic—they are very sensitive to other people’s emotions and feel them deeper than any other sign in the zodiac. [1] X Research source If you're a Pisces who wants to develop a thicker skin, there are things you can do to become more resilient. For example, try to keep in mind that constructive criticism from loved ones comes from a place of kindness rather than judgement. They want to help you live your best life! Choose your words with care around a Pisces to avoid hurting their feelings. If you do need to offer constructive criticism, work it in gently between a couple of genuine compliments. Pisces is associated with the element of water, which governs the emotions. Water signs are naturally intuitive and sensitive, and they base their actions on their feelings rather than logic.

      "content": "Pisces' indulgent mood swings can be a roller coaster. Sensitive Pisces is constantly reacting to everything around them, so their emotional state is always shifting. They can be in a great mood one minute and melancholy the next, and you never really know what frame of mind they’re going to be in. This inconsistency tends to cause problems for them, especially when it comes to maintaining relationships, and sometimes even leads to disappearing and ghosting the partner. [3] X Research source If you're a Pisces, experiment with ways to get control over your mood swings . Starting an exercise routine, limiting caffeine and alcohol, and getting plenty of rest each night are a few easy ways to feel more in control of your temperament. To their credit, gentle Pisces doesn't take their moods out on others—they retreat to a private space where they can work through what they're feeling on their own. Pisces is a mutable sign, which means they’re always changing and showing different sides of themselves. Mutable signs can be nearly impossible to pin down because they never stay in the same place for long. If you'd like to learn more about mutable signs, check out our article on modalities ."

      "content": "These kind souls fail to set boundaries to protect themselves. Empathetic Pisces is a beacon for all kinds of energy—positive, negative, and everything in between. Because Pisces absorbs the emotions of people around them, they're often weighed down with problems that don’t really belong to them—and that can be a heavy load to bear. It’s in Pisces' nature to help everyone, but without personal boundaries in place, they usually end up emotionally drained and exhausted. If you're a Pisces, work on setting boundaries when you interact with others. For example, you might say to a friend, \"I love our friendship, but sometimes it feels like you're dumping a lot of emotions on me. I'm here for you, but it can be a lot sometimes. Can you come to me for advice once you've sorted out your feelings about the situation?\""

      "content": "Idealistic Pisces is known for being a bit clingy in relationships. Pisces is a romantic at heart and they absolutely love the idea of being in love. They have a hard time detaching themselves from their romantic interests and they want to stay in touch with them constantly. Getting bombarded with texts and DMs can make people feel smothered, though, so potential lovers and friends sometimes push Pisces away. Pisces essentially wants to merge souls with their partners, and even though this can be sweet at first, it’s not good for either person in the long run. Pisces, stay busy with a few hobbies and distractions to ensure you're giving your SO plenty of space. Curious about which zodiac signs Pisces is most (and least) compatible with?

      "content": "Pisces can be inattentive since their head is always in the clouds. People born under this sign are notorious daydreamers—which isn’t always a bad thing! But whimsical Pisces tends to gets lost in their fantasy worlds, which explains that faraway look they always have in their eye. If though they aren't doing it on purpose, their constant daydreaming causes them to be forgetful, late, and just plain neglectful at times.

For example, creating a daily schedule and to-do list can help you stay on top of the things you need to do and remember important dates."

      "content": "Pisces struggles to make decisions (and may even refuse to). Making decisions is a challenge for Pisces because emotions get in the way of their logical thinking abilities. They would much rather have someone else (like their partner) make decisions on their behalf. When they feel backed into a corner, Pisces retreats into a private space to daydream instead of making the necessary decisions. [5] X Research source Pisces, to be more decisive, practice making low-stakes decisions first (like where you want to eat on your next lunch date). As you get more comfortable calling the shots, make bigger decisions, and keep going from there."

      "content": "Their trusting nature often causes Pisces to get taken advantage of. Gentle Pisces sees the best in everyone, they can’t help it—which means they miss crucial red flags that might be obvious to a lot of other signs. They’re malleable and easy to manipulate, and problematic people (like narcissists) can smell those qualities from a mile away. In relationships, Pisces are easy to lead on, and unfortunately some people prey on that particular vulnerability, too. [6] X Research source Pisces, to get better at spotting red flags in relationships, try to take things slow. Get to know the person on a real level before taking the relationship further. As an intuitive water sign, you can trust your gut about this person, but it's important to tune into what your gut is telling you."

      "content": "Pisces tends to make reckless choices based on their feelings. It’s true that Pisces dislikes making decisions, but when they do, they usually don’t put too much logical thought into them! This passionate sign gets carried away easily, especially in romantic situations, and this can be wonderfully spontaneous and charming. That said, these decisions can also be incredibly hasty and even careless, so it's important for Pisces to be careful—otherwise, they may end up in troublesome or painful situations that have to resolved. To improve your decision-making skills, take a moment to stop and think about what you're doing. Consider the consequences, good and bad, and try to make a more logical decision based on facts rather than feelings."

      "content": "This sign gets lost in illogical dream worlds and wishful thinking. Sentimental Pisces is many things, but realistic isn’t one of them! Their tendency to live in dreams and fantasies means they’re rather detached from reality. As they're off daydreaming, life in the real world keeps moving forward and tends to pass them right by. Once they finally come down from the clouds, they usually find that they’ve missed out on real world opportunities. [7] X Research source Pisces, there's nothing wrong with daydreaming and having a rich inner world! Just remember to come back down to earth occasionally to participate in real life."

      "content": "Sensitive Pisces can get bogged down in negative thinking patterns. Since this sign tends to be oversensitive, they often retreat to be alone and lick their wounds when they're feeling sad or offended. Pisces doesn’t do well alone, though, and when there’s nothing around to distract them, their minds automatically shift into negative thought patterns and self-pity. If you're a Pisces, you can learn to become more optimistic by surrounding yourself with positive people, making gratitude lists , and challenging negative thoughts when they arise. Pisces usually tends to pull themselves out of their funk eventually, but sometimes they need a little help from their friends."
