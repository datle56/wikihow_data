Unless you change the default settings, typing a new dimension for Width will automatically update the Height measurement to keep the proportions correct. If you want to specify both the height and the width without one changing the other, click the small link icon to the left of the Width and Height blanks to unlink the two measurements. [1] X Research source If you don't want to specify the size in pixels, you can select Percent from the menus next to the Height and Width values. Then you can choose to grow or shrink the image size by a percentage of the original size. For example, if the width of the image is 2200 px wide, changing the Width value to 50% will decrease the width to 1400 px. Changing it to 200% would increase the size to 4400 px. If the image has layers with applied styles, click the gear icon at the top-right corner of the Image Size window and select Scale Styles to scale the effects in the resized image.
