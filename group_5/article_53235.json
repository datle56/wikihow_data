      "content": "Learn the Triangle Inequality Theorem. This theorem simply states that the sum of two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this is true for all three combinations, then you will have a valid triangle. You'll have to go through these combinations one by one to make sure that the triangle is possible. You can also think of the triangle as having the side lengths a, b, and c and the theorem being an inequality, which states: a+b > c, a+c > b, and b+c > a. [2] X Research source For this example, a = 7, b = 10, and c = 5."

      "content": "Check to see if the sum of the last combination of two sides is greater than the remaining side. You need to see if the sum of side b and side c is greater than side a . To do this, you'll need to see if 10 + 5 is greater than 7. 10 + 5 = 15, and 15 > 7, so the triangle passes on all sides. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Check your work. Now that you've checked the side combinations one by one, you can double check that the rule is true for all three combinations. If the sum of any two side lengths is greater than the third in every combination, as it is for this triangle, then you've determined that the triangle is valid. If the rule is invalid for even just one combination, then the triangle is invalid. Since the following statements are true, you've found a valid triangle: [6] X Research source a + b > c = 17 > 5 a + c > b = 12 > 10 b + c > a = 15 > 7"

[7] X Research source Let's say you're working with these three side lengths: 5, 8, and 3. Let's see if it passes the test: 5 + 8 > 3 = 13 > 3, so one side passes. 5 + 3 > 8 = 8 > 8. Since this is invalid, you can stop right here. This triangle is not valid."
