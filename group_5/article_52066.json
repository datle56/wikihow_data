      "content": "Scrub the grout in a vigorous, back-and-forth motion. Use a narrow scrub brush, tile brush, or stiff toothbrush. [2] X Research source If you’re having trouble getting into corners or grout lines with your brush, try using a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser for those areas. [3] X Research source Instead of a scrub brush, you can try a closed-loop microfiber cloth. If so, wear gloves to protect your hands from the friction."

      "content": "Try a baking soda paste. If water alone doesn’t work, mix three parts baking soda with one part water to form a paste. [4] X Expert Source Chris Willatt House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 1 July 2019. Apply the paste to the grout, and let it sit for one to two hours. Spray with plain water, then scrub the grout again. [5] X Research source Alternately, make a paste from two parts baking soda to one part hydrogen peroxide. Let the paste sit on the grout for several minutes before scrubbing it and rinsing it clean."

      "content": "Ensure proper safety and ventilation. Open the window and/or run a fan. Wear non-porous gloves, a mask, and safety glasses. Chlorine bleach is an eye and skin irritant. The fumes can affect the respiratory tract. Adequate protection and ventilation are essential. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Make a diluted bleach solution.",
      "content": "Make a diluted bleach solution. Mix three parts water to one part chlorine bleach. Alternately, you can purchase a cleaning solution that contains some bleach. [8] X Research source If your grout is colored, using bleach may cause it to fade, especially if used regularly. You can repeat this method with a slightly higher concentration of bleach (for example, half bleach, half water) if the 3-to-1 ratio doesn’t work. Never attempt to mix other chemicals with diluted bleach. For example, ammonia – found in many cleaning agents – emits toxic fumes when mixed with bleach."

Scrub the grout with a narrow scrub brush or stiff toothbrush. Rinse the area clean with warm water. [13] X Expert Source Chris Willatt House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 1 July 2019. Vinegar is acid-based, so make sure to do a small test area first to make sure the solution doesn’t affect your surrounding tile. Optionally, apply a paste of baking soda and water to the grout before dousing it with the vinegar solution. The combination will bubble up. Then scrub and rinse.

Baking soda is abrasive, so keep it off the tile as much as possible."

If you have a vent fan, run it before, during, and after your shower. [20] X Research source For example, turn on your vent fan before a morning shower, and keep it running until you leave for the day. Even when the mirror is no longer foggy, there can still be moisture in the air. Mold and mildew thrive where it’s warm, airless and damp."
