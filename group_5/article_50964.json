If you are registering outside the state, then you will need some document that shows your residency, such as proof of employment in Alaska. To get an identification card, you will need to take the following documents to the DMV: proof of legal name and date of birth (such as a birth certificate); a secondary document that verifies your first (such as an IRS or state tax form); proof of your principal residence, such as a utility bill or rental documents; a Social Security number; and documents related to a name change (if applicable).
