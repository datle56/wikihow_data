      "content": "Yes, but not all drug dogs are trained to detect it. In many cases, drug-detecting dogs are trained to sniff out illegal drugs like heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and meth. [1] X Research source However, some dogs are trained to detect the scent of nicotine—these dogs are sometimes hired to sniff for vapes and similar paraphernalia (like nicotine pouches) at schools as a way to deter teens from vaping. [2] X Research source Ultimately, it comes down to the agency that’s training the dog. Some agencies (especially those hired by schools) train their dogs to sniff out nicotine, while others don’t. Some agencies have dogs that are trained to sniff out tobacco products (including synthetic tobacco), but this isn’t necessarily the case for all dogs. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dogs have an incredible sense of smell. If you thought humans had good noses, think again—a dog’s nose has up to 100,000 times the smelling power of a person’s. Their nose has two separate pathways—one to process different smells and one to provide basic respiratory function. They also have a special organ in their nose (the Jacobson’s organ) designed specifically to process pheromones from other animals. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Drug sniffer dogs are trained to identify specific scents. During training, dogs are introduced to a toy that’s made to smell like certain drugs. Using this toy, the dog is taught to search for the item and let their handler know that they’ve found it. [5] X Research source This training process typically involves illegal drugs rather than nicotine, but given a dog’s great sense of smell, they could definitely detect it. Dogs can be trained to sniff out all kinds of scents, including explosives and dead bodies.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source"

[7] X Research source While these dogs likely wouldn’t be sniffing for nicotine in a vehicle, it’s theoretically possible that they could sniff out nicotine in a car."

      "content": "Your best option is to not have it on your person. A drug-detecting dog can’t sniff what isn’t there. As tough as it may be to go a school or work day without your nicotine product, it’s a much better alternative to getting in trouble with the powers that be. Some people suggest wrapping up the nicotine product in plastic wrap or wax paper and submerging it in a container filled with white vinegar (like a water bottle). However, this isn’t guaranteed to deter the dog, and can potentially damage your product if it’s not wrapped securely enough."
