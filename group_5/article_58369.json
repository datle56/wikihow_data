      "content": "If using a brand new kit, take proper measures to assemble it well. Take out the paper outlines, the board, and bag of pegs. You will need either small or big batteries, but they do not come with the pack. You will need to purchase some from a store. There will also be an instruction guide just in case you need more help."

      "content": "If using a template, take one of the outlined pictures and slide it onto the board from the top. There will be letters representing the colors outlining how the picture will look like once you add the colorful pegs. Keep the picture in place by poking any colored pegs on each corner."

      "content": "Poke pegs through depending on the letters representing different colors. The first time you get Litebrite, poke the pegs softly, but not loosely, or it won't be easy to take out when doing another picture. Here is a short guide: W - clear pegs V - purple/violet pegs P - pink pegs O - orange pegs G - green pegs B - blue pegs R - red pegs Y - yellow pegs"

      "title": "When taking out the pegs, take out the ones on the corners first so it will be easier.",
      "content": "When taking out the pegs, take out the ones on the corners first so it will be easier. Pull it off carefully by twisting it around, and once it's loose enough, pull it out. This may take a large amount of time if you put lots of pegs in the picture, and if you poked them in very hard. Consider poking them a bit loose so it will be easier."

      "title": "Slide the picture out carefully.",
      "content": "Slide the picture out carefully. Even though it has holes in it, you can still use it again later. Pull it out from the top, but try not to rip it. Make sure all the pegs are out."

      "content": "To make the picture light up, screw out the screw on the battery container, and put a battery in. Press the button on the board to make it light up. Possibly, you can also press it a second time to make it blink. Press it a third time to turn it off."

      "content": "Store pegs in the empty container at the bottom of the board when you are done. Remaining pegs of a picture can also be stored in the container. Use the edge to open it and close it as well. Be careful however, as when you open it, some pegs may fly out of the container because it can be a bit strong to pull it, and you may lose pegs."
