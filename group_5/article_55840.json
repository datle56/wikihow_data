If you've tried looking for the call recording option after updating to iOS 18 and couldn't find it, don't worry—it hasn't been released yet. If you don't want to wait until iOS 18 is released, you can install the iOS 18.1 beta to gain early access to call recording. We'll show you how a little later!"

      "content": "Install the iOS 18.1 beta. You can access iOS 18's new call recording feature before its official release by installing the latest developer beta. Just enable beta updates in Settings > General > Software Update > Beta Updates , then select the latest beta to install. Installing the beta version of iOS does get you the latest features, but there could also be some bugs the developers haven't fully worked out. Be sure to back up your iPhone before installing a beta. You'll need an iPhone XR or later (or iPhone SE 2nd & 3rd gen) to install iOS 18, including beta versions. [2] X Research source If you don't want to install the beta, you can still record iPhone calls using third-party recording apps."

Whether somebody calls you or you call them, you'll now see a call recording icon in the upper-left corner of the call screen—it looks like a waveform with a record button. Once tapped, you and the recipient will both hear an audio prompt that says \"This call will be recorded,\" and the call will begin recording. [3] X Research source There's no way to turn off the announcement—it's important that both parties can opt out of the call if they don't feel comfortable with being recorded. Call recording also works on FaceTime audio calls ."
