    {
      "title": "Address the envelope to “The Right Honourable”.",
      "content": "Address the envelope to “The Right Honourable”. The first line of the envelope should read “The Right Honourable”, followed by the first and last names of the Prime Minister. Below this, write “Prime Minister of” followed by the relevant country. Write the relevant parliament address of the Prime Minister underneath. For example: The Right Honourable Jacinda Ardern Prime Minister of New Zealand Parliament Buildings Private Bag 18041 Wellington 6160 Note that the address “The Right Honourable” should still be used if you are addressing a former Prime Minister.

      "title": "Begin the letter with “Dear Prime Minister”.",
      "content": "Begin the letter with “Dear Prime Minister”. This polite opening is the expected salutation for all written communication to the Prime Minister. If you are writing an email it is still appropriate to begin with “Dear Prime Minister”. If you are writing to a former prime minister begin with \"Dear Sir/Madam,\" or \"Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. Lastname.\" [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish your letter with “Most respectfully”.",
      "content": "Finish your letter with “Most respectfully”. This complimentary closing remark shows your respect and indicates the end of your message. Thank the Prime Minister for taking time to read your letter. Then, place a comma at the end of “Most respectfully” and sign and print your name below. If you are writing the letter on a computer leave space for you to sign your name under the closing remark. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid using abbreviations or contractions.",
      "content": "Avoid using abbreviations or contractions. Contractions and abbreviations can come across as lazy and aren’t appropriate for a formal letter. Abbreviations aren’t always clear to the reader so it is best practice to spell out the full meaning of the abbreviation. Similarly with contractions, it is appropriate to write the full words instead of using an apostrophe to create one word. For example, use “do not” instead of “don’t”. Try using “New York” instead of “NY”. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use formal language.",
      "content": "Use formal language. Substitute slang or colloquial words for more proper alternatives. Using formal language in your letter will help you to be taken more seriously. Pay particular attention to using formal adjectives as describing words set a strong tone in written communication. For example, use “excellent” or “enjoyable” instead of “rad” or awesome”. Replace \"weird\" with \"unusual\", or \"hated\" with \"strongly disliked\". [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Write concisely.",
      "content": "Write concisely. Avoid repeating yourself in your letter. If you want to emphasise a point try adding extra supporting information instead of repeating the same point in different words. Keep your sentences to a limit of 2 lines. Wordy sentences can be confusing and difficult to read. [6] X Research source The Prime Minister is more likely to read your whole letter if it is clear and to the point. Avoid adding extra sentences that don’t contain necessary information."

    {
      "title": "Check your spelling and grammar.",
      "content": "Check your spelling and grammar. Read over your letter and carefully check for any spelling or grammar errors. If you have written your letter on a computer, use a spell-checker to check your work. Poor spelling and grammar will make your letter harder to read and will make your work look rushed. Ask a friend to check over your letter for any typos or mistakes before you send it."
