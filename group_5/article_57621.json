      "content": "Seeders are those who continue to share the file after it has been downloaded. The more seeders there, are the faster the download will be. [1] X Research source If you can, try to download from a file with a high number of seeders listed. If you can connect to enough seeders, you can easily max out your connection speed. While more seeders will always increase a torrent's download speed, it also makes the file more traceable. Always use a VPN when downloading torrents."

      "title": "Leechers are users that are downloading a file and have not yet seeded it.",
      "content": "Leechers are users that are downloading a file and have not yet seeded it. A leecher becomes a seeder once the file is fully downloaded. If the amount of leechers far outweighs the amount of seeders, you will experience a slow download. [2] X Research source When downloading torrents, be sure to leave the file in your client after it has finished downloading so you can become a seeder, not a leecher. It is considered proper torrenting etiquette to seed a file for at least as long as it took to download."

      "content": "Try connecting the computer directly to the modem or router instead of using Wi-Fi. A lot of signals in the house could interfere with Wi-Fi connection, thus affecting internet speed and uTorrent downloads."

      "title": "Test your connection.",
      "content": "Test your connection. Use websites such as https://fast.com or M-Lab to measure your internet speed . You may be downloading torrent files at a slow speed because of a slow internet connection, in which case you should contact your ISP or consider upgrading your plan. If you are using a VPN and suspect your connection is affecting uTorrent's download speed, try switching to a new network/location."

      "title": "Move closer to the Wi-Fi router while downloading.",
      "content": "Move closer to the Wi-Fi router while downloading. If you can't feasibly connect to the router with an ethernet cable, moving your computer closer to the router while downloading can help minimize interference from other devices and increase your speed. If any walls or large pieces of furniture obstruct the line of sight between your computer and the Wi-Fi access point, your internet speed may suffer."

      "content": "Disconnect other devices that share your Wi-Fi access point. If multiple devices are using Wi-Fi in your home at the same time, they're all sharing bandwidth. If possible, ask other members of your household to hold off on streaming videos or playing internet-based games until you're finished with your download."

      "content": "Subscribe to a higher internet speed plan. If you believe your internet speed is really affecting your download speeds, you may be able to upgrade the speed of your internet service. This will cost you more money per month, though you may be able to get a good deal by switching providers."

When more than one file is downloading at max speed, the files will take a longer time to finish. Try downloading the files one by one. Watch the first movie while you wait for the second one to finish downloading! You can force uTorrent to limit active downloads so that each individual download can maximize the available bandwidth. To do so, click Queuing on the left side and set the maximum active downloads to 1 or 2 . Your other torrents will start automatically after your download(s) complete. If you do not want to limit your active downloads to just one or two files at a time, you may manually drag any torrents atop your queue to prioritize it before the others."

This can lead to particularly fast speeds if the downloaded file has more seeds. Popular trackers include Opentracker and BitTorious . qBitTorrent is another torrenting client that has built-in tracker software. While uTorrent includes its own built-in trackers, you can visit any additional tracker's site to learn how to configure it for your needs. Added trackers only affect files downloaded to your client. If you are extracting a torrent's contents using a magnet link from an online site, that site is already serving as your \"tracker.\""

[3] X Research source If adding more trackers doesn't seem to make uTorrent as fast as you would like, visit your settings and enable both DHT and PeX under the \"Privacy\" tab. Some torrenting clients offer local peer discovery as well, which may be worth enabling if many people on your local network plan on torrenting simultaneously."
