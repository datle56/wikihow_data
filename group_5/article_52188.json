      "content": "Remove the filter from the hood. The method for detaching the hood range filter may be different depending on the type and model, but they are all fairly simple. Some are attached with screws, while others have a simple latch mechanism that you need to press and lift to remove. Certain filters have a fastener that you can rotate in and out of position. Figure out how your filter is attached, and remove it prior to cleaning. [1] X Research source If there is a plastic casing that covers your filter, you'll need to remove that first using a screwdriver before you remove the filter."

      "title": "Fill your sink with hot or boiling water.",
      "content": "Fill your sink with hot or boiling water. Make sure you use a sink stopper so the water doesn't go down the drain. Use hot water only, making sure it gets as hot as possible. Fill the sink up about ¾ of the way. [2] X Research source If your tap water doesn't get hot enough, boil water in a tea kettle or pot and then pour it in the sink."

      "content": "Pour 1/4 cup (60 g) of baking soda and a squirt of dish soap into the sink. Measure about 1/4 cup (60 g) of baking soda and pour it in. Then, add about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of degreasing dish soap. Mix the ingredients together until the water is soapy. [3] X Research source Use a brush to mix the baking soda mixture, especially if you used boiling water, to avoid burning your hands. Add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of vinegar to the mixture for extra cleaning power."

      "title": "Put the filter in the sink and let it soak for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Put the filter in the sink and let it soak for 10 minutes. If possible, make sure it is fully submerged so that the entire filter gets cleaned at once. Let the filter soak in the hot water for at least 10 minutes to allow the baking soda and dish soap to penetrate tough stains. [4] X Research source If your filter is on the larger side and doesn't completely fit in the sink, you might need to do one half of your filter at a time."

      "content": "Scrub the filter with a non-abrasive scrub brush. With the filter still in the sink, scrub the filter to get off any residue. Scrub the entire surface, front and back, to ensure that the filter is completely clean. [5] X Research source"

Use the running water to remove all of the baking soda and dish soap. After it's rinsed, use a clean cloth to dry the filter thoroughly.

To keep your filter well maintained, aim for monthly cleanings. This will keep your range hood running effectively and your filter looking its best. [7] X Research source"

Place the filters into the bag and pour enough ammonia over them to cover them, or enough to fill the bag about halfway full. Then, close the bag and leave it on a flat surface, such as a counter or table. [8] X Research source Sealing the filters in a bag with the ammonia will keep the smell of the ammonia contained."

They will get clean just by soaking."

      "content": "Put the wet filter on a baking pan and cover it with dishwasher detergent. Remove the filter from the sink and put it on a large baking sheet. The filter side with the most grease and residue should be facing up. Then, pour a generous amount of dishwasher detergent all over the filter. [12] X Research source This will prevent a huge mess on your counter or table space, as long as the baking sheet is larger than the filter. Make sure to use dishwasher detergent instead of dishwashing liquid. Dishwasher detergent is a gel cleanser that is only used in the dishwasher, not the liquid soap that is used in the sink."

Use a toothbrush to evenly distribute the detergent, making sure all of the tiny holes in the filter are covered.

The water pressure from the hose should be strong enough to remove any accumulation on the filter."

There may be some debris still stuck in the filter, especially on the edges. If that is the case, add more dishwashing detergent on the trouble areas, scrub with a toothbrush, and rinse one more time. Any remaining dirt should come off and your filter will be sparkly clean! [16] X Research source Make sure to dry the filter thoroughly before putting it back in the hood. Use a clean towel to dry the front and the back, and let it sit on a dish drying rack for an hour or so if needed."
