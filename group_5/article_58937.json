      "title": "Speak with your doctor about having your androgen levels tested.",
      "content": "Speak with your doctor about having your androgen levels tested. A doctor can confirm your androgen levels through a simple blood test. Before ordering the test, your doctor will ask about your experience with symptoms like acne, hair loss, and fatigue. They then take a small sample of blood that gets analyzed in a lab for unusual levels of androgen. It’s a simple but efficient way of deciding if medical treatment is necessary. [1] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source The test is used to rule out possible causes. For example, adrenal gland tumors, testicular or ovarian tumors, and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) all lead to higher than normal androgen levels. In women, 45-60 ng/dL is the upper level of what is considered normal for testosterone in the blood. If you have a testosterone serum level higher than 150 ng/dL, you’ll need to be checked for serious conditions such as ovarian and adrenal gland tumors."

      "title": "Take an anti-androgen medication if your androgen levels are high.",
      "content": "Take an anti-androgen medication if your androgen levels are high. There are several different medications available that limit or prevent your body from producing androgens. Your doctor can prescribe them after a blood test. Many anti-androgen drugs come in pill form and are meant to be taken once a day. There are also some given as injections by your doctor. [2] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source The most common starting medication for high androgen levels is spironolactone. This is a type of diuretic (or “water pill”). Unlike many other diuretics, spironolactone doesn’t deplete your body’s potassium supply. [3] X Research source Possible side effects include muscle tenderness, depression, hair loss, and rashes, among other things. Tell your doctor if you notice any negative effects. [4] X Research source Anti-androgen medications are usually pretty strong and can cause birth defects. For that reason, they can’t be taken by pregnant women or anyone trying to conceive.

      "content": "Take other drugs to treat side effects like high cholesterol. Although anti-androgen drugs treat most side effects on their own, your doctor may prescribe additional drugs to treat related problems. High cholesterol and high blood insulin are a few problems that often accompany androgen imbalances. Treating these problems, such as by taking pills to reduce cholesterol or blood sugar, also rids your body of excess androgens. If you have these problems, tackling them can make your recovery much quicker. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Another example is hair growth. Your doctor may prescribe a treatment like finasteride, which is a pill commonly used to treat hair loss or an enlarged prostate in men. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since it blocks testosterone, it is also assigned to women as a way to prevent excessive hair growth.
