      "content": "Pick moss from your own backyard. Rocks and trees offer the easiest access for moss. Place the scraper under one corner of the moss and slowly work forward, lifting the moss from the rock, tree or surface as you go. Dislodge the moss in the largest pieces possible. Use a rake if you are having difficulty getting the moss to come off its surface cleanly. Use a plastic scraper for particularly stubborn pieces of moss."

      "content": "Remove moisture from the collected moss. Place it on a paper towel or other absorbent surface. Press your palm against the moss into the absorbent surface. (When squeezing the moss, don't ball the moss up in your hands. When moss dries, it can become brittle and difficult to work with. Unfolding the moss can cause it to break into small pieces.) Spread all partially dry pieces of moss onto a flat surface. The surface should receive generous ventilation (open windows, outside breeze, fans or other air source)."
