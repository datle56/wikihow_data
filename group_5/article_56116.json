[1] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. If you have one, use an electronic or magnetic stud finder to search for nails. Alternately, tap lightly on the wall with a hammer. When you hear a solid \"thunk\" instead of a hollow sound, you've likely found a wall stud. If you're not certain whether you've found a stud, drill a test hole and use a bent wire or coat hanger to search for solid objects in your wall. [2] X Research source Once you've located the center of one wall stud, its closest neighbors are usually located either 16 inches or 24 inches to each side. [3] X Research source Use a small nail to probe the wall stud(s) and determine the width. Draw a vertical line down the center of the wall studs once you've found them."

[4] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. If your microwave came with a wall template, tape that instead as a drilling guide before you attach the plate. Use a level to ensure your microwave isn't installed at a slant. Remove any decorative trimming from the cabinet preventing you from placing the mounting plate correctly. If the front of the cabinet has an overhang, place the mounting plate below the back of the cabinet by an equal amount. Otherwise the overhang will block access to the microwave. For a microwave that requires base-of-cabinet attachments, you may need to saw off the overhang instead."

Follow these steps to determine which size holes to drill and where. The bottom edge of the plate should have an area covered in holes. Use a marker to draw circles in at least two holes. At least one should be completely over a wall stud to support the microwave's weight. Locate the two or more holes along the upper edge of the microwave. Fill in these with a marker as well. Remove the mounting plate. Use the circles you drew as a guide, not the mounting plate. Drill a 3/16\" (5mm) hole through any circle located on a wall stud. [6] X Research source Drill a 3/8\" (10mm) hole through any other circle. If your microwave came with a top template, tape it to the base of the cabinet above and drill 3/8\"(10mm) holes through attachment points where directed to fasten the microwave to the cabinet base."

Use lag screws (lag bolts) in the 3/16\"(5mm) holes. These will bear most of the microwave's weight, which is why they are used over the wall studs. Use toggle screws (toggle bolts) in the 3/8\"(10mm) holes. The \"wings\" of the toggle screw go through the hole and pull against the wall as the screw is tightened. Pull the mounting plate toward you while tightening toggle screws."
