After turning 1 years old, the lamb reaches maturity and is called a sheep. [1] X Research source An adult female sheep is called an ewe, while an adult male sheep is called a ram."

      "content": "Lamb wool is generally finer and softer than sheep wool. Lamb fur is highly regarded for its plush feel and lustrous shine. While sheep wool is still very soft, it’s generally more coarse and denser than lamb fur. Due to their small size, lambs often look a lot like adult goats. However, lambs typically have curly, textured fur while a goat’s fur is smooth and fine."

      "content": "Lambs have small, milk teeth while sheep have large, adult teeth. Besides size and weight, this is one of the best ways to tell how old a sheep is. Lambs are born with no teeth, but slowly develop milk teeth. These teeth are small and let them drink milk from their mothers comfortably. When they start to wean from milk at around 4 to 6 months, they lose their milk teeth. By the time they’re about 1 years old, they have 2 large adult teeth. [4] X Research source Sheep finish growing their full set of 8 adult teeth around 3 to 4 years old."

      "content": "Lambs tend to be shyer and more reserved than sheep. Like most baby animals, lambs are vulnerable after they’re born. You’ll mostly see them seeking protection and comfort from their mothers instead of exploring the pastures. [5] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source As adults, sheep are very social and move around together as a flock. They’re also friendly with humans and will stay close to you if they trust you! Sheep’s friendly natures makes them great to raise on your own. Decide if you want sheep for their wool, milk, or meat and choose a suitable breed. Then, make sure you have about 1 acre (4,000 square m) of land for every 5 sheep."

      "title": "Lambs only drink milk, while sheep munch on grass.",
      "content": "Lambs only drink milk, while sheep munch on grass. In the first few months of their lives, lambs are dependent on their mothers for milk. Because they only have their milk teeth, they can’t chew and graze like sheep can. Once they’re fully weaned and matured, sheep finally get to eat their favorite foods: grass, seeds, and hay. [6] X Research source Sheep are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants."

      "content": "Lambs do not have horns, while sheep do. One of the easiest ways to spot a lamb in the wild is by their smooth, horn-less heads. By the time they’re 1 years old, they’ll start growing visible knobs above their ears. The sheep’s horns continue to grow longer and larger each year, finally slowing once they’re 8 years old. [7] X Research source In some species of sheep, like the dall sheep, both rams and ewes grow horns. In other breeds, only the male has horns. In most domesticated breeds, both rams and ewes don’t have horns."

      "title": "Lamb meat is more tender and has milder flavor than sheep mutton.",
      "content": "Lamb meat is more tender and has milder flavor than sheep mutton. When comparing lamb and mutton, lamb is often the clear favorite. They’re typically slaughtered when they’re about 6 to 8 months old, which gives their meat a more delicate flavor and texture. Once a lamb matures to a sheep at 1 years old, their meat is called mutton. As sheep age, their muscles tighten and grow stronger. This usually makes mutton tougher to chew and gives it a strong, wild, and earthy flavor. [8] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source If you see lamb at the grocery store called “Spring lamb,” this means the lamb was slaughtered at 3 months old. Their meat is even more tender and subtle. Because it’s so tender, it usually takes less time to cook lamb than mutton. If you don’t love the gamey flavor of mutton, it’s easy to season it with delicious spices like paprika, cayenne pepper, ginger, and garlic. It also comes out super tender when you cook it low and slow."
