      "content": "It can take around 10–15 years after high school. After you graduate from high school, you’ll need to earn a degree from a 4-year college before you can apply to medical school. You’ll study in medical school for another 4 years, and then move on to post-medical school training called \"residency\" for a few years before being eligible to take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) which you must pass to practice medicine without restriction. [1] X Research source It may seem like a long time, but your experience will help you provide the best care and meet other people in your field. Medical schools will accept any major as long as you complete the prerequisite courses so do not limit yourself to a pre-medical or hard science program. In the United States, you may choose to get an allopathic (MD) or osteopathic (DO) medical degree. MD programs are more competitive than DO programs, with higher admission requirements and lower acceptance rates. However, both degrees provide similar medical education and training. The difference between these two programs are as follows: MD programs emphasize traditional, science-based medical education for treating illness and disease with medications, surgeries, and other conventional therapies. DO programs also provide science-based medical education, but focus on the musculoskeletal system's impact on overall health and well-being, taking a more holistic approach. DOs may also use osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), a form of hands-on therapy, in their treatment plans."

      "content": "Complete your prerequisite courses during undergraduate. To become a doctor, you will need to complete coursework in biology, general chemistry (including organic chemistry), and physics. Note that most medical schools do not accept AP credits. You'll need to retake any AP science courses in college to receive a grade that reflects your understanding of the subject. Until you complete the necessary prerequisites and earned your Bachelor's Degree, you cannot apply to medical school. Some of the prerequisite classes that will be helpful to you as a future doctor include: [2] X Research source General Biology (two semesters): Medical professionals need a solid understanding of general biology to understand how the human body works, and how to diagnose and treat diseases. Without a strong grasp of basic biological concepts, it would be difficult for doctors to provide effective care to their patients. General Chemistry (two semesters): Doctors need to know general chemistry because it is essential to understanding how drugs and other substances interact with the body. This knowledge is necessary for prescribing medications, interpreting laboratory test results, and understanding the basic biochemical processes that occur in the body. Inorganic Chemistry (two semesters): Doctors need to know inorganic chemistry because it is the basis for understanding how drugs work and how the body interacts with them. Inorganic chemistry also helps doctors understand how nutrients and other substances are transported throughout the body. Physics (two semesters): Doctors need to know physics because it helps them understand how the body works at a physical level, including the principles of motion, energy, and force. This understanding is important in diagnosing and treating medical conditions, interpreting diagnostic tests, and designing treatment plans."

While many med schools will accept most degree programs, you’ll have better prepared for medical school if you choose a science-related field, such as biology or chemistry, since it will help you more with the courses in medical school. You should also be taking hard courses since it will impress the admission officer and increase your chance of being accepted.
