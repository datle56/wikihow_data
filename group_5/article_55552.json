      "content": "The meme comes from a recaptioned Chainsaw Man panel. The “he just like me fr” meme comes from a panel in \"You & Crappy Movies,” the 93rd chapter of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga, Chainsaw Man . In the meme Denji, the main character, grabs a TV while sobbing and exclaims that the person on screen is “literally him.” Denji, AKA Chainsaw Man, is a touch-starved, perverted, lonely teenager who fights demons for one reason: to have a chance to get intimate with girls. Originally Denji grabs a TV while exclaiming “Oh my gaw….they really…the ladies really love me! They love meeeee!”"

Denji is an extremely emotive character from one of the most popular mangas/animes of the 2020s, which makes him a perfect reaction meme subject.

      "content": "The meme became an “exploitable” image in 2022. As “he just like me fr” gained popularity on Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and other forum sites, it was edited to be an “exploitable” meme, or a meme that can be changed to fit a more specific situation. [2] X Research source The panels were either redrawn with new characters or had other characters edited over the old ones. The exploitable memes sometimes put other characters’ faces over Denji’s or add extra panels above the meme."

If you see something and think that a character or celebrity would relate to it, edit their face over Denji’s and use the new meme as a reaction image. [3] X Research source You can also attach the meme to the bottom of another image. For example, if you had a picture of a cool-guy time traveler (like Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar ), you could add the “he just like me fr” meme under it with Fry from Futurama edited over Denji. You can also redraw the panels to make your own meme ."

      "content": "“He just like me fr” is a “literally me” meme. “Literally me” is a meme genre that spawned from a 4chan copypasta, “literally me.” The copypasta text is pasted below pictures of characters that the poster claims to be literally them. [4] X Research source It’s used ironically, however, since it’s usually pasted under animated, unrelatable characters. Copypasta refers to a story or block of text that’s copy-pasted on forums and social media sites. [5] X Research source"

That concert was amazing! OMG fr I loved it. I can’t stand our landlord. Fr bro…we have to find a new place to live."
