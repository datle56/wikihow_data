      "content": "Try restarting your phone to refresh your caches and data. Corrupted caches and old data can cause apps to not work right on your phone, and a quick restart can fix the issue. Even if you're not sure that a restart will fix the issue, it's a good first step to try. On iPhones without a home button, press and hold either volume button and the side button until the power-off slider appears. On iPhones with a home button, press just the side button until the power-off slider appears. Slide the slider, then wait 30 seconds before turning your device back on by pressing the side button for about three seconds.

      "content": "Make sure you're connected to the Internet. Grindr requires an internet connection to work, so if you've been disconnected or your signal isn't very strong, you may have trouble using the app. If you aren't connected to the internet, go to your network settings on your phone and find an available Wi-Fi connection. If you aren't connected to Wi-Fi but are connected to cellular data and are still having trouble with Grindr not refreshing, try connecting to Wi-Fi."

      "content": "Disable your VPN, if you're using one. Grindr doesn't always work the best with a VPN, so if you're getting the \"unable to refresh\" error, your VPN may be the culprit. Navigate either to your phone's network settings to disable the VPN or go to the VPN app itself to turn the VPN off (the method may vary depending on what type of VPN you're using)."

      "content": "Check to see if Grindr is down. If reinstalling the app isn't fixing the issue, there's a good chance that the issue is with Grindr (and its servers) itself. Unfortunately there's not much you can do if this is the case, and you'll have to wait for Grindr to fix the issue before you can keep using the app. Use a site like DownDetector to see if Grindr is experiencing an outage. You can also check the Grindr subreddit , as other users will usually post when they're experiencing an issue."
