      "content": "Use this for an easy, but sturdy hacky sack. Anyone can make this hackysack, even if you've never sewed before. The result is pretty sturdy if you use strong thread. One disadvantage is that sand – a great stuffing for beginners or people practicing tricks – will leak out the hole. Most players will still have plenty of fun with rice or lentil stuffing instead."

      "title": "Sew one piece most of the way closed.",
      "content": "Sew one piece most of the way closed. Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread. Pull it through both sides of the sock, near the hole. Continue sewing by moving the needle back through the sock again in the other direction. Repeat this back-and-forth movement until the sock is sewn mostly shut. Leave a gap for stuffing the sock. Polyester thread is cheap and strong, making it a good choice for this project. The closer together your thread lines, the less your hacky sack will leak stuffing."

      "title": "Pour in rice or other material.",
      "content": "Pour in rice or other material. Stick a funnel in the hole, or a rolled-up paper cone. Fill the sock with stuffing material. Uncooked rice or lentils are cheap and large enough that they won't fall out much. Plastic pellets or steel pellets from a hobby store will give more control, and feel more like commercial hacky sacks.
