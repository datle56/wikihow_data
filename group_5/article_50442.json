      "title": "Choose natural offerings, like plants and flowers.",
      "content": "Choose natural offerings, like plants and flowers. Aphrodite has many connections to the natural world, so it’s common to include items from nature on her altars. Roses are a great flower choice, though you can choose any flowers you like. Since many of Aphrodite’s sacred animals are birds, you can also offer feathers, or you can include minerals like pearls and rose quartz. [1] X Research source If you don’t have access to natural items, that’s okay, too! You can opt for fake flowers (which you won’t have to replace like you would real flowers), or you can choose a small figurine of one of Aphrodite’s sacred animals."

    {
      "title": "Include physical representations of Aphrodite.",
      "content": "Include physical representations of Aphrodite. Because Aphrodite is the goddess of beauty, many worshippers choose to include a physical image of her on their altar. You can buy a statue of Aphrodite or print and frame a picture of her. Aphrodite has inspired countless works of art over the years, so there are plenty of interpretations to choose from.

      "title": "Add perfume or makeup.",
      "content": "Add perfume or makeup. You can also offer Aphrodite items that make you feel beautiful and confident. You can choose floral-scented perfumes or pink or red lipstick. A hand-held mirror is another great option."

    {
      "title": "Offer food and drinks.",
      "content": "Offer food and drinks. The ancient Greeks often left wine, milk, and honey as offerings to the gods. They also included berries from juniper trees and myrrh. [3] X Research source These offerings are still frequently used by modern worshippers, though you can also choose to leave non-traditional foods like chocolate, strawberries, and apples."

    {
      "title": "Choose and cleanse your space.",
      "content": "Choose and cleanse your space. Since your altar is where you’ll be worshipping and communicating with Aphrodite, you want to set it up in a quiet area that allows you to focus. This might be a bedroom, an office, or even a space in a garden. [4] X Research source You’ll then need to cleanse the area and the objects you’re including on your altar using incense. By cleansing your space, you’re removing any negative energy and ensuring you’ll be able to communicate and worship Aphrodite effectively."

    {
      "title": "Make Aphrodite your focal point.",
      "content": "Make Aphrodite your focal point. Your altar is dedicated to her, after all! It only makes sense to make her the main focus. This is typically done by placing a statue or photo of Aphrodite in the middle of the altar. Then, place red, white, or pink candles around the image to add warmth and energy during your prayers and rituals. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Arrange your offerings.",
      "content": "Arrange your offerings. Because everyone’s practice is different, there isn’t one correct way to set up your altar. The key here is to decorate your altar with items you associate with Aphrodite. These can be the symbols she’s traditionally associated with or items you’ve discovered a connection with through your practice. Trust your intuition and your personal relationship with her to guide you. Just make sure to keep your altar clean out of respect for the goddess. Here are a few set-up ideas for inspiration: Some Aphrodite worshippers like to arrange their offerings by their associated element (earth, air, water, and fire) with the water-based offerings facing the direction of the nearest body of water. [6] X Research source Use a tiered shelf to create a layered altar. Place your image of Aphrodite at the top and arrange your offerings and decorations beneath her. You can place items most closely associated with her on the higher shelves and items more unique to you and your practice on the lower ones. Alternatively, you can arrange your items in a way that’s most aesthetically pleasing. As the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite is sure to appreciate this! Surround your altar with flowers. Opt for colors associated with Aphrodite like red or pink, or swap them out depending on the season. This is a great way to incorporate Aphrodite’s connection with nature and her love for beauty. Dedicate a specific area for offerings. In most cases, this is a bowl placed near the statue or image of Aphrodite. This is where you’ll put your offerings during rituals or prayers. Get creative with it and choose a bowl shaped like a seashell to honor Aphrodite’s origins."

      "title": "Pray and make an offering.",
      "content": "Pray and make an offering. Now that you’ve selected your offerings, it’s time to give them to Aphrodite. Wash your hands before making your offering, then offer a prayer to Aphrodite. Thank her for all that she has blessed you with and tell her what you are offering her. Then, light some incense and sit in quiet contemplation. It’s possible you’ll physically sense Aphrodite’s presence in the form of warm or pleasant sensations. Don’t get discouraged if this doesn’t happen, however, and trust that Aphrodite has heard your prayers."

      "content": "Take a ritual bath. One of the best ways to connect with Aphrodite is through self-care. A ritual bath is simply a bath you take to ground yourself and get in touch with your spirituality. Add some rose petals or scented oils, relax, and practice meditation to get in touch with Aphrodite. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a divination method like tarot or scrying. If you read tarot cards , try using them to communicate with Aphrodite directly. Ask her questions and interpret her answers through the cards you pull. Try scrying by looking into the flame of a candle, a crystal ball, or the surface of water and interpreting the images you see.

She rose from the sea fully formed and glided to land on a seashell, where flowers bloomed at her feet. [9] X Research source While this is the most common myth, in other versions, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Dione. [10] X Research source Because of her origins, Aphrodite is sometimes considered a sea goddess."
