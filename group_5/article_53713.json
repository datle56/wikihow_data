      "content": "You’re surrounded by abundance and good fortune. Since rain gives life to crops, animals, bodies of water—basically everything on earth—it represents the luscious fertility of the soil. Dreaming about rain can signal a period filled with blessings and luck. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "A situation will get easier. Rain pours over the land and then dissipates into the air. It is nourishing or destructive, but ultimately impermanent. Whatever is going on in your life is only temporary and, whether you enjoy the rain or not, you can look forward to the pleasure of sunny skies. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "You have unrealized emotions.",
      "content": "You have unrealized emotions. Water is the representation of emotion in many cultures and practices. Your subconscious communicates through your dreams, so a heavy rain can be its way of letting you know there’s something within you yet to be addressed. Connect with your body to figure out what message it’s trying to send you. Close your eyes and focus on the movement of your breath in your solar plexus. Say something true to yourself, like “My name is ___.” Notice how your body feels, then say something false. Keep saying truths and lies while paying attention to your solar plexus, then begin to ask your body yes no questions. Through this method, you can uncover unconscious feelings."

      "title": "You’re entering a time of emotional healing.",
      "content": "You’re entering a time of emotional healing. Raindrops form around dust in the air before falling from the clouds. Just like rain in waking life, droplets in your dreams can be pulling pollutants out of you. Especially if the rain is refreshing, this dream can be a sign of emotional cleansing and healing. If you’ve been in a conflict with someone close to you, or giving mental bandwidth to a person you don’t like, this dream can be a sign to forgive those around you and let go."

      "title": "You’re feeling misunderstood or lost.",
      "content": "You’re feeling misunderstood or lost. Dreams are all about symbolism, so if it’s raining so hard you can’t see a foot ahead of you, it could be a reflection of confusion or obstruction you feel in the waking world. Maybe you feel you can’t get through to someone, or that you’re invisible to others. This dream is a reminder that speaking your mind directly is the best way to be understood and that good interpersonal skills can strengthen the relationships around you. If you’re consistently having rain dreams where you feel stressed or scared, consider talking to a therapist or mental health professional about both your dreams and waking life."

If you’re dreaming about heavy rain, it may mean that you’re undergoing some major spiritual growth. A new time is dawning in your life, and it’s ready to be taken hold of.

      "content": "Dreaming of a thunderstorm Thunderstorms represent some of the most intense weather out there, and so they represent serious change in dreams. The crash and splash of thunder and lightning can translate to your waking life through sudden changes and shocking realizations. Get ready for a new era. Thunder and lighting are caused by rapid pressure and temperature changes. Thinking with that logic, you should look out for possible upcoming hardships while keeping in mind that they will pass as fast as they come."

      "content": "Dreaming about rain leaking into your house Houses in dreams represent your sense of self; they’re the expression of the boundaries of your waking life. [5] X Research source Leaks and water damage start to break down those barriers, for better or for worse. Depending on the effect of the water, it could be a positive or negative sign. If you’re uncomfortable in the dream, it’s probably about being uncomfortable in waking life. If a leaky ceiling is dripping on your head you could be anxiously anticipating something, or if the water stain grows mold you could be unhappy with your waking living situation. If the water is clear and doesn’t stain, it’s been thought to be a sign of illicit pleasures entering your waking life. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Dreaming of being soaked by rain Being caught in a storm is an intense experience that can go a few different ways. You could be in a light summer shower or a typhoon. When you’re dreaming out in the pouring rain it could mean that you’re overrun by your emotions, possibly ones that haven’t come to the surface yet. When you dream about being stuck in the rain, it’s time to take a look at your emotional health. This dream can be a sign of repression, so check in with your intuition to see how you’re doing. Ask yourself yes/no questions about your situation while paying attention to the feelings in your solar plexus. If you ended the dream feeling good, it could be a sign that you went through a spiritual cleanse. You’re still in the midst of overwhelming emotion, but you’re not letting it get you down."

      "content": "Dreaming about wind and rain Wind is a powerful, invisible force…just like your subconscious! When rain and wind come together in a dream, it means you have strong feelings that are being pushed up to the surface. Since wind (air) is associated with intellect and communication, this dream can be about finally being able to express yourself. [7] X Research source Wind can also be a sign of major changes that suddenly dissipate. Wind is powerful, but fleeting."

      "content": "Dreaming of rain and flooding When the rain cuts you off from everyone else in your dream it can feel like you’re the only person in the world. This lonely scene can be an indication that you need to reach out to the people around you and invest in your community . If you’re afraid of drowning in the dream, however, it could mean you’re troubled by your person-to-person interactions. When you’re in conflict with other people, look within yourself to try and find the lesson you’re being taught. If you have a friend who’s constantly blowing you off, for example, it could be a lesson about valuing other people’s (and your own!) time."

      "content": "Dreaming about driving in the rain While rain represents change, hurtling down a slick road can represent difficulty with moving forward. When things become too much and happen too quickly, you can only control yourself. Slow down, reevaluate your goals, and learn how to interact with your new environment. To change your circumstances, start slow and small. Set small, achievable goals, like applying to one job a week, and work up to big changes, like moving into your own home."

The cool water refreshing your skin, your body shooting through the droplets—every part of this dream speaks to good fortune and the ability to overcome challenges. The exception here comes from context. If there’s something chasing you, if your body hurts, if you’re experiencing fear and discomfort, etc., then the rain becomes an obstacle, or expression of your anxiety."

      "content": "Hearing rain and taking cover If you’re able to get inside before it really starts raining, that’s a good sign! Accomplishments in dreams often mean that you’re able to achieve your goals in waking life. If you’re getting out of the rain in the nick of time, it could mean your plans are coming together, and quickly! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Christianity In the Bible, rain is associated with both abundance and prosperity, as well as punishment and destruction. Rain that is associated with God’s love relieves draughts and waters crops, while rain associated with judgment—like the flood in Genesis 7-8—wreaks havoc. [11] X Research source The meaning depends on the specific circumstances of the dream. Dreaming about soft, gentle rain can indicate the presence of God in your life. If it’s watering plants or you’re enjoying standing in the rain, it can mean you’ll be blessed with abundance soon. If you’re afraid of the rain or it’s flooding, this dream can be a sign to seek help and forgiveness from God. The rain could be a manifestation of something you haven’t yet accepted about yourself."

      "content": "Keep track of your dreams by journaling about them. Dreaming is the expression of intuitive knowledge that you have not yet become conscious of. To gain the full insight of your dreams, write them down when you wake up in the morning. Try to remember where the dream took place, how you felt in the dream, and what other objects and people were in the dream. Starting a dream journal can be tough (especially if you’re groggy in the morning), but you can make it easier by leaving your journal open by your bed with a pen. This way everything is set up for you to write when you wake up. Once you form a habit around dream journaling, it’ll be easier to interpret your dreams and see what your body is telling you. To start the habit, start small and focus on getting words on the paper every day. You don’t have to write an essay—you can just record major incidents with bullet points. For example, you could say: Dreamt about rain Streets were flooded Mom was there"

      "content": "Meditate on the contents of your dreams. Sometimes the meaning behind a dream isn’t readily apparent. When that’s the case, meditate on what happened in the dream. Clear your mind and play the dream back in your head. Notice how your body reacts to the dream as it unfolds. Once you’re done, ask yourself: “Did I miss anything?” [12] X Research source Meditation is a skill that requires practice. If you’re having trouble visualizing your dreams the first few times, just stick with it. Once you get into the routine of dream interpretation it becomes much easier."

      "content": "In Jungian theory, water represents fertility. Water is the basis of all life on planet Earth—without it the world would be barren. Psychoanalyst Carl Jung believed that dreams are the unconscious communicating through symbols. In this case, the symbolic message is one of fruitfulness and abundance. [13] X Research source Since dreams are highly symbolic, their meanings can only be parsed when viewed as a whole. The more you interpret your dreams, the more you’ll begin to intuitively understand what different symbols mean to you."
