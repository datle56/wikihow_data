      "content": "Excited body language sends the message that he’s having fun. Does he lean closer or bring you into a hug? Maybe he strokes your face or runs his fingers through your hair while you kiss. You may also look below his waist and notice something’s recently “changed” about him.

If he opens his mouth while you kiss, then he’s probably feeling intensely passionate. [2] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source"

      "content": "A romantic gaze shows he’s smitten and wants you to be, too. After a passionate kiss, he’s super drawn to you. When he looks at you intensely, he’s in awe of you and letting you know how strong his attraction is. On top of that, he’ll want you to pay attention to him. In this situation, he’s hoping that if you give him the same kind of eye contact , you’ll start to develop a strong connection so you can kiss him a lot more often. [3] X Research source When his pupils dilate, or become larger, it’s a sign that his emotions are stirred up by the kiss.

All of his grins are surefire proof that he’s insanely attracted to you and already has great memories of the way you kiss.

      "content": "When he does this after a magical kiss, he’s hoping he can win you over. When he wants you to feel close to him, he’ll “mirror” your behavior, or act the same way you do. For example, if you laugh a little, he will too. He’ll want to seem compatible with you so you like him and keep seeing him. [13] X Research source “Mirroring” is so effective because it helps you both show your interest in each other. After your kiss, he mirrors your movements as often as he can because he wants to bond with you."

If so, he’s so amazed by the chemistry you two share that he wants to kiss you everywhere he can. Your lips just won’t be enough. [14] X Research source Your neck is an especially vulnerable place, so it’s very meaningful if he kisses you there. Not only is it very sensitive, but it’s a spot that’s usually reserved for people who are intimate with each other. Your shoulders and collarbone are both “erogenous zones,” or body parts that are extremely sensitive to touch. If he kisses you there, he’s expressing his enthusiasm and how much he wants you to feel good."

      "content": "A powerful kiss will make him let go of all his inhibitions. When he’s extremely excited, your makeout session will feel like foreplay because his hands will wander so much. Instead of keeping everything above the neck, he’ll touch sensitive places like your chest or your hips. He may also try to seduce you so he can move past kissing and really heat things up. [15] X Research source Since your kiss was so incredible, his foreplay is a way to repay you for the favor and focus on you. If he asks to move somewhere else, like the couch, and spends over 15 minutes touching you, then your pleasure is his number one concern. He wants to put as much effort into everything as you do."

Even if the weather’s cold or you planned to be home early, all your thoughts just melt away when you kiss. If neither of you are in a rush, then you both obviously enjoy each other’s company. [16] X Research source If he kisses you for more than 6 seconds, then it’s likely that he’s experiencing a strong attraction. [17] X Research source A kiss that lasts more than 12 seconds usually means he’s willing to go past the amount of time that seems “normal” because he can’t help himself. [18] X Research source"

You release “pheromones,” or sex hormones, when you’re aroused⁠—after he kisses you and smells these, he’ll say how incredible your scent is. If he can’t stop talking about it, then your kiss made him notice every single detail about you. [19] X Research source When he reacts to your pheromones, he’ll release his own sex hormones, including “androstenol,” a chemical found in his sweat. You’ll probably both appreciate how good you smell to each other. [20] X Research source"

Since he’s giving you all that approval, he’ll hope you’ll feel confident and fully appreciated. [21] X Research source In some cases, he’ll be at a loss for words, but that’s a good sign. He’ll make a comment like, “Wow! I’m speechless. You’re incredible.”"

[22] X Research source If you’re excited to pursue him after the kiss, then you probably both felt a strong physical connection.
