      "content": "Life, identity, and position Being the longest and most central finger, the middle finger (no matter which hand) symbolizes power. Therefore, wearing a ring on the left or right middle finger is a bold statement that shows confidence and tenacity.

For instance, a ring with a tiger’s eye crystal may be worn on a middle finger to show an individual's confidence. In Palmistry (or the practice of reading palms), the middle finger is connected to a person’s Fate Line or Line of Destiny. This line indicates the obstacles and overall life path the person will take. [7] X Research source"
