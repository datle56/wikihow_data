      "title": "Trim away any loose or fraying threads with scissors.",
      "content": "Trim away any loose or fraying threads with scissors. Cut along the edge of the fraying strands, creating a smooth edge along the rip in your jeans. Check along the edges of the rip and trim away any visible fuzz balls, as well. [1] X Research source When you patch your jeans, you want the edges of the rip to be as smooth as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip your jeans inside-out and set them on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Flip your jeans inside-out and set them on a flat surface. Tuck in the legs of your jeans so the seams are visible. After folding the fabric inside out, smooth out the material so there are no obvious wrinkles near the area that you’re trying to patch. To make the repair process easier, set your jeans on an ironing board, table, or another flat surface. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut out thin sections of fusible interfacing to line the perimeter of the hole.",
      "content": "Cut out thin sections of fusible interfacing to line the perimeter of the hole. Measure the edges of your rip with a soft measuring tape. Use fabric scissors to trim 4 thin, rectangular strips of fusible material that match the dimensions of the rip. Try to make your strips of fusible around 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide, or wide enough to support the inner edges of the rip. [3] X Research source These strips of fusible material go along the inner edges of the rip, which provide extra support. They create a “frame” of sorts around the rip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arrange the fusible interfacing around the edges of the ripped denim.",
      "content": "Arrange the fusible interfacing around the edges of the ripped denim. Line the strips around the bottom, sides, and top of the rip. If necessary, overlap the strips so the tear is completely surrounded with fusible material. [4] X Research source Since your jeans are already on a flat surface, you don’t need to pin the fusible material into place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a section of denim or premade patch on top of the hole.",
      "content": "Place a section of denim or premade patch on top of the hole. Choose a patch that slightly overlaps the edges of your rip so it stays in place. If the patch is too big, use a pair of fabric scissors to trim and adjust the edges. Make sure that the patch overlaps with the strips of fusible interfacing as you center over the rip. [5] X Research source You can purchase premade denim patches at a craft store, or any store that sells craft supplies. If you have leftover denim from an old project, you can use that instead!"

    {
      "title": "Iron the fusible interfacing strips and patch over the hole.",
      "content": "Iron the fusible interfacing strips and patch over the hole. Set your iron to medium heat with the steam setting turned off. Drag the iron over the patch and fusible material, applying an even amount of pressure as you go. Let the patch cool completely before you make any additional repairs. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Secure the corner of the patch in place with a looped stitch.",
      "content": "Secure the corner of the patch in place with a looped stitch. Patch the inside of the jeans so you don't see it necessarily from the outside. Thread a sturdy sewing needle with a thread that matches the color of your jeans, making sure that it’s knotted on 1 end. Sew through 1 corner of the patch, looping the thread backwards and over the edge of the patch. Stitch the corner multiple times so the patch doesn’t shift or move. [7] X Research source Try using sewing needles designed specifically for denim. Your stitches don’t have to be perfect—they just have to connect the patch to your jeans!"

    {
      "title": "Use a zig-zag motion with your thread to sew around the edges.",
      "content": "Use a zig-zag motion with your thread to sew around the edges. As you stitch the rest of your patch, try crossing your stitches over one another to form an “X.” Continue this pattern along all 4 edges of the patch so it’s attached securely to the rest of your jeans. To make sure that your patch is super secure, sew around the perimeter of your patch 3 times. [8] X Research source You can also use a blanket stitch if you want your stitches to look uniform.

    {
      "title": "Knot the thread every few stitches to keep the patch secure.",
      "content": "Knot the thread every few stitches to keep the patch secure. Thread the needle through both the jeans and patch to form a large loop. Instead of tightening the loop and creating a stitch, thread the needle through the loop instead. Pull the thread tight to create a knot, then continue stitching along the edge of the patch. [10] X Research source Be sure to knot the thread at least once along each edge of the patch."

      "content": "Create a final knot once you’ve stitched the patch in place. Pull your needle through the patch to create another loop. Thread your needle through the loop, then tighten the thread to create a knot. At this point, trim off any excess thread with a pair of fabric scissors. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Iron over the patch and fusible interfacing to provide extra reinforcement.",
      "content": "Iron over the patch and fusible interfacing to provide extra reinforcement. Use the same iron settings as you did before, leaving the steam settings turned off. Rub the iron over the fusible material and denim patch, applying an even amount of pressure along the surface of both materials. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Snip away any loose threads from inside your jeans. Take your fabric scissors and trim any threads down to the edge of the patch. Once your patch is securely attached to your jeans, you can turn your pants right-side-out and wear them again! [13] X Research source"
