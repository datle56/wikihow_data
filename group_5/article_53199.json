      "title": "Have a wet zone and a dry zone in the bathroom.",
      "content": "Have a wet zone and a dry zone in the bathroom. The wet zone is where the floor may get wet, such as by the tub or just outside the shower. The dry zone is where the floor will stay dry, such as by the door or the towel rack. Keep a good amount of space between the wet zone and the dry zone so you do not have to walk in wet spots when you use the bathroom. [1] X Research source For example, you may have a wet zone where the toilet is next to the shower and the sink. Then, you may put the towel rack by the door to have a separate dry zone. Keep in mind you can use a bath mat to help control the water so it does not get in the dry zone."

      "title": "Put the toilet in a separate area for more privacy.",
      "content": "Put the toilet in a separate area for more privacy. One popular option is to have a water closet that is next to the bathroom that contains the toilet. This makes the toilet more private and allows someone to use the shower while someone else uses the toilet. Go for this option if you have a busy household with lots of people using the same bathroom. [2] X Research source Doing this can also allow you to have a larger shower or tub and a bigger sink in the bathroom, as you do not have to make room for a toilet. If you can’t create a separate water closet, put a half wall next to the toilet to section it off and create more privacy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a bathtub if you have the space.",
      "content": "Get a bathtub if you have the space. A bathtub with rounded sides looks more sleek and be more space conscious. A square shaped bathtub will take up more space but may fit your design aesthetic more. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that you’ll need to have hardware for a shower head as well as a shower curtain if you want to take showers as well as baths. Some bathtubs are freestanding and aren’t meant to be used as showers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a stand-up shower if you have limited space.",
      "content": "Pick a stand-up shower if you have limited space. A stand-up shower may be a better option if you do not have a lot of space in the bathroom or want to save space. A stand-up shower is a functional option for a small room. [4] X Research source Stand-up showers can be quite luxurious, and you can make them look sleek and modern by using spa-like tiles. They can also incorporate features that a shower/tub combo may not support. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the sink close to the toilet.",
      "content": "Place the sink close to the toilet. This will make it easier for someone using the bathroom to get up off the toilet and wash their hands. The sink should be a few feet in front of the toilet or adjacent to it against the wall. Do not put the sink above the toilet or too far away from the toilet, as this will make it very awkward to use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use dividing walls between the tub and the toilet.",
      "content": "Use dividing walls between the tub and the toilet. If you have the room, keep the different areas in the bathroom separate with high dividing walls. Put a dividing wall between the bathtub and the toilet to keep them separate. Or use a stand-up shower with a dividing wall to keep it separate from the toilet. [6] X Research source Using dividing walls that do not reach the ceiling can keep the room separate but still open. They may be a good option if you do not want the bathroom to feel crowded or too small."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include small windows for natural light.",
      "content": "Include small windows for natural light. Put in a small window by the sink or a few feet away from the toilet to let in natural light. Frost the window glass so no one can see into the bathroom. If you include a small window in the shower, make sure it is frosted or can be obscured. Alternatively, you could install a skylight, which is a beautiful and functional choice. Plus, you won’t have to worry about privacy."

    {
      "title": "Confirm there is enough room for the door to open and close.",
      "content": "Confirm there is enough room for the door to open and close. Bathroom doors are usually 28–36 inches (71–91 cm) wide. Leave between 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) of space between the door and any bathroom items, such as a sink or toilet. The door should be able to swing open and close easily without hitting any items or fixtures. [7] X Research source If your bathroom is small, consider installing a pocket door to maximize space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a high mounted toilet to save space.",
      "content": "Get a high mounted toilet to save space. Mount the toilet on the wall if you want it to float off the ground. Mounting it high on the wall will allow you to conserve space, especially if the room is small. [8] X Research source You can also mount the toilet on the floor if you prefer. However, this may take up more space. Mount the toilet at regulation height so everyone can use it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a sliding glass door for the shower for a sleek look.",
      "content": "Use a sliding glass door for the shower for a sleek look. Make a stand-up shower more sleek and space conscious by using a glass door that slides, rather than opens. Get glass doors that fit the shower properly and slide easily open and closed. A sliding glass door can be more expensive than a shower curtain, so you may opt for the curtain if you are budget-conscious. In some cases, you do not need to put up a full door on the shower. Instead, having a long pane of glass on the front of the shower, with space for you to get in and out, is enough. You could also choose a seamless glass door that swings open on hinges for a sleek look."

    {
      "title": "Get a free-standing tub for a more luxurious option.",
      "content": "Get a free-standing tub for a more luxurious option. A tub that sits on the ground and is not mounted to the wall can be a great option if you like taking relaxing baths. Look for a rounded tub or a tub with claw feet for a luxurious design. Make sure you have enough room to fit a free-standing tub in the space before you get one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Float or round the sink to save space.",
      "content": "Float or round the sink to save space. Go for a sink that has rounded sides for a small space. Or mount it to the wall so it floats and takes up less room. [9] X Research source A trough style sink that floats is a good option for a narrow space. A rounded sink on a skinny pedestal is a good option for a space that is wide, rather than narrow. Look for a sink with a vanity that has a shelf to save space and create more storage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for towel racks that are flush to the wall.",
      "content": "Go for towel racks that are flush to the wall. Look for towel racks that are slim and can be positioned close to the wall so they do not take up too much space. Have a towel rack for your larger towels and a smaller rack for a hand towel. [10] X Research source Position the towel racks at shoulder height so you can hang towels on them easily. Put the towel rack on the back of the bathroom door if you do not have space on the walls in the bathroom. There should also be a towel rack close to the shower or tub so you don’t drip water on the floor. Some glass shower doors have hooks or rods to hang towels."

    {
      "title": "Pick a faucet and taps that are proportional to the sink.",
      "content": "Pick a faucet and taps that are proportional to the sink. Look for a faucet that is not too big or tall for the sink. The taps should match the faucet and be big enough to twist easily. [11] X Research source Go for a faucet that floats and is mounted into the wall to save space. Have the faucet and taps match the color and shape of the towel racks for a more uniform look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a toilet paper holder that matches the rest of the decor.",
      "content": "Get a toilet paper holder that matches the rest of the decor. Look for a toilet paper holder that is the same color or shape as the towel racks. Place the toilet paper holder on the wall beside the toilet, within arm’s reach. [12] X Research source Use a toilet holder on a stand if you do not want to mount it to the wall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get woven storage baskets for bathroom items.",
      "content": "Get woven storage baskets for bathroom items. To add more storage to the bathroom, look for deep woven baskets that you can slide under the sink. Put toiletries, spare toilet paper rolls, and other items in the baskets. [13] X Research source You can also use large storage baskets to store extra towels."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add shelving above the toilet or sink for storage.",
      "content": "Add shelving above the toilet or sink for storage. Another option is to install shelves above the toilet for candles, toilet paper, and other items. Make sure the shelves are just as long as the toilet and not too wide so they do not extend too far over the toilet. [14] X Research source Shelves above the sink are a good option for extra storage as well. Try having one long shelf that is not too wide so you can still use the sink. You may want to put a shelf between the sink and mirror to store toothbrushes and soap to keep the countertop clear."

    {
      "title": "Put in a mirror to make the space seem bigger.",
      "content": "Put in a mirror to make the space seem bigger. Include a mirror over the sink so people can see themselves when they get ready for the day. It will also help to keep the space more open. The mirror should be as wide as the sink. [15] X Research source If you don’t have room for a mirror over the sink or vanity, install one on the back of the bathroom door. A full-length mirror would work well here."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a chair or a bench if there is room.",
      "content": "Include a chair or a bench if there is room. A chair by the sink or close to the door can provide some seating in the bathroom. A bench is a good option if the bathroom is going to be used by multiple people at once and you have the space for it. Choose wooden, metal, or plastic seating. If you go for an upholstered piece, make sure it is water- and mold-resistant. Make sure the chair or bench does not crowd the room or make it feel too small."

      "title": "Look through design magazines and websites for ideas.",
      "content": "Look through design magazines and websites for ideas. Buy design magazines that focus on interior decorating, especially for bathrooms.
