The parent monsters both must be from the same island and must breed on that island to have a chance at making a Rare Mammott. You can technically use a T-Rox, Clamble, Bowgart, Congle, PomPom, Thumpies, Woolabee, Wynq, Sooza, Spytrap, Fiddlement, Ziggurab, Cantorell, or Clavi Gnat to breed a Rare Mammott, but the following combinations work best: [1] X Research source T-Rox and Clamble on Plant Island Congle and Wynq on Fire Oasis Spytrap and Fiddlement on Light Island Cantorell and Clavi Gnat on Faerie Island"

You can upgrade your structure by spending 25 diamonds. You can also add Wishing Torches around your Breeding Structure to help increase the odds of a rare monster being bred. [5] X Research source Wishing Torches can be lit for 24 hours by paying 2 diamonds or be lit permanently by paying 100 diamonds."
