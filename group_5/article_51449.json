For example, if you don't have internet access, but you have a landline or mobile with free minutes, then you would pay only the calling card minutes. However if you don't have unlimited minutes, then you will end up paying for both mobile minutes and calling card minutes, a cost which can accumulate fast. Most convenience stores, supermarkets, and airports sell calling cards. Talk to the store clerk when buying an international calling card. They can help you pick the right one for Argentina, and one that also has good minute to price ratio rates.
