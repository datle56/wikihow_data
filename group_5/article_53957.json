Staying with your partner after you know you want to leave them is not helpful to you or your partner or considerate of either of your feelings. Just drum up enough courage to end your relationship. It will be better for everyone. [1] X Research source This doesn't mean that you should not take your time in thinking about your decision. You cannot undo a breakup easily once it is gone."

      "content": "Do it face to face. Although it may seem appealing to end your relationship where you don't have to see your partner's face, this is a childish and harmful way to end a relationship, especially a long term one. It will be hard to tell your partner in person, but given how long the two of you have been together, your relationship deserves more respect than that. Don't leave a voicemail, write them a letter, tell them over the phone, or tell them through email or social media. These are cowardly and hurtful. Reader Poll: We asked 332 wikiHow readers, and 62% of them agreed that the best way to tell your partner you want to leave is to have a private and honest conversation . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Pick the right time. There is never a good time to end a relationship, but there are better times than others to break the news. Avoid telling your partner right before leaving the house, before you or your partner has to go to work, or at other busy times. This will not give you and your partner adequate time to deal with the situation and give the breakup the attention it deserves. You should also avoid telling them in public."

      "title": "Be firm in your decision.",
      "content": "Be firm in your decision. You made the decision to end your long term relationship for a reason. When you tell your partner, you need to stand firm in your decision to end it. Let them know that you are unhappy and that you are not interested in trying to make it work. If you know that your relationship will not last, make sure you don't give in to any pleas made by your partner. You are just delaying the inevitable ending to your relationship.

      "content": "Be honest. When you end your relationship with your partner, make sure you are honest. Don't avoid telling your partner exactly why you feel you need to move on and end the relationship. This will only cause problems for you and your partner in the long run.

      "content": "Stay calm. One of the worse things you can do is get riled up and tense when you are getting ready to breakup with your long term partner. This will make the situations even more stressful for you. The process is not going to be easy, but stressing about it is not going to change it. Take time to relax as you decide the best way to tell your partner. You want to explain your reasons for breaking up with a clear head and calm demeanor. This may be difficult, but it is possible. If you are extremely stressed, do something that relaxes you, such as reading or listening to music."

      "content": "Focus on the present. There is no reason to bring up the past when you are breaking up with your long term partner. The reasons that you want to break it off are current and about how your relationship is now. Don't bring up how your relationship used to be or any old fights while telling your partner it's over. This will just add salt to wounds and make the breakup that much harder. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't be passive aggressive. Avoid changing your behavior in order to get your partner to end the relationship first. This will end up making the breakup nastier than it needs to be. Approach the situation like an adult and be honest with your partner instead of trying to make them break up with you. Avoid being overly aggressive or petty towards your partner and don't make life miserable for both of you. This will help no one in the long run."

      "content": "Avoid blaming your partner. You don't want your breakup to turn ugly, so avoid placing blame on anyone in the relationship for its failure. Relationships are complicated and never black and white, so try to focus on breaking up with them in a way that does not place blame or sound accusatory. If there is a reason for you breaking up with your partner that is not your fault, such as your partner cheating on you, still try to take the high road.

      "content": "Know it will take time. A breakup, especially of a long term relationship, will not happen over night. Considering that your lives have been intertwined for so long, there is no easy break from them. You and your partner will probably have mutual friends, possessions, and routines that will make it tense and awkward for awhile. Your routines and life will change when your relationship is no longer a factor. This will take time to adjust to. You will also have lingering feelings, even if you are no longer in love with your partner. You may be emotional for awhile after the breakup as you cope with these lingering feelings."
