      "title": "Start eating a healthier diet.",
      "content": "Start eating a healthier diet . You should already have healthy habits implemented into your diet. Eat appropriate well-portioned sizes. Middle school cheer teams tend to not give diet plans, so it doesn't generally matter. You should train with spare time. A healthy meal plan to follow is for breakfast, eat a small bowl of oatmeal, a banana, a small slice of cheese, a spoonful of peanut butter, and 3 glasses of water. Before morning practice it's best to eat an energy bar or a cereal bar. This should be your morning snack. For lunch, eat a nice filling lunch like pasta, or a sandwich with carbs for energy. Also, If you're still hungry you can have a small portion of fruits and vegetables. Eat whatever your parents make for dinner. For dessert, eat vanilla yogurt with peanut butter mixed in."

      "title": "Begin an exercise routine.",
      "content": "Begin an exercise routine. You need to train for specific cheer moves like jumps , motions, and tumbling, and for overall endurance, strength, and flexibility . To train for jumps, you need to do at least 30 straddle leg lifts on each leg. A straddle leg lift is when you sit in a straddle and lift up one leg at a time without letting it touch the floor. You also need to do 30 squat jumps, 15 hops on each foot, 30 toe raises, and 30 squats. Don't forget cheerleader crunches, which is where you lie on your back with your arms above your head and crunch up into a toe touch on the floor, do 15 of these. Also, doing 10 of each required jump is great! For your motions, learn how to do bow and arrow, daggers, go or punch, hands on hips, left L, right L, left K, right K, left diagonal, right diagonal, T, broken T, high V, low V, touchdown, and low touchdown. Keep these motions stiff and tight. For tumbling, do 10 cartwheels, 10 round offs, and 10 handstands. Make sure you keep your arms and legs straight and tight and your toes pointed. Imagine you are a board. For endurance, do cardio 4 days a week. Do a cardio workout routine video. For strength training, which should be done 3 days a week, do a workout video that focuses on strengthening your arms one day, your legs one day, and your abs another day. For flexibility, do stretches twice a day. You need to have a good split."

      "title": "Shine at the tryouts.",
      "content": "Shine at the tryouts. You need to stand out at tryouts. If you can do a herkie, toe touch, split, cartwheel, and round off, you should be able to make it. During cheerleading tryouts, dress neatly in a school shirt, dance shorts, dance or cheer shoes, your hair in a high ponytail with a bow. For school shirts, make sure they are in your school colors if you can. Tie up the back if it is too long. Wear black dance shorts if you aren't super-duper tan and pastel shorts if you are super duper tan. Your dance/cheer shoes should be either white or black with white ankle socks. If you pick to go with dance shoes, jazz shoes are the best option. For your hair, brush it into a ponytail that is behind your part and high. Wear a bow in either white or your school colors. Makeup is not necessary, if you're doing tryouts outside in the sun you shouldn't apply too much makeup, if you're still planning to wear makeup, wear sweatproof makeup. For your tattoo, make it have to do with your mascot, for example, a paw print, animal, or school initials."

      "content": "Do your cheer with a lot of energy. Make it loud, snappy, and sharp. On the first day of tryouts, they will have you perform a cheer, a toe touch and optional tumbling. Make sure you bring your legs up high in the toe touch and your back straight. For tumbling, do your cartwheel, round off, and handstand. In the breakout and warm up/stretching sessions, show off your split, straddle, and bridge. Give girls advice if they ask about your moves. You will perform a toe touch, herkie, split, cartwheel, round off, handstand, and cheer. You will do similar things to yesterday, but you have to be even better than before. Show off your oversplit if you are there."
