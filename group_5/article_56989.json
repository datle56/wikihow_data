      "title": "Stack four sheets of tissue paper or crepe paper.",
      "content": "Stack four sheets of tissue paper or crepe paper. This looks best with paper in two or three bright colors. Cut the paper to 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 in) for a mediumâ€“large flower, or try out other sizes."

      "title": "Fold the stack accordion-style.",
      "content": "Fold the stack accordion-style. Starting from a short side, fold the stack of paper over about 2.5 cm (1 inch). Crease the paper, flip the stack over, and fold it again in the other direction. Keep folding in alternate directions, as though you were making a paper fan. Continue until the entire stack forms an accordion fold. Optionally, trim the ends into a point, rounded end, or V-shaped notch. These effects create a flower with distinct petals, instead of a fluffy carnation. You can even make a second layer in green paper, cutting it into sharp points to form leaves. If you are using paper much smaller or larger than the size mentioned above, adjust the size of the fold to match."

      "content": "Crease the center of the paper. Keep the paper in a 1-inch wide stack. Fold it in half so the two ends meet. Crease it to mark the center, then unfold it again."

      "title": "Tape the stem around the center.",
      "content": "Tape the stem around the center. Place the stem against the crease mark. Fold it over the paper so it touches itself on the other side. Secure the stem with tape. Tie a ribbon or wire around this instead if you want to hang the flower. Cut two small notched at the center first to secure it. [1] X Research source"
