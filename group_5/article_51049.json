      "content": "No, there aren’t any scientifically-backed materials to block EMF. Many websites suggest using aluminum, copper, or carpeting to block EMF radiation, but they usually aren’t legitimate. Experts recommend limiting your time spent near the electrical panel to lower your EMF exposure within your home.

      "content": "Yes, as long as you’re an arm’s length away. Most electrical panels (as long as they’re working correctly) give off a small amount of EMF. As long as you aren't sitting directly next to the electrical panel every single day, it’s fine to sit close to it or in the same room as it. [3] X Research source If you’re concerned about EMF, set up your living area as far from the electrical panel as you can."

      "content": "No, but you should try to sleep at least 1 m (3.3 ft) away from it. Since electrical panels give off radiation, sleeping next to them isn’t recommended. Over time, the radiation can build up in your system, leading to symptoms like fatigue, headaches, and mood swings.

      "content": "Use an EMF meter. Turn the meter on and hold it next to the electrician panel in your home. A normal reading will be anywhere from 0 to 10 volts per meter. As you back away from the electrical panel, the reading will get lower and lower. [7] X Research source If you’re concerned, you can call your power company and schedule an on-site reading. They’ll be able to help you if your EMF reading is too high."
