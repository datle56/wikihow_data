      "title": "Mix baking soda and water.",
      "content": "Mix baking soda and water. Making a solution suitable for invisible ink will take almost equal parts baking soda and water. For the best results, you want to mix as much baking soda as you can into a small bowl of water. Add a little baking soda at a time and mix slowly to fully saturate the water. 1/4 cup (60 mL) of water will hold 3 tablespoons (43.2 grams) of baking soda. If your “ink” has deposits of baking soda that won’t dissolve, the solution is over saturated. Just work backwards: add a little water at a time until the baking soda dissolves completely."

      "title": "Write your message on white paper.",
      "content": "Write your message on white paper. Using the brush or swab, write your message in clear block letters on a piece of paper. Make sure you write your letters large enough to be legible. The water will bleed into the paper, distorting the letters, so practice using your brush or swab ahead of time. Consider writing your message in code for added security. For example, a simple substitution code replaces each letter of the alphabet with another letter or a number in a pattern set ahead of time. A regular index card makes a great surface for short messages."

      "title": "Allow the “ink” to dry.",
      "content": "Allow the “ink” to dry. You want the message to dry without leaving signs that the paper has been tampered with. For better results, try the following: Press the page between heavy books or other weights. Add a few pieces of paper above and below the page carrying the message so excess moisture does not ruin the books that you use for weight. Hang the paper. Photographers hang developing prints to let them dry because gravity will help keep the paper from warping. You can use the same trick by using clothes pegs to hang your message. If you use a heavy, high-quality paper or cardstock to carry your message, the thicker paper will warp less than standard copier paper."

      "title": "Consider steaming the page.",
      "content": "Consider steaming the page. [4] X Research source When you write your message on the page, the watery “ink” will warp the paper, leaving marks that are visible even after the paper dries. By lightly steaming the page, you can hide all evidence that the paper has been tampered with, which increases the chance your message will go undetected. There are two good methods for steaming your secret message: Boil water in an electric kettle or a large pot and hold the page near the rising steam. Steam is extremely hot (hotter than boiling water) so use kitchen tongs or a similar utensil to hold the page. Use an iron on the lowest steam setting. Keep your fingers safe from the steam and lightly iron the page. If you do steam the page, be sure to use one of the advanced drying methods listed above."

      "content": "Consider writing a decoy message on the dry paper in pen or pencil. [5] X Research source If your message is intercepted before delivery, an empty page would look suspicious. After all, who would go through the trouble of delivering a blank piece of paper? By writing a decoy message on the page, you can throw enemies off your trail. For instance: Writing a grocery list over your secret message is a classic spy trick. Nobody suspects the humble shopping list. If you plan on revealing your secret message with a liquid method (grape or red cabbage juice), don’t write your decoy message in pen! The ink from the pen will bleed across the page when you apply the wash."

      "title": "Expose your message to a source of heat.",
      "content": "Expose your message to a source of heat. It takes a good amount of heat to oxidize the carbon in the baking soda enough to reveal your message, which means you need a safe but strong source of direct heat. Several household heating elements can work. [6] X Research source For example: An incandescent light bulb works. You will need to hold the message near a hot bulb for several minutes to heat the baking soda enough. A traditional stove is another idea. Be careful holding a piece of paper too close to hot coils, which could also start a fire. Hair dryers can be turned up to a high heat and waved evenly over the page. A dry iron can reveal the letters of your message as well. Avoid using a steam setting and draw the hot iron over your paper slowly and evenly. [7] X Research source You could place your message on a baking try and put it in an oven set to 250 °F (121 °C), checking every few minutes for your letters to appear. Laying your page on an old-fashioned radiator or the top of a toaster can work too. [8] X Research source Pay attention to the paper at all times to reduce the risk of accidental flames."

      "content": "Be careful to avoid catching your page on fire. [9] X Research source Paper is flammable, and holding your page close to direct heat means a chance for accidental flames. Choose the method of heating you feel safest with and avoid using any open flames if possible. Halogen bulbs emit more heat than standard incandescent bulbs and increase the risk of fire. Stoves will heat up slowly but eventually become very hot. Use kitchen tongs to hold your message and avoid getting the paper too close to the coils."

Whatever method you use for heating the page containing the invisible ink, work slowly to ensure you heat the paper only as much as necessary. Move your page over the heat source to avoid one place on the paper from getting too hot. [10] X Research source It can take several minutes for your letters to appear, depending on the amount of heat you apply, the thickness and texture of the paper, and the saturation of the \"ink\" you made.

      "content": "Read the message that appears in brown letters on the page. As the paper warms up, your message will reappear on the page as though being burned into the paper itself. The letters appear brown because sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is broken down into its parts when heated, allowing the carbon in the baking soda to become oxidized when it touches the air. [12] X Research source Oxidation is the same reason the flesh of an apple turns brown after sitting out."

      "content": "Thaw grape juice concentrate in a bowl. The best grape juice to use for revealing your invisible ink is the concentrated kind, which often comes frozen. [13] X Research source Concentrated juice contains more acid and will create a stronger reaction with the baking soda in the invisible ink. You can use any dark, acidic liquid such as cherry or blackcurrant juice or balsamic vinegar to reveal your message."
