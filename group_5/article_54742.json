For women, that's around 14%-20% body fat. For men, shoot for 6%-13% body fat. This means eating a healthy diet and doing plenty of high-intensity cardio. While you don't have to be super slim to have visible back dimples, it does help. These dimples occur at a point where there is not a lot of muscle tissue between your skin and the underlying bone. If your natural dimples are not that deep, extra body fat could fill in that space and make them hard to see. There are several ways to calculate your body fat percentage, but the most common method is to use special calipers to measure skinfolds at several sites on your body. Ask your doctor, personal trainer, or a registered dietitian to measure your body fat. [1] X Research source"

If you're looking to get a truly athletic figure that will show off your back dimples to the best advantage, you may need to do more. Talk to a registered dietitian or personal trainer about how to achieve your goals in a healthy way. Good cardio activities include things like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, and sports like tennis and squash. An easy way to gauge the intensity of your exercise is to do the “talk test.” During moderate-intensity exercise, you should be breathing hard enough that you can talk, but not sing. During high-intensity exercise, saying more than a few words will be difficult.

This is accomplished by removing fat from the areas where you would like the dimples to appear. Traditionally, this is done with liposuction, in which a needle is inserted under the skin and a little bit of fat is suctioned out. The liposuction procedure used specifically to create back dimples may go by a variety names, including V-spot treatment, Dimples En V, or Barbie Back surgery. This type of liposuction is usually performed under local anesthesia. Possible risks of liposuction include numbness around the liposuction site, infection of the skin, bleeding, or fat embolism (a blood vessel blockage caused by a loose piece of fat).

      "content": "Use deoxycholic acid injections as an alternative to liposuction. Deoxycholic acid (Kybella) can be injected under the skin to dissolve fat without damaging the surrounding tissues. Targeted injections can be used to simulate back dimples. Deoxycholic injections require less downtime and are less expensive than liposuction, but you may need several treatments to get the results you want. Common side effects of Kybella injections include swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness, and hardening of the tissue around the injection. Kybella is only FDA approved for treatment of fat below the chin. However, cosmetic practitioners may still legally use it for off-label uses, such as creating back dimples.

While a single treatment with Kybella costs less than liposuction, you may need multiple treatments. Because of this, Kybella can add up to about the same or even more than what you would pay for liposuction. [14] X Research source Most insurance plans will not cover the costs of these types of procedures, so you will almost certainly have to pay the whole cost out of pocket."
