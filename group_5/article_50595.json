See if you can determine what caused the injury to the person and if it is safe for you to approach. It doesn't help anyone to rush into a situation before the hazard has completely ended — you can't help the person if you fall victim to the same emergency, and emergency medical services (EMS) do not need to rescue two people instead of one."

Can you tell me what year it is? Can you tell me what month it is? What day is it? Who is the president? Do you know where you are? Do you know what happened? If the person answers clearly and coherently, then they are displaying a high level of consciousness. If the person responds but answers incorrectly to several of the first questions, then he’s conscious but showing signs of what is called an altered or changed mental state, which includes confusion and disorientation."

Write everything down if you need to in order to pass along the information just as the person communicated it. For instance, if the person has given incoherent answers to most of your questions but also communicated that she has a seizure disorder, then she may continue answering questions incorrectly for five to ten minutes in the post-seizure phase of the disorder, yet she may require little more than a brief period of observation from paramedics. As another example, if the person has confirmed that she is diabetic, then the emergency responder will know to immediately check her glucose levels when you pass along that information."

If the person responds to \"pain\" — to this sensation — you can continue to monitor them without CPR as this is a sign that they are okay for the moment (if they do not respond to pain, however, you will likely need to proceed to CPR). If you fear the person otherwise has a chest injury from the trauma, other methods of testing her pain response include pinching the person’s fingernail or nail bed or pinching the person’s trapezius muscle (back of the neck). The pinch should be very hard and directly to the muscle.

[11] X Research source Be sure to keep a constant watch on the rise and fall of the person’s chest to ensure that he’s still breathing. If you cannot tell by watching alone, you can place your ear near their mouth or nose and listen for breath sounds. When you listen at someone's mouth, point your head down their body to the chest and watch their chest rise and fall at the same time. This is the easiest way to see breathing. Note that if you have any reason to suspect a spinal injury but the person is breathing, then do not try to reposition him unless he vomits. In this case, roll their entire body to the side while supporting their neck and back to keep them in the same position. If you have no reason to suspect a spinal injury, then roll the person onto their side, position their top leg so that both their hip and knee are at a 90° angle (to stabilize him on their side), and then softly tilt their head back to help keep their airway open. This is called the \"recovery position\" and is the safest for the patient to be in, in case he vomits at any point."

      "content": "Check the person’s airway. If the person isn’t breathing or has stopped breathing, then the first step is to check their airway. Place one hand on their forehead and the other underneath their jaw. With the forehead hand, slide their head backward and tilt their jaw with the other hand. Watch for any signs of their chest beginning to rise and fall. Place your ear over their mouth and feel for any breath on your face. [14] X Research source If you can easily see something in the airway when you look into the person's mouth, then try to remove it, but only if the object is loose. If the object is clearly lodged, then do not try to remove it from their throat since you may inadvertently push the object farther down their airway. The reason we check the airway first is that if there is a blockage (or an obstruction, such as often happens in choking victims), and if we can easily remove it, our problem is solved. However, if there is not, check for a pulse and, if there is no pulse (or if you cannot find one and are in doubt), immediately begin chest compressions. Head-tilt chin-lifts should not be done on skull, spine, neck injuries. Instead, use the jaw-thrust method, in which you kneel above the person's head and place your hands on either side of their head. Place your middle and index finger along their jaw bone and gently push it upward so that the jaw is jutting forward, as though he has an underbite."
