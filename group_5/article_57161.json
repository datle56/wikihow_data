Dozens of cuisines have been created around the world using ingredients native to that region. The simplest approach when first learning to adapt a recipe might be to start with food that’s most familiar to you. This will help you recognize when the flavors are unbalanced. You will also already be familiar with the specific cooking techniques used for that cuisine."

Find recipes you’d like to try by browsing cookbooks, magazines and recipes online if you don't already have one on hand you want to modify. Start with tried-and-true cookbooks and online recipes with many positive reviews, so you will know a recipe works well and that many like it. Finally, remember that modifying a recipe is an experiment. It could turn out to be the most delicious thing you’ve ever eaten or an inedible mess. Have fun with it! [1] X Research source Reviews of online recipes often include information on how the reviewer adapted it. They also often discuss tricks discovered to make the dish more easily and quickly. Reviews also frequently cover what didn’t work. You can also modify a dish through examining one you’ve eaten at a restaurant or friend’s home. Write down the ingredients you remember and the cooking techniques you think were used. Make this your base recipe. [2] X Research source Don't be surprised if the measurements and instructions don’t make sense when using an \"heirloom\" recipe written decades ago. For instance, how much is a \"tumbler\" of milk? Go to a website such as this for translations and conversions: [1] .

To make it healthier or to accommodate allergies? The answer will guide you in adapting it successfully. Here are some tips and links to websites that will help you a) convert yield and portion size and b) adapt recipes to be healthier and to accommodate allergies. Conduct online searches using the name of the dish and words such as “gluten free,” “dairy free,” “vegan,” “sugar free” and so forth when modifying for health or allergy purposes. You’ll have a better idea of the ingredients you can substitute after reading a few of these recipes. Here is a chart for adapting recipe ingredients to make them more healthy: [3] Additionally, food scientists have found that people don’t notice much of a flavor difference when the following are changed: reducing sugar and fats by 1/3, omitting salt or reducing it by 1/2, substituting whole wheat flour for 1/4 to 1/2 of all-purpose flour, and substituting finely ground oat bran or oatmeal for 1/4 of all-purpose flour.

This is because these foods use precise ratios between and among necessary structural ingredients. All breads, for instance, are 5 parts flour and 3 parts liquid. You wouldn’t end up with bread if you changed that ratio. So always consider the role of the ingredient when deciding if you can substitute it, and how. Signature ingredients can be swapped, but be careful because they also are typically core to a dish. For example, basil is necessary in a pesto recipe. Accent ingredients, such as blueberries in muffins, are more easily modified without risk of ruining the dish. [3] X Research source"

You can also use ratios to form the basis of potentially hundreds of recipe modifications. [4] X Research source While some ratios call for cups, many call for parts. When they call for parts, they mean weight. A cup of flour, for instance, could vary in how many ounces is actually in it based upon variables such as whether a sifter was used or if the flour was packed into the measuring cup. Therefore, think in terms of ounces and get a good digital kitchen scale to use. [5] X Research source Also remember that when ounces are the unit of measurement, weight is measured in ounces but volume is measured in fluid ounces. They aren’t equivalent. Thus, always use liquid measuring cups for liquids."

Before randomly substituting ingredients or cooking techniques, taste the food from the original recipe and think about what you like and don’t like about it. Would a different spice improve it, or more/less of the spice used? Might swapping a certain ingredient give it a better texture? If so, think about ingredients that would accomplish this without changing the flavor. If cooking for others, ask them for their thoughts on the dish as made according to the original recipe.

When adapting a recipe, it’s critical to understand the difference between flavor and taste because interchanging ingredients can dramatically alter the dish’s flavor. Taste is what our taste buds perceive when a food touches one of the now five identified taste receptors on the tongue. There are five scientifically identified tastes: salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami. Flavor, on the other hand, is a combination of taste; the aroma of the food; and the texture of the food. [7] X Research source Balancing the tastes is necessary for a nicely flavored dish. Knowing which tastes balance each other will help you decide how to best modify recipes and to correct flavor imbalances. Thus, these tastes and ways to balance them are discussed in part 3."

Experiment with ingredients having different tastes and textures after you've made it the first time. [8] X Research source But remember that ultimately the tastes must be balanced, or the modification will not have the flavor you want. Take detailed notes each time you modify a recipe. You won’t be able to recreate it if you don’t. Your notes will also help you determine what didn't work in your modified recipe. They’ll also help you avoid repeating mistakes if you make it again. Here are things to include in your notes: the necessity of an ingredient, its impact on the flavor, how it reacted to other ingredients (e.g., soggy raisins in baked goods), and if it is a structural, signature or accent ingredient."

      "content": "List the ingredients next. The ingredients list lets the person making the recipe (or you, if you’re making it again) formulate a preparation and cooking plan. List the ingredients in the order they’ll be used in the recipe. Use precise measurements and indicate if they need preparation. For instance, instead of writing “1 clove of garlic” when the instructions later say to “add 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic,” write “1/2 tablespoon garlic, minced.” [10] X Research source If an ingredient is used more than once in a recipe, list it where it’s first used. Then write “divided” after it, set off by a comma. So, for example, if a recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to first sauté vegetables and to later create a vinaigrette, you’d write, “6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided.” If a dish has different elements, such as a pie has a crust and a filling, break up the ingredients list with headings such as “Crust” and “Filling.” [11] X Research source Don’t use two numerals together; set the second off with parentheses. For example: “1 (12-pounce) package of cream cheese.” [12] X Research source Be literal in your measurements. A “cup of chopped spinach” isn’t the same as a “cup of spinach, chopped.” The latter would obviously have much less. [13] X Research source Capitalize ingredients that start with a letter instead of a number. For example: “Sea salt to taste.” If preparing an ingredient is easy, set its description off with a comma after the ingredient. For example, “1 stick of butter, melted.” Use generic names rather than brand names. So, for instance, say whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. [14] X Research source"

Be descriptive by providing visual cues like “barely translucent,” “golden, pebbly top,” “almost iridescent,” etc. Also give warnings when something is tricky or dangerous. [15] X Research source State exact or approximate cooking times, with descriptors to indicate when something is done. Separate each step into a new paragraph. If you're mixing all dry ingredients in one bowl, for example, make that one step (and its own paragraph). As with the ingredient list, separate different parts of the process with headers. The second to last instruction should involve plating, garnishing and the temperature at which it should be served. The final instruction should discuss storage, if that applies.

Instead, it has three functions: to reduce bitterness, enhance sweetness and to heighten the aromas and natural tastes of other ingredients. [18] X Research source While not all dishes need salt, it generally enhances the overall flavor of most so they don’t taste flat. If you have a dish that tastes flat or bitter, try adding a three-fingered pinch of salt before anything else. Taste it again. If it’s still not right, add a little more and give it another taste. That might be all it takes. If not, proceed to balancing in other ways. Salt absorbs into food as it sits. If you add too much salt, you can try increasing the sweet or sour components or by diluting the dish a bit with water. [19] X Research source [20] X Research source You can also try to compensate by adjusting the side dishes. For example, don’t salt the rice or add a sweet or sour side dish. [21] X Research source To avoid over-concentration when reducing liquids, add salt after the liquid is reduced. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Find sweet outside of sugar. The taste of sweet is a great contrast to sour and salty tastes. It can help balance dishes with ingredients having these tastes or if a dish’s flavor becomes too salty or sour. While the sweet taste in most foods comes from sugars – cane sugar (granulated, turbinado, brown, powdered, bakers, fruit, etc.) and beet sugar – it can also come from molasses, maple syrup, honey, carrots, mango and other sweet foods. So consider these as alternatives when creating your recipes. Sweet really benefits from sour, which is why a squeeze of lemon juice over a fruit salad or cream cheese frosting on cake work so well together. [23] X Research source Unfortunately, because people are consuming more and more packaged foods that often have a lot of high fructose corn syrup and the like, we have become more tolerant of sweetness and require more of it to taste it."

That’s because sour as a taste brings out the natural flavors in foods. It also balances sweetness and spiciness and enhances saltiness. It’s generally found in acidic foods like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt and pickled veggies. It’s also in vinegars like balsamic, sherry, red, apple cider and rice. Many other fruits are also classified as sour: raspberries, blueberries, red currants and grapes. If a dish is too sour, add something sweet or something with fat to balance it.

Chocolate and coffee are naturally bitter, as are olives; greens like radicchio, arugula, dandelion and kale; hops; bitter melon; brussel sprouts; turnips; chicory; and grapefruit.
