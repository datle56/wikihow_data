Whatever size this canvas is will be the size of each repeated item in the picture. For now, set the height and width to 100 pixels or so, then zoom in to see the pattern up close. You can change the canvas size later, so don't worry about getting it exactly right the first time if you're struggling. [1] X Research source You can choose any type of background, from white to transparent, depending on your desired pattern."

If you have multiple layers, flatten the entire file by going to Layer > Flatten Image . [2] X Research source If you're just practicing, place a dot in the very middle of the frame. This will end up creating a polka dot pattern. You can turn on \"View\" → \"Show Guides\" to help you center and space out your pattern if you want exact measurements. [3] X Research source"

Remember, this pattern wants to repeat perfectly, so the each side should be balanced with the other. For example -- if your pattern is made up of stick figures, and the top of a head pokes out the bottom of the pattern, that figure's body should be right on the top edge of the pattern, so that they match up when repeated. To get this, Offset the image one more time, using the same settings as the first time. Vertical Offset: Set to half of your image's height. If you have a 600px tall canvas, set the vertical offset to 300px. Horizontal Offset: For now, set this to zero. Wrap Around: Make sure that this setting is checked."
