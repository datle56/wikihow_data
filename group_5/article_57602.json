Although it's completely fine to pour the colloidal oatmeal directly into your bathtub, put it into a filter if you weren't able to grind the oats into a fine powder. Pour the ground oats into a pair of pantyhose, a muslin bag , or a cloth cold brew coffee filter , and tie it shut with a rubber band. This prevents it from clogging your drain. [3] X Research source The filter acts like a teabag, so the bathwater infuses with the nourishing compounds from the oats. If you enjoy taking regular oatmeal baths, prep several bags of colloidal oatmeal so they're ready at a moment's notice!"

It's really important to use lukewarm, not hot, water because water that's too hot will make your dry skin feel even itchier.

If you don't feel like making your own colloidal oatmeal, buy a colloidal bath product like Aveeno soothing bath treatment .

[6] X Expert Source Lydia Shedlofsky, DO Dermatologist Expert Interview. 3 May 2021. Don't soak for more than 15 to 20 minutes or you may actually dry out your skin. Be careful getting in and out of the tub because the colloidal oatmeal makes the bathtub extra slippery. After you're done bathing, clean the tub to remove the slippery residue. Skip the soap—you want your skin to absorb the oatmeal's nutrients. Plus, soap will strip your skin of its natural oils and make it feel drier. If you don't have a bathtub or just want to spot treat your skin, prepare a bowl full of oatmeal bath solution and dip a soft sponge into it. Sponge the solution onto your skin and let it air dry."
