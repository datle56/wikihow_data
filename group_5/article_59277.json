DIY home improvement specialist Mike Katona says that if you’re updating the hinges on an old cabinet, “it’s typically best to find a hinge that is mounted the same way and has mounting holes and screws in the same places. This will allow you to update your hardware without having to drill new holes, patch old holes, and repaint.” [5] X Expert Source Mike Katona DIY Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 25 August 2021. If possible, identify the brand of the old hinge and try to replace the hardware with that same brand. [6] X Research source To make sure the new hinge matches the old one exactly, lay both side-by-side to see if the screw holes are the same distance apart. If you’re buying hinges online or you’d like to be sure they match, measure the dimensions of the old hinge and find a new hinge with the same length, height, and thickness."

Concealed and inset-mount hinges require drilling a hole into the door to mount them, while semi-concealed and exposed hinges just screw into the frame and door. [11] X Research source Concealed hinges: These are installed on frameless cabinets on the inside of the door and cabinet frame, and no part of the hinge can be seen when the door is closed. Inset-mount hinges: Inset (or overlay) mount hinges are recessed into the door, allowing it to lay flush against the face of the cabinet. Semi-concealed hinges: These hinges can only be seen at the door joint. These are usually found on face-frame cabinets and their sizes might vary based on the size of the cabinet. Exposed or traditional hinges: These hinges can be fully seen and are installed on the outside of inset or overlay cabinets. Overlay doors sit on top of the opening and cover up the face frame or cabinet edges. Inset doors are mounted inside the face frame opening with a small gap around them. To measure the cabinet’s overlay, put a piece of tape along the edge of the closed doors. Open the door and measure the distance between the cabinet opening and the tape."
