      "title": "Steel generally works the best.",
      "content": "Steel generally works the best. Pick one out that’s around 1 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) long, then trace a pointed tip onto the end of it with a permanent marker. Make it into a triangle shape for the perfect point on the edge of your sword. [1] X Research source You can find steel strips at most hardware stores for under $10."

      "title": "Use a C-clamp to secure the metal strip onto a work table.",
      "content": "Use a C-clamp to secure the metal strip onto a work table. Put on eye protection and power up an angle grinder with a cutting wheel blade. Hold the angle grinder with both hands and carefully cut the tip into the strip of metal, following the lines you traced earlier. Do this outside so you don’t shoot sparks into your home! [2] X Research source Angle grinders are fairly easy to use. You can either buy one for around $70, or you can rent one from your local hardware store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Most swords have a slight angle on the edges.",
      "content": "Most swords have a slight angle on the edges. Put a grinding disc onto your angle grinder and make small passes over both edges of the metal strip, holding the angle grinder at a 45-degree angle to the sword itself. Keep going until both edges are slightly slanted. [3] X Research source Don’t hold the angle grinder parallel to the sword, as that will flatten the edges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t sand it if you want a dark finish.",
      "content": "Don’t sand it if you want a dark finish. If you want the whole thing to be shiny, grab a power sander and load it with 80-grit sandpaper. Turn it on and press it against your sword, moving in circular motions over the flat side. It will take about 1 hour of sanding until your sword looks shiny, but it will be worth it! [4] X Research source If you don’t care about the shininess of your sword, you can skip this step."

    {
      "title": "A guard protects your hands from the rest of the sword.",
      "content": "A guard protects your hands from the rest of the sword. Try to find a metal fridge handle that’s about 6 in (15 cm) long from your local hardware store. Use a masonry drill bit to cut a slot in the dead center of it that's the same length and width as the flat end of your sword. Slide the guard onto that end of the sword so it’s situated at the end of the hilt, or the area where you’ll grab the sword. [5] X Research source If the guard slides around at all, put a screw in front of it using a masonry bit."

    {
      "title": "Make a handle for your sword for extra comfort.",
      "content": "Make a handle for your sword for extra comfort. Grab a block of wood that’s about 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick and set the non-pointed edge of your sword on top of it (the spot where you’d grab your sword to hold it). Trace the shape of the hilt onto the wood with a pencil, then use a band saw or a hand saw to cut out the shape. Then, cut out another piece of wood in the same shape and size so you can cover both sides of your hilt. [6] X Research source The type of wood you choose doesn’t really matter. Just make sure it’s a color that you like, since it will be on the end of your sword."

      "title": "They’re how you’ll attach the hilt to your sword.",
      "content": "They’re how you’ll attach the hilt to your sword. Clamp your sword down onto your workbench with a C-clamp and mark out where your hilt will be. Use a masonry drill bit to drill 3 holes along the hilt that are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart from each other. Drill slowly and carefully to avoid heating up the metal too much. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "One block will get 2 holes, and one block will get 1 hole.",
      "content": "One block will get 2 holes, and one block will get 1 hole. Place the blocks of wood onto the strip of metal and line them up with the holes you already made. Use a pencil to mark the holes onto the wood, then clamp the pieces of wood down onto a workbench with a C-clamp. Use a drill to make 2 holes (the top and the bottom hole) on one block, and 1 hole (the center hole) in the other block. [8] X Research source It’s much easier to attach the wood to the hilt of your sword if the holes are already there."

    {
      "title": "Place the 2 pieces of wood around the grip of your sword.",
      "content": "Place the 2 pieces of wood around the grip of your sword. Screw in 2 screws on one side of the sword, going for the top and bottom drill holes that you made. Flip the sword over and add the last screw in the center drill hole. If parts of the screws stick out, file them off with a metal file to make sure your hilt is smooth. [9] X Research source If the wood on your hilt is kind of rough, use a sheet of 80-grit sandpaper to sand it down until it’s smooth."

    {
      "title": "Grabbing a wooden hilt won’t be very comfortable.",
      "content": "Grabbing a wooden hilt won’t be very comfortable. Add a thin layer of super glue over the wooden hilt, then start wrapping your leather or twine from the bottom up. Overlap each layer so your wooden hilt is completely hidden. When you get to the top of the sword, cut off the excess twine or leather, then let it dry. [10] X Research source Try cutting up an old leather belt into strips for the perfect grip material."
