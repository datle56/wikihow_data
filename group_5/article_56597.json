      "content": "The TV may have been accidentally muted. Some sound bars have soft-touch buttons that are easy to brush against and turn off, so check any external sound devices, too. If the Volume Up button on your remote doesn't make the volume of your TV louder, you might have it set to play audio through an external speaker you don't have. To fix this so the sound plays through your TV, go to \"Settings\" on your TV and navigate to Sound/Audio > Sound Out > TV Speaker or choose the external speaker you know works."

      "content": "You won't hear a sound if the audio is playing to speakers you don't have. Even if you have the TV output correctly to your speaker set, you should always try using \"TV Speaker\" to see if your external device is the issue. For example, if you select TV Speaker from the \"Sound > Sound Output\" menu and hear noise from your TV, the sound issue is caused by the other speaker. In that case, jump to checking your cables .

Check that there's no physical damage (like frayed or exposed wires) and that there aren't any sharp bends. If a damaged cable is your problem, you can easily and cheaply get a new HDMI cable. Older cables can show signs of sound lag as well."

If you don't see an HDMI or Sound issue from the self-diagnostic tests, and you updated your TV and reset it but still have sound issues, try using a different speaker. Some external sound systems will turn off if they have a weak signal, which will cause your audio to drop, so use a new external speaker."
