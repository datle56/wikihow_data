      "content": "Don’t be afraid of odd colors and textures. It is common for the color and the texture of your milk to change. Much of this reflects the changing dietary needs of your baby. Appearance is no way to judge the freshness of milk . [1] X Research source It is common for the color of milk to change during the course of storage or even a single feeding. It is natural for the milk to occasionally have a bluish, greenish, yellowish, or even brownish color. It is also common for it to separate into layer of lighter milk and more dense cream. This is not dangerous, but you should gently swirl it to mix the two together."

      "content": "Be careful with milk that is three days old. Expressed milk can often last much longer than this, but its shelf life varies considerably depending upon the details of its storage.

[2] X Research source Similarly, you should be careful if the milk has been out for three hours without being refrigerated. [3] X Research source It is okay to store milk at room temperature from three to six hours depending on how cool the room is. If you are storing milk in an insulated cooler, it is safe to leave it in the cooler for 24 hours."

      "title": "Store in a tightly sealed container.",
      "content": "Store in a tightly sealed container. Glass, disposable bottle liners, or “mother’s milk” bags are best. Polypropylene or polybutylene hard plastics are preferable to soft plastic polyethylene bags. It is also important to ensure that other containers in the fridge are closed tightly so that that the milk does not absorb these other odors. A box of baking soda in the refrigerator can help absorb other smells. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Scald milk with a soapy flavor , if your baby won't drink it. If you find that your milk has a soapy flavor and that this is a problem for your baby, you can try scalding it. Heat to about 180 °F (82.2 °C) (it should show signs of a full bubble, but not a rolling boil). Immediately afterward cool and store the milk. If this flavor does not bother your child, do not scald it. The milk will lose some of its nutrients in the process. [9] X Research source"
