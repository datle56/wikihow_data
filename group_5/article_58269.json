      "content": "Pillow method shifting is a form of reality travel that’s become popular online. Around 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic started flaring up, people (especially on TikTok) began trying to subconsciously “reality shift” (RS) from the stresses of their worlds to a desired reality (DR) of their choosing as a means of escape. One of the most popular forms of RS utilized “the pillow method” where users wrote a script of where they wanted to travel to, placed it under their pillow, and meditated until they fell asleep. [1] X Research source While no scientific sources claim reality shifting is possible, most people who tried the pillow method reported at least one positive outcome - from a more active imagination to a relaxed, hypnosis-like state."

      "title": "Write your reality-shifting script.",
      "content": "Write your reality-shifting script. The first step in pillow method shifting is writing out what your desired reality looks like. Be as specific as possible, writing out key details about yourself (name, age) as well as the reality you’d like to travel to. What does it look, feel, smell, sound like? Who are the specific people in your reality? What are their names? Be as precise as you can! [2] X Research source Write your script in the present tense, as if this reality is currently happening to you. If you’d like to travel to a fictional world like Hogwarts or Wonderland, regular shifters have scripting templates for those places they’d recommend. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Start meditating. To have a vivid experience in your desired reality, it’s important to clear your mind of the stress in your current reality (CR). Make sure you have a quiet, clear, dependable space to shift from. Then, practice mindfulness by taking some deep breaths, and letting your anxious thoughts quiet. Consider playing subliminal or ambient sounds while meditating. Clearing the mind has helped shifters begin their DR manifestation more easily. [5] X Research source"

There are lots of reasons to try reality shifting, but arguably the most common in recent years has been people’s desire to live in a world they’ve dreamt about. Whether it’s a real city they’ve always wanted to visit but can’t afford like Paris, or the complete fantasy realm of Mordor, the pillow method offers the chance to experience these places in a realistic way.

Chosen realities aren’t impaired by physical distance or death. If there’s somebody you’d like to talk to but can’t get ahold of, shifting is a unique way to gain their insight.

      "content": "Pillow method shifting is different for everybody. Everybody has a somewhat different sensation during and after RS. Some users say it resembles a hypnotic, trance-like state. Others say it’s like a more vivid form of lucid dreaming. Shifting via the pillow method is a unique, entirely individual experience which leaves a different impression on everyone.

Because pillow method shifting is done entirely asleep and does not engage the body, only the brain, there is nothing physically dangerous about reality shifting via the pillow method.
