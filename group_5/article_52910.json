The tip of your index finger will be where you begin combing your bangs. Make sure that your hair is dry. Wet hair can stretch by up to 45%, so it’s much longer when it’s wet. If you cut it while it’s wet, you might cut more than you intend. [1] X Research source"

Though you could pick any angle you’d like, a recommended angle is to cut them on a parallel line to the one that you’ve created when you sectioned off your bangs. Cut them somewhere between the top of your lip (for a longer bang) and the tip of your nose (for a shorter bang). Try to cut them in one or two even snips.

      "content": "Create your part. Make an upside-down V shape, starting about an inch and a half away from your hairline. The “top” of the triangle should be about in the center of your head. A good guide for to locate the outer points is in line with the outer edge of your eyebrows. Any bangs cut outside of that could look too wide. Your hair should be completely dry while you’re cutting your hair. You probably also want to cut your hair when it looks “normal,” or how it looks on a typical day. If your hair is unusually curly or atypically frizzy on the day when you cut it, you might be displeased with how it looks on a normal day."
