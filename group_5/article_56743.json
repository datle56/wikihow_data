      "content": "Love might feel different for your partner than for you. For instance, you might like feeling like the center of attention, while your partner prefers to hang out in the background.

      "content": "This is a words of affirmation approach to love. Try telling your partner exactly why you love them or what you appreciate about them, and don’t be afraid to get specific.

      "title": "Your partner's love language might be gift giving.",
      "content": "Your partner's love language might be gift giving. If they really appreciate it when you bring them home a souvenir or grab them a snack from the grocery store, this is probably the way to go. It’s not about how big or expensive the gift is, it’s about the thought behind it. [5] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019.

      "content": "Some people receive love through physical touch. If that’s your partner, they might like a long hug after a long day or holding hands in public.

      "content": "Acts of service can show your partner you love them. If your partner really likes it when you pick up around the house or do the dishes, their love language is probably acts of service. Try doing more chores after your partner has had a hard day to make them feel loved. [7] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. You might also do things that your partner really hates. For instance, if they can’t stand doing the laundry but you don’t mind it, show your love by taking over that chore."

      "title": "Quality time means a lot to many people.",
      "content": "Quality time means a lot to many people. If quality time is your partner’s love language, make an effort to plan dates and spend time together just the two of you.

Try not to take any negative feedback personally—your partner’s only telling you so that you can both be happier. [10] X Research source You might say something like, “This week I really made an effort to communicate my love with words. How do you feel?”"
