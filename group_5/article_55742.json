      "content": "A curious Virgo asks questions to get to know the real you. In fact, it might feel a little like an interrogation! He’ll ask a lot of carefully-constructed personal questions in a row and analyze your responses and body language because he’s looking for the truth. Those questions could be about your past, relationships, hopes, and dreams, or even about what you’d do in a hypothetical situation. [1] X Research source Give him an honest and thoughtful answer when he asks you questions. Don’t try to give the answer you think he’s looking for or change yourself to please him. Remember: Virgo isn’t looking for perfection here. He just wants an ideal partner for him. Being true to yourself is the best way to show him you’re that ideal partner!"

      "content": "Highly analytical Virgo wants to know you’re a good fit right from the start. Early in the relationship, he’ll start to tell you about his life, values, and expectations in order to study your reactions. From that, he’ll be able to tell how much you have in common. A careful and detail-oriented Virgo cares about compatibility ; he doesn’t want to invest in a relationship with many incompatible aspects. [2] X Research source Don’t sweat too hard about this: Virgo isn’t looking for an exact clone. He just wants to know that the most important things—like your core ideals, for example—complement his."

      "content": "Virgo wants a partner who can set healthy boundaries for themselves. This goes hand-in-hand with good communication skills; if you know how you feel and what you need from him, you should be able to verbalize it. A Virgo man may reflect on your conversations to see if you have ever set boundaries with him. If so, he’ll take it as a positive sign of your emotional maturity. [4] X Research source The answer here is simple: set boundaries with your Virgo and be willing to say “no” when you need to. Respectfully explain to him what you need without letting yourself feel guilty for having boundaries. For example, you can ask for space by saying, “I’d like to be alone right now. Can I call you tomorrow?” Don’t be afraid to say “no,” either. Your comfort matters, and he’ll respect that. He doesn’t want to walk on eggshells with you, so your ability to communicate your needs will make him love you more!"

      "content": "Virgo guys know what they want and prefer commitment to casual dating. If there’s one sign that doesn’t want to waste time once they develop feelings for someone, it’s Virgo.

[7] X Research source Passing this test is pretty simple: if you feel the same and want to be with him, say so! Knowing you’re on the same page will mean a lot to him. If you’re not as committed to the relationship as he is, it’s a good indicator that it might be time to move on anyway."

[8] X Research source Show your Virgo guy just how much you care by opening up to him and telling him about your feelings. For example, “Could we talk? I’ve got something on my mind, and hearing your thoughts always makes me feel better.” One of Virgo’s primary love languages is acts of service. He loves to pitch in and help! He’ll also love it if you do the same for him. Do nice things for him simply because they’ll make his life easier or make him smile."

      "content": "Virgo loves to help others, but he also loves those who help themselves. Your Virgo guy has an independent streak and wants a partner who enjoys having their own life too. For Virgo, the key is a healthy balance: he still wants to feel close and connected to you, but he doesn’t want you to lean on each other for everything. He’ll also examine your behavior to see if you have an independent streak. [9] X Research source Prove to your Virgo that you can be an independent person with your own life. Maintain solo hobbies and interests outside the relationship, and spend some time with your friends. Show him you support his independence, too!

      "content": "Perfectionist Virgo wants to know if you can accept criticism gracefully.

He’ll be watching to see how you handle his criticism and what you do with it. To pass this test, let him give you advice. Consider his words thoughtfully rather than getting defensive and ask yourself how you might use his advice to improve yourself. Remember: Virgos don’t criticize to make you feel bad. They look for weaknesses and critique them because they want to act as a mirror, helping you see those flaws and fix them to become your best self."

      "content": "Virgo is a planner and seeks someone to share their vision for the future. Hardworking and driven, Virgo guys have lofty career goals but tend to be family-oriented. If you ask your Virgo what he sees in his future, odds are he’ll have it planned out already—including what he wants for his career, relationships, and family life. He’ll test you by asking what plans you have for your life as well. For example, you might say, “I’ve got a five-year plan to get promoted to management staff at my company,” or “I plan to be a fully freelance artist by next year.” Talk about personal goals too. For example, “I’ve always wanted to have a family and be a parent,” or “I want to find a long-term partner I can settle down with!” Passing Virgo’s test is all about showing him you’ve carefully considered what you want out of life."
