      "content": "Write down 6 tasks you want to accomplish tomorrow. As you're getting ready to leave work or packing up your books at school, take a few minutes to think about the tasks you need to tackle tomorrow. You might have a lot that you want to accomplish, so simplify your list until you have the 6 most important things you need to get done. [1] X Research source You can jot your list down in a journal, agenda, calendar, or use a productivity app like todoist , asana , or Toodledo . It’s okay to list less than 6 tasks each day, but you don’t want to overwhelm yourself with more than 8. If you’re having trouble streamlining your task list , really think about what you need to get done. If some tasks can be completed later in the week, keep them off your list for tomorrow. For example, the most important tasks at work might be preparing for a meeting, catching up on emails, scheduling a phone call, finalizing a report, drafting a proposal, and updating a budget spreadsheet. It is also helpful to break down really big tasks into smaller bits . If preparing for a meeting is too big to tackle as one task, you might split it into reading over notes, going through the presentation, practicing your part, etc."

      "content": "Order the tasks from most to least important. Your number 1 task is the most urgent and important thing that you need to accomplish tomorrow. Maybe the meeting you have to prepare for is in the morning, so you need to accomplish this task before anything else. Your number 6 task is still important, but might not have as tight of a deadline or be as critical as number 1. So, catching up on emails might be your last task for the day. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Complete the first task before moving on to the second. Start your morning by working on your first task. Don’t work on any other tasks until you’ve completed it. Once you’ve checked it off, move to your second task. Simply continue on down the list as you complete each item. [3] X Research source There are always exceptions to every rule, so sometimes you’ll have to start a task before the one before it is complete. For example, maybe you couldn’t reach the person you had to schedule a call with. It’s okay to leave a message and move on to the next task as you wait for them to call you back. Of course, life and emergencies happen too, which will understandably get you off task. Try to deal with them as quickly as possible. Limit potential distractions by keeping your phone and other electronics out of sight and working in a calm, quiet place where you won’t be interrupted. Keep your list in an area where you can see it every day so you're reminded of what you need to get done."

As the story famously goes, in the 1920s, Charles Schwab, illustrious businessman and president of Bethlehem Steel, asked Lee to help his executives be more productive. Lee presented his method to them in 15 minutes. He only asked that he be paid what Schwab felt was fair after 30 days of seeing how his executives performed. After 30 days, Bethlehem Steel’s productivity soared and Schwab sent Lee a check for $25,000. [11] X Research source $25,000 back then is worth about $400,000 today!"
