Go through your pantry and cupboards and look for any ingredients/foods packaged in paper, cardboard, or another flimsy material. Transfer these foods to sturdy, air-tight containers that mice can’t nibble through. Mice won’t want to hang around a place with no free food."

If your furry friend doesn’t eat all of the food, toss it out or store it in a sturdy, airtight container. Try to get in the habit of immediately transferring your pet’s dry food to a sturdy container. This way, mice can’t gnaw their way through the bag for a free snack."

Trim down any plants so mice aren’t tempted to take shelter there, and remove any weeds or piles of trash that the critters could use as a hiding spot. [12] X Research source If your shrubs and bushes are really close together, consider replanting them a little further apart. This way, mice won’t have a huge shelter at their disposal."

      "content": "Traps are a great final line of defense in case any mice somehow sneak into your home. Pest control experts suggest using electronic or snap traps, which kill the mice almost instantly. There are also humane options, like catch-and-release traps. Set these traps near any potential entry points to catch any wandering mice. Don’t use glue traps to catch mice. These are very inhumane, and can also trap other unsuspecting animals. Steer clear of any rodenticides. These are lethal to all kinds of animals, including family pets."
