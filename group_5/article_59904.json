      "content": "Read the labels on the 4 buttons on your watch. If you can’t look up a manual right now, you can probably figure out how to change the time with some simple guidance and trial and error. The vast majority of digital watches work more or less the same way. There are four buttons on the watch and they are: [1] X Research source Mode: This button typically cycles between a stopwatch mode, alarm, time, and other functionalities. Set or Reset: On some watches this is also the “lap” button if you have a stopwatch function. This button usually confirms settings or resets stopwatches/alarms. Start/Stop: This button starts or stops timekeeping in stopwatch mode. It often switches between values when you’re setting the time, as well. Light: Pressing this will illuminate the screen so that you can more clearly read the time."

      "content": "Press the “Mode” button or hold it down until the time flashes. The minutes or hours of most digital watches blink when you're in the time setting mode. On some watches, you can change the time by getting to the time-change mode. On others, you have to hold the mode button down for 3-5 seconds to get to change the time. [2] X Research source If holding and cycling through the mode button doesn’t work, try pressing down the “Set” button instead. If your watch only has two buttons, one of them typically changes the mode and the other advances settings and moves numbers up or down. Generally, only one unit (minutes, hours, date) will blink at a time. Some watches may indicate option selection differently, like with an underline or box. It’s okay to experiment and push buttons to see how they affect the watch's display. It’s extremely unlikely you’ll get so lost in the menus that you won’t be able to get back to the time."

Continue cycling through the numbers until you’ve got the proper time. Press “Mode” when you’re done to leave the time-setting mode.

Type in your watch’s brand in a search bar followed by any serial number or model number on the back. If there isn’t a serial or model number, describe your watch and sort through photos until you find your watch’s model. Open the manual online and follow the instructions for setting the time. [5] X Research source If a digital manual is impossible to find, call the manufacturer’s customer support number. They’ll be able to help you. Model and brand information are usually written or engraved on the back of the watch or somewhere on the watch face."

Use a pen to poke into the recessed area and change the mode of your watch. If your watch has a recessed button and another button, the recessed one is most likely for switching modes and the other for tweaking settings. Avoid using a pencil to press recessed buttons. If the tip of the pencil breaks off in the hole, it may jam the button, making it impossible to set."
