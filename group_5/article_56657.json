      "content": "You’ll need a place to establish your homestead. Look for a location that you can afford that’s away from major cities that also has access to resources like trees and water so you can use them. Make sure the property has road access so you can get in and out, and read up on local laws regarding living off of the grid. Pay cash for the land or work with a local bank to finance the purchase. [1] X Research source Read up on local property taxes and zoning laws as well. You may have to pay an annual tax for the land. Ask if the property has “legal access,” which means it isn’t surrounded by either private or public land that could prevent you from accessing your own property."

      "content": "Disconnecting your current home usually isn’t an option. This is especially true if you live in a built-up area with numerous public utility connections. Instead, look into alternatives like the following: [2] X Research source Buying a rural home that you can convert to off-grid living. Check property listings online. Contact realtors about homes that pique your interest. Visit a few homes to get an idea of what each one offers and how easy it would be to take it off the grid. Building an off-grid home from scratch. Work with a housing contractor that has lots of experience building tiny homes and other types of off-grid housing. Alternatively, look into building your own off-grid home—but be realistic about the amount of time, energy, effort, and money it’ll take! Building a tiny home. Get in touch with a company that specializes in building tiny homes, which are cheaper than full-size homes but have all of the amenities. Many are also portable so it can be delivered to your property. Living in a camper or RV. Modern RVs have kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms—everything you could need in a home. And you can drive to a new location if you ever want to. Joining an off-grid community. This can be a good choice because it allows you to live off-grid while maintaining connections with other people. There are off-grid communities around the world.

      "content": "Off-grid living requires you to develop home energy independence. In most cases, the best option is to retrofit your existing home (or fit your new home) with solar panels, which will absorb energy from the sun that you can use in your home. Solar panels need to be installed by a professional so, consult a solar power installation company in your area to get the job done right. [4] X Research source Total installation costs of an average solar power system—including solar panels, a battery, a backup generator, and professional installation—averages around $40,000 USD. [5] X Research source Solar power systems can also power a hot water heater so you have a supply of hot water for showers and cleaning."

When you have a stretch of cloudy weather or any kind of mechanical problem with your solar panels, a backup really comes in handy! If you live near a creek, you could get a micro hydropower turbine installed as a backup system. Alternatively, you could get a wind turbine installed near your house. Talk to renewable energy companies in your area about your options. [6] X Research source A domestic wind turbine costs around $10,000 USD. A small micro hydropower turbine can cost around $7,000 USD, while a larger one can cost over $50,000 USD. [7] X Research source"

Depending on where you live and the depth of the water table, it may be possible to dig a well yourself with power equipment or even just shovels. However, while dug-out wells and wells made by driving pipe into the ground can only reach down about 10–50 ft (3.0–15.2 m), professionally-drilled wells can go down 1,000 ft (300 m) or more. The deeper your well, the less likely water contamination becomes. [8] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Drilling a well typically costs around $30-$60 USD per foot, with a typical total cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $7,000 USD. [9] X Research source You can also use drums or barrels to collect rainwater, which can be useful for gardening, toilets, and washing clothes. But you’ll need to filter or purify the water before you drink it."

      "content": "You need a way to safely treat your sewage in order to live off the grid. A septic tank is a watertight chamber that collects sewage in the absence of a sewer system. While solid waste remains inside the tank, liquids exit into a surrounding leaching field. The size of the leaching field means there’s a fairly substantial amount of excavation involved in the installation process. While it’s possible to do the installation yourself in some cases, it’s usually best to have your septic tank system professionally installed. [10] X Research source Solid waste in the septic tank will need to be emptied by a vacuum truck periodically. Having a septic tank system installed generally costs around $5,000 USD.

A greywater system treats water used in dishwashing, sinks, showers, and baths so that it can be used in toilets or for irrigation. While it’s less of a necessity than a septic tank or a well, a greywater system can extend the lifetime of your well by allowing you to use water that has already been pumped up to the surface. Recycled greywater is not safe for drinking, cooking, or cleaning. Installing a greywater system typically costs around $1,000-$4,000 USD. [12] X Research source"

Since you’re producing your own electricity instead of getting it from the grid, it’s important to take steps to ensure you don’t use too much power. Start with the simplest steps, like turning off lights when you’re not using them and unplugging items like TVs that draw power even when they’re turned off. Rely on LED bulbs for lighting and choose the most energy-efficient appliances and household items available.

Your off-grid lifestyle will be more secure if you are able to pay for upgrades, repairs, or other things when you need them. To ensure you’re able to do so, save as much as possible before going off the grid, and continue to save wherever possible after going off the grid. [23] X Research source How much should you save up before getting off the grid? There’s no way to say for certain, but a good general rule is to have at least six months’ worth of your current income saved. Eliminate unnecessary expenses. Even if you’ve started out your off-the-grid lifestyle with a large nest egg, work to buy only what you need and save as much money as possible. Use your hobbies to make money. For instance, if you’re a seasoned cross-stitcher, you might want to sell your creations online or at a local farmer’s market. Turn your knowledge of off-grid living into a financial opportunity. Monetize a blog, produce videos, or write a book about your experiences. You might also host others in a kind of off-grid exchange program. [24] X Research source"

There are countless videos and articles online about how to live off the grid. Renting an isolated cabin provides you with a taste of what you can expect when living off the grid. Spend a week or so in one that most closely approximates the sort of home you plan on living in.
