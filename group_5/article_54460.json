If your iPhone has a home button, press and hold the side button until the power-off slider appears. Drag the slider to the right and let your phone shut off completely, which can take up to 30 seconds. Once the phone is off, press and hold the side button for about three seconds until the Apple logo appears on the screen.

If you're not on Wi-Fi (a wedge-shaped icon with three arcing lines), you will have a cell signal symbol (a series of lines/bars in graduated heights) that displays how much signal you have. You may also see a symbol that says \"5G\" to denote you're on a 5G network. If you don't have many bars in your cell signal symbol or you see the words \"No service\" at the top of your screen, your call is likely failing because your cell reception is poor . You can try joining a Wi-Fi network if one is available, or you may have to move to a spot with better cell reception."

However, if you have Airplane Mode on and are not connected to Wi-Fi, you won't be able to use your phone's network capabilities until it's turned off. You can easily tell if Airplane Mode is on if there's an airplane icon at the top of your screen. To turn off Airplane Mode, pull down from the upper-right corner of your screen to open the Control Center . Tap the Airplane Mode icon (which has a yellow background when active) to turn it off. The cellular mode icon next to the Airplane Mode icon will turn green after switching off Airplane Mode.
