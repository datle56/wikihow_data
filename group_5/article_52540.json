Run cold water over the rice until the draining water doesn't look cloudy anymore. [1] X Research source Rinsing the rice helps prevent it from clumping up as it cooks, keeping it fluffy and airy."

      "content": "Place the rinsed rice into a rice cooker and pour in 3 cups (710 ml) of water. If you'd like to use a different amount of rice, keep the ratio 1 part rice to 1.5 parts of water. For example, if you want to cook just 1 c (196 g) of Arborio rice, use 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of water. Try this method in an instant pot for similar results. Just make sure to use the rice cooking settings on your appliance. To make risotto in a rice cooker, replace the water with chicken broth or stock. Once the machine has finished cooking the rice, stir in 1 c (100 g) of grated parmesan cheese."

      "content": "Close the lid and turn the rice cooker on. Depending on the type of rice cooker or instant pot you have, you may need to select \"Cook,\" \"Rice,\" or just turn the machine on. Most rice cookers turn themselves off once the rice has finished cooking, or they'll switch to a setting that keeps the rice warm until you turn it off. [2] X Research source Arborio rice typically takes 30 minutes to cook in a rice cooker or instant pot."

Once the machine turns off or switches to a \"Keep warm\" setting, open the lid and gently break up the rice with a wooden spoon. Then, put the lid back on and leave the rice to rest for 10 minutes.

Leave the lid off the pot and wait for the broth to bubble. Using hot broth later on will ensure your risotto cooks evenly.

Stir in 1 finely chopped onion , stirring it every few minutes as it cooks. Sauté the onion until it softens and becomes clear. For a more complex flavor, add 2 minced garlic cloves with the onions. Keep an eye on the onion so it doesn’t overcook or become too brown, as this could make the risotto taste bitter."

Slowly add 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio) to the rice and turn the burner up to medium. Stir the mixture constantly to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Let the wine bubble and evaporate as the alcohol cooks off. [6] X Research source"

Choose a ladle or measuring cup that holds between 3 ⁄ 4 and 1 cup (180 and 240 ml) of liquid, and use it to carefully scoop some of the hot chicken broth you prepared before. Pour a ladleful of the broth into the rice and stir consistently. [7] X Research source The rice will gradually absorb the broth and become tender as it cooks."

Fully cooked rice will be tender and not crunchy in the center. If it’s mushy, you’ve overcooked it. [9] X Research source"
