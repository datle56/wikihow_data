      "content": "These are listed below under \"Things You'll Need\". Note that this tutorial uses 3.5\" (8.8cm) squares. However, you can use larger or smaller squares to make different sizes of flowers, depending on the end use you're looking for. The larger size is easier for the beginner to work with and learn from. The breakdown is basically: one petal for each square and a flower can be 5, 6, 7 or 8 petals. So, if you have 1 yard (0.9 m) 44-45\" (91.44cm) fabric and cut to 3\" (7.6cm) squares, you can make 24 flowers."
