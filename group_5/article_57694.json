Use a [1] to check the angle of the club’s sole before you measure the length of the shaft. [2] X Research source You can buy a measuring tool with a metal peg that holds the club’s sole in the proper position while you’re taking your measurement. If you don’t have a protractor, you can eyeball the angle in a pinch as long as you ensure the shaft is straight."

Position the end of the measuring stick or tape measure at the end of the grip at the top of the club. Check the measurement at the heel, which is where the sole of the club and shaft form a corner on the club face.

      "content": "Measure a putter from the top of the grip to the bottom sole of the club. Since the shaft on a putter is usually positioned in the middle of the club face, measuring to the heel will give you an inaccurate measurement. Align your measuring stick or tape on the putter’s shaft so it extends past the end of the club. Find where the bottom of the club intersects the measuring stick or tape to properly measure your putter. [4] X Research source"

Each type of club has a different standard length, where drivers are the longest, followed by low-numbered irons, high-numbered irons, wedges, and finally putters. Any adjustments you need to make are added or subtracted to the standard length of the club.
