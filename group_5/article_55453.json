      "content": "Wipe down the ceiling surfaces above the bed corner with alcohol. Dust or dirt on the ceiling could prevent adhesive hooks from sticking properly. Pour some rubbing alcohol into a paper towel and wipe down the ceiling above each corner of the bed. Don’t use a wood or glass cleaner. These products leave behind residue that make the adhesive strip weaker. Adhesive hooks need an even surface to stick properly. If you have a popcorn ceiling, then this method won't work and you'll probably have to drill into the ceiling."

      "content": "Attach an adhesive strip onto the ceiling over each pencil mark. Adhesive hooks come with sticky strips. Peel the non-stick paper off one side of the strip and press it down onto the pencil mark you made. Hold it down for 30 seconds so it sticks completely. Do the same for all 4 marks. Get a product with a solid hook that doesn't move. Some adhesive hooks have a hinge for more flexibility, but those won't work for this job. Always read and follow the directions that come with the product you use. Different products might have specific directions."

When all the strips are attached, peel the non-stick paper off the other side. Take a hook and press it down onto the strip. Make sure the hook points away from the bed so it holds the string properly. Hold it for 30 seconds. Repeat this process for the other strips, making sure all the hooks face away from the bed. If you’re using heavy curtains, make sure to get adhesive hooks that can handle a lot of weight. The product packaging should state how much weight the hook type is designed for, so use this to guide what kind you buy."

      "content": "Wait 1 hour before hanging anything on the hooks. This gives the hooks enough time to adhere to the ceiling. If you start hanging the curtains too early, the hooks might fall. If you recently painted, wait 7 days after the paint dries to hang adhesive hooks on the ceiling."

Add a few extra inches so you have room to tie the string. Then cut the string off the roll. [4] X Research source It’s okay to have extra string. You can cut off any excess when you’re finished. If you’re hanging a heavy curtain that's more than about 5 lb (2.3 kg), then you might need something more heavy-duty like wire."

      "title": "Loop the string through the curtain if it has a tunnel along the top.",
      "content": "Loop the string through the curtain if it has a tunnel along the top. Some curtains have a tunnel for a rod to go through, but you can also run a string through it. Insert the string into the opening on one side and work it through the tunnel to the other side. Then bunch up the curtain in one spot so it doesn't get in the way while you're hanging the string. [5] X Research source Make sure you do this before hanging the string because you won't be able to mount the curtains if the string is already tied off. If you want a curtain on more than one side, then you'll need multiple curtain sections. Get a curtain section for each area between 2 hooks."

      "title": "Tie the string tightly around the hooks.",
      "content": "Tie the string tightly around the hooks. Lift the string up to the first hook. If you've already attached the curtain, then slide it along the string so it's between the correct 2 hooks. Tuck the string into the hook and pull it tight. Maintain the tension as you pull it to the next hooks. When you reach the first hook again, tie to 2 string ends together. [6] X Research source You might need to use clear tape to lock the string in place if the hooks aren’t tight enough to grasp the string. Working with a partner will make this job easier. One person can hold the string in place while the other loops it through the hooks. If you’re going for more of a canopy look, then you can leave the string loose instead of pulling it tight. This gives your curtains a rounded, crescent shape."

      "content": "Insert hooks into all the spaces on top of the curtains if they don't have a tunnel. If the curtains didn't have a tunnel for the string, you can still hang them with hooks. The curtains should have holes for hooks along their top edges. Insert a hook into each hole. Make sure you don’t miss any holes or the curtains will sag. [7] X Research source If the curtains don’t come with hooks, you can buy a set of hooks online. You can also get clips instead, which means you don’t need holes in the curtains. Using hooks makes sliding the curtains easy, and also makes replacing them very simple."

Slide them back and forth a few times to make sure the hooks hold. If you want to cover your whole bed, put a curtain set on all 4 sides. [8] X Research source You can also only put the curtains in one or two sections if you don’t want to cover your whole bed. This will still give you a nice effect."
