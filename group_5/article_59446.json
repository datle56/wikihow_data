      "title": "Reply with \"one love\" to show you share the same belief.",
      "content": "Reply with \"one love\" to show you share the same belief. Because \"one love\" is an expression of unity, saying it back confirms it, making this the strongest response you could make. You're telling the person that you're on the same wavelength. [3] X Research source If you're seeing the person again soon, you might add \"see you later\" before \"one love.\" You can also address the person as \"brother,\" \"sister,\" or \"friend\" to show unity: \"One love, my brother!\""

      "title": "Say \"peace\" for a response that's similar in spirit.",
      "content": "Say \"peace\" for a response that's similar in spirit. Even though \"one love\" is inclusive, it's a phrase that originated in Rastafarian and Black Jamaican culture. If it doesn't feel natural for you to say it, \"peace\" is a good alternative. The idea of peace is wrapped up in \"one love,\" so it has the same general vibe. Addressing the person as \"brother,\" \"sister,\" or \"friend\" further reinforces the unity of humanity embodied in the phrase \"one love.\""

      "title": "\"Bless up\" is a common Jamaican response to \"one love.\"",
      "content": "\"Bless up\" is a common Jamaican response to \"one love.\" This means the same thing as \"have a nice day\" or \"have a blessed day\" in English. Even though it's technically a patois phrase, it has a broader usage. [4] X Research source You could also use a more American phrase, such as \"bless you,\" which has the same meaning. If the person you're talking to is Rastafari, you might also say \"Jah bless\" (similar to \"God bless\" or \"God bless you\" in English)."

      "title": "Use \"take care\" to show love for the person.",
      "content": "Use \"take care\" to show love for the person. As a response to \"one love,\" the phrase \"take care\" extends and returns that love right back to the person who said it. Just like in English, you're telling the person to look after themselves until you see them again. \"Walk gud\" (\"walk good\") is a Jamaican patois option. It's similar to \"take care,\" but usually means something more like \"stay out of trouble.\" [5] X Research source Personalize the phrase by addressing the person as \"brother\" or \"sister.\" This also carries through the spirit of \"one love.\""

    {
      "title": "Say \"take it easy\" to extend peace and calm to the person.",
      "content": "Say \"take it easy\" to extend peace and calm to the person. \"Take it easy\" falls somewhere along the lines of \"take care\" or even the \"walk gud\" of Jamaican patois. When you respond to \"one love\" with this phrase, you're telling the person to be gentle with themselves and those around them. You can also say \"be easy,\" which means roughly the same thing. This phrase is a little more common than \"take it easy\" with Jamaicans specifically."

    {
      "title": "Use \"stay safe\" if the person is facing some risk.",
      "content": "Use \"stay safe\" if the person is facing some risk. This response is really similar to \"take care,\" but it's typically used if the person is going to be traveling or doing something risky. Instead of just telling them to look after themselves, you're also telling them to guard their safety. Combinations of other phrases convey a similar meaning. For example, if you said, \"Take care of yourself out there,\" your meaning is closer to saying \"stay safe.\""

      "title": "Say \"see you later\" if you have plans with the person.",
      "content": "Say \"see you later\" if you have plans with the person. Usually, you say this when you know for sure you're going to see the person again. But it's fine to say it even if you don't, as long as you figure you're probably going to see the person again at some point soon. You can also simply say \"later,\" typically pronounced more like \"lata\" in this context. If you know you're going to see the person tomorrow and you're comfortable using Jamaican patois with them, you might say, \"Inna di morrows,\" which means, \"See you tomorrow.\" [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Go with \"I'll see you around\" if you bump into each other often. This phrase makes the most sense if you see the person on a pretty regular basisâ€”say, you live in the same neighborhood or go to the same school. Saying it just acknowledges that you'll probably see each other soon even though you don't necessarily have specific plans to do so. In Jamaican patois, you might say \"mi wi si yuh,\" which translates roughly to \"I'll see you around.\" [7] X Research source"
