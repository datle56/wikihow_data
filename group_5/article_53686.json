      "content": "Begin shading. Start opposite the light source and move inwards. The darkest area will be furthest from the light source. Create circles or partial circles of equal value (darkness). The darkest part is not all the way to the edge, but in the middle of the shaded side of the sphere. The sphere is round, and as it turns back towards the light, it picks up some of the reflected light again and gets lighter. Try to make your transitions as smooth as possible. Using the side of the pencil can be an easy way to do it."
