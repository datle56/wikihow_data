      "content": "Send this meticulous man a picture of you at your best . These men are known perfectionists who take their grooming and general appearance seriously, so don’t be afraid to send him a picture of you in your Sunday best. Dress up in a suit and tie or a nice dress you’ve been saving, and send him a picture to remind him you take your appearance seriously too. [1] X Research source Taking care of your appearance doesn’t have to be all glitz and glamour. If you don’t have anything particularly fancy to show off, don’t worry. You can send him pictures of the products you use in your skincare or hair routine. He might even have recommendations for you to try. If you feel like it, go shopping for something new you can wear around him. Pick out a stylish new outfit, do your hair up, and show yourself off. Even something small like a new piece of jewelry can make a statement and show him you put a lot of effort into looking good. Get him involved by sending him pictures of outfit choices or two shirts you’re thinking of buying. He’ll pick what he thinks you’ll look good in, and it’ll make him miss being around someone so attractive."

Don’t be afraid to send messages throughout the day telling him about what’s happening with you. Send him a quote you saw or an interesting fact you learned to satisfy their intellect. [2] X Research source If your relationship is in earlier stages, focus on intellect and logic rather than emotion. Not only are Virgos hesitant to express their own emotions, but they might also be scared off by someone who’s overly emotional or dramatic. Take emotional endeavors more slowly."

[3] X Research source If you want to invite him out, make sure you have a solid and detailed plan. These men are meticulous and organized and would prefer not to leave things to chance.

      "content": "Virgo men enjoy things quieter, so don’t worry if he gets distracted. Their brains are always in problem-solving mode which means they can get caught up in their own worlds. If you find he’s gone a few days without responding to you, it might simply mean he’s busy. [8] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with asking what he’s been up to lately. Virgos are open and honest communicators, so it’s likely he’ll tell you the truth if something’s up. If they’ve been busy with work or trying to help others, they can get caught up trying to make things perfect, so be prepared for quiet patches from time to time."

For example, if he’s trying to earn a promotion at work but doesn’t get it, tell him you can see he’s disappointed and ask him to tell you about it. Or, if he doesn’t want to go into detail, focus on the progress he’s made and tell him how proud you are. Getting excited about his progress with him can make him more likely to open up in the future and be more comfortable overall. Take time to notice if he’s put extra effort into looking nice for a date or interview. Congratulate him when he gets a raise or when he finishes an art project."
