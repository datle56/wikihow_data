      "title": "Choose a suitable object for the project.",
      "content": "Choose a suitable object for the project. Wood objects that work the best for this project include boxes , frames , and wooden letters . Avoid round or beveled shapes, such as balls or candlesticks, as this can cause the paper to crinkle."

    {
      "title": "Sand away any rough patches on your wood piece.",
      "content": "Sand away any rough patches on your wood piece. Most blank wood pieces from the arts and crafts store come pre-sanded, but some may have rough patches. If you need to, sand those rough patches away with a medium to fine-grit sandpaper . Be sure to sand with the grain rather than against it. [1] X Research source If your piece has a very rough grain, you will need to sand it smooth first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe the wood piece down to get rid of the sanding dust.",
      "content": "Wipe the wood piece down to get rid of the sanding dust. A tack cloth works best for this, but you can use a damp cloth as well. You don't have to do this if you skipped the sanding, but it would still be a good idea to do so. Many store-bought items contain a thin layer of dust that may prevent the Mod Podge from sticking.

      "title": "Paint the wood piece a solid color if desired.",
      "content": "Paint the wood piece a solid color if desired. If you will be covering the entire wood piece with paper, you can skip this step. If you will cover just one side, consider painting it first. Be sure to leave the side you'll be covering with paper blank. [3] X Research source Acrylic paint or spray paint works best for this. Use a color that matches the design on your paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the paint to dry if you applied it.",
      "content": "Allow the paint to dry if you applied it. How long this takes depends on the type of paint you used. Most spray paints and acrylic paints only need about 20 minutes to dry. If you need to apply a second coat of paint, let the first one dry before doing so. Allow the second one to dry as well before moving on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick out your scrapbooking paper.",
      "content": "Pick out your scrapbooking paper. Scrapbooking paper works the best for this type of craft because it’s extra versatile. If your wood piece is much larger than the scrapbooking paper, consider using wrapping paper instead. Another alternative is to create your design on the computer and print it out using an inkjet printer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal the paper with clear acrylic sealer, if needed.",
      "content": "Seal the paper with clear acrylic sealer , if needed. If you used regular scrapbooking paper, you can skip this step; however, if you used thin scrapbooking paper or printed out your design on copy paper, you may want to do this to add an extra layer of protection. Follow the steps below: Spray the front of the paper first with a clear acrylic sealer. Let the paper dry completely, then spray the back. The finish of the spray doesn’t necessarily matter, as you’ll be applying Mod Podge over it."

    {
      "title": "Trace your wood piece onto the back of the paper.",
      "content": "Trace your wood piece onto the back of the paper. Flip the paper over so that you can see the back. Set your chosen wood piece on top of it and trace around it with a pencil. Repeat this step for each side of the paper you will be covering. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the traced scrapbooking paper.",
      "content": "Cut the traced scrapbooking paper. Follow your trace lines and trim the paper. Cut the paper just outside the lines you drew to reduce the risk of cutting the paper too small. After all, you can always trim away excess, but you can’t add more. [5] X Research source Try using a ​craft blade for more precise cuts."

      "title": "Pour Mod Podge into a bowl or container, if desired.",
      "content": "Pour Mod Podge into a bowl or container, if desired. Pouring the Mod Podge into some sort of container can make it easier to access and dip a paintbrush into. Plus, it can help keep the Mod Podge container clean. [6] X Research source Bowls, clean and empty yogurt tubs, and plastic food containers work well for this. Pay attention to the type of finish your Mod Podge has before using it. For instance, a gloss Mod Podge will give your project a beautiful shine, while a matte Mod Podge will reduce shine."

    {
      "title": "Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the wood piece.",
      "content": "Apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the wood piece. Use a flat, wide paintbrush , a foam brush , or foam roller to paint a layer of Mod Podge onto the wood. Be sure to cover the entire surface from edge to edge. If your paper is thick and sturdy, it may be a good idea to apply a thin coat to the back of the paper as well. [7] X Research source If you are applying Mod Podge to your paper, work on a larger piece of scrap paper so that you don't get your work surface dirty. If you are covering multiple sides on your object, choose one side to work on first."

      "title": "Place the paper onto the Mod Podged surface and smooth it down.",
      "content": "Place the paper onto the Mod Podged surface and smooth it down. Set the paper lightly onto the surface first. Nudge it into place, if needed, then gently pat it down. Use a spatula or rolling pin to carefully push the excess glue out from under the paper. Work your way from the center of the object outward. [8] X Research source Mod Podge makes special rollers for smoothing down paper. You can typically find it alongside the other Mod Podge supplies in the arts and crafts store. If any Mod Podge leaks out from under the paper, wipe it off with a damp paper towel. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow the paper to dry before adding a second coat.",
      "content": "Allow the paper to dry before adding a second coat. Let the paper dry for 15 to 20 minutes, then apply a second coat of Mod Podge. It is very important that you wait; otherwise, the first layer won't cure properly, and your paper might crack or bubble. [10] X Research source If you have any overhanging edges, trim them off now with a craft blade or sand them off with sandpaper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add some cut-outs, if desired.",
      "content": "Add some cut-outs, if desired. If your paper has a pale, subtle, or simple background, you can make it look more interesting by Mod Podging shapes cut from other scrapbook paper on top. For example: Choose a paper with a large pattern on it, such as birds or flowers. Cut the individual birds or flowers out. Apply Mod Podge to the back of each shape. Smooth the shapes onto your covered wood piece. Overlap shapes for an interesting effect."

      "title": "Apply 2 more coats of Mod Podge, then let it dry completely.",
      "content": "Apply 2 more coats of Mod Podge, then let it dry completely. As before, keep these layers thin. Allow each layer to dry before adding the next one. Once you apply the last layer, allow it to dry completely. [11] X Research source Mod Podge typically has a drying time and a curing time. Refer to the label on your bottle for specific times."

      "title": "Finish the other sides, if needed.",
      "content": "Finish the other sides, if needed. If you are Mod Podging paper to a box, you can apply the paper to the other sides. Use the same method and technique as before, working one side at a time. You can do 2 sides that are opposite each other, as long as they are not touching anything."

    {
      "title": "Embellish the finished piece, if desired.",
      "content": "Embellish the finished piece, if desired. You can leave your Mod Podge piece as-is, or you can embellish it further with buttons , fake flowers , or ribbon . [12] X Research source For something simple, use paper scrapbooking embellishments. Peel the backing off of the foam sticker on the back, then apply it to the piece. Outline larger shapes or edges with glitter glue. If you don't have glitter glue, use regular white glue, then sprinkle extra-fine glitter on top. Apply a light layer of white paint with a dry brush for a vintage look. Thread embroidery floss through the holes on a button, then glue the button to the piece so it looks stitched on. Mix extra-fine glitter into Mod Podge, then apply a final coat for extra sparkle."
