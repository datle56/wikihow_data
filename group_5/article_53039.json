[3] X Expert Source Daniel Lioy-Ryan, PhD Animal Behaviorist Expert Interview. 17 August 2021. You can buy a flea comb at your local pet store. Always comb out your kitten in a warm room so she does not get a chill or develop a cold, which could be fatal to a kitten. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Put warm water in a bowl with a few drops of liquid detergent. Comb the fleas off of your kitten and place the fleas in the water. Swish the water around so the fleas drown. You can also dilute five parts water to one part bath oil and sponge or spray it onto the kitten’s coat. Then, use the flea comb to remove the fleas off her damp coat. Fleas will run from the driest parts of your kitten so they may swarm around her face. Grab them and drop them in a bowl of water so they drown. You can also place the removed fleas on a piece of double sided tape so they cannot move or escape. You can then drown them or crush them. If you have other cats or kittens, including the mother cat, in your home, always treat them for fleas as well. You do not want fleas from another animal to get back onto your kitten."

Always wash your hands well after you have removed all the ticks from your kitten. Apply antiseptic to the tick bites on your kitten to prevent infection. Your kitten may try to chew or itch the bites, so treat them daily with antiseptic so they stay clean. Check your kitten for any signs of a disease or infection and bring your kitten to your vet if she displays any symptoms of infection, such as fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, or stiff limbs."
