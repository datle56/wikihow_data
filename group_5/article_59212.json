      "content": "Eggs all contain two chalazae or ‘eyes. ’ These keep eggs fresh, but they are also what make an egg smell and taste particularly eggy. To get rid of any potential egg smells or tastes when baking a cake, remove the eyes of the egg. [11] X Research source To identify each eye, locate the gooey, white substance near the yolk. If you are unsure how to identify it, look for a white, string or strand-like substance attached to the yolk. Next, scrape it away from the yolk carefully using a fork or a spoon with a sharp edge. You're now on your way to baking a tastier cake!"

      "title": "Some people think that over baked cakes taste more eggy.",
      "content": "Some people think that over baked cakes taste more eggy. This may happen because higher temperatures cause a chemical reaction between the sulfur in the egg whites and the iron in the yolks. [15] X Research source To avoid that, be sure to double-check the temperature on your oven using a thermometer, and set a timer so you don't accidentally bake the cake for too long."

      "content": "Eggs from different farms may taste different. Fixing the flavor of your cake may be as simple as picking up a new carton the next time you're at the store. The supplements used in the chickens' feed can affect the taste of their eggs.

      "content": "Smaller eggs tend to have a richer flavor. Smaller eggs come from younger chickens, which tend to favor a diet that's rich in corn.This gives their eggs a stronger flavor. Normally that's a good thing, but if you need to reduce the egg taste in a cake, switching to a larger egg might help. [17] X Research source Most recipes call for large eggs, so you probably won't need to adjust the number of eggs you use."

      "title": "This may improve the flavor without affecting the recipe.",
      "content": "This may improve the flavor without affecting the recipe. The egg yolks in a cake recipe are important for helping the liquid and fat bind together, so just leaving out some of the eggs can create a cake that's dry and crumbly. [18] X Research source Instead, cut down on the egg flavor by using whole eggs for half the eggs called for in the recipe, but only add the yolks for the other half. [19] X Research source For instance, if your recipe calls for 4 eggs, you'd add 2 whole eggs and 2 that are yolks only. If you're using a recipe that calls for whipped egg whites to be folded into the batter, this won't work—the egg whites are important for creating a light, fluffy texture in that recipe."
