If you love the grain of the wood you’re working with and you want that super natural feeling, water-based stains may be best for you. [1] X Research source This is part of why a lot of people think water-based stains are ideal for cabinets or countertops."

      "content": "Allows air to pass through the pores of the wood If your wood is going to be around a ton of moisture and humidity, water-based stains will likely be better for your wood in the long term. Water-based stains soak deep into the wood instead of sitting on the surface, so air tends to flow in and out of the pores more easily. This can prevent mildew and mold from developing in high-humidity environments. [2] X Research source This doesn’t mean that water-based stains are better in heavy rain or extreme weather, though. Heavy weather will damage water-based stains faster than alternative options. Oil-based stains don’t trap water inside, but they do a better job of keeping it out in the first place. They are more susceptible to regular moisture, though."

If the wood is going to be exposed to a ton of sunlight, water-based stains are going to protect your wood better than in the long run. [3] X Research source This is the main reason water-based stains preserve the look of wood better than other options."

Water-based stains are made with nontoxic ingredients, so you’re doing the planet a favor by going with water-based! [4] X Research source VOCs are found in thousands of paints, cleaning supplies, and building materials, so don’t feel terrible if you end up going with the oil-based stuff.

This doesn’t mean the wood can’t catch fire if you use water-based stain, but a deck may be especially susceptible to fire damage if you go for the oil-based stuff. As a result, you almost certainly want to use a water-based stain if you live in an area prone to wildfires.

      "content": "Easier to apply to the wood Water-based stains dry extremely quickly, and you often can’t soothe out uneven applications with a rag the same way you can rub down oil-based stains. If it’s your first time working with wood stain, you’re probably going to find the oil-based stuff a little more forgiving. This also makes it a great option for larger surface areas. [7] X Research source With that said, water-based stains are a lot easier to clean up if you make a mess since you can just wash it away. The oil-based stuff needs to be carefully soaked up or cleaned with soap. Dry the rags and cloths you use to apply the oil-based stain by spreading them out flat on a rack or on the ground. Then, put them in the trash. [8] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source"

As a result, oil-based stains preserve your wood a lot better in blizzards, heavy rain, and extreme temperatures. [9] X Research source As a note, this can cause oil-stained wood to change color over time. Since the wood isn’t as breathable, it has a lot harder of a time releasing heat and moisture."

If you want to stain your wood and then not think about it for over a year, oil-based stains are likely the better option. [10] X Research source You also don’t need to sand the wood to remove the old stain if you want to reapply it, which you do need to do to reapply water-based options."

Oils sit on top of wood when they dry, so oil-based stains will give your wood a more uniform feel and look. [11] X Research source Water-based stains will lift the grain of the wood. This is likely a drawback unless you really like the look and feel of natural wood."

What they will do is keep the wood safe in whacky weather and extreme temperatures. It’s also a lot easier to reapply over the years. All things considered, oil-based stains are pretty great if you want to keep things simple and be efficient. [13] X Research source If you’re more of a form-over-function kind of person and you really don’t enjoy doing home maintenance, keep things simple and skip the water-based stains."

Your stain isn’t going to stick to the wood uniformly if you skip the sanding—especially if your wood has been previously painted or stained. Use an orbital belt sander and start with 120-grit sandpaper. Then, work your way up to 180-grit for water-based stains and 150-grit for oil based stains. This will give the stain a porous, lifted grain to adhere to. If you don’t sand the wood before staining it, it may come out blotchy or uneven."

Each layer will enrich whatever color or shade you’ve chosen for your wood. Let each layer dry between applications and keep reapplying layers until you achieve the look you want. There are absolutely transparent stains out there. If you don’t want to change the color of your wood, opt for a clear stain and apply 2 layers."

Follow the instructions on the sealant to apply it to the material . [15] X Research source There are also “seal and stain” combos out there do a good job of sealing and staining at the same time.
