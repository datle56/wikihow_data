To get over a relationship and feel a sense of closure, it’s essential that you give yourself the physical and emotional distance to move on. If you are surrounded by sentimental objects that remind you of the past relationship, you should pack them up and place them somewhere hidden or give them back to your ex. Sometimes, ridding your space of reminders of the relationship can make it that much easier to work to a sense of closure. [1] X Research source You may want to integrate the physical reminders of the relationship into a letting go ritual, where you process your emotions by throwing away the objects or leaving them somewhere far from your space. This can act as a symbolic act and help you move forward from the relationship."
