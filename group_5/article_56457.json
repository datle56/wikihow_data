      "content": "Determine whether you feel attracted to people of the opposite gender. Even if you have never had a romantic or sexual relationship with another person, you may have had feelings of sexual or romantic attraction toward other people.

      "content": "Figure out whether you feel comfortable dating someone of the opposite gender. Think about your close relationships with others, whether they are platonic (just friends), romantic, or sexual. Take a moment to ask yourself how you feel about those relationships, without judging or over-analyzing those feelings. Consider which relationships have felt most comfortable (safe, fulfilling, happy) to you. [2] X Research source Do you feel any romantic or sexual attraction toward your close friends of the opposite gender? If so, ask yourself how you would feel about dating any of those people. How do you feel about any romantic and sexual experiences you have had with people of the opposite gender, or with people of the same gender, if you’ve had them? Did you enjoy them and feel fulfilled by them? Make note of which relationships you feel the most positive about, and ask yourself how much the gender of the other person had to do with that feeling."

      "content": "Examine your friendships. Many people are most comfortable being friends with people they aren’t sexually attracted to. For example, gay men tend to make friends with women more easily than heterosexual men do, while straight men might be more comfortable hanging out with other men. [3] X Research source Think about your friendships. Are your relationships with people of the opposite gender often “complicated” by romantic or sexual feelings? Do you feel more comfortable being friends or hanging out casually with people of the same gender as yourself? If so, you may be heterosexual. Having a lot of friends of one gender or the other does not necessarily say anything about your sexuality. Look at your friendships along with other factors, like your romantic history or the types of sexual situations you like to fantasize about."

Think about how you feel when you imagine these situations: [4] X Expert Source Samantha Fox, MS, LMFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 19 January 2021. If you mainly enjoy imagining yourself with people of a different gender from yourself, you may be heterosexual.

[5] X Expert Source Samantha Fox, MS, LMFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 19 January 2021. You may be straight, gay, or somewhere in the middle (bisexual or bicurious). [6] X Research source Some people think of themselves as straight even if they occasionally feel attracted to (or have even had relationships with) people of the same gender, and some people consider themselves gay even if they have felt some attraction to/had relationships with people of another gender. Others are not interested in sexual or romantic relationships at all, with people of any gender. These people may consider themselves asexual or aromantic. [7] X Research source What’s most important is how you think of yourself. [8] X Research source Try writing down, or saying to yourself out loud, “I am heterosexual,” or “I am straight.” How do you feel when you refer to yourself this way? Does it feel comfortable to you?"

Sometimes it can help to talk things over with someone who may be going through the same things and asking the same questions as you.

If you know your friend is comfortable talking about their sexuality, try asking something like, “When did you first figure out that you are straight/gay/bisexual? How did you know?”"
