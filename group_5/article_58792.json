      "content": "Keep a diary to identify what triggers you to look at porn. The first step to change anything is awareness, so you need to be honest with yourself and understand your relationship to the pornography. Try keeping a diary of times when you felt tempted to access porn and any times that you followed through with the urges as well. Record how you were feeling, where you were, what time of day it was, and any other factors that you think may have contributed to your urge to access porn. Make a note of the feelings of shame and guilt that you felt afterwards. Review your diary after 2 weeks to look for patterns. [1] X Research source For example, you might notice that you tend to become aroused and access porn late at night, after watching movies that feature love scenes, or when you’re bored. Knowing these triggers can help you to be more mindful and prevent accessing porn."

      "content": "Make a list of the pros and cons of accessing porn. Writing down all the reasons why you like and dislike using porn may help you to see it as more negative than positive. This may also help you to become more mindful of the habit. List anything that you view as positive about accessing porn under the pros side and everything you see as negative about it under the cons side. [2] X Research source For example, under pros you might list things like “relaxes me,” “takes my mind off being lonely,” and “makes me feel good for a little while.” Under the cons side, you might list things like, “costs me money,” “makes me feel ashamed and dirty,” “displeases my Creator\" and \"will lead me to Hellfire.\" Try keeping the list with you and reading over it often to help remind yourself of the reasons why you want to stop using porn. Try to understand how the Shaytaan (devil) operates, how he takes advantage of human weaknesses and tries to weaken our faith by drawing us towards temptation."

Try saying a prayer every time you get the urge to access porn. Ask Allah to give you the strength to resist your urges and help you to become a good Muslim.

[4] X Research source If you do slip up, it is very important to pray to Allah to acknowledge your sin, promise with sincerity not to repeat it and ask for forgiveness . Remember that Allah loves to forgive those that turn to Him when they fall to temptation, but hates it when we repeat the same sin and may decide that punishment is due."

Being part of a community of people who are all working to overcome their addiction to sex and porn may also help you to feel less alone. [8] X Research source If there are no meetings in your area, consider participating in online meetings or an online forum on overcoming porn addiction. Try to ensure that your advice comes from an Islamic perspective as some non-Muslim therapists may try to encourage you to satisfy your urges in haram (forbidden by Islam) ways. Study the evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah that forbids sexual gratification outside marriage and use the divinely prescribed penalties to motivate yourself to stay away from such sin. Understand that intentionally sinning in this way leads to Hellfire and that only Allah can save you from this fate. Try to be mindful of the rewards that are available in this life and the next to those that are able to control their inner desires and live life in the way that pleases Allah."

Or, you could volunteer at a local homeless shelter or other charity for the less fortunate. [11] X Research source You could also look into a class or study group at your mosque to help you develop your relationship with Allah. Consider volunteering at a madrassa to help young Muslims learn about their religion. Try to develop your daily routine of worship, especially your prayers, so that pleasing Allah becomes the central focus of every day. That way, you will find it much easier to combat temptation and stay away from sin. A great way of becoming more mindful of Allah is by repeating beautiful phrases, such as Alhamdulillah and Allahu Akbar, over and over again as you go about your daily business."
