      "content": "Work on your basic skills to improve your cooking. Every home chef needs to know some basic skills, like how to chop vegetables , zest fruit , brown meat, boil an egg or pasta , and cook rice . Cooking eggs is also a basic skill that comes in handy. These skills will take you far if you spend some time learning them now before tackling more complicated recipes. [1] X Research source Try watching videos to learn basics like chopping or grating. They will often go through the process step-by-step, and you can follow along at home."

      "content": "Learn kitchen safety to protect yourself and others. Kitchen safety is about the obvious dangers, such as cutting yourself with a knife or burning yourself on the stove. However, it's also about the less obvious dangers, such as not cooking foods like raw meat to the proper temperature so it's safe to eat. [2] X Research source Explore videos or cooking tutorials about kitchen safety to help you learn things like avoiding cross-contamination and keeping meat at safe temperatures."

      "title": "Stock your kitchen",
      "content": "Stock your kitchen with basic ingredients. It's hard to improvise and make your own recipes if you don't have ingredients on hand. Of course, you'll usually need to shop for perishables for each recipe, but there's plenty of things you can keep on hand to improvise recipes. [3] X Research source For instance, keep canned goods like tomato paste, tomato sauce, canned tomatoes, coconut milk, and canned beans in your pantry. You can use coconut milk and tomato sauce for a curry or add the beans to a dish for quick and easy protein. In dried foods, keep things like pasta, rice, lentils, barley, and quinoa on hand. These foods can provide a foundation for a dish. It also helps to have flour and cornstarch on hand to thicken foods and make gravies. Stock up your seasonings with spices and herbs like Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, chili powder, cumin, curry powder, dill, and rosemary. Keep proteins in your freezer, such as chicken breasts, ground beef, and pork chops. In the refrigerator, keep ingredients you can add to dishes, such as bouillon paste, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, mustard, and olive oil."

      "content": "Find recipes online and through cooking apps. When you're just starting out, a recipe is a good place to begin. Look for simple recipes that you'd like to try, or even watch videos that go step-by-step through a recipe. It can be a great way to get started cooking when you don't have much experience. Cooking apps put recipes at the tips of your fingers, and you can save your favorite recipes for later."

      "title": "Be creative!",
      "content": "Be creative! It's okay to deviate from the recipe. A recipe is just a guide, and you have to develop the knowledge to know when you need to follow that guide and when not to. For instance, a recipe may call for a casserole to bake for 30 minutes, but if it's not bubbling and brown on top, you may need to bake it another 10 minutes. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Start mixing up recipes with your favorite flavors.",
      "content": "Start mixing up recipes with your favorite flavors. As you start to recognize flavors you like, try playing around with recipes. Don't completely change a recipe. Instead, start with 1 or 2 ingredients, and swap them out for similar ingredients that you like better. [5] X Research source For instance, if a recipe calls for yellow mustard, try swapping in Dijon. If you find you don't care for a particular herb, like oregano, try swapping another one in, like rosemary."

      "title": "Improvise when you don't have an ingredient.",
      "content": "Improvise when you don't have an ingredient. It can be tempting to run to the store when you're out of an ingredient a recipe calls for. Sometimes, that's necessary. Other times, you can find an ingredient in your pantry or refrigerator that will be a perfect substitution. [6] X Research source Think about the nature of the ingredient and what it does for the recipe. For instance, if a recipe calls for lemon juice, it's likely adding sourness and flavor to the dish. You may be able to swap in red wine vinegar, for instance, or balsamic vinegar. It's important to think about the dish. Balsamic vinegar wouldn't work in a dish like chicken piccata, as the heavy flavor would completely change it. You could try it, but you have to keep in mind you're going to end up with a very different dish."

You can look at recipes online to get an idea of what you want to do, but then step away from them and try to figure out a recipe just by yourself. It may not be perfect, but it will be a valuable learning experience for next time. [7] X Research source Try going to the farmer's market and picking up a few fresh ingredients for inspiration. Then, use what you've learned from other recipes to create your own concoction."

Try to salvage it if you can. After all, no one else knows exactly what you're going for, and it may still be delicious. [8] X Research source If you can't salvage it, laugh it off and learn from your mistake! If you want to try a new recipe, practice when you have the time, such as on the weekend. Don't try it out when you're going to be feeding a crowd. [9] X Research source"

Add in a couple of dashes of salt and pepper, and beat the eggs together with a fork. [10] X Research source To beat the eggs, gently break up the yolks with the fork by piercing them. Then, whip the eggs in a circular motion to mix them up. If eggshells drop in the bowl, use another piece of eggshell to fish them out."

A single garlic clove is 1 piece out of the large head of garlic. If you prefer, you can use the garlic that comes chopped in a jar. It will tell you how much to measure out for 1 clove.
