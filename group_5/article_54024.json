      "content": "Level up Drakloak to level 60. You can use Rare Candies, EXP Candies, or battle experience to level up your Drakloak. Once your Drakloak reaches level 60, it will evolve into a Dragapult. If you choose to use battle experience, note that Drakloak (and its evolutions) are part of the slow evolution group, which means they take the longest to evolve as they need more experience points to level up. [3] X Research source The reason for this is that Drakloak's final evolution Dragapult is known as a \"pseudo-legendary\" Pokémon. [4] X Research source Pseudo-legendary Pokémon are more powerful than most other non-legendary Pokémon due to having naturally high base stats, which in turn makes them harder to raise. If you don't feel like leveling up a Drakloak, you can catch Dragapult (in Pokémon Violet only) in 5- and 6-star Tera Raid Battles. [5] X Research source"
