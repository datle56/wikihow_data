      "title": "Locate your home’s circuit breaker.",
      "content": "Locate your home’s circuit breaker. Your home’s circuit breaker, or service panel, is easily identifiable. Look for a gray steel box with a hinged door. It will either be placed directly into your wall or secured to it. They’re typically located in the basement, however, for homes without one, you can find it in your utility room or garage.

      "title": "Unplug electrical appliances and turn off power.",
      "content": "Unplug electrical appliances and turn off power. Before engaging in any electrical work, first unplug any appliances and shut the power off. This is so you don’t accidentally touch exposed wires or other components that can shock or electrocute you. To avoid injury, use extreme caution. [2] X Research source For modern homes, switch the circuit breaker in the main service panel to the “off” position. [3] X Research source Homes built before 1960 will operate on a fuse panel. To cut power off from the entire house or individual circuits, pull the small metal handle connected to the main or individual fuse blocks. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab your safety gear. While you don’t need to dress head-to-toe in protective gear, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. It only takes 500 volts to cause serious damage to your body. [5] X Research source At minimal, put on a pair of electric insulated gloves to keep your fingers safe from unexpected shock or burns."

      "title": "Identify the blown fuse.",
      "content": "Identify the blown fuse. Every circuit breaker panel comes with steel stamped numbers and a paper glued to the back of the panel door. This helps you match individual breakers to specific circuits. For example, if you’ve blown an outlet in the bathroom, you’ll need to find the “Bathroom outlets” breaker. [6] X Research source Once you’ve narrowed down your search, look for a fuse with discoloration, cracks, or scorches."

    {
      "title": "Replace the blown fuse.",
      "content": "Replace the blown fuse. Unscrew the fuse by twisting it out of its socket, touching only its face. You can also use a fuse puller if you’re experiencing difficulty. Remove it completely from its socket, making sure to avoid touching the metal threaded base of the fuse. [7] X Research source Replace the damaged fuse with a replacement fuse of the same amperage. Each fuse or circuit breaker should have its amperage marked on the handle. In the United States, most homes are wired with 15-amp or 20-amp fuses. [8] X Research source On average, an individual fuse can run you between $3 to $15. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Reset your circuit breaker.",
      "content": "Reset your circuit breaker. Flip the breaker you’ve just replaced back to the “on” position. Return to where you originally lost power and turn on a light fixture or appliance to make sure the circuit has power. [10] X Research source If you follow all these steps, your power should be back on track!"

      "title": "Call an electrician if your circuit still trips.",
      "content": "Call an electrician if your circuit still trips. If you find that power is not resuming or the circuit trips shortly after being restored, it’s time for a helping hand. A professional fuse replacement service can run anywhere between $400 to $2,000 in the United States. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn off the engine and disconnect your battery.",
      "content": "Turn off the engine and disconnect your battery. Safety always comes first. To avoid potential mishap or injury, keep your vehicle powered off. Then, raise your vehicle’s hood and locate its battery. If you’re struggling to find it, refer to your owner’s manual for its exact location. To disconnect your car battery, first locate the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals on either side of the battery. In some cases, the terminals may be covered with a plastic cap. Simply remove these with your fingers. [12] X Research source Grab a 10-millimeter open-end wrench or socket wrench to unbolt the battery cables. [13] X Research source Begin by unbolting the negative battery cable. Once it’s loose, you’ll be able to disconnect the cable by lifting it free. Push the cable far out of the way before proceeding to unbolt the positive cable next. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Locate the fuse panel.",
      "content": "Locate the fuse panel. In most vehicles, there will be two fuse panels. One located on the driver’s side of the dashboard, beneath the steering wheel or one under the front hood. [15] X Research source Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to be sure. Once you know where the fuse panel is, remove its cover to find several rows of color-coded fuses. The backside of the cover will show a diagram of which fuse belongs to specific electrical components. For example, one fuse will be assigned to your dashboard lights. [16] X Research source If you do not have an owner’s manual, contact your local dealership or search online for more information."

      "content": "Pinpoint the blown fuse. If you suspect a fuse is blown in your car, it’s likely you’re experiencing a malfunction like your radio or power outlets won’t work. Refer to the backside cover of your fuse panel and look for the correct color-coded or numbered fuse. For example, for a faulty radio you’ll look for the fuse that’s assigned to the radio.

      "title": "Replace the fuse with the same amperage rating.",
      "content": "Replace the fuse with the same amperage rating. Each color-coded fuse has an amperage rating written on it. You must use a replacement fuse that has the same amperage. Otherwise, it’s likely it will blow again. When you have the right fuse, gently push it into the correct slot and put the panel cover back in place. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your car to an auto mechanic if replacing the fuse doesn't fix the issue. Also, see a mechanic if the fuse blows again. Expect to pay anywhere from $88-$111 for a diagnosis. An electrical repair can run anywhere between $1,300-$2,000. However, prices will vary depending on the make, model, and year of your vehicle. [22] X Research source"
