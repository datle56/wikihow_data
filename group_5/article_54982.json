      "content": "Figure out if you have scars or marks. While the term “acne scars” is used to talk about any kind of lingering mark from acne, it actually refers to something specific. Acne scars are permanent indentations in the skin that come from acne for various reasons, whereas marks are non-permanent. You may have a combination of the two. Scars can be hypertrophic , which stick out above the skin, keloid , in which there is an overproduction of skin tissue, or atrophic , which are sunken depressions. There are different forms of each of these. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Scars will require professional treatment from a dermatologist in order to be removed. Non-permanent acne marks are the reddish and brownish marks that can be left over from acne. Dermatologists call them '\"post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation . They typically go away on their own after 3 to 6 months, but the pace of this process can usually be quickened using the methods in this article.

Do not use these for too long or your skin may become permanently discolored. Skin-lightening products can increase your sensitivity to sun damage and cause premature aging. Always wear sunscreen when using these products, even on cloudy days."

      "content": "Try gentle manual exfoliation first. Depending on how your skin is feeling, you may prefer either a manual or chemical exfoliant to remove dead skin cells. A manual exfoliant is a physical scrub. This can be a warm washcloth, baking soda, or any product specifically designed for the purpose of exfoliation, like facial brushes . While manual exfoliation is more natural, be careful about further irritating the skin, as it can be abrasive. Excessive or harsh exfoliation can lead to worse dark spots after acne.

      "content": "Try chemical exfoliants if manual ones don't work. Chemical exfoliants come in several forms. Two common and effective ones are BHAs and retinoids. A BHA exfoliant uses beta hydroxy acid, which contains salicylic acid, to get deep inside your pores, dissolve dirt, and exfoliate the skin. Acne marks will fade faster and you should get fewer breakouts. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Retinoid creams can be used to speed up the skin's natural process of cell division, which pushes out the discolored skin cells. This treatment will increase sensitivity to sunlight, so be sure to apply the cream at night. [11] X Research source"
