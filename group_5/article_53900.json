Send your message with the email account that your school assigned to you—your professor will recognize that you're one of their students. Avoid personal email addresses, especially if they have silly phrases. Not only are they inappropriate, but they might be sent to your professor's spam folder. [1] X Research source If you haven’t been assigned an academic email address, create a Gmail account that separates your first name and your last name with a period: \"john.tran@gmail.com\" \"kate.lopez@gmail.com\" \"charlie.jackson@gmail.com\""

Your professor will be able to look up your scores and your class syllabus. That way, they can make suggestions about make-up assignments or extra credit: [2] X Research source “PSY 103-13401: Inquiry About My Grade” “HIST 176-2458: Concern About My Recent Exam” “ENG 101-1043: Question About My Essay”"

Then, explain the score that you would prefer to have in class. Be direct about the purpose of your message so your professor can strategize about your academic goals: [4] X Research source “I am writing to discuss the possibility of changing my grade in PSY 103 from a ‘C+’ to a ‘B-’.” “I am reaching out to talk about receiving a ‘60%’ on my recent exam and to check in about opportunities to improve my overall grade in class. I am hoping to receive an “B-” by the end of the semester.” “I am sending this message because I submitted my essay after your deadline. Right now, my grade has dropped to a ‘B’.

Your instructor is likely to take this into account and respect your commitment to doing well.

I received positive evaluations from all my teammates as well as full points on all of my reflection papers.” “Prior to this crisis, I had an average of ‘88%’ in your class. All of my scores on your exams were over ‘80%.’ In addition, I took advantage of every opportunity for extra credit. I even received 100/100 points for your optional assignment to perform a short skit.” “Last week, I had an ‘A-’ and turned all of my essays in well before the deadlines outlined on the syllabus.

As a rule of thumb, anything you write should be suitable for a business email. [11] X Research source Instead of starting with your concerns or anxieties about your class, begin with a thoughtful remark like, “I hope this week has treated you well.” Avoid slang, acronyms, emojis, or lots of exclamation marks. Aim for a higher level of vocabulary. For instance, instead of saying, “I want to talk about my grade,” try, “I am reaching out in order to discuss my recent progress in your class.”"

Your professor will likely appreciate all your effort and recognize you’re taking your academic success seriously. [12] X Research source While tools like spell check can help, you shouldn’t rely on them 100%. Use your own best judgment and proofread your message very carefully to pinpoint any errors.

I am reaching out in order to discuss my grade in your class and to see if it’s possible to receive a “B” average by the end of the semester. Currently, I have a score of ‘75%’ in your class, but I’m hoping to earn an ‘80%’. My grade declined after the most recent exam on the French Revolution. A family emergency arose that impacted my study schedule last week. Before this event, I submitted every essay on time and received at least an ‘85%’ on every exam. In the past, I have been very diligent about reviewing all my materials. I was wondering if it would be possible to retake the exam. Alternatively, I can write an essay on the French Revolution in order to show my understanding of the content. I really appreciate the opportunity to learn from you. I am particularly inspired by how civil unrest can lead to significant progress in society. I would value the chance to demonstrate how seriously I take this class. Do you have any time available this week to talk about this matter in person? Best regards, Mary Kline"

I am sending this message to discuss my current grade in your class as well as my overall performance. As of today, I have a ‘65%’ in your class, and I am hoping to receive at least a ‘C+’ by the end of the semester. I want to be transparent and acknowledge that I’ve been struggling in this class. Since this is my first philosophy class, I’m unfamiliar with many of the theories we’ve discussed in class. Due to my lack of background knowledge, I haven’t been able to receive many participation points in our Socratic seminars. Are there any resources you can recommend so I can learn more about the key themes in this course? I am willing to write multiple reflection papers or submit an essay on a philosophical movement, like existentialism, in order to improve my grade. While this subject is new to me, I appreciate the opportunity to discover how important figures reflected on the world around them. I plan to attend tomorrow’s office hours, and I hope we can discuss this matter in further detail. Sincerely, Joshua Woods"
