      "content": "Set healthy boundaries. Think of boundaries as the limits you place around your physical, emotional, and mental health, alleviating the pressure to commit to something (or someone). To help you break free from your people-pleasing tendencies, identify what makes you feel stressed or drained, and then clearly communicate these boundaries to your partner. It can be difficult to state your boundaries at first, and it’s perfectly normal and valid to experience guilt when you decline to help someone. With practice, it becomes easier, but it could be worth seeing a therapist if you’re struggling to move past the first step of saying “No.” You can establish boundaries around your body, time, energy, and personal possessions. Don’t be afraid to set limits specific to your well-being—the more precise your boundaries are, the better. Remember that you don’t need to provide an apology or explanation for saying “No.” Someone who truly cares about you will respect your boundaries, even if they don’t fully understand or agree with them.

Loving self-talk helps you understand that your self-worth isn’t linked to making your partner happy, helping you heal from a codependent relationship. Once you believe that you are worthy of love, you’ll be able to overcome your people-pleasing tendencies and foster a deeper connection with your partner. [1] X Research source Remind yourself of your positive traits daily, and don’t feel weird or awkward hyping yourself up. If you feel attractive in the morning, give yourself a compliment. You may find it helpful to verbally state manifestations. For example, you could say, “I am strong, powerful, and confident” or “I am enough, and I am worthy of love.” If you’re bombarded with doubts, get rid of negative thoughts by writing down your insecurities on a piece of paper. Then, rip up the paper to physically and mentally discard them.

      "content": "Prioritize self-care. Unlike codependent relationships, both partners support each other in healthy relationships. This dynamic isn’t possible unless you take time off for yourself, so it's important to remind yourself that self-care isn’t selfish. By meeting your needs first, you’ll be more present with your partner, making your relationship more balanced in the process. Don’t be afraid to take a break from your partner—let them know you prefer spending time alone during a certain time frame, or dedicate one day out of the week to yourself. If you’re not used to taking time off, schedule it into your calendar. Try to do one thing for yourself every day, even if you don’t have much time. For example, you can try waking up 10-15 minutes earlier to journal, or you can wind down with a relaxing cup of tea. [5] X Research source"

Give yourself the opportunity to explore hobbies and activities that you've never felt free to explore with your partner. Spending some quality time with yourself is an excellent way to better understand your own thoughts and feelings, as well as practice some self-reflection . [6] X Research source Think about all the different activities that caught your eye in the past, like rock climbing, painting classes, or piano lessons. Give yourself permission to embark on a personal quest that doesn't involve your partner whatsoever! Remember that you don’t have to be “good” at an activity to continue doing it—the purpose is to enjoy it. In healthy relationships, both people still maintain their individual interests, needs, and selves. Invest in things you love, and you’ll feel more satisfied—and by doing that, you’ll naturally be mending your codependent relationship, too [7] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Here's a brief rundown of the 4 attachment styles: Secure: You had a secure bond with your parents as a child and feel comfortable forming healthy relationships. Avoidant: Your parents may not have connected and engaged with you a lot, which leads to your current relationship lacking in emotional intimacy. Anxious: Your parents may not have cared for you in a consistent way, which leads to you needing a lot of reassurance in your current relationship. Disorganized: You may have experienced something traumatic in your childhood related to your parents, and you often behave in an unpredictable way in your current relationship.

      "title": "Codependency occurs when you sacrifice your needs for someone else.",
      "content": "Codependency occurs when you sacrifice your needs for someone else. A codependent partner feels that the best way to express love and care is to prioritize their partner before anyone else, including themselves. While this dynamic can feel mutually beneficial at first, a codependent person may develop resentful feelings towards their partner because their own needs aren’t being met. Since both partners aren’t putting in the same amount of effort, the relationship becomes one-sided, and the codependent partner may struggle to set boundaries. Codependency often stems from childhood. If a person's parents weren't emotionally available or didn’t meet their needs growing up, they may develop codependent behavior as a survival skill to receive attention or love. Analyze the costs and benefits of your relationship to determine if it’s the best choice for you and your emotional well-being. While some partners are receptive to new boundaries, others may cross them repeatedly. If so, talk to a close friend or family member to establish an exit plan and leave your partner."
