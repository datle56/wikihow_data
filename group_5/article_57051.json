      "content": "Choose how you want your doll to look. Choose a human or an animal. Start with the fabric color. Any plain fabric will do, but you might want to choose something approximately skin-colored. Decide on the color of the hair and eyes. If you’re making an animal, you should also decide on whisker color. Traditionally, rag dolls were made from scraps of fabric (rags). Try to find enough fabric to recycle from a pillowcase, an old shirt, or clothes that don't fit."
