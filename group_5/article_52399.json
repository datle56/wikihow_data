Make sure it doesn't conflict with the existing DHCP (a separate network management protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to partner devices). For two IP addresses to exist in the same subnet, they must share the same network number. Only the identifier at the end of the address differs. So, 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 would both exist within the same subnet.

From here, simply complete the setup of your new router before continuing. If your initial router/access point is also wireless, use a different SSID for your new router. Be sure to disable DHCP on this new router as well. You only need DHCP enabled on the primary access point. A light should activate on both your access point and router, indicating a connection between the two."
