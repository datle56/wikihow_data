      "content": "Stick to a sulfate-free shampoo that’s extra moisturizing. Since wavy hair tends to be a little more frizzy and dry than straight hair, it’s important to use gentle, hydrating products. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Look for shampoo that says “moisturizing” or “hydrating” on the bottle. It’s up to you how often you wash your hair, but try not to wash it every single day. Using shampoo too often can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it frizzy."

      "content": "Brushing your hair with a hairbrush can lead to extra frizz. If you notice any tangles or knots, grab a wide-toothed comb and start at the ends of your hair.

      "content": "This step hydrates your tresses to minimize frizz. While your hair is still damp, spray a light mist of conditioner all over. This will help fight frizz even after your hair is dry; plus, it will add some extra moisture. Leave-in conditioner is also a good option if you have fine hair since it’s a little bit lighter than its traditional counterpart. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The best leave-in conditioner for wavy hair should be a lightweight formula that creates shine, detangles and smooths cuticles. Leave-in conditioners normally protect hair from heat, as well."

      "content": "Use hair serum every day to fight frizz and add extra moisture. Rub the product between your hands and work on your ends first. Scrunch your hair with your palms, working upward to distribute the product evenly. [7] X Research source Argan oil works great as a hair serum, because it smooths fly-aways, but isn’t too heavy.

      "content": "Give your waves some extra hold so they don’t fall flat. Rub a quarter-sized amount of mousse in between your palms. Gently scrunch it into your hair, starting at the ends and working your way up to the crown. Look for a mousse that contains flexible polymers to give curl memory and definition to your wavy look. [9] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Mousse has come a long way since the 1980s. Instead of creating a stiff, crunchy hold, it now gives soft, touchable control to hair."

      "content": "Use the air-drying technique when you have a few hours to spare. Wrap and twist your hair around your fingers in 1 in (2.5 cm) sections. Scrunch the ends of your waves with your hands to set the curls. Keep the curls in place by wrapping a towel around your hair and leaving it on while it dries. Take the towel off after a few hours to let your hair dry the rest of the way. [10] X Research source Drying your hair in a towel is also called the “plopping” method. It helps keep your waves in place as they dry for bouncier, springier curls. If you’re going to bed, try putting your hair into a braid. Braid wet hair in one big, loose braid. Twist the braid into a bun, and clip your hair a few inches below the crown for some lift. [11] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020."

      "content": "Give your waves extra volume with a diffuser attachment. Tilt your head to the side or upside down and start drying from the ends of your hair, working your way up. Hold the nozzle horizontal to your locks or at a 45-degree angle to your head, and scrunch your waves as you dry. Massage your scalp with the diffuser to add volume at the roots. [12] X Research source You can buy universal diffusers that fit any hair dryer, or you can buy one made specifically for yours. If you finish diffusing and notice any unruly waves or curls, touch them up with a curling iron. If diffusing makes your hair a little too frizzy, try drying your hair until it’s about 50% dry then letting it air dry the rest of the way."
