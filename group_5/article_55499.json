When fully grown it forms rich green, compact heads of fan-shaped leaves. [1] X Research source A mature head of lettuce will be firm to the touch and 6 to 8 inches in diameter. [2] X Research source Buttercrunch lettuce takes a while to run to seed so there is plenty of time after it matures for harvesting. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a sharp knife or pruning shears to harvest the lettuce head. With one hand, lift up the outside leaves of the lettuce and with the other cut the head of the lettuce off at the base of the plant. Make your cut at a point that will keep all the lettuce leaves intact and the roots embedded in the ground. Use a long handled kitchen knife with a thin blade. Do not pull on the lettuce plant or you will disturb the roots."

The whole plant will keep growing and be ready for harvesting again in two to three weeks if you leave an inch above ground. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick lettuce leaves as you need them.",
      "content": "Pick lettuce leaves as you need them. Buttercrunch lettuce is a lettuce that forms a loose head. Its leaves grow from the centre, so picking leaves from the outside of the plant allows these centre leaves to grow larger. Start picking outer leaves on demand when they are 2 to 3 inches long, or wait until they are fully grown and large enough to eat. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your fingers to remove leaves from the head of the lettuce.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to remove leaves from the head of the lettuce. Detach outer lettuce leaves from the base of the Buttercrunch lettuce plant in a pincer movement. Dig in with your thumb and turn your hand to twist the lettuce leaf off. You can continue picking leaves this way until the plant goes to seed and you have to replace it with a new seedling.

      "content": "Trim lettuce leaves off with scissors or gardening shears. Use scissors to cut individual lettuce leaves off close to the base. As long as you don't disturb the crown of the Buttercrunch lettuce, lettuce leaves will keep growing back to be harvested, over and over again. This harvesting technique is commonly known as a ‘cut-and-come-again’ method.

If drying just the leaves, spread them out over a paper towel. Let them air dry or place another towel on top and gently press down to mop up any moisture. Be careful not to bruise any of the leaves.

Clean, properly stored loose lettuce leaves should keep in the fridge for up to 10 days. Heads of lettuce have a longer fridge life and will last up to three weeks."
