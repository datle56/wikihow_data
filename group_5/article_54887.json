      "content": "Give your partner space if they need it. Sometimes, being put in the “dog house” is just your partner’s way of taking some time for themselves. If they don’t want to talk right away, give them time until they feel like they can have a conversation calmly and rationally. They might tell you they need space verbally, or they might walk away from the argument to take a breather. [1] X Research source Needing a break from someone isn’t personal. Some people just need more time to process their feelings. Sometimes, people don’t know how to handle their emotions so they’ll give you the silent treatment. If that happens, feel free to approach them so you can talk about your issues."

      "content": "Reflect on the situation to figure out what went wrong. If you aren’t sure why you’re in the dog house, take a few moments to think about what has happened recently. If you and your partner got in a fight, it’s probably related to the argument. If you realize you forgot an important occasion or you let your partner down, it may be a result of your actions. [2] X Research source Coming up with what you did wrong on your own can make your partner feel understood."

      "title": "Ask your partner what’s wrong if you don’t know.",
      "content": "Ask your partner what’s wrong if you don’t know. If you aren’t sure how you ended up in the dog house, approach the person who’s mad at you and ask what the problem is. Chances are, you might know what you did wrong, so you don’t have to ask if you already know. [3] X Research source Sometimes, asking what you did wrong can make the person angrier. Think about what the problem could be before you ask them what you did to avoid making the problem worse. After reflecting on your mistake, own up and admit what you did wrong. Show them you care by admitting your mistake.

      "content": "Listen to your partner without interrupting them. When your partner talks, let them say everything that they need to say without interjecting. Even if you feel like you want to jump in and make excuses, wait until they’re done to clarify or apologize so they can express themselves. [5] X Research source If you don’t listen to them, you won’t be able to understand exactly why you’re in the dog house."

      "title": "Avoid getting defensive or coming up with excuses.",
      "content": "Avoid getting defensive or coming up with excuses. When you hear your partner talk about why they’re upset, it can be easy to come up with a million reasons why you did what you did. However, this can make your partner feel unheard and could make the situation worse. If you feel yourself getting defensive, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you’re in this together. [6] X Research source Listening to your partner and letting them say what they need to say will resolve the issue much quicker."

      "title": "Validate your partner’s feelings.",
      "content": "Validate your partner’s feelings. After your partner has explained why they are upset, acknowledge that you respect how they’re feeling and that you can understand why they are feeling that way. Doing this will show your partner that you’re mature enough to accept the blame for your part in the argument and that you can put yourself in their shoes. [7] X Research source Say something like, “I can see why that would make you upset. If you did that to me, I’d probably feel the exact same way.”"

[8] X Expert Source Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD Licensed Clinical Psychologist (PSY #31949), Registered Dietitian, & Fitness Expert Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. Try not to make excuses so the person knows that you’re serious, and only apologize if you truly mean it. [9] X Research source Say something like, “I’m sorry that I spoke harshly to you in front of our friends. I can see how it would make you feel bad, and I know it wasn’t the right way to handle the situation.” Reader Poll: We asked 937 wikiHow readers, and 81% of them agreed that the best way to make up with your partner after a disagreement is by saying \"I'm sorry\" and taking responsibility for your actions.

      "content": "Come up with a plan to avoid the problem in the future. Apologies are great, but they’re just words. Talk with your spouse or partner to make a plan on how you can avoid getting into the situation that led to the apology in the first place. Then, you can avoid getting into the dog house in the future. [10] X Research source For example, if you spoke too harshly to your partner in public, you can make a plan to save your disagreements for when you’re alone instead of hashing it out in front of others. Or, if you forgot to make dinner reservations for your anniversary, set a reminder on your phone or calendar so you don’t forget it in the future. Or, if you promised you’d be home on time but you were late, agree to watch the clock while you’re at work and call your partner if you’re running late."

Think about what you and your partner agreed upon and make changes in your daily life to avoid being in the dog house in the future. [12] X Research source For example, if you planned on hashing out your issues alone instead of in public, make sure you work on keeping your arguments to yourself until you get home. Or, if you promised to remember your anniversary plans, make sure you marked your calendar and plan something really special for the next major holiday. Or, if you constantly come home late from work, call your partner so they know that you won’t be home on time."

      "content": "Do chores around the house without expecting a thank you. Clean the kitchen, start some laundry, vacuum the carpet, and mop the floors. Your partner might not thank you for your good deeds, but they will notice and appreciate them. Cleaning is also a great way to relieve stress in a healthy manner."

      "title": "Be comically sweet and apologetic.",
      "content": "Be comically sweet and apologetic. Do things that are shamelessly humble, so the person who's mad at you won't be able to resist laughing. How about serenading them when they come downstairs in the morning? Or writing \"I'm sorry\" with frozen hot dogs across their car dashboard? The fact is, if someone cares for you, they can only stay mad at your for so long, and humor is a great way to disarm them. Make sure you only do this after you’ve apologized sincerely. If you treat every “I’m sorry” like a joke, you could make your partner even angrier."

Think about what your partner likes and what might give them a chuckle to break the ice between you two after you make up. [14] X Research source For example, you could write them a love note with a pun on the front of it. Or, you could tell a story about how you lost your car in the parking lot one time and thought it had gotten stolen."

Think about what your partner likes to do and book some activities that the two of you can do together. Try to do all of the planning yourself so your partner knows you’re making a sweet gesture. [15] X Research source For example, you could plan a hike and then stop at a diner on the way home to grab a bite to eat. Or, you could make dinner reservations and then go see a new movie in theaters."
