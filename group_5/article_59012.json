      "content": "Table top stretches help stretch your wrists and forearms. Find a short, flat table or other surface that you can comfortably stand over. Place both hands down, with your palms touching the flat surface. Lean forward a little bit, creating a nice stretch along your wrists or inner forearms. Then, shift your weight to the left and right to make the stretch extra dynamic.
