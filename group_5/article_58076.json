      "title": "Dividers will help you categorize your notes and materials.",
      "content": "Dividers will help you categorize your notes and materials. Preferably with pockets, so you don't need folders. They're not expensive, depending on how many you buy. They usually come in packs of 5 and 8. Get dividers with pockets. Select plastic or laminated paper dividers as plain paper ones may get ripped or crinkled more easily."

      "title": "Clearly label each divider with whatever subject/class you want.",
      "content": "Clearly label each divider with whatever subject/class you want. [1] X Research source It's helpful to have the dividers in order of your classes. i.e. If math is your first class, then your first divider would be math. Label the spine of the binder too, so you can see what class or subject the binder is for when you stack it in your locker or on a bookshelf."
    },
    {
      "title": "Order your binder by classes, by color, etc.",
      "content": "Order your binder by classes, by color, etc. If you keep your binder in order either by color or by classes or any other method, you will have no trouble whatsoever during the school year. It'll be so much easier to find your papers!"

      "title": "This will help you stay organized.",
      "content": "This will help you stay organized. Have dividers and binders for each subject. Organize your work and notes into categories such as notes, grades, homework, assignments. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You'll want lined paper to be easily accessible.",
      "content": "You'll want lined paper to be easily accessible. Your pencil bag, and your planner/agenda at the front of your binder, because these are important materials that you use most often. Keep your schedule in a page protector at the front, or slip it in the clear front of your binder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have something to take notes on/in.",
      "content": "Have something to take notes on/in. Notes are an important part of getting into higher grades. The older you get, the more notes you'll take, so have a spiral or some paper to take notes. (If your school doesn't allow spirals, because some don't, get a composition book and put it in the pocket of that subject's divider."
    },
    {
      "title": "Color coding can make it easier to keep track of things.",
      "content": "Color coding can make it easier to keep track of things. For example: let's say science is blue. You'd get a blue half-inch binder, blue dividers (if you can, because most dividers come multicolored), a blue folder, blue highlighter- whatever else you need for science would be blue. Everything. So if you're trying to pack for science, in your locker you'd see a blue binder and folder- you'd know immediately that's science."

    {
      "title": "Keep a well-stocked binder, and you'll always be on your game.",
      "content": "Keep a well-stocked binder, and you'll always be on your game. For some subjects, you need specific things and it is easier to keep that object in your binder. Another thing which is really useful is an insertable binder hole punch which will ensure you place all your papers in WHEN you get them. If you don't do this then your binder won't be as organised."
