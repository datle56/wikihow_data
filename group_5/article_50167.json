      "content": "Girls are often very insecure and don't want to come on too strong. So, you should make the first move. One thing that may be going through a girl's mind is, \"What if he doesn't like me back? If he likes me, he can get off his shy butt and come over here and tell me!\" If you don't feel comfortable making the first move, take a step back from the situation and reflect on why you feel that way. What can you work on within yourself that can make you feel confident enough to make the first move?"

    {
      "title": "Move on if you ask a girl for her number and she rejects you.",
      "content": "Move on if you ask a girl for her number and she rejects you. She's obviously not interested. Rejection is a fact of lifeâ€”the key is understanding that it's not the end of the world."

      "title": "It is all too easy to give a girl the wrong impression about how you feel.",
      "content": "It is all too easy to give a girl the wrong impression about how you feel. If, however, she does give you her number, try to only use it to arrange dates. For example, constantly texting her will probably give her the idea that you are in love with her, and set very high expectations for your relationship."

    {
      "title": "Don't lead a girl on if you are going to change your mind.",
      "content": "Don't lead a girl on if you are going to change your mind. Of course, you should not go out with her after the first date if there is no connection. If you feel there is no connection, say so early on and don't leave her hanging, this will result in resentment from her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let her know you are interested but don't be too eager.",
      "content": "Let her know you are interested but don't be too eager. See how she reacts when you start the conversation, and go from there."

      "title": "Girls are much more likely to fall for you if you be yourself.",
      "content": "Girls are much more likely to fall for you if you be yourself. They're not as likely to fall for the person you're pretending to be."

    {
      "title": "Don't behave strangely towards her around your friends.",
      "content": "Don't behave strangely towards her around your friends. Many boys think that their friends will tease them if they are all \"loved up\" with their girlfriend. To make it easier, see your friends separately from your girlfriend. If you are together though, be yourself with your friends but make sure you don't leave your girlfriend out."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that she likes you back first.",
      "content": "Make sure that she likes you back first. Then hint, touch her arm and look into her eyes, or look at her lips then at her. It is a good idea to make some contact before the kiss, so holding her hand or tucking her hair behind her ear is a good start. Lean in - but slowly so that if she doesn't look up for it you can just touch her arm and say something instead. If she leans toward you as well then good! Move your head slightly to one side first and she will follow. If she pulls away before you expected, don't be awkward, just act like you wanted it to end then as well. Don't pressure her into anything."

      "content": "Make it clear if a girl is hitting on you and you aren't interested. Sure, she might get upset, but that is better than going along with it and breaking up with her later."
