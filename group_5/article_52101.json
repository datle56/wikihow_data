      "content": "Soak the plastic in vinegar and water. To remove light tomato stains, pour 1 cup (237 ml) of hot water and 1 tbsp (15 ml) of white vinegar into your plastic container. Then, let the container soak for 12 to 24 hours. Simply rinse and wash the container with dish soap to remove the stains and vinegary smell. [2] X Research source Soak plastic spatulas and other plastic kitchen items in a mixture of 1 part white vinegar and 1 part water. Vinegar is acidic, which helps it break down and dissolve stains. [3] X Research source This method also works well for other colored food stains on plastic containers."

      "content": "Leave the plastic in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can bleach and remove stubborn tomato stains on plastic containers and other items. Simply place the plastic in a spot where it gets bright, intense light. Then, leave it there for several hours. [4] X Research source Repeat this method over several days until the stain is gone. This method works best in the summer when the sun’s rays are more intense."

      "title": "Rub the plastic with baking soda and water to remove stains and odors.",
      "content": "Rub the plastic with baking soda and water to remove stains and odors. Add 1 to 2 tbsp (17-34 g) of baking soda to your plastic container. Then, mix in enough water to form a thick paste and rub it into the stain. Let the baking soda sit for 30 minutes before rinsing and washing the plastic. [5] X Research source Stocker says to “press hard so that you get the paste inside the little ‘pores’ of the plastic.” [6] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Baking soda is mildly abrasive and a natural deodorizer, making it perfect for cleaning lingering tomato stains. [7] X Research source If the stain is especially old or pungent, leave the baking soda paste on the plastic for 1 day or longer. The longer the baking soda sits, the more efficient the stain removal will be."

      "content": "Rub the plastic with a lemon to spot clean stains. Cut a fresh lemon in half widthwise. Then, grab one of the halves and rub the cut side into the tomato-stained areas. Squeeze the lemon gently as you scrub to release more juice. Then, place the plastic in direct sunlight to dry and remove the stains. [8] X Research source Wear rubber gloves if you don’t want your fingers to smell like lemon or you have any cuts on your hands, as the lemon juice can sting. Rubbing plastic with lemon can help remove oily tomato residue as well, as lemon juice is good at fighting grease."

      "title": "Scrub tougher tomato stains with vinegar and baking soda.",
      "content": "Scrub tougher tomato stains with vinegar and baking soda. Put on some rubber gloves and pour 1 to 2 tsp (4-8 g) of baking soda over the stained plastic. Then, pour 0.5 to 1 cup (120-240 mL) of white vinegar on top of the baking soda; the mixture will foam up and expand. Simply scrub the container with a stiff-bristled brush or sponge until the stain disappears. [9] X Research source Rinse and wash the plastic off once you’re done scrubbing. Baking soda and vinegar create a lot of bubbles and fizz when combined, so clean the plastic in your sink to avoid making a mess."

Then, fill the glass or bowl with hydrogen peroxide until the plastic is completely submerged. Let the plastic soak for 6 to 24 hours, depending on how tough the stain is. Then, rinse and wash the plastic item with dish soap at least 2 to 3 times. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the plastic in a bleach and water mixture. If the stains still aren’t coming out, Stocker recommends filling the plastic container with ½ non-chlorine bleach and ½ water. Let the container sit for 1 day and rinse it out. Then, leave it in the sun for 2 days. Stocker says this helps “with the smell of the bleach and also help[s] the sun remove some of the stains.” [13] X Expert Source Susan Stocker House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 8 November 2019.

      "content": "Pour ⅕ cup (40 g) of sugar into the plastic container. If you’re using this method on a plastic item that isn’t a container, place your item inside a clean plastic container. If you’re cleaning a container, pour the sugar directly into the center. The sugar helps soak up the grease and oily tomato residue. [15] X Research source The measurements given in this method are designed for a standard 5 by 5 in (13 by 13 cm) food storage container. If your item is really big, double or triple each of the ingredients listed in this method. Use regular granulated sugar. Do not use brown or confectioner sugar."

      "title": "Add 6 ice cubes into the container and fill it with cold water.",
      "content": "Add 6 ice cubes into the container and fill it with cold water. The ice cubes help separate the tomato and oil, which makes it easier for the sugar to soak the oil up. Simply pour cool water into the container until the stains are covered. [17] X Research source If you only have access to crushed ice or your ice cubes are really small, simply pour a handful in instead. Watch as the water, ice, soap, and sugar begin to bubble up. This is a sign that the process is working."

So, put tomato-based foods into a glass or ceramic dish before heating them up. [20] X Research source Use metal utensils instead of plastic ones when mixing hot, tomato-based foods to help prevent stains, too. Avoid storing hot tomato-based foods and sauces in plastic containers to also prevent stains. Wait for the sauce to cool down before pouring it into a container."

      "content": "Tomatoes contain a staining pigment called lycopene. Tomatoes get their bright red color from the pigment lycopene. Like plastic, lycopene is hydrophobic, meaning it repels water. When these 2 substances meet, they cling together to avoid water, which results in stains. [22] X Research source Lycopene is found in a variety of other fruits, like papayas, pink grapefruit, red cabbage, and beets. So, use the same cleaning methods above to get rid of stains!"
