      "content": "848 is one of the most powerful numbers for manifestation. The numbers 4 and 8 are widely considered the primary manifestation numbers. When paired together in a single angel number, they provide an invaluable opportunity to manifest almost anything—whether you’re manifesting love , manifesting money , or personal fulfillment, it’s yours to take. First, though, you need to let go of what no longer serves you to make room for what you want to manifest. For example, if you’re manifesting personal fulfillment, you may need to let go of things that don’t fulfill you—scrolling social media, needless purchases, or other bad habits."
