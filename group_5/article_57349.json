      "content": "Take a softwood cutting of your chosen cultivar of maple in early summer. Maple trees are easy to grow from cuttings. Select a maple tree branch that is appealing in shape. The size of the branch can be up to the diameter of your little finger. [2] X Research source There are many possible cultivars of Japanese maple. Select according to what you're wanting––some will grow larger than others, some have rough bark and some require grafting. It's a good idea to take several cuttings; that way, you will be assured that one will take well (sometimes the roots are weak, rot or simply don't form). Note that red-leafed cultivars of the Japanese maple tend to have weak root systems and are usually grafted onto other rootstocks. Unless you know how to graft or have someone knowledgeable to help you, it might be a good idea to avoid the red-leafed cultivars until you are more experienced."

Keep the moss wet. After several weeks, you should see roots through the plastic. Alternatively, stick the branches into a gritty compost of good quality. Keep this compost medium moist. Expect roots to form within 2 to 3 weeks if the stock taken is healthy and the conditions are warm and moist."

[7] X Research source Partially fill the container with good quality topsoil (a good mix consists of about 80 percent bark and 20 percent peat, as this tends to promote fine fibrous feeder roots and gives good drainage.

The addition of sphagnum moss is helpful in hard water areas. [9] X Research source Colin Lewis, <i>Bonsai Basics</i>, p. 73, (1997)"

      "content": "Enjoy your new tree! Find a suitable outdoor area to keep your bonsai, such as a porch, garden bed area or patio. Bonsai are not meant to be indoor plants; [8] X Research source Peter McMahon, <i>Return to Lilliput</i>, in <i>Growing Today</i>, pp. 30-34, (January 1995) if brought indoors, only keep them inside for a one to two days before returning them outdoors again; only bring them in when in leaf, or only for an hour during winter. [9] X Research source Colin Lewis, <i>Bonsai Basics</i>, p. 73, (1997) Keep the bonsai maple tree sheltered for the first few years. Don't leave it outside where frost can get to it for the first 2 to 3 years, as this can kill it. Avoid placing the plant anywhere windy and do not let it sit in direct sunlight for the whole day. [11] X Research source Feed a balanced feed after the buds form until late summer. During winter, feed with a low- or zero-nitrogen feed. [9] X Research source Colin Lewis, <i>Bonsai Basics</i>, p. 73, (1997) Never let a bonsai tree dry out. [12] X Research source It needs to be kept slightly moist at all times. [8] X Research source Peter McMahon, <i>Return to Lilliput</i>, in <i>Growing Today</i>, pp. 30-34, (January 1995) Wherever possible, use rainwater rather than tap water; it's healthier for the tree. Regular spraying with water is helpful for healthy growth. Learn to \"style\" the tree as it gets established. This is where you learn to reproduce what nature normally does, to give the tree the look of a real tree. [8] X Research source Peter McMahon, <i>Return to Lilliput</i>, in <i>Growing Today</i>, pp. 30-34, (January 1995) It consists of careful pruning and wiring. Getting this aspect right can take a lot of practice but that's all part of the fun of growing your own bonsai."
