      "content": "Aluminum cookware isn’t toxic, but some experts advise not to use it. The aluminum you might consume from cookware is typically a small amount that’s safe for most people and quickly leaves the body through your urine. [1] X Research source However, the long-term health effects of consuming aluminum aren’t entirely known and some experts recommend minimizing your daily intake as much as possible. [2] X Research source The average adult in the U.S. eats about 7 to 9 mg of aluminum per day from other sources like processed food, drinking water, and medicinal products like antacids and aspirin. [3] X Research source Aluminum pots and pans only make up 1 to 2 mg of that total. [4] X Research source"

Aluminum is typically filtered out of your body through your kidneys, so those with weakened kidney function may not be able to filter out the metal fast enough.

      "content": "Aluminum cookware may tarnish or cause acidic foods to taste metallic. Aluminum pots and pans can tarnish, dent, or warp easily. Because of leached aluminum, cooking with uncoated aluminum cookware may also add a subtle metallic taste to highly acidic food like tomatoes. [15] X Research source Aluminum also heats up quickly and can superheat in areas that are in direct contact with the burner. This may cause your food to cook unevenly. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Aluminum cookware is lightweight and versatile. Aluminum cookware is easy to carry and handle, which can make it perfect for everyday use. It’s also usable for a variety of cooking methods, from frying to boiling and baking, and can be used on stovetops, in ovens, and on grills. Aluminum might not be as durable as a material like cast iron, however, many pots and pans are coated with nonstick or anodized surfaces to make them last longer and prevent corrosion."

      "content": "Aluminum pots and pans can be more affordable than other materials. This is mostly because aluminum is an abundant metal that can be cheap to commercially extract from ores. [20] X Research source Aluminum is also recyclable and highly sustainable when reused. [21] X Research source On the flip side, a more expensive high-quality cookware might be a more long-term investment since you may not need to replace it as often."

      "content": "Aluminum cookware may heat up faster than other metals. Aluminum heats faster than cast iron or stainless steel, and can evenly distribute heat. [22] X Research source Stainless steel, in particular, is a poor heat conductor, which is why there’s usually an aluminum layer in stainless steel pans. [23] X Research source High-end pans are made with a copper core instead of an aluminum one because copper is an even better heat conductor than aluminum. [24] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid cooking acidic foods, like tomatoes, in uncoated aluminum pans.",
      "content": "Avoid cooking acidic foods, like tomatoes, in uncoated aluminum pans. Aluminum may be highly reactive with acidic foods like tomatoes, vinegar, alcohol, and citrus juice, causing aluminum to leach into the food. Leafy vegetables might also absorb more aluminum than other foods. [25] X Research source Simmering tomato sauce in an aluminum pot might leach the most aluminum because it’s acidic, salty, liquidy, and spends a long time in the vessel. In comparison, cookies on an aluminum sheet extract less aluminum because they’re drier, less acidic, less salty, make less physical contact with the metal, and spend less time cooking. If you do use uncoated aluminum cookware, look for high-quality brands that source their material from pure aluminum to reduce your intake of potentially dangerous metals."

Try to avoid cooking in scratched aluminum cookware and dispose of them when you notice scratches. [28] X Research source To prevent scratching, use wooden or silicone utensils instead of metal ones. Use a gentle brush and warm water to clean your pans, not steel wool. Try to avoid washing with hot water, which can cause oxidation on aluminum pans."

[29] X Research source However, it may contain other metals that are prone to corrosion. Make sure your aluminum cookware is completely dried off before putting it away to prevent rust. Aluminum cookware is generally not safe to put in the dishwasher or soak in soapy water for long periods because the high temperature can cause it to fade and oxidize quickly. [30] X Research source Try to avoid stacking nonstick aluminum pans—they may scratch each other. If you need to stack them, put a pot holder, dish towel, or paper towel between the pans to protect them. [31] X Research source"

      "title": "Anodized aluminum cookware",
      "content": "Anodized aluminum cookware Anodizing means oxidizing the outer layer of the aluminum, which can make your cookware tougher, more resistant to scratching, and more nonstick than bare aluminum. [32] X Research source This also may make the aluminum less likely to react with acidic foods, preventing the metal from leaching into your dinner. This means anodized aluminum cookware has a layer of aluminum oxide on the surface of the metal, which can make the material more durable and rust-resistant. The downside: At super high heat levels, the anodized surface can break down. It also doesn’t have as long of a lifespan as stainless steel or cast iron cookware. [33] X Research source When you buy a new pot or pan, look for ones marked “PTFE-” and “PFOA-free.” These chemicals have been linked to health risks and may stay in your body for months to years.

      "content": "Aluminum cookware with a nonstick or ceramic coating Nonstick surfaces have a PTFE (Teflon) layer that can create a layer between the metal and your food. However, because of health concerns, ceramic-coated cookware may be a better option. Ceramic cookware is naturally stick-resistant and can handle higher temperatures than other nonstick pans. [38] X Research source PFOA, a chemical used in the manufacturing of nonstick cookware like Teflon (PTFE), has been associated with cancer and developmental problems. However, it hasn’t been made in the U.S. since 2015.

[40] X Research source They’re usually lighter than cast iron, but they usually can be seasoned in the same way. To season cast aluminum, heat the pan to a high temperature, then add vegetable oil. Wait until it smokes, then remove it from heat and rub the oil with a paper towel. The downside: Like regular aluminum cookware, cast aluminum can warp in high heat and may scratch more easily than cast iron or other materials. [41] X Research source"

Copper cookware warms up quickly, spreads heat evenly, cools faster than cast iron, and helps with cooking delicate foods like savory sauces and caramel. [42] X Research source Copper is also naturally antimicrobial, which means germs and bacteria don’t survive on the surface. The downside: It’s reactive with acidic foods and can leave dishes with a slightly metallic taste. Copper also requires regular polishing and maintenance. [43] X Research source To make the copper less reactive, look for cookware with a stainless steel or tin lining."
