      "title": "Acoustic panels",
      "content": "Acoustic panels reduce sound energy by absorbing sound waves. If you have a large, empty space that’s echoey or extremely loud, try hanging acoustic panels on the walls to get rid of some unwanted noise. These panels are extremely light and can be hung on walls, ceilings, and floors. Use them to block sound from entering and escaping a room. [1] X Research source Look for acoustic panels that match the color scheme and overall vibe of your space. For instance, if you have modern decor, opt for canvas-style panels in white and black that can be hung in a geometric design."

      "title": "Hanging drapes",
      "content": "Hanging drapes over windows can help block out street noise. Heavy curtains or drapes can reduce the noise that comes in from outside and make your room quieter. The textiles absorb sound waves coming into the room, helping cancel some of the noise you hear. [2] X Research source Make sure you mount the curtain rods so they’re secure and can hold up the weight of the heavy drapes. Choose curtains that add to the look of the room and are also “soundproofing.” For instance, choose curtains with colors or designs that match the colors of your room."

      "title": "Thick rugs",
      "content": "Thick rugs can help soften and absorb noise in a large or small space. Whether you have hardwood floors or carpeting, putting down some thick throw rugs can help muffle extra noise. Place the rugs throughout the room to absorb as much sound as possible. [3] X Research source The thicker the rug, the more sound it’ll absorb. Choose a rug that complements the room and adds to the decor. For example, if you have a pink bedspread, try picking a pink rug to match it."

      "title": "The more layers of textiles you add, the more sound you can absorb.",
      "content": "The more layers of textiles you add, the more sound you can absorb. So, place throw pillows in the room to add extra layers of textiles. Put the decorative throw pillows on your couches, chairs, and anywhere else that looks nice. [4] X Research source Choose throw pillows that add to the design and style of the room. Match color schemes or choose a theme to follow to help guide your decision."

      "title": "Acoustic caulk",
      "content": "Acoustic caulk can prevent extra sound from getting in and out. If there are gaps and crevices around your door frames, windows, vents, or electrical outlets, try sealing them with acoustic caulk instead of regular caulk. This specific soundproofing caulk is made of latex, making it extremely flexible. Unlike regular caulk, it won’t crack overtime and will help keep noise out longer. [5] X Research source Use a thermal camera to see where air (and sound) is traveling in and out of the room so you know where to place the caulk."

      "title": "The gap beneath your door can let in lots of noise from outside.",
      "content": "The gap beneath your door can let in lots of noise from outside. Plug the gap by adding a rubber door sweep . This seals the door and blocks sound waves from entering the room. [6] X Research source Use a drill or screwdriver to screw the door sweep to the bottom of your door. Check the packaging on your chosen door sweep for specific installation instructions. For a quick fix, roll up a heavy towel or blanket and shove it into the door's gap. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Large pieces of furniture can help block and absorb sound waves.",
      "content": "Large pieces of furniture can help block and absorb sound waves. If you share a wall with a loud neighbor or have a lot of ambient noise coming in from outside, line couches, chairs, and bookcases against the wall. The fabric and material of the furniture can help absorb sound waves coming in to reduce the noise. [8] X Research source For example, if you have a lot of noise coming in from the street, place your furniture against the wall facing the street."

      "title": "Textiles like quilts and tapestries absorb sound.",
      "content": "Textiles like quilts and tapestries absorb sound. So, hang a tapestry or another large textile piece on the wall or ceiling can help to keep your room quiet. Plus, it can add a cozy aesthetic to your space. Find your wall studs and mount brackets or nail the tapestry up on the wall. [9] X Research source Use the tapestry to add to the look of the room by hanging it so the center is at eye level. General contractor Andrew Peters recommends using a stud finder to easily locate studs in your walls.

      "content": "Empty wooden chairs can deflect sound waves and keep them in a room. To avoid this, add decorative seat and back cushions to the chair to help absorb sound and make the room quieter. Without seat cushions, unwanted sound waves can easily bounce around and remain trapped in your space. [11] X Research source If your wooden chairs already have cushions but they’re damaged or old, you can reupholster them to improve their sound-absorbing abilities and update their design!"

      "title": "The stems, leaves, and branches of plants can absorb sound.",
      "content": "The stems, leaves, and branches of plants can absorb sound. Not only can plants help reduce the level of noise in space and alter a room’s acoustics, but they’re also beautiful to look at. Remember, the more objects in a space, the less sound waves can travel. [12] X Research source Choose low-maintenance houseplants (like snake plants, pothos, and aloe vera) if you’re just learning how to care for houseplants."
