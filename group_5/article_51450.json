If you leave it on and your WiFi goes out during your call, you could wind up having to pay international rates."

[3] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source There are many VoIP programs and applications but not all work in China, so it would be prudent to check an updated list of China's banned websites and applications before trying to download a specific app. Additionally, some VoIP applications only allow you to make calls to people who have the same application, while others allow you to call landlines or cell phone numbers. WeChat and Skype are the most popular VoIP applications that currently work in China. They each have different features and fees associated, so it is best to have some sense of your needs when researching these options. You can also get a VoIP phone that operates using an IP Network. These phones are also known as IP phones, and they include features that differ from traditional phones. Because they send and receive calls over IP Networks, they also have different operating requirements from traditional phones. [4] X Research source"
