      "content": "Dress simply. A pair of jeans, a sexy t-shirt, and a sexy pair of heels will do. The point is not to let your wardrobe take attention away from your beautiful face or body. You don't want to look overdone. Heels, as opposed to flats, will not only enhance your height, but they will improve your walk and add style to your simple wardrobe."

      "content": "Wear very little make-up. Try to avoid wearing foundation at all, if possible. This will keep your skin clean and healthy. If you have acne, see a dermatologist right away. Realistically, acne may take months or even years to clear up, and at this age, you have very little time to waste on experimenting blindly with products. [1] X Research source Also, consider switching to mineral make-up. It is much lighter than heavy foundations, it does not clog pores, and can help oily complexions. Avoid drugstore brands, unless that is financially your only option. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not hide or distort your features with heavy eye make-up or blush. If you do not know how to do the natural look, see a professional make-up artist and ask for a natural look. If you feel you need heavy eye make-up, you may not be cut out for modeling, or you may lack the confidence needed to succeed in the field. If this is you, try going cold turkey by slapping on some mascara, some light concealer only where it's absolutely necessary, and some lip gloss with a natural tint. You WILL get used to it, and you will probably get compliments from your friends and family, which can only help. Chances are they've been hoping you'd chill with the heavy make-up. Also, make sure to stick to the daytime and nighttime make-up rule."

      "content": "Keep your hair healthy. Avoid hot irons, blow-dryers, and curling irons whenever you can. Try working with the natural texture of your hair, whether you like it or not. Invest in a high-end salon and ask your stylist to create a style that would work with the natural texture of your hair. Straightening iron addicts- put those straighteners down! These tools should be reserved for special occasions ONLY! As a model, you will be exposed to these frequently anyway, so it would help to allow your hair to rest whenever you can. Also, try finding styling products that can achieve the look you're going for. ALWAYS use heat protection sprays and the appropriate products for your hair type. DO NOT wash your hair daily.

That means, no tanning! EVER. Unless of course it's sunless, in which case, don't overdo it, and don't look orange. Ask a family member or friend who you think would be bold enough to tell you if you look orange or not. If you do, tone it down or avoid it all together. Photographers will apply bronzer to your skin if they think it's too pale. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

Agencies usually cut off open calls to models over the age of 25. Take 4 photos of yourself. The first should be a photo of the front of your face with NO MAKEUP on. (if you insist on wearing it, however, make sure you keep it down to mascara and concealer that matches your skin tone perfectly). Second, a photo of your profile. Third, a full body shot of you in a bikini (NEVER send nude photos. They are UNACCEPTABLE). And finally, a full body shot of you in a bikini from the side."
