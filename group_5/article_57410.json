      "title": "Fold the square in half.",
      "content": "Fold the square in half. Start by folding the lower left corner of your square up to meet the upper right corner of your square. You should be left with a triangle. Make sure the corners meet up perfectly. Your fox will look much more polished if your folds are precise. To avoid confusing yourself, don't change the orientation of your paper."

    {
      "title": "Fold two corners in to make a square.",
      "content": "Fold two corners in to make a square. Next, fold the left corner of your square in to meet the upper right corner (the right angle). Do the same with the lower corner of your square. You should be left with a small square with a crease diagonally down the middle where the two triangles meet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip your square over.",
      "content": "Flip your square over. Flip your square over so that all of the folds are facing away from you. Be sure to turn it over horizontally, not vertically. To confirm that you flipped the paper the right way, check to make sure that seam between the two triangles on the back of your square goes from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. If it doesn't, reposition the square so that it is oriented the correct way."

    {
      "title": "Fold the square in half.",
      "content": "Fold the square in half. Keeping your square in the same position, fold the upper right corner down to meet the lower left corner. Be sure to match the corners up precisely before creasing your fold. . You should now have a right triangle, with the right angle on the lower left side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the left side over.",
      "content": "Fold the left side over. Fold the entire left side of your triangle over to the right. Try to fold it so that the straight edge will intersect the remaining triangle in half. (It does not need to be precise.) At this point, you should have a skinny rectangle (that has a point on the upper right hand side) on the left of your piece. There should be a small triangle protruding from behind the rectangle on the right."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold the rectangle.",
      "content": "Unfold the rectangle. You will notice that the rectangle on the left side of your piece is comprised of two folds. Starting at the bottom of the rectangle, separate these two sections. Fold the top fold to the right and the bottom fold to the left. As you do this, you should notice a triangle that begins to emerge near the top. This is the fox's head."

    {
      "title": "Finish up your fox.",
      "content": "Finish up your fox. To finish your fox, encourage the head to fold down by running your fingers along the crease. You can also fold the tail out to help it stand up. Lastly, you may decorate your fox's face in whatever way you choose. You can draw on a nose and eyes, or use googly eyes to give your fox its expression."

      "title": "Fold your paper in half.",
      "content": "Fold your paper in half. Starting with the colored side of your paper facing down, fold your square in half diagonally. Make sure that the corners line up nicely and that you run your finger along the fold to make a good crease. [1] X Research source If you are using construction paper or printer paper, both sides will be colored, so it doesn't matter which side is facing down."

    {
      "title": "Fold your paper in half a second time.",
      "content": "Fold your paper in half a second time. Keeping the first fold in place, fold your paper in half diagonally a second time. Once you have creased this fold, you can immediately unfold it. The purpose is to create a crease, but not to leave this fold in place. Be sure to leave the first fold in place. After this step, you should have a square that has been folded into a triangle once and has a crease down the middle."

    {
      "title": "Fold the point of the triangle down.",
      "content": "Fold the point of the triangle down. Position your triangle so that the long side is facing towards you. Then fold the top point of the triangle down so that it just barely meets the long side of the triangle."

    {
      "title": "Fold the ears up.",
      "content": "Fold the ears up. Keep the paper positioned so that the long side is facing towards you. Then fold up one of the bottom corners so that the point sticks up over the top of your paper. Do the same with the second bottom corner, trying to make sure the shape symmetrical. This will create the fox's ears. The higher you place your folds, the larger the ears will be. You can make them whatever size you want, but do your best make sure the two sides are the same size."

    {
      "title": "Create the face.",
      "content": "Create the face. Flip the paper over, and you should see the beginnings of a fox face. You should have a large triangle at the bottom (which is the face) and two triangles sticking up on the top from behind (which are the ears). To make it look more like a fox, draw on a face. Color in the bottom of the triangle with a black pen or marker to make the nose. Experiment with different expressions. The way you draw the eyes can make your fox look happy, sad, or angry. You can also put some googly eyes on your fox."

      "title": "Decide what kind of paper you will use.",
      "content": "Decide what kind of paper you will use. Regardless of which kind of fox you want to make, you will need to start with a perfectly square piece of paper. Origami paper comes in perfect squares, so so won't have to worry about cutting it. If you don't have a square piece of paper, you can start with a standard 8 1/2 x 11-inch sheet of paper and use a simple folding technique to turn it into the perfect square. [2] X Research source You can use any color paper you want, but orange is a popular choice for foxes, since it is close to the color of a fox's hair."

      "content": "Fold the left corner in. If your paper is not already a square, start by folding the upper left corner of your paper down to the right side, making sure that the upper right corner is creased perfectly in half. You should be left with a skinny rectangle at the bottom of the page. It's very important that your edges all line up. If they don't you won't have a perfect square."

      "title": "Fold the rectangle.",
      "content": "Fold the rectangle. Fold the rectangle on the bottom under your triangle. Run your finger along this fold to make a very good crease. At this point, you should have a large triangle with two smaller triangles protruding from behind it (one on each side)."

      "title": "Unfold and cut.",
      "content": "Unfold and cut. Lastly, unfold your piece of paper and cut the rectangle off of the bottom. This will leave you with a perfectly square piece of paper that you can use for any origami project. If you created a really solid crease, you may also be able to tear the rectangle off, but be careful to do it cleanly."
