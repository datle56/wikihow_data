      "content": "Look for the ability to adjust the chair's height. The height of your ergonomic chair should be fully adjustable. The chair's seat should be easy to move either upwards or downwards. This adjustment will allow for people of different heights to comfortably sit in the chair. Make sure you can adjust how high or low the seat is before purchasing your chair. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source A seat height of 15” to 22” will comfortably seat a person between 5'0\" to 6'4\" tall. Most chairs will offer only a small range of adjustment.

      "content": "Make sure elements of the chair can be individually adjusted. A good ergonomic chair will allow you to adjust each part of the chair by itself. You should be able to move the armrests, seat and back supports independently of each other. This level of customization will allow you to make the chair a good fit for anyone that might end up using it. [4] X Research source You may want to avoid chairs that don't allow for adjustments. Generally, you will want to select chairs that have a large number of adjustable features."

      "content": "Check the chair for adequate upper and middle back support. Proper ergonomic chairs will offer full upper and middle back support. If you are going to be sitting for a long period of time, supporting your back and its natural shape will be important in preventing injury or strain. Make sure your ergonomic chair has excellent upper and middle back support before making a purchase. [5] X Research source The backrest should be between 12” and 19” wide.

      "content": "Make sure the backrest can be adjusted or reclined. Being able to recline or adjust the back of your chair will affect the amount of weight placed on your lower back. If you are planning on being seated for a majority of the day, reclining can help relieve pressure on your spinal discs and lower back muscles. [7] X Research source Avoid buying an ergonomic chair that can't recline. Most chairs can be locked into the most comfortable reclined position you find. Back pressure is lowest between 110° and 130° of reclining. People with lower back injuries can benefit the most from reclining chairs."

Think about some of the following parts of the chair you are looking at to help you finalize your choice: [12] X Research source Chair bases should have five spokes. The chair's casters should move easily and freely. If the chair comes with a headrest, make sure it's a good fit for your body type. You may need a foot rest if the chair's height is too high and cannot be adjusted. You'll want to think about which chair covering is best. Vinyl coverings can be easy to clean but don't breathe well. Cloth seat covers can allow for airflow but may be tougher to keep clean."
