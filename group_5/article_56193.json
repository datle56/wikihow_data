      "content": "Cider is a fast fashion media brand, dropping new pieces weekly. Cider, also known as ShopCider, is a popular clothing brand that went viral in 2020 on TikTok. They produce trendy items at affordable prices. However, with weekly drops of new items, fast fashion is characterized as any item made quickly and inexpensively to attract consumers. Therefore, Cider designs their clothing to be discarded and replaced more quickly than higher-quality products. [1] X Research source Sustainability has become a major buzzword for retailers. To fit into the “trend\" of sustainability, many brands have begun to greenwash their items to market towards people looking to be more sustainable. Greenwashing is about claiming or creating the idea that a business’s services or products are more environmentally friendly or sustainable than they are. [2] X Research source For example, eco-friendly products wrapped in plastic. Cider can be compared to other fast fashion brands like Shein, Princess Polly, Rue21, Forever 21, Garage, and more. Generally, Reddit users have found if a brand’s sustainability information isn’t easily accessible, it means they’re not eco-friendly."

      "content": "Cider primarily uses polyester in their clothing. Despite the brand’s claim that sustainable fashion “should be accessible, not exclusive,” a majority of the fabrics they use in their “New In,” “Bestsellers,” or “Trending” aren’t made of sustainable fabrics. [3] X Research source One of the leading fabrics that should be avoided is polyester, which most of Cider’s clothes consist of. [4] X Research source Polyester usually comes from petroleum or oil and is not biodegradable. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The company has wool and exotic animal hair in some collections. Another component of sustainable brands is the use of animals. Fortunately, the brand doesn’t use leather, down, fur, angora, or exotic animal skin across its collections. However, the company has a wool collection that comes from sheep. [6] X Research source They’re also said to use exotic animal hair in some collections without sourcing where they’re getting this material from."

      "content": "Cider only uses recycled polyester in specific collections. The company claims to invent a smart fashion model that produces on demand by adopting recycled materials and a responsible supply chain. [7] X Research source But only certain collections #ReCider, for example, feature recycled polyester. With that said, recycled polyester is rarely just that. Clothes often blend different fibers, making recycling difficult. [8] X Research source In 2020, 99% of recycled polyester was sourced from PET bottles, and only 0.5% came from pre-and post-consumer recycled textiles. [9] X Research source Each time you wash a polyester product, it sheds small pieces of plastic (microplastics) into your water supply and air. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "The company utilizes biodegradable plastic bags for packaging. In 2022, Cider switched to d₂w biodegradable bags, which can be placed in a compost bin to degrade quickly. However, how quickly that is remains unclear. Additionally, Cider partnered with DHL’s GoGreen parcel service to offset carbon emissions at no extra cost. [11] X Research source They also recommend repurposing the Cider bags as dry bags for the beach, make-up bags, or to organize stationary."

      "content": "Cider has limited information on their employee’s wages. Unfortunately, Cider does not provide wage transparency despite its policy that suppliers must not pay less than the local minimum wage. [12] X Research source However, this doesn’t consider how low some minimum wages are in other countries. Meeting the minimum does not mean it’s a living wage for their workers. [13] X Research source If you’re wondering what makes a company ethical, consider how the company creates positive change, does more for the environment, puts its workers first, and uplifts human and animal rights and their political stance.

This includes safe work sites, fire permits, and two or more safety exits. Similarly, employees can drink water during working hours and go on bathroom breaks freely. During breaks, employees are free to leave the workplace. [15] X Research source"

Cider only works with suppliers, subcontractors, and factories that offer “the greatest protection to workers and the community.” Their Zero Tolerance Policy covers four key points: human rights, safety, environment, and integrity. Regarding the environment, suppliers must obtain materials “from responsible sources,” and the “origin of the inputs” must be monitored. Still, this information isn’t transparent to the consumer.

      "content": "Cider is a woman-owned fashion brand created in 2020. Four friends wanted to create a brand celebrating “happiness in the mundane,” and thus Cider was born. Inspired by the street fashion of major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Shanghai, and Seoul, the company claims to operate on a “smart fashion” model where they release new styles by adjusting production in real time to avoid producing large qualities of clothing. [17] X Research source Cider’s involvement in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) is unclear. However, they claim to be a global team fueled by young talent—primarily women or women-identifying individuals. [18] X Research source The company went viral on TikTok and reached 1 million followers on Instagram within their first year of operation. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for sustainable, ethical, or slow fashion brands instead. If you’re ready to enter your sustainability era, consider purchasing fashion at a slower rate. Although sustainable brands may not be the most affordable option up front, they last for years and years to come. Thrifting at your local Goodwill or online (Depop, Poshmark, Facebook Marketplace) are great alternatives to finding goods at an affordable cost. Other sustainable, size-inclusive brands include: [20] X Research source Lucy & Yak Kotn Organique Mila.Vert Flare Street Iron Roots Frankie Collective Pact"
