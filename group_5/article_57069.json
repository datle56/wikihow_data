Break them with your hands or a tool, then pick up the bamboo shoots. You need at least 6 bamboo shoots to make scaffolding. Alternatively, you can find bamboo inside structures in jungles. Pandas also drop bamboo when killed."

You can place scaffolding blocks on the side of a scaffolding stack by aiming at the side of a scaffolding block you want to place it on and placing it, or by standing on top of a scaffolding block and aiming just outside the edge you want to place a scaffolding block and placing it. Scaffolding blocks can be placed above ground on the side of a scaffolding stack up to 6 blocks out from the central support stack. Placing blocks any further out will cause them to fall to the ground."
