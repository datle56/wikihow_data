      "title": "\"Sent As SMS via Server\" means your text was sent as SMS, not RCS.",
      "content": "\"Sent As SMS via Server\" means your text was sent as SMS, not RCS. RCS stands for Rich Communication Services and is similar to iMessage on Apple devices. Messages from an Android device via RCS are sent over Wi-Fi or mobile data instead of cellular service, which means they don't count as SMS (Short Message Service) for cellular data plans. \"Sent As SMS via Server\" is a standard delivery status notification, just like the \"Sent,\" \"Delivered,\" \"Received,\" or \"Failed\" notifications you're probably used to seeing. Sending messages as an SMS is a fallback enabled by default on most Android devices, so your messages can still be sent even if your recipient can't receive RCS messages. Note that if your text contains a photo or video, it will be sent as an MMS which means Multimedia Messaging Service (even though the notification still says SMS)."

      "content": "The type of phone and reception quality can cause a message to be sent as SMS. These are the reasons your message may be sent as SMS via server: Your recipient is in an area with poor reception and/or no internet access. RCS messages require both the sender and recipient to be on Wi-Fi or mobile data. If the person you're texting isn't connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data, your text will be sent as an SMS. You or the recipient have turned off RCS. While sending messages via RCS is enabled by default, you can turn it off in your settings. If this is the case, make sure both you and your recipient have enabled RCS messages. Your recipient has an iPhone. If you're trying to text someone who has an iPhone, they won't be able to receive RCS messages. Your text must be sent as a normal SMS/MMS message. The recipient has blocked you. This is uncommon, but if you're trying to text someone you know can get RCS messages and the message is sent as an SMS, they may have blocked you. There are other ways you can tell if someone has blocked your number , however."
