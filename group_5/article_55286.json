Bend one leg and rest your ankle on the opposite knee or thigh, so that you can easily reach your foot. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Don’t try to reach your own foot if it causes you a lot of pain. You may need to stick to using a massage tool or ask someone else to massage your foot. Remove your shoes and socks first.

This is an acupressure point, and pressing or rubbing there may help relieve pain in other parts of the body.

You can get a similar effect with a rolling pin or water bottle, but the massage won’t be as intense. You can also get electric foot massagers, which do all the work of the massage for you. These massagers typically use a combination of vibration, movement, and heat to relieve pain and tension. Don’t use an electric foot massager if you’re diabetic unless your doctor recommends it. Your feet may be more vulnerable to injuries and burns, especially if the massager uses heat.
