      "content": "Experiment with different clothes and outfits to find what you like. Remember, not everyone has the same likings of clothes style. You can still be pretty even if you can't afford new clothes. Wear whatever makes you come alive, and the right people will compliment you. Wear clothes that make you happy, not what makes other people happy.Wear leggings, jeans, shorts, skirts, crop tops and dresses. Whatever makes you feel comfortable and good. Wash your clothing once a week, and make sure that they are stain free. Don't worry too much about what other people think: wear what makes you feel good. Confident people (or people who seem confident!) are seen as better-looking. Tune into Instagram, fashion magazines, and new celebrity looks if you'd like to keep up with the latest trends. Color trends are another great way to stay fashionable. Look at the colors of the season (like Pantone colors) and try to pick your wardrobe based on those. Try to find bloggers who share the same style as you, too. That can be a great outlet to figure out what's in style. If you can, try to find style icons who are close to your age. Some trends (such as cat-eye eyeliner, or tall high heels) look stylish on a 20-year-old, but strange and awkward on someone who's 10."

You are going to change rapidly over the next few years, if you aren't already changing. Adapting your sense of self now will take you further than ever. Be proud of who you are , and how you present yourself. So keeping clean , fresh , and coming off as being a polite person will come in handy. Finally, don't let other people get you down ."

      "content": "Let your light shine. Be nice to everyone. Help other people carry their groceries, pick up something a busy parent dropped. Do small deeds for people and you will feel good about yourself. If you see a chore that needs doing, try and get it over with. Your parents will thank you! Kind people are often considered to be more pretty than rude or mean people. If people are happy with how you act, they'll start to see your appearance in a better light, too (without even thinking about it!)"

Remember that you're only 10, and that even if you don't look the way you want to now, this may very well change as you get older. Think about the way you see your friends. Do you think badly of them because of the shape of their nose, or the color of their eyes? Don't think anything mean about yourself that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying to your best friend."

      "content": "Choose whether you wear makeup. Never feel like you have to. You're gorgeous anyway, and no one has to wear makeup. You can wear it if you want to though. The same applies for accessories like expensive handbags and jewelry. You do not need to wear them unless you want to. If you choose to wear makeup, consider asking an older girl or woman you trust (mom, sister, older female friend etc.) whether it looks good. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether your makeup is messy or embarrassing, especially if you're just starting out."

Everybody needs a good lifestyle to keep them alert and help them to live longer. You should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, move enough every day to get your heart rate up, and drink water whenever you're thirsty.

Learn as much as you can about the world around you and try to have interesting things to say. No, you won't use everything you learn in school, but think of school as a way to teach you how to learn. It sounds funny, but this is a very useful skill."

Having to be in a relationship because of peer pressure is not good. But beware of hanging out with older, \"cool\" people. It could be dangerous for you. Stick around kids your age and be cautious with older children."

If you want, you can add accessories like clips, headbands and bows for a pretty, girly look. Wash your hair every one or two days. Try alternating between having your hair down, keeping it in a ponytail, or doing a more unique style (like braids or two ponytails) so that you can look different each day. But if you want to stick to just one that works for you, go for it!"
