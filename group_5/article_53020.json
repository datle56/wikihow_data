      "content": "Stock up on your favorite soft foods and liquids. Choose foods that can give you the nourishment you need without making eating more of a headache than it already is.

      "content": "Take small bites and chew gently. Remember, the palate expander is literally separating the two halves of the upper jaw, exerting pressure on the bones of your lower face. You will most likely end up chewing with the teeth that aren't harnessed to the expander."

      "content": "Follow your orthodontist's instructions about how often to turn the expander. This could vary from once a day to two or three times per day, depending on the degree of expansion required as well as on other orthodontic procedures that need to occur during the process, such as adding braces.

      "content": "Insert the key into the hole in the screw of the central gear. In most cases you will be inserting the key into a small angled hole facing the back of your upper teeth (i.e. the key will be pointing out of your mouth). If you are performing this on yourself, do this in front of a mirror in a well lit room. If you are performing this on a child or young person, have them lay down and open their mouth as wide as possible to prevent gagging in case you accidentally touch their uvula. Make sure you have enough light to see clearly - use a flashlight if needed."
