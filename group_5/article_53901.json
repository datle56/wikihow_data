      "title": "A concise subject line lets the artist know exactly what you want.",
      "content": "A concise subject line lets the artist know exactly what you want. Tattoo artists get a lot of emails about booking and consultations. Once you find an artist, start an email with a subject line that’s only a few words long so the artist can quickly get an idea of your request. Some good subject lines you can try are: [1] X Research source “Tattoo inquiry” “Booking request” “Tattoo appointment request” If the artist is traveling and will only be in an area for a small window of time, mention the dates in your subject line, like “Tattoo availability July 1–10?” Check the artist’s social media or the tattoo shop’s website to see if they have any specific requirements for what you should include in the subject line."

    {
      "title": "A polite greeting starts your message on a good note.",
      "content": "A polite greeting starts your message on a good note. Say hi or hello to the artist before you introduce yourself. Mention that you like the artist’s work and that you’d really like them to do your next tattoo. “Hi Ryan, my name is Ava Smith, and I’ve been a fan ever since I saw your work on Instagram. I’d love to be tattooed by you if you have an available appointment.” “Hello James! I’m Pablo and I was hoping to get some more information about a potential tattoo design. I really like your style and was hoping we could work something out for a piece that I’ve been wanting.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Detailed descriptions give the artist a clear look at your vision.",
      "content": "Detailed descriptions give the artist a clear look at your vision. If you’ve already chosen a tattoo design , explain the most important parts you want to include so the artist can determine if it fits into their style. Try to keep it to 1 or 2 sentences so the artist has some freedom to interpret your idea too. [2] X Research source “I’d really like to get a monarch butterfly with a kaleidoscope design in the wings.” “My idea is a realistic portrait of my mom with the quote ‘Do good things’ in her handwriting underneath.” “I was hoping to get a lighthouse with Kraken tentacles wrapping around it. I’d also like to have some waves crashing into the rocks below the lighthouse.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Mentioning style and color gives the artist a better idea of your piece.",
      "content": "Mentioning style and color gives the artist a better idea of your piece. Some artists are really versatile while others may only specialize in a certain style. Briefly mention the tattoo style you were hoping to get so the artist can decide if it’s something that they’re comfortable and confident working on. [3] X Research source “I’d like to get this as a neo-traditional piece in color.” “I was hoping to get this design in a black-and-gray realistic style.” “I think this tattoo would work really well as a color new school piece.” If you want the specific style that your artist specializes in, you don’t have to mention it in your email."

      "title": "Artists judge how difficult the tattoo will be based on size and location.",
      "content": "Artists judge how difficult the tattoo will be based on size and location. If you know where you want to get tattooed , tell the artist where they’ll be working and if you have other tattoos around it. Be sure to give a size estimate as well since larger tattoos will take more of the artist’s time. [4] X Research source “I’d really love to get this design on my left shoulder so it’s about 4 inches tall.” “I just wanted this about the size of a quarter right above my ankle.” “I’m not quite sure where I want this tattoo yet, but I’m open to talking through it to find the best place for it.” If you’re getting the tattoo as a cover-up, be upfront about it since the artist will have to plan the design around your existing tattoo. Even if you don’t know for sure where or how large you want, it’s okay to mention that and the artist will give their best recommendations."

      "title": "The artist will tell you if they have slots open when you’re available.",
      "content": "The artist will tell you if they have slots open when you’re available. Pick a few dates that you have free and tell your artist when you can come in for a consultation or tattoo. Make sure you let them know if you only have certain hours of the day free so your artist can find a time where they can work on your piece without feeling rushed. “I’m available in the afternoons after 4 PM on weekdays and am completely open on weekends to come in.” “My weekdays are busy, but I have every Saturday this month available to come in.” “I’m planning on visiting town from August 12–19, and was wondering if you had any slots available at that time.”"

      "title": "Your artist can address concerns you have before coming into the shop.",
      "content": "Your artist can address concerns you have before coming into the shop. It’s okay if you have a lot of questions about the artist and their process, especially if you’re getting tattooed for the first time . Your artist wants you to feel comfortable throughout the entire process, so make sure to ask anything that you’re worried about so the artist can help you prepare for your tattoo . “I’ve never gotten a tattoo before, and I’m just curious how much it hurts?” “What’s your policy about getting touch-ups once my tattoo heals?” “How long have you been tattooing?”"

      "content": "The tattoo artist will need to reach out for confirmation and additional info. Make sure to leave a phone number and the email address where the artist can easily reach you. Mention that you’re excited to hear back from them so you can continue working on the design together. “I’m really excited for this piece, so please feel free to reach out by phone at (555) 555-0123 or over email at artgeek23@gmail.com to let me know if this is a good fit for you.” “I look forward to hearing back from you! You can get a hold of me at (555) 555-6789 or steven.sibella@yahoo.com.” “I’d love to discuss this piece a little more with you. Replying to the email address I sent this through works best, but you can also call me at (555) 555-3456.”"

      "content": "Artists will love that you’re appreciative of their time. Tattoo artists get a lot of inquiry emails, so staying polite will help set your message apart and show that you’re easy to work with. Let them know that you’re eager to keep communicating with them before ending the email with your signature. Thank them for their time and include a closing before adding your name. “Thank you so much for your time. I can’t wait to hear back from you!” “I really appreciate you taking the time to read through my request. I hope we can work together soon.” “I’m excited to hear what ideas you have for this piece! Thanks again!”"

      "content": "Visuals help your artist understand the look you’re hoping for. Scroll through the artist’s social media page or their portfolio site and find examples of their own work that you like. It’s okay to include a few pictures of designs by other artists too. You can also send a picture of where you want the tattoo on your body so the artist gets a better idea of how the piece would fit. [5] X Research source Avoid asking a tattoo artist to exactly replicate another tattooist’s work. Your artist will put their own spin on your design idea and make it unique for you. Double-check that you've included the right attachments before you hit send."

      "content": "Your artist can give an accurate estimate once they know the details. Rather than asking upfront about the price, be patient and wait for their reply to make sure they want to work on the piece. Many artists will charge by the size of the tattoo or how long it takes to complete, and they should have a good idea of the price once they read through your first email. [6] X Research source “What is the payment process for this tattoo?” “Do you have an approximate estimate for this piece so I can save up money for it?” “I was just wondering how you charged for this design?”"

      "content": "Subject: Tattoo inquiry Hi Tommy, My name is Ellie Smith and I’ve been browsing your work on Instagram and I’m a big fan. If you have any availabilities coming up, I’d love to get a tattoo from you. My idea was to get an American traditional clipper ship with a pirate flag waving from the mast. I’d like to get the piece on my thigh about 6 inches tall, and I don’t have any other tattoos on my leg. I attached a few reference images from your portfolio so you have an idea of what I’m looking for. I live nearby, so I’m available on weeknights after 3 PM for appointments, and I’m completely free on Saturdays if there are available appointment times. This is my first tattoo, so I’m a little nervous about how much getting this piece will hurt. Is the thigh a painful spot to get tattooed? I’d love to talk more about my idea, so feel free to email me back at ellie.smith123@gmail.com or give me a call at (555) 555-2468. Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon! Ellie Smith"
