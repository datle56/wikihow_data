      "content": "Look for an offer letter from Kia in your mail. If you drive an eligible model that uses a turn-to-start key, then look for a letter from Kia Corporate Headquarters. The heading will read something like “IMPORTANT STEERING WHEEL LOCKING DEVICE OFFER” at the top along with your vehicle identification number (VIN). It also lists an offer code on the top-right for submitting a request form. [1] X Research source Typically, you’ll get a letter if you have a Kia made before 2022 that has a key and turn-start ignition. These models lack engine immobilizers, which are parts that prevent your vehicle from starting without a key, so they’re more vulnerable to theft. If you didn’t receive a letter from Kia, contact their support team at 1-800-333-4KIA (4542). The support line is available Monday through Friday from 5 AM to 6 PM PST."

[14] X Research source What causes the steering wheel to lock up? Auto repair specialist Hovig Manouchekian mentions that a common culprit may be a worn-out key or a damaged ignition tumbler. He says to check the grooves of the key for damage or try a duplicate key to see if it works. He also mentions that a leak in your power steering system could also make the wheel lock up so it’s difficult to turn. Damage to engine control unit (ECU) sensors and debris inside of your ignition system could cause the issue. If you keep having persistent problems with your steering wheel locking up, then take your vehicle to a mechanic for repairs. Avoid forcing the key to turn because you could break it off in the ignition, which requires a more pricey repair and replacement."
