      "content": "Tell your partner clearly and openly how you’re feeling. Try to talk with them as soon when issues arise instead of bottling up your feelings inside. This way, you and your partner can stay on the same page. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source As you open up, try to keep emotion out of the conversation; instead stay grounded on the topic at hand. [2] X Research source You might say, “Lately, I feel like our relationship isn’t a priority for you. I’m not trying to point any fingers, but I just want to be honest with you.” Good communication isn’t always about being “right.” Be prepared to compromise as you talk things out with your partner.

      "content": "Listen closely as your partner airs out any issues they have. Communication is a two-way street, and listening is an essential part of a healthy relationship. If your partner is going through a tough time, invite them to share what’s on their mind. Try to stay engaged throughout the conversation, and let them know that their thoughts and feelings are important. [3] X Research source Restating, reflecting, and summarizing are great ways to be an active listener. You might say something like, “Let me make sure I’m on the same page…” “It sounds like…” or “I can tell that you’ve been thinking about this a lot.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to view a situation from your partner’s perspective. If you and your partner run into issues about who should be doing what around the home, it’s perfectly natural to feel defensive. Instead, try to push past these feelings and view the conversation through your partner’s eyes. Your discussion might be more productive and understanding if you look at the issue from their point of view. [5] X Research source Instead of saying “I don’t get why you’re so upset about this,” you might say, “I’m sorry you’ve felt this way. I didn’t mean to leave all the trash and recycling to you last night.”"

      "content": "Identify you and your partner’s attachment styles. People with different attachment styles tend to act differently. [6] X Research source Attachment styles, or the way you connect and relate to other people, play a role in your relationship. [7] X Research source Compare your attachment style with your partner’s in a friendly, open conversation. [8] X Research source Once you know your attachment style, you’ll have an easier time addressing your intimacy issues. [9] X Research source If you have an anxious or avoidant attachment style, focus on building your self-esteem and putting yourself out there with your partner."

      "title": "You might be repeating a past habit without realizing it.",
      "content": "You might be repeating a past habit without realizing it. Think about your family life and past relationships. Are your past habits and relationships leaking into your current one? Pinpointing these bad habits can help you separate your past from your present, and lead to healthier conversations with your partner. [10] X Research source For example, if you tended to pick fights with your parents as a child, you might pick fights with your partner without realizing it."

      "content": "Don’t play the blame game with your partner. Instead, think about the kinds of conflicts and arguments you and your partner usually have, and why they happen. Once you recognize and identify these patterns, make an effort to change and mold them into something healthier. [11] X Research source For instance, if your partner tends to leave their dirty laundry on the floor, say something like, “I don’t want to start a fight, but I’ve noticed that you don’t seem to listen or care when I remind you to put your laundry away. Is there a way we could compromise on this?”"

      "content": "Every relationship “problem” is just an incorrect answer to a bigger issue. Instead of focusing on individual issues, try to look at the bigger scheme of things. The next time you run into a problem with your partner, focus on the cause instead of the effect. [12] X Research source For instance, if your partner forgets to do the dishes, suggest making a chore chart instead of criticizing them for forgetting. If your partner is in a bad mood, ask “What’s on your mind?” instead of saying “What are you pissed about?”"

      "content": "Rewind back to the very beginning of your relationship. After spending weeks, months, and years with the same person, it’s completely valid to lose a bit of perspective along the way. Instead, think about what attracted you to your partner in the first place. Spend some time reconnecting and chatting—this may help you find your roots, and relight that spark between the both of you. [13] X Research source You might ask a simple, open-ended question, like “If a crystal ball could tell you an absolute truth about your past, present, or future, what would you ask?”"

      "title": "Variety is essential to a healthy relationship.",
      "content": "Variety is essential to a healthy relationship. After spending a lot of time with your partner, you might develop a “fantasy bond.” This is a fancy term for merging your identity with your partner’s, instead of viewing each other as separate people. To break this bond, try changing your usual routine by spending some more quality time with your friends and trying new things. [14] X Research source For instance, you might go to the movies one weekend if you usually spend the night in. You might try out a new restaurant instead of eating dinner at home."

      "content": "Try touching each other more. Believe it or not, simple, affectionate touch can go a long way in a relationship. Touching your partner is a simple but effective way to show that you’re thinking about them and that you care. Even something like a simple touch on the forearm can really help rekindle a connection between you and your partner. [16] X Research source You might pat your partner on the shoulder if they’ve had a rough day, or offer to give them a hug. If touch isn’t a big part of your relationship, talk to your partner about it! An open conversation might help you pinpoint some issues in the relationship."

      "content": "Practicing gratitude helps you feel better about a relationship. Look for opportunities to tell your partner thanks, whether they did an extra chore, offered helpful advice, or something else unrelated. When you say thanks often, both you and your partner feel better and secure about the relationship overall. [17] X Research source You might thank your partner for making the bed that morning, or for picking up some extra ingredients at the grocery store."

      "content": "Tackle your household finances as a pair. In many relationships, budgets and finances are managed in an unbalanced way. To avoid this pitfall, assign each other “jobs” related to the household finances. You might keep these jobs permanently, or trade every month. Working in tandem is a great way to better manage your budget.

Then, you can switch roles the following month."
