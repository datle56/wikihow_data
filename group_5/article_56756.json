If you are older than 51 years of age or if you have underlying conditions causing an increased blood pressure, stick to 1500 mg of sodium a day at maximum. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source A small drop in your sodium intake can often lower your blood pressure by 2 to 8 mmHg. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Check food labels on processed foods; they often contain a lot of sodium. To add flavor to your food, try herbs and spices like cayenne pepper (expands blood vessels and improves blood flow), turmeric (decreases inflammation, which improves cardiovascular function), garlic (lowers both cholesterol and blood pressure), and chili peppers.

      "content": "Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption. In small amounts, alcohol can actually cause your blood pressure to drop. However, the positive effects of alcohol can disappear after 2 drinks. In light to moderate amounts, wine and other alcohol can lower your blood pressure by 2 to 4 mmHg. In higher amounts, it may actually cause your blood pressure to increase. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For men and women over the age of 65, drink one glass of wine or a beverage with a similar alcoholic content per day. For adults under the age of 65, you might be able to drink up to two glasses a day. For tracking purposes, one drink or glass equals 12 oz (355 ml) of beer, 5 oz (148 ml) of wine, or 1.5 oz (45 ml) of 80-proof liquor. Note that this is only helpful if you already drink alcohol, however. The results are less pronounced and riskier if you do not drink regularly. Drinking alcohol may decrease the effectiveness of blood pressure medication."

You can get exercise through both athletic activities and common chores. Before increasing the amount of exercise you do in a day, ask your doctor for guidance. Increasing physical activity too dramatically may put you at greater risk of heart attack or stroke. Power walking is one of the simplest exercises you can add to your routine.
