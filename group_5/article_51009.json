      "content": "In the Bible, 10 signifies responsibility, power, and divine completion. Numerically, the number 10 is seen as a complete or perfect number, and its appearance in the Bible is no different. [1] X Research source 10 is the sum of 4 and 6—with 4 representing physical creation and 6 indicating man. Together, these numbers create 10, embodying the Lord’s almighty power and grace. God has a big responsibility to watch over humankind, and 10 is a reflection of that. When the number 10 appears in the Bible, it’s typically in relation to something being completed because of God’s power. [2] X Research source In Judaism, 10 is sometimes believed to mean “union” or “collection,” as rabbis deemed it a holy number. The tenth number of the Hebrew alphabet is yod, which means “hand of God” and “continuity.” [3] X Trustworthy Source Chabad.org Online resource for information related to Chabad-Lubavitch and Jewish culture Go to source It’s believed that the number 10 is in the Bible over 240 times."

      "content": "God gave His followers 10 Commandments to live by. One of the most well-known depictions of 10 in the Bible is the appearance of the Commandments in Exodus. On Mount Sinai, Moses receives 10 Commandments or golden rules from the Lord. It is these rules Christians must live by in the name of God. [6] X Research source Some theorize that the order of the 10 Commandments holds a more significant meaning. The first 4 are directed toward God (e.g., “You shall have no other gods before Me”), while the other six regard human relationships (e.g., “You shall not murder”). This distinction may represent God’s power and divine completion."

Ten generations passed between Adam and Noah’s stories when God claimed man was corrupt and decided to destroy all humankind (outside of Noah and his family on the ark).

Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David” (1 Kings 12:19-20). [15] X Research source “‘This is what the Lord says: Do not go up to fight against your fellow Israelites.

The Old Testament refers to books not in the Bible, and scholars refer to these as the “lost books.” These books aren’t necessarily lost but missing or taken out of the Bible’s final publication.

      "content": "In the Bible, John 10:10 is Jesus’s mission statement to give Christians eternal life. John 10:10 is as follows: “The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” [18] X Research source This is a powerful verse that embodies Jesus’s mission to help Christians live an abundant life. In the Bible, God’s people are sheep and Jesus is the shepherd. In this allegory, the thieves Jesus refers to in John 10:10 are those who try to steer God’s people wrong. It is God’s word and Jesus’s mission to forgive the thieves and lead them on a path of Christianity to an abundant life. [19] X Research source Jesus explains that an abundant life is an eternal life: “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand” (John 10:27-28). [20] X Research source"

The Hebrew word for the number 10 is eser , which sounds very similar to the Hebrew word for “wealth,” osher . [21] X Research source Because of this connection, many Christians believe the number 10 is associated with tithing, which is the practice of giving one-tenth of one’s earnings to the church. In Biblical times, the law required Israelites to give 10% of their goods. [22] X Research source As the scripture says: “Every tithe of the herd and flock—every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod—will be holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). [23] X Research source “Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year” (Deuteronomy 14:22).

There’s no denying that the number 10 is powerful, and how it’s used in the Bible and what it represents is extremely significant. The number 10 primarily comes with catastrophic and life-altering events. For instance, the 10 Plagues of Egypt and the 10 Commandments. These events altered Christians' lives and showcased the Lord's almighty power. Because of this, the number 10 represents God’s strength and effort to execute divine completion."
