      "content": "Use caution with this method. There are many contradicting opinions regarding water and amber. While some jewelers recommend using soapy water to clean amber, others strongly advise against it. If your piece is particularly dirty and you wish to try this method, you may consider performing a test on an inconspicuous area of the amber, or on a bead in the back of the necklace."

      "content": "Prepare two bowls of lukewarm water. The bowls should be large enough to fit the piece you will be cleaning. One bowl will be used to wash the amber, and the other bowl will be used to rinse it."

      "title": "Dip the amber necklace into the bowl with the soapy water.",
      "content": "Dip the amber necklace into the bowl with the soapy water. Gently run the necklace through your fingers to remove any dirt and grime. If there is dirt between the beads, you can use a soft-bristle toothbrush to reach it. Simply run the toothbrush over any cracks and crevices until you cannot see any more dirt. Use gentle pressure and do not scrub too hard, or you may scratch your amber. [3] X Research source Avoid tugging on the beads, as this can cause the string to break. Avoid soaking your amber for long periods of time. Prolonged exposure to water, especially hot water, can damage amber, making it appear cloudy."

Then, run the amber necklace between your hands. This helps restore the amber's luster and shine. Wipe the olive oil off your amber using the soft cloth. If you do not have any olive oil, another light oil may be used instead, such as an almond oil."
