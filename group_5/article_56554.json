      "content": "Start by putting on a song with a good beat. Ideally \"My Dougie\" by Lil' Will or \"Teach Me How to Dougie\" by Cali Swag District should be on. But you can technically do the Dougie to any song with a good hip hop beat. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Start with the side-to-side move.",
      "content": "Start with the side-to-side move. Begin swaying back and forth, starting with the right. Pause for a beat while putting your weight on the foot on the side you're leaning, thinking right step out, left tap. Then sway to the left and repeat.You can do it to the beat, or double-time every third beat. [2] X Research source Put your own rhythm into it so it feels comfortable. Keep your knees loose and remember, right step out, left tap. Left side out, right tap. Don't bring the \"tap\" all the way in; it's just a light touch on the floor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sway right, left, right, right.",
      "content": "Sway right, left, right, right. Follow it up with left, right, left, left. This is the same move, only you're swaying the same side twice after you've swayed both right and left (or left and right). Think, \"one and two and double this side.\" The start of each section should begin on the 1 and 5 -- right and 2 and 3 and 4 and left and 6 and 7 and 8. [3] X Research source Start feeling it in your arms. That's the next step! Get your shoulders into the groove, release your knees, and relax your hips. The style comes all from you. Step out on the whole counts -- 1, 2, 3, and 4. Tap on the \"and\" beats, so it's 1 tap 2 tap 3 tap 4."

    {
      "title": "Add some arms once you feel you have the style down.",
      "content": "Add some arms once you feel you have the style down. As you're doing the side-to-side movement, bring your hand (on the side you're swaying to) towards you in a fist in a counter-clockwise circle motion, until your arm is bent with your elbow facing down and your first up by your head. Do this move with the sway of the same side and then again with the opposite arm. Don't overcomplicate it! This arm-movement is the most popular Dougie arm move, but some other versions include arm-pops, rolls, etc. Whatever works for you, include in your Dougie. We'll cover some variations next. Try \"driving your car.\" With the side you're swaying on, grab the steering wheel and sway your arm back and forth. Then bring it in to incorporate other moves."

    {
      "title": "Try the \"Cat-Daddy,\" another popular Dougie move.",
      "content": "Try the \"Cat-Daddy,\" another popular Dougie move. Punch down by your hip with the arm of the opposite side (e.g. right hip, left arm). This is similar to the arm movement just discussed, only on a slightly lower level. Bring your hips and knees down with your arms, too, lowering your entire body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try the \"Wheelchair\" move.",
      "content": "Try the \"Wheelchair\" move. With both your arms, make forward circles to your sides like you're pushing yourself in a wheelchair (you probably saw that one coming). At the same time, start crouching lower with each rotation, either with your knees going forward or to the sides (like the chicken-wing move with your legs!). Vary this one up with the moves already discussed as the music progresses."

    {
      "title": "Now do the Dougie \"Fresh!\"",
      "content": "Now do the Dougie \"Fresh!\" This move is signature for all styles of Dougie. Bring your hand over the top of your head and slide it off the back, like you're slicking your hair down. Greasing the mullet, if you will. Do this with the side-to-side move, shifting your shoulders side to side, then do it with the other hand. Vary your levels with this move too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't forget to be loose with your knees.",
      "content": "Don't forget to be loose with your knees. Otherwise you're going to look very stiff! That is not how you want the dance to look -- it's all about feeling the beat and flowing with the motion of the music. It helps to shake around and let your arms and legs feel free before dancing, just to get in the groove. Add your own personal flair to the dance as well. Basically, just have fun!"
