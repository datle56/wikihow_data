      "content": "Move gently. Your hands always have to be open and loose. The gecko needs to feel safe. Don't squeeze the gecko as this can injure, anger, or scare it. [2] X Research source If you try to constrain the gecko, it may think that you are a predator and trying to eat them. That's really scary! A scared gecko that cannot get away may turn around and bite you."

      "content": "Pick it up slowly and take it out of its cage. When handling it, just let it crawl around or sit on your arm or hand. Enjoy your new friend. [3] X Research source It is safest to sit on the floor when you are handling the gecko. This way, if the gecko jumps and lands on the floor, it won't have too far to fall, and you won't step on it."
