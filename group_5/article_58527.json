      "content": "Tilt your head slightly to 1 side. This prevents your nose from bumping into that of your partner’s while French kissing. Even if you aren’t practicing with a person, you should still get into the habit of tilting your head slightly. [1] X Research source If you decide to learn to French kiss with another person, you should be direct and let them know that you want to kiss them for practice, not necessarily because you have feelings for them. You can practice french kissing with your hand, a piece of fruit, or even your imagination. If you’re using your hand, curl it loosely to form the letter “O” which represents your partner’s lips and mouth. If you’re using fruit, bite into a ripe, firm fruit such as a peach or plum to create a small hole that resembles a person’s mouth."

      "content": "Press your mouth softly against your partner’s. You want to start with a soft kiss and test the waters before moving on to a French kiss.

Your lips should fit into theirs—your top lip can either be above their top lip or in between their lips. Your bottom lip, then, would rest in between their lips or below their bottom lip. [3] X Research source If you’re practicing alone, fit your lips gently to your hand or to the piece of fruit."

When practicing alone, experiment with different ways to move your tongue against your hand or the piece of fruit until you find a pattern or method that feels natural."
