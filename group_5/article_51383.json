      "content": "Measure the lengths of the pieces you need. Review the design plan for your project. Identify all the pieces of any particular material type that you need. Determine the length of each separate piece. For example, suppose you are installing a new kitchen countertop. Your plan might require a two-foot length from the wall to the sink, a three-foot length from the end of the sink to the corner, and another two-foot length to wrap around the corner."

      "content": "Add the individual lengths together. To find the total number of linear feet that you need for your project, add together the lengths of the individual parts. Imagine the individual pieces lined up end-to-end and determine the length from one end to the other. In the countertop example, you need three pieces of two feet, three feet, and two feet. Thus, the total number of linear feet of countertop material that you need is 2+3+2=7 feet."

      "title": "Check your project instructions.",
      "content": "Check your project instructions. For some projects, the design plan or instructions may tell you the number of linear feet that you need. For example, suppose you were knitting a sweater. It would be impossible to look at a picture of a sweater and determine the amount of yarn that you need. Somewhere, the instructions should tell you how much yarn to purchase."

      "title": "Convert units if needed.",
      "content": "Convert units if needed. By definition, \"linear feet\" are measured in feet. However, the individual pieces you need may be measured in inches or a combination of feet and inches. It may help first to convert all your measurements to inches, then add them, and convert to feet and inches in your final step. For example, suppose you have three pieces measuring 5'2\", 4'6\" and 3'8\". If you convert each of these to inches, you get 62\", 54\" and 44\". Add them to get a total of 160\". Divide this by 12 inches per foot, and you will get a total of 13 feet, with four inches left over. Thus, the total linear footage is 13 feet, 4 inches."

For example, separate out the different sizes of boards that you plan to use into separate categories. You will need to calculate the amount of material in each category. [1] X Research source As a running example, suppose you are planning to build a bookshelf. The sides of the bookshelf will be made with four 2 x 4 boards, one in each corner. The top, bottom, and three shelves in the middle are made from 1 x 12 boards. In this case, divide the building materials into two categories, 2x4's and 1x12's."

[2] X Research source Take care not to measure the same pieces multiple times. It can be helpful to check off each board on a sketch of your project and label each piece with its length as you go. In the bookshelf example, suppose that the four 2x4s are each eight feet long and that the five 1x12 boards you use for the top, bottom, and shelves are all four feet long."

Add up the lengths of the pieces of each board size. Keep them apart from each other and find a separate total for each style. [3] X Research source In the bookshelf example, since you have four eight-foot long corner pieces made from 2x4 boards and five pieces made from 1x12 boards (three shelves plus the top and bottom), you can calculate totals as follows: 2x4 boards: 8 feet times 4 boards = 32 linear feet 1x12 boards: 4 feet times 5 boards = 20 linear feet"

Find the price of each type of material (per foot) and multiply by the total linear foot value obtained for the type of material to find the approximate cost of the material. [4] X Research source In the bookshelf example, you need 32 feet of 2x4 boards and 20 feet of 1x12 boards. Suppose 2x4s sell for $1.50 per linear foot and 1x12 boards sell for $2.25 per linear foot. In this case, you would determine the costs of these materials by multiplying as follows: 2x4 boards: $1.50 x 32 = $48 1x12 boards: $2.25 x 20 = $45"

Multiply your linear footage by 1.05 (5%) or 1.10 (10%) to find the total you should purchase. [8] X Research source For example, if you calculated a linear footage need of 192 feet, then you should get: 192 ∗ 1.05 = 201.6 feet {\\displaystyle 192*1.05=201.6{\\text{ feet}}} 192 ∗ 1.10 = 211.2 feet {\\displaystyle 192*1.10=211.2{\\text{ feet}}}"

If you plan to do something more creative, like laying the boards along diagonal lines, you are likely to waste more material in the corners making the boards fit. If so, you will need to plan more linear footage."

There is an online calculator based on the number of rooms that you plan to pack and move. edeck.com is a company that sells outdoor deck building materials.

For storing rare manuscripts, you will need to provide the number and size of specialized storage boxes. In any event, read the instructions carefully and provide the information in the units that are expected. Some sites will allow you to select your own measurement units, such as feet or yards. Others are pre-programmed for a particular unit. Read the instructions carefully."
