      "content": "The key is to mean what you say. If you try too hard to compliment a guy, not only will it come off as potentially creepy, it could make it seem like you don’t really mean it. Whenever you’re thinking of a compliment, go with one that you actually think. It’ll seem more natural that way as well. [1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. If you really mean it, he’ll appreciate your compliment and is much less likely to think that it’s creepy. For example, if a guy had a rough day and looks really tired and upset, don’t say, “Wow, you look great!”"
