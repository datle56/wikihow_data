      "content": "Curl your hair. This is not necessary if your hair is already very curly. If your hair is wavy or straight, use a curling iron. Curl small sections of hair at a time. Continue until all of your hair has been curled. You should end up with tightly coiled curls. Choose a curl iron size that allows the hair to wrap at least 1 and ½ times around the barrel. Leave the ends out for a more modern and deconstructed look. It’s also an option to use curlers if you don’t want to use heat on your hair."

      "title": "Brush out your curls.",
      "content": "Brush out your curls. Once you have curled your hair, begin to brush it. It doesn’t matter what type of brush you use. Brushing out the tight curls will give you the “bushy” look Hermione Granger was known for in the first movie. Continue until all of your hair has been brushed out. This works best with thick hair, but you can still accomplish the same effect with thinner hair."

If your hair is thinner, use a comb or teasing brush to tease all of your hair—including the roots and ends. Hold small sections of hair up and brush the back of the hair in quick back-and-forth motions."

If you have side bangs, this is the part of your hair you shouldn’t curl. Otherwise, avoid curling the front right section to represent side bangs. Do not brush your curls out. [2] X Research source If your hair is already very curly, you will need to straighten it first before curling it into loose ringlets."
