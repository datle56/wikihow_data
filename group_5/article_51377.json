      "title": "What is half-life?",
      "content": "What is half-life? The term “half-life” refers to the amount of time that half of the starting substance takes to decay or change. It’s most often used in radioactive decay to figure out when a substance is no longer harmful to humans. [2] X Research source Elements like uranium and plutonium are most often studied with half-life in mind."

      "title": "Does temperature or concentration affect the half-life?",
      "content": "Does temperature or concentration affect the half-life? The short answer is no. While chemical changes are sometimes affected by their environment or concentration, each radioactive isotope has its own unique half-life that isn’t affected by these changes. [3] X Research source Therefore, you can calculate the half-life for a particular element and know for certain how quickly it will break down no matter what."

      "content": "Can half-life be used in carbon dating? Yes! Carbon dating, or figuring out how old something is based on how much carbon it has, is a very practical way to use half-life. Every living thing intakes carbon while it’s alive, so when it dies, it has a certain amount of carbon in its body. The longer it decays, the less carbon is present, which can be used to date the organism based on carbon’s half-life. [4] X Research source Technically, there are 2 types of carbon: carbon-14, which decays, and carbon-12, which stays constant."

      "content": "Understand exponential decay. Exponential decay occurs in a general exponential function f ( x ) = a x , {\\displaystyle f(x)=a^{x},} where | a | < 1. {\\displaystyle |a|<1.} In other words, as x {\\displaystyle x} increases, f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} decreases and approaches zero. This is exactly the type of relationship we want to describe half-life. In this case, we want a = 1 2 , {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {1}{2}},} so that we have the relationship f ( x + 1 ) = 1 2 f ( x ) . {\\displaystyle f(x+1)={\\frac {1}{2}}f(x).}"

      "content": "Rewrite the function in terms of half-life. Of course, our function does not depend on generic variable x , {\\displaystyle x,} but time t . {\\displaystyle t.} [5] X Research source f ( t ) = ( 1 2 ) t {\\displaystyle f(t)=\\left({\\frac {1}{2}}\\right)^{t}} Simply replacing the variable doesn't tell us everything, though. We still have to account for the actual half-life, which is, for our purposes, a constant. We could then add the half-life t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle t_{1/2}} into the exponent, but we need to be careful about how we do this. Another property of exponential functions in physics is that the exponent must be dimensionless. Since we know that the amount of substance depends on time, we must then divide by the half-life, which is measured in units of time as well, to obtain a dimensionless quantity. Doing so also implies that t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle t_{1/2}} and t {\\displaystyle t} be measured in the same units as well. As such, we obtain the function below. f ( t ) = ( 1 2 ) t t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle f(t)=\\left({\\frac {1}{2}}\\right)^{\\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}}"

Of course, our function f ( t ) {\\displaystyle f(t)} as it stands is only a relative function that measures the amount of substance left after a given time as a percentage of the initial amount. All we need to do is to add the initial quantity N 0 . {\\displaystyle N_{0}.} Now, we have the formula for the half-life of a substance.

      "content": "Solve for the half-life. In principle, the above formula describes all the variables we need. But suppose we encountered an unknown radioactive substance. It is easy to directly measure the mass before and after an elapsed time, but not its half-life. So, let's express half-life in terms of the other measured (known) variables. Nothing new is being expressed by doing this; rather, it is a matter of convenience. Below, we walk through the process one step at a time. [7] X Research source Divide both sides by the initial amount N 0 . {\\displaystyle N_{0}.} N ( t ) N 0 = ( 1 2 ) t t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}=\\left({\\frac {1}{2}}\\right)^{\\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}} Take the logarithm, base 1 2 , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}},} of both sides. This brings down the exponent. log 1 / 2 ⁡ ( N ( t ) N 0 ) = t t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle \\log _{1/2}\\left({\\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\\right)={\\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}} Multiply both sides by t 1 / 2 {\\displaystyle t_{1/2}} and divide both sides by the entire left side to solve for half-life. Since there are logarithms in the final expression, you'll probably need a calculator to solve half-life problems. t 1 / 2 = t log 1 / 2 ⁡ ( N ( t ) N 0 ) {\\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\\frac {t}{\\log _{1/2}\\left({\\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\\right)}}}"
