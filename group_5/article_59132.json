      "content": "Try scar-reducing creams and gels. There are many over-the-counter products that claim to reduce the appearance of (or even completely remove) scars. Whether these products will work for you, however, will often depend on the type and severity of your scarring. Though medical professionals are skeptical about the success rates of OTC creams, many people have found products like Mederma to be effective. [1] X Research source Mederma may work to reduce stretch marks and other types of scarring if it is systematically applied 3 to 4 times a day for 6 months. It is thought to work by softening and smoothing scars. Start OTC scar creams as soon as your wound heals.

Vitamin E oil is very moisturizing and contains powerful antioxidants, which helps protect your skin’s cells.

      "content": "Apply lemon juice. Lemon juice is a common home remedy for scar treatment, but this method receives mixed reviews. It's believed to lessen the appearance of scars by acting as a bleaching agent and minimizing redness, but this isn't proven. [9] X Research source This method isn't usually recommended by dermatologists, as it can be harsh and drying, especially for people with sensitive skin. If you do decide to try lemon juice on your scars, cut a small slice of lemon and squeeze the juice directly onto your scars. Leave the lemon juice on for a few hours then rinse off. Do not apply fresh juice more than once a day. If you feel the pure lemon juice is too strong, dilute it with water before applying or mix it with some blended cucumber to limit the harshness of the treatment. Rinse off lemon juice and discontinue use if you notice any skin irritation."

[13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Extra virgin, cold-pressed olive oil, in particular, is believed to produce the best results, as it has a greater quantity of nutrients like vitamins E and K. [14] X Research source Apply a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil to the affected area and massage using small circular motions until the oil is absorbed. You can also use the olive oil as an exfoliating scrub by mixing it with a teaspoon of baking soda, which you can massage into the scars before rinsing off with warm water. A custom, nourishing oil blend can also be effective. Combine two parts olive oil with one part rosehip, chamomile, or calendula oil and apply to the skin."

[15] X Research source To use, peel a cucumber, chop it roughly, and blend it in a food processor until it achieves a paste-like consistency. Apply a light layer of this paste to the scarred skin and leave it on overnight, or apply a thicker layer and wash it off after 20 minutes. Keep the remaining cucumber paste covered in the fridge for several days. Continue to apply it to the affected area each night. You can increase the effectiveness of this treatment by mixing the cucumber paste with some of the aforementioned products, such as lemon juice, olive oil or aloe vera."

[21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It works by burning away the scar tissue, allowing new skin to grow and replace the scarred surface. The area is numbed before the procedure, so the treatment isn't particularly painful. The laser can also pinpoint the scar precisely, so the surrounding skin remains unaffected. [22] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. Laser treatment should only be received at a reputable clinic with a well-trained staff, as lasers can be dangerous if used incorrectly. You may need to return to the clinic for a series of treatments to fully remove the scar. The downside of this option is that laser treatment can be expensive, ranging from $1000 to $5000, depending on the size and depth of the scar."

Larger keloids are sometimes sliced or frozen off before the steroids are used. Steroid treatment is a process rather than a one-off procedure, so you’ll need to return to the clinic every 2-3 weeks to receive another injection. This treatment has a high rate of success, but is relatively costly and may cause skin discoloration or thinning.

[25] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Collagen is a natural animal protein, which is injected into the skin with a fine needle, thus filling in the indented scars. Though effective, the results are not permanent, as the body absorbs the natural collagen. You'll need to get the scar refilled after about four months. Each collagen injection costs approximately $250, so this route for scar treatment can be costly. You will need to have a skin test done before you receive any collagen injections, to ensure that you will not have an allergic reaction to the treatment."
