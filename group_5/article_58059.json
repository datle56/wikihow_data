If your MacBook screen suddenly gets orange spots on the screen, it is most likely a display defect caused by storing your MacBook at high temperatures or by putting pressure on certain parts of the MacBook screen. While heat and pressure are the most likely culprits for these orange spots, anything that could exacerbate a problem with the layers of your laptop's screen could be causing the spots."

There are three ways to repair the screen on your MacBook, which are detailed below: Bring it to Apple. If you still have a warranty on your MacBook, this is the best method, as the repair will likely be covered. Contact Apple to make a service appointment, or bring your computer to the Genius Bar. If you're not under warranty anymore, you can still go to Apple, but you'll have to pay out of pocket. Contact a third-party repair service. Many independent repair providers fix MacBook displays. To find an Apple-approved repair service in your area, go to Apple's Repair Provider Search . Using an independent repair provider will void any active warranty on your laptop, but the repair service may offer you their own warranty. Replace the screen yourself. If you're experienced with repairing computers, you can replace the display yourself. Go to Apple's Self Service Repair page to find the parts you need, and use this wikiHow article to learn how to replace a laptop screen yourself.
