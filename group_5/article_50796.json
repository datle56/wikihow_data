      "content": "You can stay out as late as you want without checking in. If you want to take the day off and head to the beach, you can!

[1] X Research source It’s always good to tell at least one person where you’re going, especially if you’re alone.

      "content": "It can be as clean or as messy as you want it to be. If you hate dishes stacked in the sink, take it upon yourself to clean them early. Or, if you don’t mind a bit of clutter, leave the house a bit messier. It’s up to you to decide how you decorate and exist in your space. [2] X Research source Plus, when you’re single, you can probably get a smaller place (and a smaller place means less cleaning for you!)."

      "content": "Focus on propelling yourself forward into new opportunities. You don’t have to be a workaholic, but you can take advantage of the fact that no one’s going to be mad if you get home late.

      "content": "You don’t need to be in a relationship to have strong connections. Focus on bonding with the friends you already have and making new friends to feel fulfilled. Go out to dinner, have a fun weekend with friends, and work on fostering strong relationships with people that you love. [9] X Research source Focusing on your friendships can help distract you from the desire to have a partner. If you hang out with cool people that you love, you’re less likely to feel lonely.
