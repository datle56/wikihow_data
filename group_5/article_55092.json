      "content": "Turn off your phone right away. No matter how water resistant your phone is, power it down immediately when it gets wet. Don't be tempted to turn your phone back on until you've thoroughly dried the charging port, headphone jack, and other components. [1] X Research source If there is anything plugged into your phone when the charging port is wet, such as a charging cable or battery-extending case, remove that as well. If your entire phone is wet (not just the charging port), remove the SIM card tray , SIM card, and any external memory cards. If you're using an Android with a removable battery, remove that too."

Microfiber is a great material for this, as it's highly absorbent and dries quickly. Continue wiping until you've removed all of the water that you can. [2] X Research source"

Make sure the charging port is facing down before you tap the phone on your hand—if the port is facing up, water can run deeper into your phone. Continue tapping your phone on your hand until you're sure all excess water has dripped out. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow the phone air dry in a well-ventilated area. The best way to get water out of the charging port is to let it evaporate naturally. Air circulation will dry the port faster, so let the phone dry in a room with fans, a dehumidifier , or any other moving air source. [4] X Research source If you don't have a fan, you can also try drying the charging port near an electrical appliance that has an exhaust vent, such as behind your computer or TV. Just avoid very hot airflow—never use a blow dryer or place the phone too close to a heater. Keep the charging port facing down while your phone dries, if possible."

      "content": "Allow the phone to dry for at least 5 hours before turning it back on. Apple recommends allowing your phone to dry for 5 hours before turning it back on or connecting a charging cable to the Lightning port. [5] X Research source The recommendations for Android models vary, but waiting at least 5 hours should be long enough for the charging port in any phone to completely dry. Don't turn your phone on any sooner to avoid damaging your phone. Once the charging port has dried long enough, turn on the phone and watch for a \"Liquid Detected\" alert. If you see this alert, turn off the phone again, and wait another few hours for it to dry. Do not select \"Emergency Override\" to allow your wet phone to charge because this will damage your phone. If your phone was submerged, there may be more water that you can't see. Continue drying the phone for 24-48 hours for stubborn cases."

If there is still water in the charging port, there are a few other tricks you can try: [6] X Research source If the phone is taking too long to dry, set some bags of silica gel around the base of your phone to absorb excess moisture. You can also place the phone in a sealable bag with a few silica packets (after letting the phone air dry) to absorb more moisture. Use a can of compressed air to blow out remaining water from the charging port. Spray in gentle, short bursts, and only once or twice, from several inches away."

[8] X Research source Plus, the dust from the rice or particles from the rice could get into the charging port and other openings and cause damage. Instead, use silica gel packets. The loose silica particles are contained in a bag, which prevents tiny pieces of the substance from getting inside your phone and damaging it."
