      "content": "Answer: 1 ⅛ cups or 1 cup + 2 tablespoons. Half of 2 ¼ cups is 1 cup and ⅛ cup. If you don’t have a ⅛ cup, 2 tablespoons is equal to ⅛ cup. To halve 2 ¼ cups, divide the whole number and fraction by 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1. ¼ ÷ 2 = ¼ × ½ = ⅛. Another way to halve 2 ¼ cups is to convert it to a fraction, then divide by 2. 2 = 8/4. 8/4 + ¼ = 9/4. 9/4 ÷ 2 = 9/4 × ½ = 9/8. 9/8 as a mixed fraction is 8/8 + ⅛, or 1 ⅛."

Below are some common measurements cut in half: [1] X Research source Half of 1 cup is ½ cup. Half of ¾ cups is ⅜ cups or 6 tablespoons. Half of ⅔ cups is ⅓ cup. Half of ½ cup is ¼ cup. Half of ⅓ cup is ⅙ cup or 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons. Half of ¼ cup is ⅛ cup or 2 tablespoons. Half of 1 tablespoon is ½ tablespoon or 1 ½ teaspoons. Half of 1 teaspoon is ½ teaspoon. Half of ½ teaspoon is ¼ teaspoon. Half of ¼ teaspoon is ⅛ teaspoon. Half of ⅛ teaspoon is a dash."

Below are some common conversions: [2] X Research source 1 cup is equal to 16 tablespoons. ¾ cup is equal to 12 tablespoons. ½ cup is equal to 8 tablespoons. ⅓ cup is equal to 5 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon. ¼ cup is equal to 4 tablespoons. ⅛ cup is equal to 2 tablespoons. 1 tablespoon is equal to 3 teaspoons."

It also makes halving a recipe easier by cutting out the need to convert cup, tablespoon, and teaspoon measurements. [4] X Research source For example, a recipe might call for 224 grams of sugar. It’s much easier to divide 224 grams by 2 to get 112 grams of sugar for your halved recipe."

      "content": "Use a smaller pot or pan. When you halve a recipe, you typically need to use smaller cookware and bakeware than you use for the normal recipe. This helps ensure that your dish comes out right. [5] X Research source For example, if you bake a halved recipe of brownies in a pan that fits the whole amount, they might come out crunchy and flat."

      "content": "Use dry and liquid measuring cups for dry and wet ingredients. Dry and liquid ingredients have different properties, so ensure your halved measurements are as accurate as possible by using the proper tools. Measure dry ingredients (like flour and sugar) with dry measuring cups and liquid ingredients (like oil and milk) with liquid measuring cups . [6] X Research source Dry ingredients can be loosely or tightly packed into measuring cups, which affects their volume. Follow the recipe’s instructions for how to measure the ingredients. Liquid ingredients have the same volume no matter how you pour them or what you put them in. However, using liquid measuring cups with ounce and milliliter measurements makes your conversions more precise. Using a kitchen scale can help make your dry and liquid ingredient measurements more precise and accurate."

This is especially important when halving the measurements for spices, as you might find that your recipe tastes bland when you cut the spices in half.

Mix the egg white and yolk together with a whisk or fork. Then, pour half of the whisked egg into your recipe. [8] X Research source Most large eggs measure about ¼ cup (59 ml) when cracked and whisked. So, half an egg is usually about ⅛ cup or 2 tablespoons (30 ml). Alternatively, weigh the whisked egg using a kitchen scale. Then, divide the weight in half to get a more precise measurement for half an egg."

If you don’t have the proper measuring cups and spoons, or you’re on a time crunch, simply fill the cup or spoon in half with the ingredients. For instance, if a recipe calls for ¼ cup of flour, simply fill half of the ¼ cup with flour. Using this method doesn’t give you the most accurate results, so try to use the proper measuring cups and spoons when you can. This is especially important when baking, as it requires more precise measurements than cooking."

Just keep the temperature the same to ensure the dish cooks all the way through.
