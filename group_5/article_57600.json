      "content": "Collect 8 Sticks and 1 Leather. Item Frames only require Sticks and Leather, and they are both common materials that you can find at the start of any Minecraft game. [1] X Research source To find Sticks, try breaking apart leaves on trees to see if any Sticks drop. Alternatively, hit the tree trunks until they break into logs. Open the crafting menu and place the logs in a single space to create planks. Then, place 2 planks in a single column to create 4 Sticks. To find Leather, try attacking cows, horses, donkeys, mules, or llamas. You may also find leather in random chests throughout a village, especially if the building has cauldrons outside.

      "content": "Trade Emeralds with a Cartographer villager for an Item Frame. Minecraft Specialist Zac Churchill says that “you can exchange materials that you find throughout the game for many different items depending on the specialization of the villager.” Look for the Cartographer villager with a monocle and talk with them. You will have the option to trade 7 Emeralds for 1 Item Frame. [4] X Research source If the Cartographer villager doesn’t have an Item Frame for trade yet, make different trades to increase the villager’s level. When the level increases, more trade options unlock in the menu. Churchill adds that you’ll find chests filled with random items all around a village, so there may be a chance to find Item Frames."
