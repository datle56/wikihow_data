      "content": "Locate the midpoint right above your Adam’s apple. Place two fingers above your Adam’s apple, right below your chin. This will help you locate point C, the midpoint between point A and B. [4] X Research source The midpoint is typically 1 to 1.5 in (2.5 to 3.8 cm) above the Adam’s apple, right between your head and neck. Trimming your neckline higher than this might give you a “chinstrap” look instead of a full beard."

      "title": "Shave outwards from point C along your natural neckline.",
      "content": "Shave outwards from point C along your natural neckline. First, shave straight downward above your Adam’s apple to clean up the very center of your neckline. Then, starting at the freshly shaved midpoint, work outward (to the right or left) and start eliminating all of the hair below the jawline. Remember to follow the line that runs from point A to point B to avoid creating an overly rounded line (it should curve gently and slightly upward as it wraps around your neck). [5] X Research source Aim to make both sides of your neckline as symmetrical as possible. Once you have one side cleaned up, repeat the exact same movements on the other side. Styling tip: Use a handheld mirror along with your bathroom mirror to see how your neckline looks from the side (your profile) and make adjustments as needed to get the shape and symmetry you want."

      "content": "Round off the intersection where the sideburn and neck line meet. Imagine another line that goes straight down from your sideburn. It should start at the back edge of your sideburn (the part closest to your ear) and go straight down to meet your jawline to bisect the ear-to-ear line. Use the trimmers to round the intersection off on both sides. [6] X Research source Styling tip: If you have a rounder face, leave the corners a bit sharper and more defined to create a stronger, straighter jawline. [7] X Research source If you have naturally angular features, rounding them off can soften your overall look."

      "content": "Try fading your neckline for a less defined, more natural look (optional). Grab your clippers and choose a guard one size down from your beard length (for example, if you trim your beard to a #4, put on a #3). Trim upward into your neckline about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to create a subtle grade. Then, switch guards to go another size down (to a #2, for example), and go over half of the space you just trimmed (about ½ inch (1.3 cm)). [8] X Research source Repeat this process a third time, going down one more guard size and trimming half of the previous beard space (so about ¼ inch (0.6 cm) this time). Continue this process until you’re at a #0 (or the bare teeth of the clipper) right at your neckline."

If your hair grows very fast, you may even need to do this daily. For a more natural look, you can do it every three or four days. Styling tip: If you’re growing a super long beard, you can stop trimming your neckline once your beard is big enough to cover it up. No one will see it anyway! [9] X Research source"

Identify specific points for A and B; don't generalize. [10] X Research source Like with your neckline, use a white eyeliner pencil or barber’s pencil to draw the line if you have a hard time visualizing it. Styling tip: If your cheek hair is thin or sparse, don’t worry too much about creating a clearly defined line.

For a softer, more natural line, round off the edges at the point where the beard meets your sideburn, and again at the point where it meets the edge of your mustache. [13] X Research source Styling tip: Rounding the corners will help soften your face if you have naturally angular or sharp features.

Make the sides as even as you can, but don’t stress over absolute perfection. [14] X Research source In general, symmetrical faces are perceived as highly attractive across many cultures.
