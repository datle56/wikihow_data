      "content": "Cut the plastic tip off the end of a tube of powdered graphite . If your lock is so sticky that you can barely get your key in and out, you may need something as tough as powdered graphite, which comes in a tube. Snip the plastic off the end of the nozzle with a sharp pair of scissors so the graphite can flow freely. [1] X Research source Powdered graphite is a dry lubricant that encourages smooth movement between two metal surfaces without attracting grime. The graphite particles form a fine layer on the surface of the metal, lubricating and \"brushing\" away dust and dirt. In a pinch, you can rub a graphite pencil against the surface of the lock."

      "title": "Place the end of the nozzle up to the opening of the lock.",
      "content": "Place the end of the nozzle up to the opening of the lock. Depending on the bottle size, you can fit the nozzle part of the way inside the opening. If not, hold it flush to the lock. It should still be able to penetrate deep enough to lubricate the locking mechanism. [2] X Research source Hold the tube level so that graphite doesn't escape around the opening."

      "content": "Squeeze the bottle or tube gently to release a few puffs of graphite. Try not to use an excessive amountâ€”graphite is a potent substance, so a little goes a long way. Wait 1-2 minutes so the graphite can start working its magic on the lock. [3] X Research source If possible, wear a pair of disposable gloves to avoid getting graphite all over your hands."

      "content": "Test the lock by inserting and removing your key once or twice. It should be easy to get the key in and out of the lock now. Turn the key in both directions to see how fluidly it moves. [4] X Research source Sliding your key in and out of the lock also helps spread the graphite inside the lock."

    {
      "title": "Repeat the application as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat the application as needed. If the lock still feels sticky, hit it again with a few more blasts of powdered graphite. Test the lock after each application. Once the graphite has spread, it will clear away the gunk hindering the lock's movement, leaving you with a fully functioning, hassle-free door. Try squeezing a little graphite onto the door's latch for especially stubborn locks. This is the part of the locking mechanism that moves in and out of the door frame when you turn the knob. Lubricating the latch can help ease the keying action. [5] X Research source If you still need help, call a professional locksmith to look at your locks. Sometimes, the problem is with the pins inside the lock slipping down and loosening, which can't be fixed with lubricant."

Expert Home Specialist Ryaan Tuttle suggests using the thin, flexible red applicator straw that fits right over the nozzle where the oil comes out. The straw will allow you to penetrate deep into the lock, lubricating it more effectively. [6] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. While WD-40 is a common household item that can be used on nearly everything, it's not recommended for long-term use. It's effective for a quick fix, but dust and debris can still stick to the surface. [7] X Research source WD-40 Dry Lube PTFE Spray is dust and dirt-resistant and has long-lasting corrosion protection. Avoid using any lubricants that aren't appropriate for home improvement uses, such as cooking, botanical, or sewing machine oil. Most oils will attract dust that forms new layers on the locking mechanism, worsening the problem. [8] X Research source"
