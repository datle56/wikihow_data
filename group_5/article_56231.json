This site doesn’t actually give out money—rather, they facilitate the payout by partnering with lots of different third-party brand deals, which often require upfront payments on your end. [1] X Research source To qualify for the Shein credit, you need to complete a certain amount of deals on the website. A lot of the time, those deals require you to pay your own money—jump to the next section for more detail on what those deals might look like. [2] X Research source The Flash Rewards terms of service often require you to give the company permission to pass along your data to third-party companies that they partner with.

Agreeing to this T&C may cause you to get spam messages/offers from different companies, which can be really frustrating to deal with. Unfortunately, agreeing to this T&C is typically non-negotiable, so you’ll have to weigh the pros and cons of agreeing to it for yourself. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Complete the required number of deals to qualify for the reward. Flash Rewards provides you with different “levels” of offers to complete; the higher the reward you’re angling for, the more higher-tier deals you’ll have to participate in. These deals often require you to either pay a small amount of money and/or sign up for a subscription service, which can trap you into further long-term payments if you don’t remember to cancel. [8] X Research source Users have reported some Flash Rewards deals being less than $10 per deal, or even being free of charge. However, even cheap deals can start to add up over time, and the “free” deals may require you to sign up for an expensive subscription service that will cost you money later (if you don't remember to cancel it). Other deals may also involve a long waiting period before they’re considered “complete” (like 60 days). Deals may include buying lottery tickets, signing up for betting services, signing up for streaming services (like Disney+), and so on. Other deals may require you to sign up for subscription services that come with a free product (e.g., getting a free snack box for signing up for a subscription snack service). Keep in mind that you have to complete the requirements of your deals within a fairly short time period (as specified by the terms and conditions). For instance, you can’t complete a deal, wait two months, and then complete more deals toward your $750 Shein credit. While Flash Rewards doesn’t appear to have any advanced security risks, their data distribution policy leaves a lot to be desired. Even if it’s not genuine spam (emails/texts promoting scams/malware), receiving huge volumes of marketing correspondence can feel very spam-like and overwhelming."
