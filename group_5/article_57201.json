      "title": "Dry your body.",
      "content": "Dry your body. After getting out of the shower, quickly dry yourself by rubbing the towel on the very wet areas of your body. These areas include but aren't limited to your hair, torso, and arms. You want to be moderately dry before wrapping a towel around you, so you can actively do things and move around without tracking water all over the place."

      "title": "Select your towel.",
      "content": "Select your towel. Use a bath towel large enough to completely cover and wrap around your body. A typical-sized towel should be appropriate for most individuals, but for larger individuals, you might want to consider using a larger towel or a beach towel. Women will most likely want to use a towel long enough to cover them from their upper chest to their mid thighs. Men may prefer to use a towel long enough to cover the area from their waist down to their knees."

      "title": "Position your towel.",
      "content": "Position your towel. Hold the towel horizontally, grasping the two top corners with your right and left hand. Place the towel behind you, around your back. The two ends of the towel should now be in front of you, while the middle portion of the towel is pressed against your back. Women should have the towel positioned higher on their back, so the horizontal top edge of the towel is at the height of their armpits. Men should have the towel positioned lower, at their waist, so the horizontal top edge of the towel is just above their buttocks."

      "title": "Wrap the towel around your body.",
      "content": "Wrap the towel around your body. Using either your left or right hand (it doesn't matter which hand you use), bring one corner of the towel across the front of your body to the opposite side. For example, bring the left corner of the towel across the front of your body to the right side. Make sure the towel is tightly pulled across your body. Hold this corner in position with your hand. Then, while your hand is holding the first corner of the towel, bring the other corner of the towel across the front of your body to the opposite side. [1] X Research source For women, this wrapping will be across your chest, above your bust and parallel with your armpits. For men, this wrapping will be across your waist, parallel with your hips."

    {
      "title": "Secure the towel wrap.",
      "content": "Secure the towel wrap. Once both corners are brought to the opposite side of your body, tuck the second corner into the top horizontal edge of the towel wrapping, fitting the corner between your body and the towel. Try tucking in a large enough portion of the towel corner so the towel is more secure. The more taut the original towel wrapping is, the more secure your towel wrap will be. Consider twisting the second corner and tucking the twisted portion into the top edge of the towel. This twisted portion may secure the towel even further. If the towel keeps coming undone, consider using a safety pin to keep the corner of the towel tightly tucked and in place."
