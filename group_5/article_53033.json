      "content": "Totally, there's nothing wrong with feeling weird about your boyfriend balding. Attraction is a complicated thing, but the one thing we know for sure is that it’s subjective and uncontrollable. You don’t get to choose what you’re attracted to, so you have nothing to feel guilty about. Don’t beat yourself up if you aren’t all that happy about your man balding. [1] X Research source It’s possible that you’re simply not used to the lack of hair on your boyfriend’s head. Even if you feel a little iffy on it now, you might wake up a week or two from now and feel better about his balding."

      "title": "There is no “correct” way to feel about your boyfriend balding.",
      "content": "There is no “correct” way to feel about your boyfriend balding. Some people really couldn’t care less about their boyfriend’s hair. Other people care a lot. Both are equally valid and reasonable ways to feel. You don’t have control how you feel about the way your partner looks, so don’t pretend that you need to feel a certain way. [2] X Research source While it is true that you have nothing to feel bad about, your boyfriend doesn’t either. He has no control over this, so try not to take your frustration out on him."

      "title": "Meditate on why you dislike your boyfriend losing his hair.",
      "content": "Meditate on why you dislike your boyfriend losing his hair. It may not even be the balding that’s bothering you. It could be what balding means. People start to bald as they get older. You may be upset that the two of you aren’t as young as you used to be, or mourning the lack of adventure that growing old represents. Think about why you feel the way you do here—it may give you some great insight. [3] X Research source If your dad was bald, you might find yourself a little turned off by the idea that you and your boyfriend are “turning into” your parents. That’s a pretty common fear, actually.

      "title": "Many men get insecure and upset when they start balding.",
      "content": "Many men get insecure and upset when they start balding. When a man starts balding, it can feel like he’s losing a part of what makes him, him . It can also be a signal that he’s getting old, or that he’s even getting closer to the grave. All kinds of crazy thoughts can go through his head, and it’s normal for him to feel anxious or scared when he starts balding. [5] X Research source He may also be concerned that women and/or men won’t find him attractive anymore, either. There’s a lot of stigma surrounding bald men in our culture. TV and movies often depict bald men as dumpy, unattractive, or uncool. All of this can make balding scary for a guy."

      "content": "Some men have no problem going bald and embrace the change. A lot of fellas out there aren’t all that invested in their hair. Many men had dads or grandfathers who went (or always were) bald. If he already knows that balding is genetic, he may have been expecting this. If he has already had time to emotionally prepare, this may not be a big deal. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Help him find a hairstyle that works for him. If he asks you what he should do and you think a new hairstyle would improve the overall vibe, help him pick something new! If you have a sense for what might work, recommend it. Alternatively, you could go to a hairdresser with him and ask a pro what they think would work. It’s totally possible that a fresh look solves any concerns you’ve got! [7] X Research source Don’t ask him to change his hair if he’s happy with the way he looks. Generally speaking, it’s tough to make long hair work when you’re balding. If your boyfriend is rocking a longer style, going short may solve things! You might recommend he grows out his facial hair. Balding guys often look really good with a beard, goatee, or moustache. Buzz cuts, crew cuts, slicked-back hair, and quiffs with a side cut can all look super sharp on a guy who’s balding.

      "content": "Encourage him to shave his hair to embrace the bald look. A balding guy might not be your jam, but a bald guy? They might do it for you. There are plenty of attractive bald fellas out there, and your boyfriend might be one of them. If he mentions not loving his balding hair, ask him if he’d be interested in shaving. The thought may not have even crossed his mind, and it might work for him! [9] X Research source If he’s got his doubts about this, it might be due to the fact that he’s losing hair already and he’s scared of losing more. Remind him that what’s left will grow back if he hates it, and you think bald guys are hot."

      "content": "Let him know there’s nothing wrong with getting a toupee . We know what you’re picturing right now—a shlocky guy with a pot belly and a terrible toupee. Trust us, toupee technology has come a long way. Reach out to a hair replacement pro near you or online. They’ll have your boyfriend looking brand new in no time. [10] X Research source Technically, a toupee only covers a bald spot. Wigs cover your whole head. If he wants to keep his hair, your man needs to look for a toupee. If he’s down to shave it off, he’ll need a wig. You can theoretically just buy a wig or toupee online, but it’s not going to look particularly good. Working with a pro who crafts or installs wigs/toupees will seriously make a world of difference."

It may not be the baldness bothering you, but his reaction to it. If he were more confident and he owned the fact that he was balding, both of you could move on. If the hair isn’t a problem for you and you’re mainly bothered by your boyfriend’s reaction, keeping his spirits up may just help him move past this. [11] X Research source Laugh at his jokes, don’t bring up his balding hair situation, and kiss/hug him regularly. He’ll get over the funk and go back to his old confident self in no time."

If the problem is minor and it looks like your boyfriend won’t be losing his full head of hair any time soon, he can always just solve the problem. Rogaine (minoxidil) is actually highly effective at helping hair regrow.

If you act like a brand-new person, he may get the feeling like you’re putting on a show. He knows he’s balding. You know he’s balding. If you oversell it with the love and affection, it won’t feel genuine. A little bit of normalcy goes a long way. [15] X Research source If you treat him the same way you normally do, it’ll go a long way towards sending the message that balding isn’t the end of the world. This might seem like a catastrophe to him, and if you treat him differently it may reinforce that feeling."

If you are, and he asks you, tell him the truth in the kindest way possible. Acknowledge what’s going on, tell him you still like him, and offer to help him solve the problem in whatever way he wants. [16] X Research source If he asks you what you think about his balding, you might say: “I’m going to miss your hair, but it’s natural. I think it’ll look a lot better if you alter your hairstyle a bit, but you’re still a cutie pie.” “The bald look will suit you. This in-between thing may not be my favorite look of all time if I’m being totally honest, but I’m sure I’ll get used to it!” “I’ve never dated a balding guy before, so this is really new to me. I think I’m not a fan? I’m not really sure yet.”"

You fell for this guy for a variety of reasons, but a great head of hair probably wasn’t in the top 5, right? Remind yourself why you dated this guy in the first place. If you can put a less-than-ideal hairstyle into context, it may not seem so bad. [17] X Research source"

While men losing hair may not be your favorite thing about the gender, it’s something you’re probably just going to have to live with. Roughly 70% of men lose hair as they age, and 50% of guys have lost some hair by 50. Knowing that this is a part of life may make it easier for you to cope with.

You might think it’s kind of wrong to break up with someone just because they’re losing their hair, and maybe it is a little bit of a superficial reason to end a relationship, but what’s the alternative? Pretend that you’re into someone you aren’t interested in? That seems kind of unfair to both you and your partner. If this is a dealbreaker for you, it’s okay. Everybody has their quirks, needs, and preferences in a partner. [20] X Research source If some thinning hair is enough to make you want to cut the cord and run, know that the fact that this was never going to work in the first place. Respect everyone’s time by moving on now, even if it hurts."
