Take a strand of 1 color in your lanyard and wrap it around the strand on the opposite side that is the same color as it. For example, if your 2 colors are black and green, hold 1 green strand in your hand and wrap it around the other green strand that is on the opposite side. [2] X Research source If you are using more than 2 colors, wrap 1 strand around another that is on the opposite side of it."

This will secure your strand in a kind of small knot. [3] X Research source You don’t have to pull this knot tight yet. Keep it loose so you can work with the other strands."

You may have to pull each strand 1 at a time until they are tight. [7] X Research source Make sure your knot is tight enough that the strands won’t fall apart, but not so tight that it makes your lanyard pucker or warp."

Once you see the material turn shiny and cover the frayed ends of your cut lanyard, you can take the flame off of it. [15] X Research source Don’t hold the lighter on your lanyard for too long, or it may catch fire. If it does, quickly run it under water to douse the flames. Keep your lanyard end towards the bottom of your lighter flame, where the fire isn’t as hot."
