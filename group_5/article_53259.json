      "title": "Identify attention-seeking behaviors.",
      "content": "Identify attention-seeking behaviors. A person with histrionic personality disorder may dress or act in certain ways as a means to gain attention. For example, they may dress in an overly seductive way, or wear outrageous clothes or costumes as a way to seek attention. These people may attend events or social situations in which they can easily be the center of attention. Often, the behavior may be interpreted as inappropriate, over-the-top, or overly seductive. [2] X Research source Behavior may be overly theatrical or purposefully flamboyant as a way to get people’s attention. For example, a woman guest may wear a wedding dress to another woman’s wedding, or a man may show up in an animal costume to a formal event. Someone with HPD may frequently dress inappropriately or in an attention-getting way, like by wearing revealing or seductive clothing to work, or putting on lots of jewelry or makeup. These people are often considered the “life of the party.” They may be viewed as charming or charismatic."

      "content": "Recognize an overly dramatic response to problems. A person with histrionic personality disorder may respond to minor problems as if they are major or life-threatening. Instead of finding solutions, this person may exaggerate the severity of the problem or create other problems where they do not exist. Even minor problems provide the opportunity to create drama, which allows the person to draw more attention to themselves. [3] X Research source For example, a person may date someone for one week and when the relationship does not work out, they may threaten suicide. Instead of taking responsibility, the person may blame other people or external factors for their own problems.For example, if the person’s business fails due to negligence and poor decision making, they may blame staff, location, bad customers, or other external factors. The person's behavior or reactions may be so intense or attention-grabbing that it may frighten, embarrass, or otherwise put off the people around them."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The person may appear more concerned with expressing the opinion than supporting it. For example, the person may have very strong and controversial beliefs, such as saying that all countries should be communist or that having children should be regulated by the government. When asked why, they may not give a direct answer or provide any reasons for these beliefs. They may inject themselves into conversations with a strong, opinionated statement - such as suddenly interrupting a meeting at work to say that the current project will make the company will go bankrupt."

However, there is usually no desire to be the center of attention. For instance, someone with illness anxiety disorder (hypochondria) may frequently go to the doctor over little things, but this is because they genuinely think they're sick, not to get attention. Anxiety can often co-occur with histrionic personality disorder."
