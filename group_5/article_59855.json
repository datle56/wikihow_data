      "title": "Run hot water over the outer glass.",
      "content": "Run hot water over the outer glass. Glass expands when it’s hot, so heating the outer glass can give you room to wiggle out the inner glass. Mixology expert Yasmin Rosales recommends turning your faucet to hot water and holding the outer glass under the water for several seconds to 1 minute. Then, gently twist and pull the inner glass out. Dry the glasses before you pull them apart so you have a better grip. Wear gloves and eye goggles to protect yourself as you pull apart the glasses, as the glass can potentially shatter. Warning : Do not use boiling or very hot water to heat the glass. The sudden change in temperature can cause one or both glasses to shatter. [1] X Research source The glass is also under pressure, which can increase the risk of cracking. Glasses often get stuck when you stack them immediately after washing. The hot glasses expand and then contract as they cool, causing them to stick together."

      "title": "Heat the outer glass as you cool the inner glass as an alternative.",
      "content": "Heat the outer glass as you cool the inner glass as an alternative. If just heating the outer glass doesn’t work, use cold ice to contract the inner glass. Fill a bowl with warm water to about where the 2 glasses overlap. Then, fill the inner glass with ice and place the glasses in the bowl. Wait a few minutes for the glasses to heat and cool and then pull them apart. [2] X Research source Warning : Do not use hot or boiling water. The extreme temperatures can shock the glasses and cause them to shatter. [3] X Research source If the glasses won't separate, let them sit in the water for longer to give them more time to expand and contract."

      "title": "Run the glasses through your dishwasher as another option.",
      "content": "Run the glasses through your dishwasher as another option. Hot, moist air can cause glasses to get stuck together, but it can also help them get unstuck. Simply put the glasses in your dishwasher and run a normal cycle. Then, pull them out while they’re still hot and steamy and wiggle them apart. If your glasses aren’t dishwasher safe , bring a pot of water to a simmer. Place a mesh sieve or strainer over the pot and set the glasses on top. Then, put a bowl over the glasses and allow them to steam. After a few minutes, twist the glasses apart. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Tilt and twist the glasses apart.",
      "content": "Tilt and twist the glasses apart. Most glasses aren’t perfectly round, so the inner glass may only be \"pinched\" between two points in the outer glass. Tilt the glasses to the side and look for any movement—this is a good sign. Then, gently wiggle and twist the glasses apart. Put on gloves and eye protection to keep yourself safe in case the glass breaks and shatters. Do not use a lot of force when twisting and pulling the glasses. This can potentially shatter them or cause you to lose your grip."

      "title": "Tap the outer glass with your hand as an alternative.",
      "content": "Tap the outer glass with your hand as an alternative. If you can’t twist the glasses apart, set them on a sturdy surface. Then, use the heel of your hand to firmly tap the outer glass where the 2 cups are connected. Repeat as needed until the inner glass loosens and you can pull the cups apart. This is a similar method to how bartenders separate a cocktail shaker from a glass. [5] X Research source Variation : Hold the glasses upside down and tap the edge of the outer glass with your hand or against the side of a table."

      "title": "Roll the glasses as another option.",
      "content": "Roll the glasses as another option. Vibrating the glasses can help jostle them apart. Simply lay the glasses on their sides on a flat, stable surface. Then, carefully roll them back and forth until the inner glass feels loose and you can separate the glasses."

    {
      "title": "Leave the glasses upside down as another alternative.",
      "content": "Leave the glasses upside down as another alternative. Let gravity do its job and help separate the inner glass from the outer glass. Simply set the cups upside down on a table and leave them for several hours or overnight. Then, carefully wiggle and twist the glasses apart. If the inner glass still doesn’t feel loose after several hours, keep the cups upside down for a few days. Variation : Use a clamp to hang the glasses a little bit above your table or counter. Just set a few towels or a pillow under the glasses to catch the inner one if it falls."

    {
      "title": "Blow compressed air between the glasses for another option.",
      "content": "Blow compressed air between the glasses for another option. Trapped air can cause the glasses to stick together, so adding air can release the pressure. Insert the tip of a can of compressed air between the glasses and give it a few squeezes. Keep moving the compressed air around the glasses until the inner one loosens and you can pull it away. Variation : Insert a thin straw between the 2 glasses and blow into it. Keep blowing until the inner cup loosens. [6] X Research source Variation : Aim a hair dryer between the glasses to add air and help loosen the inner and outer cups."

      "title": "Pour cooking oil between the glasses.",
      "content": "Pour cooking oil between the glasses. Oil is a natural lubricant that helps reduce friction between 2 parts, so it can help the glasses get unstuck. Simply pour olive, vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil between the 2 glasses, making sure you cover the entire circumference. Wait a few minutes for the oil to seep between the glasses, then gently twist and wiggle them apart. [7] X Research source Don't try to pull the glasses straight apart. The force needed to grip the glass could break the glass itself. Using oil is especially effective if the glasses are \"pinched\" together rather than suctioned together. Use the oil method in conjunction with the heating method. This can help you loosen especially stubborn glasses."

      "content": "Drizzle dish soap between the 2 glasses as an alternative. Dish soap can also act as a lubricant to help unstick the glasses. Simply pour the soap around the rim connecting the outer glass to the inner. Let the soap coat the glasses and then gently twist and wiggle them apart."

      "title": "Spray WD-40 between the glasses as another option.",
      "content": "Spray WD-40 between the glasses as another option. WD-40 is a mechanical lubricant that helps unstick parts and help them work smoothly. To help it unstick the glasses, spray the solution between the cups. Allow the lubricant to spread and then twist and pull the glasses away from each other. [8] X Research source Wash the glasses thoroughly with hot water and dish soap. WD-40 can cause upset stomach, nausea, and diarrhea if it’s swallowed. [9] X Research source"
