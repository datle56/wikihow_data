      "title": "Your butt muscles are more likely to cramp if you sit a lot.",
      "content": "Your butt muscles are more likely to cramp if you sit a lot. If you spend long parts of your day sitting at a desk for work or school, find excuses to stand up more often. Take work calls on your feet while you waltz around the room, or ask your teacher if you can stand at the back at the room while you take notes. Get on your feet more often and your butt cramps may show up less often. [4] X Research source If you’re looking to relax instead of burning calories on your feet, go ahead a lie down instead! That will be easier on your butt than sitting."

      "content": "If you feel tight, some basic stretching will relieve the tension. Cramping is an involuntary contraction of the muscle. Stretching warms the muscle by applying pressure, which removes the need for your muscle to tighten. This makes any stretch that works your glutes ideal for butt cramps. [7] X Research source You might try: Walking lunges. Stand up straight and then take a step forward with one foot. Bend your back knee down and keep your frame upright. Then, alternate legs. This is a great dynamic stretch for your butt. [8] X Research source Sitting hip stretches. Sit up straight in a chair with your left ankle over your right knee. Push down for 15-20 seconds. Then, swap legs. This will work your outer quad muscles, hips, and lower back. [9] X Research source Toe touches. Stand up straight with your feet together. Then, reach down and try to touch your toes. This will work your upper thighs, hips, and the base of your pelvis. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Treat painful butt cramps directly with 200-800 mg of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is anti-inflammatory, and your pelvic muscles can swell quite a bit when you’re cramping over and over again.

[11] X Research source Don’t take ibuprofen on an empty stomach. It can cause stomach pain if you take it and you haven’t eaten in a while."
