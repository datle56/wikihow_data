On service uniforms, the stars are attached to a general's epaulets and shirt collar. On dress uniforms, generals wear their stars on the epaulets and an insignia of an eagle on top of a globe, with an anchor running through it, on their jacket collars. To position the eagle/globe logo, position the insignia so that the eagle is vertically upright, and the head of the anchor is facing inwards towards the neck. Attach this insignia 1/2 an inch from the side and 1 inch from the bottom of the collar."
