Edge - ••• > Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Notifications . Firefox - ☰ > Settings > Privacy & Security > Settings (next to \"Notifications). Use this method to stop websites from sending you notifications that look like McAfee pop-ups. For Windows computers with the notification center, these pop-ups can appear in the notification center, which makes them look more official. Turning off notifications and revoking access to sites that already have this permission is the best first step you can take to get rid of those pop-ups."
