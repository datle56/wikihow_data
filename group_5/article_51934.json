If you have multiple CPUs (or even one CPU with multiple cores), you'll see multiple sets of temperatures. The CPU's current temperature appears in the first blank. In the \"Minimum\" column you'll find the lowest recorded CPU temperature since launching the app. The \"Max\" column shows you the highest recorded temperature. The \"Load\" percentage tells you how much load is on the core. The \"Throttle\" temperature indicates temperature the manufacturer considers the highest safe operating temperature. [2] X Research source Your CPU temperature should never exceed this temperature. Really, your laptop's CPU should not run much more than 122F/50C most of the time. [3] X Research source If the internal temperature is running high, press Ctrl + Alt + Del to open the Task Manager, and click More Details at the bottom-left corner of the resulting window (if you see it). In the CPU column, find the app that's using the most CPU power (it'll be at the top of the list) and shut it down if necessary."

Although Apple doesn't report the average running temperature of a CPU or GPU, they recommend only using your notebook when the ambient temperature is between 50 and 95 F (10 and 35 C) [4] X Research source In general, your Mac's CPU temperature should stay in the 122F / 50C zone. One cool way to check out average CPU temperatures experienced by other Mac users is to visit https://www.intelmactemp.com/list . Select your model from the drop-down menu above the \"Base Model\" column. The \"Idle\" temperature column shows CPU temperatures on a system that doesn't have any apps open, while the \"Load\" temperature shows the highest temp recorded. If your temperatures are running high, open Activity Monitor (in Applications > Utilities ) and click the CPU tab. You can click the CPU % column to sort by what's consuming the most of your CPU power. Closing that app might decrease the temperature."

A safe temperature zone for a modern laptop is an ambient temperature between 50 and 95 F (10 and 35 C). If the ambient temperature is getting too high and you need to use your laptop, try pointing a fan at it during use.

Your laptop should be on a flat, hard surface, such as a table or desk. Make sure nothing is blocking the fan vent(s), and that nothing is placed on top of the keyboard. If you must work on your lap, try using a laptop cooling pad or external fan."

Another way to lower your energy consumption is to simply unplug when you can, as many laptops automatically switch to a power-saver mode.

However, if you're often overheating, you may want to change that to \"active.\" In your Power Options, click Change plan settings below your power plan, then click Change advanced power settings to find these settings under \"Processor power management.\""

Depending on your laptop, expertise, and what sort of tools you have laying around, you may be able to do this yourself. This involves powering down the computer, flipping it over, and then removing the bottom panel to expose the components. Then you'll need to gently loosen any dust or debris you see around the fans using a cotton swab or cloth. If you use compressed air, use only short light bursts."
