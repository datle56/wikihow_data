      "content": "Lawful Good characters have a strong sense of morals and justice. They are inherently good and honest at heart and see great value in the law or an established code to keep society running smoothly and fairly. While many well-known Lawful Good characters hold powerful mantles in society (e.g., Superman or Captain America), ordinary characters with an honest and just outlook on life can also qualify. These characters: [1] X Research source Believe that law and order are necessary for the good of society Are against cheating, stealing, and lying Refuse to harm innocent people or creatures May get others to choose a morally righteous path Stand up for what they believe in"

      "content": "Lawful Good is 1 of 9 character alignments. The character alignment system is commonly associated with the tabletop roleplaying franchise Dungeons & Dragons , but it can be used to analyze fictional characters from every medium and franchise under the sun. The 9 alignments fall into 3 categories: Lawful (Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Lawful Evil), Neutral (Neutral Good, True Neutral, Neutral Evil), and Chaotic (Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Evil). [2] X Research source Character alignments are often viewed on a 3 by 3 chart. The “good” alignments are on the top row, the “neutral” alignments are on the second row, and the “evil” alignments are on the bottom row. [3] X Research source Character alignments can also be displayed on an axis-style chart, with the X-axis representing a range of “plays by the rules” and “does not play by the rules,” and the Y-axis representing a range of “nice person” down to “bad person.” On this chart, a Lawful Good character would fall in the top left corner. The Lawful Good philosophy is distinct in that it follows a specific code. Neutral Good and Chaotic Good philosophies, while still morally aligned, don’t follow a strict code (or any code at all)."

      "content": "Character alignments can bleed into one another. Fictional characters are more than just the sum of their parts—they’re often complex individuals thrust into complex situations. While some characters play strictly by Lawful Good standards, other characters may waver from the Lawful Good paradigm. At the end of the day, the character alignment system is incredibly nuanced! For example, Superman is often treated as a paragon of law, order, and goodness, but many modern iterations take a more chaotic and less lawful approach to his characterization. In the 2013 Man of Steel film, Superman destroys plenty of property as he battles against Zod."

      "content": "Steve Rogers/Captain America from the Marvel Comics franchise For the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (as well as Marvel Comics in general), Captain America is known for his pure heart and unyielding ideals, even in the face of unspeakable evil. This is exemplified in Captain America: The First Avenger , when Steve famously says “I don’t like bullies—I don’t care where they’re from.” In certain aspects of the comics and MCU, it can be argued that Steve takes a more Neutral Good or Chaotic Good approach to crime-fighting (especially following the events of Captain America: Civil War ). Still, Steve Rogers as a character always follows a strong moral code, which lines up well with the Lawful Good alignment."

      "title": "Clark Kent/Superman from the DC franchise",
      "content": "Clark Kent/Superman from the DC franchise While more modern iterations of Superman may fall in Neutral or even Chaotic Good territory, the classic iterations of Superman (like Christopher Reeve’s appearance in the 1978 Superman film) feature the character as a morally righteous character who seeks to protect others at all costs while always doing what’s right. Clark’s Lawful Good tendencies are also apparent in Smallville , the popular 2000s TV show that explored Clark Kent’s life before he became a superhero. In season 8, time-traveling heroes attempt to kill Clark’s best friend Chloe, who was possessed by an evil supercomputer known as Brainiac. Although killing Chloe was the easiest way to solve the problem, Clark convinced them to find another way to save Chloe’s life and neutralize Brainiac."

      "content": "Spock from the Star Trek franchise Spock is a loyal, devoted, and morally righteous member of the U.S.S. Enterprise ’s crew, serving as Captain Kirk’s second-in-command. His Lawful Good nature shines through in his well-known quote from the 1982 film The Wrath of Khan : “Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” [4] X Research source Spock’s dutiful rule-following tendencies are clearly seen in the 2013 Star Trek film Into Darkness , where Spock reports an illegal maneuver that Kirk did (despite that maneuver being done to save Spock’s life)."

      "content": "Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars franchise The battles between the law-abiding Jedi and the ambitious, self-seeking Sith in Star Wars are excellent examples of Lawful Good and Lawful Evil, especially when it comes to protagonist Luke Skywalker. During the first 3 Star Wars films, viewers get a first-hand look at how dedicated Luke is to the forces of good as he trains to be a Jedi. Luke’s innate sense of Lawful Good can be seen in the 1983 film The Return of the Jedi , where he denies Emperor Palpatine’s request to kill his father, Darth Vader, and take up his mantle."

      "title": "Ned Stark from Game of Thrones",
      "content": "Ned Stark from Game of Thrones In the Game of Thrones universe (a world filled with treachery and betrayal), few Houses are as loyal and morally sound as House Stark. Ned Stark, the House’s patriarch in Season 1, exemplifies this sense of goodness in his fair and just rule as the Warden of the North. His Lawful Good attitude ultimately gets him killed during his tenure as the Hand of the King when he attempts (and fails) to force the cunning Cersei Lannister’s hand. Not all members of the Stark family toe the line of Lawful Good like Ned does. For instance, a revenge-driven Arya Stark strays from the path of Lawful Good as she becomes an assassin to avenge her murdered family members, but she ultimately lands in Chaotic Good territory by the end of the series. Arya’s sister, Sansa, lands in a Lawful Good position toward the end of the show—particularly when she orders the treacherous Littlefinger to be executed for his crimes against her family."

      "content": "Aaron Hotchner from Criminal Minds Criminal Minds features plenty of FBI agents who follow their own personal codes of justice within the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). The BAU’s Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner serves as a pillar of Lawful Good ideals for a good portion of the series as he holds his unit accountable for their actions (like in Season 1, where he holds Agent Elle Greenaway accountable when she vigilante-kills a criminal). Like many Lawful Good characters, Hotchner strays from his duty to law and order, particularly in Season 5 when the Boston Reaper murders his ex-wife. In retribution, Hotchner beats the killer to death."

      "content": "Lawful Good vs. Lawful Neutral Lawful Neutral characters follow a certain set of principles to a tee, but their personality and mindset are essentially defined by these principles that they follow or enforce. [5] X Research source In the manga and anime series Bleach , Rukia is a great example of a Lawful Good character who genuinely believes in the rules laid out by the Soul Society, a major organization within the series. Her older adoptive brother Byakuya acts more as an enforcer for the Soul Society for a chunk of the story, making him more Lawful Neutral."

      "content": "Lawful Good vs. Lawful Evil Like Lawful Good characters, Lawful Evil characters are also dedicated to a specific code and system—but theirs is evil, rather than morally sound. [6] X Research source In the Star Wars franchise, Yoda is a Lawful Good character who is dedicated to the ways and code of the Jedi. Darth Vader, on the other hand, is dedicated to the ways and code of the Sith."

      "title": "Lawful Good vs. Neutral Good",
      "content": "Lawful Good vs. Neutral Good Neutral Good characters are comfortable following the law and/or a strong moral code, but they aren’t quite as dedicated to these principles as Lawful Good characters are. Where Lawful Good characters will try to encourage others to toe the line, Neutral Good characters will not. [7] X Research source In the Harry Potter franchise, Hermione Granger’s by-the-book approach to both life and magic (at least at the beginning of the franchise) lands her in Lawful Good territory. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore takes a more Neutral Good path throughout the series. Despite his status as Headmaster, he isn’t afraid to subvert the conventions of law and order when necessary (like when he conspires to have Snape kill him so Snape can gain Voldemort’s full trust)."

      "title": "Lawful Good vs. Chaotic Good",
      "content": "Lawful Good vs. Chaotic Good Lawful and Chaotic Good characters both gravitate toward morally good actions, but Chaotic Good characters are free-spirited and often break the rules and go against the established authority. [8] X Research source In the Star Trek franchise, Spock is known for his morally righteous principles and his tendency to follow the rules and make decisions that benefit the group (rather than himself as an individual). Captain Kirk, on the other hand, is a good example of a Chaotic Good character—he’s a morally sound individual who isn’t afraid to follow his own playbook."

      "content": "Lawful Good characters are devoted to doing the right thing in D&D. As the definition of Lawful Good implies, Lawful Good D&D characters tend to choose the moral high ground in a D&D setting. [9] X Research source They won’t try to deceive or pick fights with NPCs, and they definitely won’t hurt or kill anyone unless it’s absolutely necessary. Paladins, dwarves, and gold dragons are often played as Lawful Good characters."

While Lawful Good is commonly associated with certain classes, like the oath-sworn Paladin, you are by no means limited to this class if you wish to play a Lawful Good character . (Similarly, you don’t have to be Lawful Good if you choose to play as a Paladin.) [10] X Research source D&D is all about creativity and imagination—so, if you want to try your hand as a Lawful Good Warlock or Rogue, chat with your DM about the best way to make that happen."

      "title": "Playing as a Lawful Good character may limit your character’s decisions.",
      "content": "Playing as a Lawful Good character may limit your character’s decisions. Lawful Good characters tend to make morally sound decisions that follow the established law of a setting. Because of this, you likely won’t have the same freedoms that a Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral character might have (e.g., pickpocketing, lying, etc.). [11] X Research source With that being said, D&D is an incredibly flexible game, and the details of your specific campaign are ultimately left up to your DM. If you’re feeling stifled by the Lawful Good restraints of your character, chat with your DM—they might be able to suggest some ways to help your gameplay feel as fresh and fun as possible."
