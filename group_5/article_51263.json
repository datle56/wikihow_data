Secure the bed rail hangers to the end of the side-rail and head post. Double check that each placement is consistent. Repeat the process for all corners. [1] X Research source These hangers can sometimes be hard to find in hardware stores. If so, check online retailers. Bed rail hangers are usually sold 4 sets to a package. In the place of bed rail hangers, you can use 8 long lag bolts. When tightened, the lag bolts make the bed very solid. Lag bolts are also much easier to find than bed rail hangers.
