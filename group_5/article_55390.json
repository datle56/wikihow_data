      "content": "Place the pot in an area with partial shade. Jasmine prefers warm temperatures (at least 60 °F (16 °C)) and several hours of shade to grow. Choose a spot for your jasmine pot that receives sunlight but with around 2-3 hours of shade a day. If placing the pot indoors, choose a place near a south-facing window so it can receive direct sunlight.
