      "content": "Gently jiggle the steering wheel while removing the key. Hold the key and apply a light amount of pressure while moving the steering wheel to the left and right repeatedly. Maynes explains that If the steering column is locked and holding the key in place, you should be able to unlock it long enough to remove the key by “moving the steering column” to the open position. What causes this? Maynes explains that when a car is off “you can turn the wheel and it locks the wheel. So, what happens is that people will go in there, get out of the car, and kind of grab the wheel as they go out and they go out, it locks it, but it locks the key in with it. Is there anything to repair? No, this is just one of those quirks of owning a car. In the future, just don’t move the steering wheel when you’re turning the key off."

      "content": "Check the gear and confirm it’s in park or neutral. Maynes points out that If your transmission is stuck in between two different positions, it “won’t disengage.” As a result, your vehicle may lock the steering column and keep the key secured. Use your shifter to confirm your vehicle is actually in the park position (or neutral). What causes this? Maynes explains, “Some cars have a park-neutral switch. The vehicle won’t let the key come out if the car isn’t in park or neutral. So, if your car has that, sometimes the key can get stuck halfway in between park and reverse and the key won’t come out.” Is there anything to repair? No. Just be make sure you’re in the proper gear before moving the key in the future."

      "title": "Press the brake down as hard as you can and try again.",
      "content": "Press the brake down as hard as you can and try again. Most modern vehicles will not let you move the key without your foot on the brake. Maynes points out that “sometimes the vehicle needs to see the brake signal from the brake switch to know that your foot’s on the brake when you go to start it.” Try pressing really hard on the brake and moving the key. If it helps pop the key out, your car’s brake pedal switch is probably dying. What causes this? Maynes explains that “most vehicles need to see the brake signal from the brake switch to know that your foot is on the brake when you move the key. If the car doesn’t, that switch is no good.” Is there anything to repair? Yes. See a mechanic to have the brake pedal switch inspected and swapped out. It shouldn’t cost more than $80-150."

      "title": "Try pulling the key out part-way and turning it.",
      "content": "Try pulling the key out part-way and turning it. If your key is dirty, damaged, or old, it may simply not have lined up with the tumblers inside the lock. Push the key in all the way, try turning it, then slowly move the key out in tiny sections and keep trying to turn the key. Use light pressure to avoid breaking or bending the key as you do this. [1] X Research source What causes this? Having an old or damaged key. Is there anything to repair? Potentially, yes. Inspect the key carefully. If the tumblers look dull, the key is bent, or there’s a crack in the metal, see a mechanic or locksmith to have the key replaced."

      "title": "Jump the battery if it’s dead.",
      "content": "Jump the battery if it’s dead. If your car’s battery is dead and the key is in ignition, it won’t come out. If you know for a fact that the battery has no juice, jump it . Your key should turn freely once the battery is online. [2] X Research source What causes this? This is a security feature on modern vehicles. It’s designed to prevent car thefts when the anti-theft system isn’t activated. By locking the car down when the battery is dead, it keeps thieves from snagging the car while the alarm is down. Is there anything to repair? No, not unless this happens again. If your battery keeps dying, replace it to prevent the key from getting stuck in the future."

      "title": "Inspect the dashboard for odd lock settings if it’s a new car.",
      "content": "Inspect the dashboard for odd lock settings if it’s a new car. If this is your first or second time in a particular car, your vehicle may have some kind of locking mechanism you accidentally engaged. Look at all of the buttons on the dashboard to see if there’s a lock icon lit up or a button that refers to a key lock and select that to see if it helps. [3] X Research source What causes this? It depends on the vehicle model, so refer to your manual to see why/when this happens. Is there anything to repair? No, if there’s a setting you find that locks or unlocks things, it’s just a unique component for your car."

      "content": "If you think you’re making progress, use graphite lube. If you can feel your key moving and you suspect it’s just stuck because of damage, try spraying some graphite lock-safe lubricant into the ignition. Then, gently wiggle the key back and forth to spread the lubricant. If you’re lucky, the key will slide freely out. [4] X Research source If the key is degraded enough that it requires lubrication, it’s time to get a new key. If your key appears to be completely fine, your ignition module is likely dying."

      "content": "If the key won’t budge, see a dealer for a new ignition module. The ignition module (or ignition switch) refers to the mechanism that physically rotates to trigger the ignition coil. If that module is broken, damaged, or exceptionally dirty, it may be locked and pinning the key in place. See a dealer to have them swap out your ignition mechanism. [5] X Research source A dealer is the only one who can reprogram the ignition module accurately since these are unique from model to model."

      "title": "No, most vehicles do not have a way to override a locked ignition.",
      "content": "No, most vehicles do not have a way to override a locked ignition. The “override function” you might see recommended occasionally involves removing the panel covering the bottom half of the steering wheel and then manually pressing on the portion of the ignition module that unlocks the key. This is generally not advisable though, since there are ways to unlock the key without potentially damaging your steering column. The one exception is Chevy vehicles. Modern Chevys have a small port on the underside of the steering column. Remove that panel cover and reach a finger inside. Press gently towards you once you find the latch and the key will unlock."
