      "title": "Leo is a masculine sign naturally attracted to femininity.",
      "content": "Leo is a masculine sign naturally attracted to femininity. Here, being opposites works out great for you. As daughters of the moon, Cancers ooze feminine energy—all you have to do is showcase it with soft, flowing fabrics and delicate accessories. [1] X Research source For example, if you're going out to a party, you might wear a flirty sundress or a pair of leggings with a gauzy patterned top. If you're a typical Cancer, this is your comfort zone. If you can, try to match his personal style aesthetic as well—he'll like it if the two of you look like you go together. For example, if he typically wears a black leather jacket and jeans, you might wear a motorcycle jacket over a sundress."

      "title": "Lions love to be reminded of how wonderful they are.",
      "content": "Lions love to be reminded of how wonderful they are. Everybody likes compliments, but Leos need compliments. Praise him often by pointing out great things that other people might not notice about him. [2] X Research source This is a great opportunity to put that Cancerian intuition to work—you have a sixth sense about what he's proud of. Compliment him for those things and he'll be hooked. Here's another neat thing about the Leo-Cancer combo: You know how the moon reflects the light of the sun? Cancer is ruled by the moon and Leo by the sun, so making him glow and then basking in his radiance just comes naturally. Make sure your compliments are genuine, though—he can smell fake flattery a mile away and he'll wonder what you're trying to butter him up for. And who could blame him?"

      "title": "The typical Leo would be thrilled to know he is the center of your universe.",
      "content": "The typical Leo would be thrilled to know he is the center of your universe. When you're with him, let everyone and everything else fade into the background. Make eye contact and listen—really listen—when he talks. Ask follow-up questions to show you've been hanging on his every word and he'll want to keep you by his side. For example, suppose he's telling you a story about his sister. Start with a compliment: \"I think it's awesome how devoted you are to your sister.\" Then ask a question: \"When is she coming to visit next? I'd love to meet her.\" Asking about something he told you later tells him you're really interested. If he mentions something about his brother's new project on Monday, for example, you might ask how it's going when you see him on Wednesday."

      "title": "The typical Leo loves living life and is enthusiastic about the future.",
      "content": "The typical Leo loves living life and is enthusiastic about the future. This doesn't mean he never faces dark periods, but he doesn't like to dwell on them when he does. No matter what happens, tell him that you're looking forward to the next opportunity. If you act like you believe there's an adventure waiting around every corner, he'll feel like he's found a soul mate. This doesn't mean you have to act fake or pretend like bad things don't happen. If you're going through a tough time, acknowledge it, but focus on how it will make you a better and stronger person in the future."

      "content": "The lovable Leo enjoys teasing and being teased. [3] X Research source If you've ever seen a video of lion cubs playing together, you've got the right idea. Leos tend to be pretty physical and respond well to playful, childlike flirting. Channel your inner kitten and swat him on the arm when he makes a teasing remark or spontaneously challenge him to race you. \"Last one there's a rotten egg!\" If you're usually a little more reserved, you might feel a little silly acting like this—but that's okay, that's kind of the point. Show him that you know how to let loose and have some fun and he'll definitely want to see you more often."

      "title": "He likes people who are as confident and self-assured as he is.",
      "content": "He likes people who are as confident and self-assured as he is. The typical Leo believes he's a valuable person, and he wants the woman on his arm to be valuable as well. Don't be shy about the fact that you have a life of your own with your own interests that fulfill you. Mention a program you started or the website you're building for your passion project and he'll definitely be interested. Leos tend to be pretty busy—they're super-social guys—so it helps if you have a lot of different interests taking up your time. When you talk about the things you're passionate about, he'll light up. You can also use this opportunity to show off your intelligence a little—don't worry, Leos like smart ladies. Tell him about your latest research project or an idea you have for a new story or screenplay."

      "title": "Leos tend to lead and prefer to be the ones in pursuit.",
      "content": "Leos tend to lead and prefer to be the ones in pursuit. He's likely to get bored quickly if you make the first move. This shouldn't be a problem for you, Cancer, since you tend to be a little more reserved and cautious with love anyway. Flirt a little to let him know that you're interested, then retreat into your shell. He'll adore drawing you out. Being a little mysterious is a good way to keep him interested. He'll stay hot on your trail because he's curious and wants to know everything about you. He loves the thrill of the chase as long as he knows he's going to win in the end. Don't ignore him or pull back so much that he thinks you're no longer interested—he might move on to someone else."

      "title": "Leos typically think it's hot when a woman stands up for herself.",
      "content": "Leos typically think it's hot when a woman stands up for herself. He's assertive and strong and wants his partner to be the same. If you're the typical conflict-averse Cancer, it might be hard for you to stand your ground—you'd rather go with the flow than make waves. But rest assured your Leo guy will have nothing but respect and admiration for you if you do. For example, if he texts you late at night and asks you to come over to his place, you might text back, \"I don't think so. We don't know each other well enough for that.\" The two of you do have some pretty big differences. Boundaries are important to keep these from becoming a serious issue as your relationship progresses."

Put in all the work and he'll adore his moment in the spotlight. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. For example, why not recreate your favorite rom-com moment with him in the leading role? He'll adore that you've put so much effort into declaring your affection for him. Make a big deal out of occasions too! Take him to a baseball game on his birthday and arrange for a happy birthday message to be displayed on the Jumbotron.

[7] X Research source This is one of the things that makes you and Leo a great match. Let him know you're in his corner by saying things like, \"I know you've got this presentation in the bag!\" or \"You've worked so hard on that project, I know you'll nail it!\" When he hits a snag—happens to the best of us—encourage him by saying things like, \"That's okay, you'll get it next time,\" or \"I know that was tough, but the experience will be worth it.\" Reader Poll: We asked 1073 wikiHow readers what they would do if their Leo crush opened up and was vulnerable with them. 86% agreed that the best way to win his heart is by showing empathy, understanding, and support.

      "content": "He'll open up if he knows he's safe with you. Deep down, your brave and boisterous lion is actually pretty sensitive. Surely you can understand this, Cancer, since you're one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. Keep things he tells you in confidence and don't gossip about other people around him. He can be a little afraid of emotions because they make him feel vulnerable. Channel your Cancerian motherly instincts to reassure him. If he knows that you're always on his side, he'll let you into his heart."
