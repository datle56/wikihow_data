      "content": "Save your game before you start. While you can’t go to a Pokécenter between battles to heal your Pokémon, you can save your game after defeating each Elite 4 member. Some players prefer to save just before entering the Elite 4, so they can restart the battle with a clean slate. Stock up on healing items. Buy plenty of Full Heals, Full Restores, and Max Revives to quickly get an injured or fainted Pokémon back on its feet in the heat of battle. You can’t go back to a Pokémon Center in the middle of battle, so it’s important to be fully stocked. [3] X Research source Level up your Pokémon before the battles. The Elite 4 and Pokémon Champion have Pokémon between levels 46 and 58, so make sure that your own team is on that level. The more you grind, the easier it’ll be to defeat everyone."
