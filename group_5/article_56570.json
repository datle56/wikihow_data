      "content": "Check your state law. Since gun laws vary significantly from state to state, it's important to check the laws of the state in which you live before you buy an antique firearm. If you move to another state, don't assume the laws are the same and you can continue to legally own an antique firearm just because you legally owned it somewhere else. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source For example, anyone convicted of a felony is prohibited from buying a firearm. However, this prohibition doesn't apply to many antique firearms. The types of guns included, however, depend on state law. Muzzle-loading rifles, shotguns, and pistols that use black powder rather than fixed ammunition generally can be purchased by felons. However, if the weapons are converted so that they can fire fixed ammunition, they may not be allowed. Additionally, many states have additional regulations regarding characteristics such as flintlocks, barrel length, and who may own them."

However, each state applies this exception in different ways, and may define \"antique firearm\" differently.

The federal definition also includes replicas, which means the firearm may have been manufactured recently, but if it was manufactured to exactly duplicate a firearm produced before 1898, it is still considered an antique firearm. Most states use the same definition as federal law. However, some states include newer firearms as well. In these states, a firearm is considered an antique if it was manufactured more than 50 years ago and is not still being manufactured. With these relatively newer weapons that are still considered antiques, there may be additional restrictions on their ownership. Typically that depends on the type of ammunition they use."

If you're unsure about how the exception applies, of if you are eligible to purchase or own an antique firearm legally, speaking to someone such as a federal firearms licensee can help you understand the law. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source The state government agency that regulates firearms typically will be your most reliable source. You can identify this agency by searching on the internet or asking a licensed gun dealer near you. If you don't feel comfortable calling up the state agency, a licensed gun dealer near you usually can give you full information about the laws in your state. You also may be able to find out about your ability to legally own an antique firearm by talking to an attorney, such as a criminal defense attorney. If you've been convicted of a felony, this may be your best resource."

      "title": "Apply for a state license to carry a gun.",
      "content": "Apply for a state license to carry a gun. Typically, you don't need a license to buy or own an antique firearm. However, not being licensed limits your ability to use or transport your gun, and you may not be able to sell it to others. A state license generally is a \"license to carry,\" meaning you need the license if, for example, you want to take your antique firearm to a local shooting range and fire it. Some states such as Massachusetts have exempted antique firearms from the license to carry. However, before you rely on this you should check to make sure that your antique firearm falls within the licensing exemption, which may differ from the purchase or possession exemption. When you buy your antique firearm, think about the reason for your purchase and what you anticipate doing with it. If you're a collector who intends to hang it on your wall or display it in a case, and knows you're never going to attempt to fire it, you shouldn't need a license in most states."

      "content": "Consider getting a curios and relics (C&R) license. If you want to collect antique firearms and plan on buying and selling them on a regular basis, a curios and relics license will allow you to do that more efficiently. [10] X Research source A C&R license is a type of federal firearms license (FFL) that allows you to buy and sell antique firearms directly without having to go through a licensed dealer. The license is issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). You can download a copy of the application from the ATF's website. A C&R license allows you to buy and sell antique firearms, including any firearm that is at least 50 years old or that has historical or collectible significance. Once you get your license, you must keep records of each firearm you buy or sell, including the make, model, serial number, and type of firearm. You also must record the name and address (or FFL number) of the buyer or seller of the weapon."

However, apart from that information, you should be able to find out basic information about the reputation of this particular seller before you buy an antique firearm from them. While this isn't necessarily a legal consideration, it can be if someone sells you a firearm claiming that it is an antique, when it really isn't â€“ particularly if you don't have a license to buy or possess modern firearms."

Your local gun dealer may be able to point you to someone who specializes in dating antique firearms. If the antique firearm is alleged to have particular historical significance, you will want to have it evaluated by a museum curator or historian who specializes in that particular period of time or type of weaponry."

[16] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms U.S. federal law enforcement agency dealing with crimes related to firearms and alcohol and tobacco products Go to source If you have a C&R license, you don't have to worry about transport restrictions if you're buying and selling within your own state. However, to transport an antique firearm across state lines, you typically must use a federal firearms licensee within the state where the firearm is located. That licensee can then transfer the firearm to you, or to a federal firearms licensee in your state to deliver to you. If you want to import an antique firearm (or ammunition) from another country, this also must be done by a registered firearm dealer. The ATF provides forms which must be completed prior to making an international purchase or sale and transfer. Visit the ATF website to download those documents. If the firearm you wish to transport is more than 100 years old, it is eligible for duty-free transport internationally. However, you must be able to provide proof of age."

Your state law controls how the final transfer of the weapon can be made. Generally it can't simply be shipped to you. Instead, you must meet with the seller in person to take possession of the antique firearm.

[20] X Research source In some states, antique firearms are not exempted from state storage laws. However, others carve out an exemption for antiques being displayed for collection purposes, provided they are not loaded. Generally, you should avoid keeping even antique firearms where children can reach them or take them down to play with them.

Keep in mind that the idea that collectors typically don't intend to use antique firearms in the same way or for the same purposes people have modern firearms is part of the reason for the exemption from various licensing requirements. States that allow gun owners to keep loaded weapons for self-defense purposes typically do not allow muzzle-loaded weapons that use black powder for ammunition to be kept loaded. You should only \"load\" a black-powder weapon if you intend to fire it immediately. If your muzzle-loaded weapon has been converted so that it can fire standard bullets, it may not be considered an antique firearm as a result of that modification."
