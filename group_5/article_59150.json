      "content": "Cover the stain with baking soda. Your goal here is to get rid of excess oil in the stained fabric. Baking soda is an absorbent, which means it can soak up oil. Sprinkle a generous amount of it on the stain and double check to make sure you've got the area covered completely. [2] X Research source Apart from baking soda, you can use talcum powder and cornstarch as well. They also serve as absorbents. If you're dealing with a stain that's turning brown, soak it in lemon juice and cover with salt instead. While the salt will act as an absorbent for oil, the lemon juice will act as a harmless bleaching solution. [3] X Research source Another option is to soak it in baking soda. Add a bit of baking soda to a bowl and fill it halfway with water. Let the stained piece soak in for about 24 hours and then wash it as usual."

      "content": "Let the baking soda sit and then brush it off. In order to absorb as much oil as possible, the powder needs to remain in contact with the stained area for at least 30 minutes. Once it's been that long, the baking soda should look damp. Then you can use a soft-bristled brush to brush it off. [4] X Research source Treating the stain with baking soda might be enough for it to disappear. If it doesn't, you'll need to do a few more steps until completion.

      "content": "Wash the fabric as usual. If you can, use the highest temperature setting allowed for that type of material. Once it’s out of the washing machine, the fabric should be completely free of stains. If it’s not, simply repeat the process. [8] X Research source Whatever you do, avoid putting the fabric into the dryer before the stain is completely gone. Otherwise, the temperature in the dryer might help the stain to set.

      "title": "Cover the stain with an absorbent.",
      "content": "Cover the stain with an absorbent. Baking soda, talcum powder, and cornstarch are excellent absorbents. They can soak up excess oil from almost any material with which they come in contact. So sprinkle the stained area with one of them generously."

      "content": "Let the absorbent sit and then vacuum the stained area. Leaving it on for 15 minutes should be enough, but if you want to be sure, simply check if the powder is damp. If it is, that means the absorbent has done its job and soaked up excess oil. Now you can vacuum the stained area to remove all traces of the powder. [10] X Research source Brushing absorbents off is allowed when treating washable fabrics, but it's not recommended when it comes to carpets and upholstery. By using a brush, you're risking pushing both the absorbent and the sunscreen deeper into the material."

Your goal is to remove the sunscreen, not replace it with the dry-cleaning solvent. Keep sponging until you’ve covered the entire stained area. [11] X Research source If the stain is still visible, try removing it using water and dish soap. Simply mix 2 cups (470 mL) of cold water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of dish soap. Using this solution and a clean cloth, sponge the stained area until you've removed the stain completely. [12] X Research source"

So soak the cloth in water and rub it gently over the stained area. Repeat until you’ve removed all traces of the solvent. [13] X Research source If you don’t want to use dry-cleaning solvent, you can leave the absorbent to sit longer instead. You should leave it for at least 6 hours before vacuuming it. Once you’ve finished vacuuming, the stain should be gone."
