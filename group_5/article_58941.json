      "content": "Area rugs stop echoes from bouncing off of hard floors. Hard flooring causes sounds to reverberate back and create echoes. Choose a large area rug that has a thicker pile to help it absorb more of the noise. As a bonus, the rugs also add a nice decorative touch to your room. [1] X Research source Try placing foam mats underneath the rugs to help absorb more of the noise."

Acoustic panels and foams come in different sizes, shapes, and colors so you can find ones that look great in any room.

      "content": "Heavy curtains stop echoes from bouncing off flat walls and windows. Install the curtains across your windows and pull them over the glass to get rid of echoes. If you want to add a decorative touch to your wall, cover the flat surface with a large curtain. No matter where you hang your curtain, choose an accent color or pattern that complements the rest of the room.

      "content": "Canvas wall art and textiles stop echoes from forming. If you want a way to decorate and liven up your space, a few new pieces of art or decorative tapestries are the perfect addition to your room. Look at local art stores or interior design stores for large canvases and thick tapestries that match the style and colors you’re already using in the room. [6] X Research source To hang your painting , choose where you want to place it and put a sturdy nail or screw into your wall. Then, hang the art on your wall to display it. There are multiple ways to hang a tapestry , but normally you’d put it on a rod similar to the way you would hang curtains. Avoid using art with glass frames because the noise will still bounce off of the flat surface."

      "content": "Bookcases against your walls help diffuse the sound. Move bookcases into the room, or put up new shelves along the walls where you hear the most echoes. Put different books and knick-knacks on the shelves to fill them up. All of the items you store there make sound waves bounce in different directions so they don’t create a loud echo.

      "title": "Upholstered couches, armchairs, and loveseats absorb sounds.",
      "content": "Upholstered couches, armchairs, and loveseats absorb sounds. Plush furniture is softer, so sound waves are less likely to echo off of it. If you’re just moving into a place, moving in a couch or chair will help reduce the echo. Try rearranging your furniture a few times to find the most effective arrangement for reducing echoes. Otherwise, replace some solid wood or metal furniture with a new upholstered couch or chair. [8] X Research source Decorate your home with plush blankets and throw pillows to help absorb more of the noise and get rid of echoes in the room."

      "content": "Soft carpets reduce echoes better than hard flooring. If an area rug doesn’t dampen as much noise as you want, covering your floor completely with carpet will help stop echoes even better. Because the carpet also has a cushioned pad underneath, it helps stop echoes even more. [9] X Research source While you may install carpet on your own , it can be a little tricky if you haven’t done it before and may be best to contact a professional installation service.

      "content": "Underlays insulate your floors to block noise and echoes. Sound-dampening underlays are made from foam, fiberboard, or rubber, and they are installed as a layer beneath your finished flooring. Because putting in underlayment requires you to remove your old floors to install it, it’s best to hire a professional service to put it in for you.

Because cork flooring can be difficult to put down correctly, have a professional install it for you.

      "content": "Mass-loaded vinyl covers the wall or under drywall to absorb sounds. Mass-loaded vinyl is used in recording studios and other large buildings and is one of the best soundproofing products to use. If you don’t mind the black, shiny finish of the vinyl on your walls, you can hang it right on the surface. Otherwise, install drywall over the vinyl for a cleaner finish.

      "title": "Insulation fills gaps in your walls to muffle noises.",
      "content": "Insulation fills gaps in your walls to muffle noises. Wall insulation usually comes in large foam rolls or smaller spray foam, and it sits behind your drywall. Insulation absorbs sounds instead of letting them echo inside your wall, so it works to prevent echoes in large spaces. Because it’s difficult to install insulation without removing the drywall first, it’s usually best to do it if you’re doing a larger renovation. Otherwise, contact a professional service for installation. [14] X Research source Insulation also helps regulate the temperature inside your home to help reduce energy bills and make you feel more comfortable."
