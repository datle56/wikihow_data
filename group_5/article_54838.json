      "content": "Earn and open up Apex packs to find Heirloom Shards. Heirloom Shards are normally found in Apex Packs (though each pack only has about a 1% chance of containing Heirloom Shards). In each pack that contains Shards, you’ll get 150 Heirloom Shards in total. Collect packs in a few different ways, including: [1] X Research source Leveling up. As you gain experience points, you’ll continually level up in the game. This is the only way to earn Apex packs that won’t cost extra money. Ranking up in the Battle Pass. The game’s premium Battle Pass costs extra but unlocks various rewards (including Apex packs) as you rank up. Buying packs with Apex Coins. If you don’t want to wait to get Apex packs, buy them from the store with Apex Coins (which can be purchased with real money or earned with the Battle Pass)."

      "content": "Collect at least 500 Apex Packs to be guaranteed Heirloom Shards. Respawn has a mercy timer installed that ensures you can’t open 500 Apex Packs without getting Heirloom Shards. So, if all else fails, just keep collecting Apex Packs—because you’ll definitely earn Shards by the 500th, although odds are you’ll get more along the way. [2] X Research source Consider counting your Apex packs as you earn them to track how close you are to getting more Heirloom Shards. You could even use an online tracker . You could also save up your Apex packs until you have 500 and open them all at once. Keep in mind that if you have all current Heirlooms, you can’t collect more shards until there’s a new one available."

      "content": "Participate in Collection Events to get Shards and Heirlooms. Collection Events are 2-week-long events held whenever a new Heirloom is released. Every event offers 24 new cosmetics (including 12 epics and 12 legendaries), and when you buy all of them, you can unlock the new Heirloom, too. [3] X Research source If an event doesn’t offer a mythic end-game item, you can earn Heirloom Shards instead by completing it. During events, Heirloom Shards can be obtained from special event packs—but they won’t replace items in the pack. You’ll receive Heirloom Shards and special themed items."

Wrath’s Kunai, the first Heirloom, was secretly added to the game, and players could find it by opening loot ticks. Over time, as developers made more Heirlooms, they added Heirloom Shards so players could pick and purchase the Heirlooms they wanted. [4] X Research source Most Heirloom items have a unique banner pose and special voice line."
