The binary system is a base 2 system, so instead of the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands place like we use in the decimal (base 10) system, binary has the ones, twos, fours, and eights place. [1] X Research source The ones place is the far right column of your chart, and the eights place is the far left column. You can continue your place value chart. Each place value is determined by a base 2 exponent. For example: 2 0 = ones place {\\displaystyle 2^{0}={\\text{ones place}}} 2 1 = twos place {\\displaystyle 2^{1}={\\text{twos place}}} 2 2 = fours place {\\displaystyle 2^{2}={\\text{fours place}}} 2 3 = eights place {\\displaystyle 2^{3}={\\text{eights place}}} 2 4 = sixteens place {\\displaystyle 2^{4}={\\text{sixteens place}}} 2 5 = thirty-twos place {\\displaystyle 2^{5}={\\text{thirty-twos place}}}"
