      "content": "Offer sympathy and support for someone who lost their mother. The death of a mother can be extremely painful, to say the least. A kind and supportive condolence message can provide comfort during the grieving process.

      "content": "Let your family member know you’re there for them. After someone loses a parent, it’s often important for the rest of the family to offer support and comfort throughout the grieving process. If someone in your family lost their mother, let them know how much their mother meant to the family and that you’ll be there to support them. Here are some examples: [2] X Research source “Your mother was an amazing person who led a remarkable life.

      "content": "Provide comfort for a close friend who lost their mother. Losing a parent is extremely difficult, and your friend will likely feel comforted that you’re there to support them. Let your friend know how much you mean to them and how you’ll be with them through thick and thin. Try one of the following messages: [3] X Research source “I’m so sorry for your loss.

      "content": "Offer your condolences to grieving coworkers. Relationships with coworkers are often unique; you may be really close to some while you don’t know others well at all. Try to cater your condolence message to your relationship. If your interactions have been mainly business-related, Phillips suggests “acknowledging that person's loss and showing that you sympathize with them, but maybe not expressing as much emotional vulnerability.” Here are some examples: [4] X Research source “I’m so saddened to hear of the loss of your mother. Thinking of you during this difficult time.” “Please accept my deepest condolences to you over the loss of your mother.

      "content": "Offer your sympathies to someone you don’t know well. Even if you don’t know someone that well, it’s still kind and appropriate to offer your condolences. If you don’t know much about the grieving person or their relationship with their mother, it may be best to focus on offering your sympathies in your message. Here are some examples: [5] X Research source “I’m so sorry to hear of your loss. Wishing you peace during this difficult time.” “I’m sorry to hear of the passing of your mother.

      "content": "Keep things short if you don’t know what to say. Trying to figure out the perfect message for a condolence card can be difficult, especially if you don’t know the person well or don’t know the circumstances of the death. Still, a short message is better than no message at all, as it shows the grieving person you acknowledge their loss and care about their situation. Here are a few examples of what you could say: [6] X Research source “I’m so sorry for your loss. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do for you.” “The sky is so gray for you right now; I hope the clouds part soon.” “Thinking of you and hoping there is sunshine in your life soon.” “Our hearts are breaking for you.

      "title": "Offer a religious person comfort during a painful time.",
      "content": "Offer a religious person comfort during a painful time. If the grieving person is religious, they may seek comfort through their religion and feel a sense of relief that their mother is now with God. Consider offering them a Bible verse (or another religious message if they aren’t Christian) as a form of support. Here are some examples: [7] X Research source “My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him. He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.” – Psalm 62:1-2 “Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him.” – Psalm 126:5-6 “The Lord your God is with you, and he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing.” – Zephaniah 3:17 “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” – Isaiah 41:10 “God's grace is all-powerful and can give you the strength to get through anything.” “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\" – Psalm 34:18 “Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.” “When you lose someone you love, you gain an angel you know.” “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.\" – John 11:25,2 “In this moment of sorrow, may God's grace surround you. Your mother's spirit now rests in His eternal embrace.” “I extend my sincere condolences.

      "content": "Choose an appropriate quote if you don’t know what to say. It’s often hard to find the right words to say when someone is grieving. If you’re struggling, consider adding a well-known quote about mourning or sympathy. Here are some examples: [8] X Research source “Grief is the price we pay for love.” – Queen Elizabeth II “There is love in holding and there is love in letting go.” – Elizabeth Berg “It is not length of life, but depth of life.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson “Grief, when it comes, is nothing we expect it to be.” – Joan Didion “Although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it.” – Helen Keller “Death is nothing else but going home to God. The bond of love will be unbroken for all eternity.” – Mother Teresa “There is no greater sorrow than to recall happiness in times of misery.” – Dante Alighieri “Unable are the Loved to die / For Love is Immortality.” – Emily Dickinson, “Poem 809” “There are no goodbyes for us. Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart.” – Mahatma Gandhi “Like a bird singing in the rain, let grateful memories survive in time of sorrow.” – Robert Louis Stevenson “A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies. It brings us together again and again.” – Maya Angelou “What is lovely never dies but passes into another loveliness: stardust or seafoam, flower or winged air.” – Thomas Bailey Aldrich “To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.” – Thomas Campbell “Death ends a life, not a relationship. All the love you created is still there. All the memories are still there. You live on in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.” – Mitch Albom “Death is a challenge. It tells us not to waste time. It tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other.” – Leo Buscaglia"

      "title": "Be a good listener.",
      "content": "Be a good listener. Let the grieving person know you’re there if they want to talk. They may not open up immediately, but this shows them that it’s okay to talk about their feelings. Allow them to speak openly and listen patiently; repeating the story of their loved one’s death is often a way of processing grief. [9] X Research source When it’s your turn to talk, try to be candid and avoid steering the conversation away from the subject of death. If appropriate, ask sensitive questions that encourage the person to open up, like “Do you feel like talking about it?” Be willing to sit in silence. Don’t press them if they don’t feel like talking. Sometimes, being in the presence of someone who cares provides enough comfort. Phillips says, “Part of mourning is having memories, and especially good memories can help someone kind of move through those stages of grief.” If the person is willing, see if they want to talk about fond memories they have with their mother."

      "content": "Understand the grieving process. Everyone grieves differently, and there is no right or wrong way to grieve. Be prepared to handle mood swings and a rollercoaster of emotions, as feelings of anger, guilt, sadness, and fear are common. Don’t judge the person or take their behavior personally. [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source There is no set timetable for grief. Don’t try to pressure the grieving person to move on or feel like they’ve been grieving too long. This pressure can actually slow the healing process. Grieving people don’t always go through the stages of grief in order. Phillips says the process can be cyclical: “Acceptance doesn't mean that they will never have those other feelings again.” They may feel anger, depression, and denial at different points in their life after the initial loss."

      "content": "Offer to help with tasks. A grieving person may not directly ask for help because they fear being a burden, but they’ll likely appreciate help with more mundane tasks like grocery shopping, preparing meals, doing laundry, etc. Instead of asking what you can do to help, make specific suggestions about tasks you’re willing to help with. Try to be consistent with your help so the person knows you’ll be there for them. [12] X Research source For example, say something like, “I’m going to the store this afternoon. What can I bring you?” or “I’ve made a casserole for dinner. When can I stop by and bring you some?”"

It’s never too late to let someone know that you acknowledge their loss and are thinking of them. [14] X Research source As a general rule, the closer you are to someone, the sooner you should send your condolences. If you’re more casually acquainted, it may be best to offer your condolences around the time of the funeral or memorial. There are many acceptable ways to send your condolences to someone. Speak to them in person, write them a letter , or offer them a sympathy card . When you find out about the death, call them or send them a text ."
