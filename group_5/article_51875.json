      "content": "Enter the command to see your error logs. The command varies between servers and operating systems, but the default is similar to: \" tail -n 10 error.log \". If you get an error message or don't receive an answer, your error logs might be in a different location. Check with your server's information to find the file path your logs are stored. Some commands will require root access and should start with \" sudo \" to work."
