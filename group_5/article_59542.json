      "content": "Find out the zoning category for the neighborhood in which you are interested. Contact the local municipal planning and building department. Ask them into what zoning category your desired neighborhood falls. [1] X Research source A typical zoning category is single-family residential. This means that the principal permitted uses of property in this neighborhood include single-family dwellings, churches, schools, parks and community facilities. [2] X Research source A multi-family residential zoning district allows multi-family structures. These include condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, apartments and group homes. [3] X Research source A transitional zoning district is at the junction of commercial, residential, public and industrial areas. This means that residential lots exist near busy roads with many stores or other commercial buildings. Residential properties are allowed to have limited office or commercial space, but the residential character of the home must be maintained. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Mixed-use zoning areas are common in high-density population areas where commercial, residential, cultural and industrial properties must coexist. These zoning districts allow a mix of single-family and multi-family residential units with commercial businesses and services. This kind of zoning results in compact development, which allows for efficiency of land use while reducing energy consumption and transportation costs. [6] X Research source"

Your real estate agent or attorney may be able to help you. [7] X Research source If you plan to run a home business in an area that is zoned residential, you will have to check with the municipal rules to see if it is allowed. Some municipalities allow exceptions for certain kinds of businesses, like a home child care. [8] X Research source Remodeling and landscaping plans may run into zoning issues. Some ordinances and zoning rules prohibit adding structures, cutting down trees, changing the layout of a house, or even changing the paint color or putting up a fence. Keeping farm animals and parking oversized vehicles or boats may also be disallowed. [9] X Research source"

Also, you can go to your local office of planning and building in person and request a zoning map for the area. This will let you see how the property is zoned. The clerk in the office or a zoning officer will be able to answer many of your questions about how the property is zoned and whether you will need to apply for a variance, or a request to break the set zoning law. [10] X Research source Your local government may have developed long-range plans that impact the way property is zoned. If your request to rezone property doesn’t align with the long-term goals of the municipality, it might be difficult to get the variance. [11] X Research source"
