      "content": "Self-cleaning litter boxes use motors and sensors to clean the litter after your cat uses the box. The sensors in a self-cleaning litter box detect when your cat leaves the device. When the cat exits, the cleaning cycle begins immediately. Electric motors activate the cleaning mechanism and the waste compartment sifts, rakes, flushes, or otherwise deposits the feline waste into a special compartment. [1] X Research source Eventually, the compartment will fill with waste, and you must empty it into the garbage. However, you’ll most likely only have to empty this waste bin about once a week, which is much less frequent than the daily scooping of a traditional litter box. Keep in mind that because self-cleaning litter boxes are motorized, most of them must be plugged into an electrical outlet in order to work."

Although a self-cleaning litter box still requires you to empty and refresh it every once in a while, it’s much easier and requires less maintenance than a traditional litter box.

You’ll want to choose the device type that’s best for you, so we’ve provided a summary below: [6] X Research source Sifting Automatic Litter Boxes : Conveyor-belt system for sifting waste. Generally the quietest option with the least waste contact. Sweeping Automatic Litter Boxes : Raking system for sifting waste. Very little waste contact, although you will have to clean the rake itself from time to time. Flushing Automatic Litter Boxes : Scoops, liquefies, and flushes feline wastes out of your home. Most mess-free option, but requires most special products and set-up. Hybrid Litter Boxes : Uses pellets and pads to collect cat waste. Solid waste must still be disposed of daily, but liquid waste only needs to be taken care of once a month."

      "content": "Litter compatibility Some automatic litter boxes require self-clumping litter, while others require specially-designed litter like silica gel crystals. If your automatic litter box only accepts a certain type of litter, make sure that your cat is comfortable with that litter before purchasing. Also, make sure that any specific litters are within your budget for repeated purchases in the future. [7] X Research source For added flexibility, look for a litter box that allows several different types and brands of litter—that way, your cat will be able to use the litter that they feel most comfortable with. Any standard-weight, clay-based clumping litter will work well with the PetSnowy SNOW+ Self-Cleaning Litter Box and ensure that it functions at top performance. Avoid litters designed solely for absorption, non-clumping litters, newspaper-based litters, and absorbent wood pellet litters."

So, it’s crucial to choose a box that fits your needs and time constraints. Look at each box’s product specifications to see how often it needs to be emptied and deep-cleaned. [8] X Research source If the product uses a mechanical rake, this can also make for an additional thing to clean, versus rotating litter boxes that sift out waste without using a rake. The PetSnowy SNOW+ actually uses patented technology to make maintenance and clean-up easier. Their automatic litter box features a unique packing design so that the litter is neatly packed up for you before you empty the tray. You won’t even have to look at the litter! Plus, the SNOW+ features a magnetic assembly system that facilitates easy setup, disassembly, and cleaning."

Depending on each unit’s construction, some are better than others at reducing odors in your home. Some automatic litter boxes even come with special features like UV sanitizing lights and filters to fight odors. While standard odor control systems rely on simply masking or absorbing smells, PetSnowy SNOW+ utilizes a triple deodorization system that actively works to get rid of odors. The SNOW+ triple deodorization system includes a fragrance insert, UV light, and TiO2 photocatalyst. Together, these features chemically neutralize ammonia gas and deactivate viruses and bacteria for long-lasting odor control."

Look into your desired product—does the company mention how many decibels their product operates at (e.g., PetSnowy’s runs at 53db, equivalent to a quiet office space)? Do reviews comment on the volume of the device? Take these factors into consideration as you make your choice. [9] X Research source"

Check the dimensions of the footprint, height, and entrance opening, and make sure that your cat will have plenty of space to move and turn around comfortably. Then, measure the space you hope to place your litter box in to make sure it will fit. [10] X Research source It may be a good idea to buy or construct a cardboard box with the same dimensions as whatever litter box you’re eyeing. Then, you can compare it to your cat’s size and make sure it won’t get in the way of your daily life. Along with dimensions, try to find an automatic litter box that you like the look of. Many modern devices come with sleek, minimalist designs to make your cat’s restroom into less of an eyesore."

Check how long you’ll have to return your litter box for a full refund, and keep all of your packaging in the meantime. Since not all cats are happy with an automatic litter box, it’s crucial to have a long enough return window that your cat has time to adjust to the box. That’s why PetSnowy offers a 12-month warranty with a 30-day trial—your cat will have plenty of time to make their choice clear!"

      "content": "Clean a self-cleaning litter box by removing and emptying the waste compartment. Most self-cleaning litter boxes have a small container where your cat’s waste is disposed of. Depending on the amount of cats you have, you’ll likely have to empty this container and top off the litter every 1-2 weeks. However, you may also want to deep clean the unit and completely refresh the litter every 3-6 weeks. Every model is different, so follow the specific cleaning (and deep cleaning) instructions for your chosen self-cleaning litter box. If cleaning up litter is really not your thing, look for boxes with innovative features like this patented self-packing design unique to the PetSnowy SNOW+. To deep clean the SNOW+ , remove the top of the device and sweep any remaining waste into the litter compartment. Then, remove the waste bag to seamlessly clean out the litter before disinfecting according to manufacturer instructions. This cleaning process can take less than 15 minutes and only needs to be done every few months—plus, the PetSnowy app lets you set up automatic cleaning schedules to make sure that you always have a fresh litter box for your feline friend."

Keep the self-cleaning unit unplugged or in “off” mode until the cat begins to use it regularly—just scoop it as you would a regular box. [13] X Research source Let your cat take their time to explore their new litter box, and you can take away the traditional one once they show a clear preference for the new one. Pay attention to your cat’s behavior as they get used to the new litter box. They may be tentative at first but should get used to the new sounds, smells, and routines over time. If your cat never chooses to use the new litter box, that’s completely normal, but you’ll probably have to return to a traditional litter tray!"
