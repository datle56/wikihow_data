      "title": "She gets really angry if she feels disrespected or betrayed.",
      "content": "She gets really angry if she feels disrespected or betrayed. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet of aggression. It might seem like she's always looking for a fight, but she's really just self-aware. If she suspects that you're offending her or not being honest with her, she will call you out on it. Aries is also a cardinal sign, which is the first sign of a new season. This means she likes to take action. An Aries woman swiftly reacts to conflicts or problems—she's not afraid to make moves!"

      "title": "She can get angry if she doesn't get her way.",
      "content": "She can get angry if she doesn't get her way. Aries is highly competitive and loves winning. Usually, this makes for friendly competition, but if she feels like you've got the better of her, she might take it out on you. You may be alarmed at how something trivial can make her temper flare up—this is totally normal for a passionate sign like Aries. [1] X Research source For instance, she may take it out on you if it's her turn to pick a restaurant, but her restaurant is closed and your choice is available. Obviously, it's out of your hands, but she'll get angry at you because she's not getting her way."

      "title": "She can get upset or argumentative if she's bored in the relationship.",
      "content": "She can get upset or argumentative if she's bored in the relationship. To her, fighting is a way to add a spark of passion when things between you seem dull. In her mind, confrontation, intense feelings, and making up can inject energy into your relationship. [2] X Research source This is especially true if it feels like things between you two have settled into a routine or you haven't fought in a while. Aries is spontaneous, so to prevent her anger, try to surprise her with fun activities or dates that you've planned."

      "title": "An Aries woman can get angry if she feels like she's not important to you.",
      "content": "An Aries woman can get angry if she feels like she's not important to you. Aries is a remarkably independent but loyal sign, so it's a big deal to her if she's in a relationship. You've got to make her feel like she's the most valuable relationship in your life. She also wants to feel like you're pursuing her. If she doesn't feel special or doesn't think you're trying very hard, she will be very upset and you'll know it! Aries doesn't expect you to chase too hard, because she likes to be the one in charge. However, she wants to see you put in the effort."

    {
      "title": "She'll be direct and tell you that something's wrong.",
      "content": "She'll be direct and tell you that something's wrong. An Aries woman is a very straightforward sign. Aries is the sign of the ram and she's not afraid to butt heads. She will let you know that she's angry—her temper will probably flare up and she'll be explosively upset. Remember, her sign is governed by Mars, which is also the sign of war. It's her nature to not back down or give up any fight, no matter what her instincts tell her."

    {
      "title": "She may act indifferent or give you the cold shoulder.",
      "content": "She may act indifferent or give you the cold shoulder. Although she's more likely to get really worked up, she can go radio silent if she feels provoked. She might stop communicating with you altogether—no calls, texts, messages. This is a clear sign she wants to put some space between you. Don't try to reach out immediately. It's better to give her some room to process her emotions before you try to connect with her."
    },
    {
      "title": "If she's really angry, she might end the relationship.",
      "content": "If she's really angry, she might end the relationship. This is her nuclear option. If she is just over the relationship, she'll make it very clear that she's done. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to change her mind at that point. She may no longer be satisfied with frequent arguments or she might have lost all interest in maintaining the relationship."

    {
      "title": "Stay calm and don't try to argue with her.",
      "content": "Stay calm and don't try to argue with her. It's so easy to get into a fight with an Aries woman—she likes a challenge and she loves to pick a fight. Unfortunately, arguments with Aries tend to escalate. When her temper explodes, do not try to engage in a conversation or argument with her. Take a few deep breaths, count to 10, or visualize a peaceful scene to help you stay calm. You might be alarmed at how quickly she gets angry, but keep in mind that her temper fades just as quickly. This is why it's better to let her anger pass before you try to talk with her."

      "content": "Walk away and give her space to cool down. The best thing you can do is to give her some room. [3] X Research source Aries need a lot of space. This gives her a chance to think and be in her own head. She may need a few hours or the rest of the day to think—just give her space and let her come to you. You could say something like, \"I think you need a little space to yourself right now,\" or, \"I'm going to go and give you some room.\""

      "content": "Keep the lines of communication open, so she can talk when she's ready. Don't try to punish your Aries woman by giving her the cold shoulder when she does reach out. Aries is a sign that's quick to forgive and move on. Respond as soon as she reaches out, so she knows you two can talk. For example, if she texts you, don't wait to text her back. Reply and let her know you're available."

      "title": "Listen as she tells you why she was upset.",
      "content": "Listen as she tells you why she was upset. Pay complete attention when she decides she's ready to open up and reveal what made her angry.

      "content": "Offer a sincere apology or rationally share your side of the situation. If you were in the wrong, give her a genuine apology . Aries appreciates being listened to and respected, so an apology usually patches things over. If you weren't in the wrong, calmly explain your viewpoint—don't show weakness, since an Aries woman values strength. For instance, you might say, \"I had no idea you wanted to hang out. In the future, just tell me when you want to meet up,\" instead of, \"I guess I should have cleared my evening with you first. It won't happen again.\""

      "title": "Show her love and respect as you move forward together.",
      "content": "Show her love and respect as you move forward together. It can be surprising how quickly Aries forgives and forgets. You may still be thinking about the huge fight, but she's already moved on. Let yourself go with the flow, and work on communicating clearly in the future. In the days after a fight, make time to enjoy each other's company. Go on fun dates, get physically active, or take a trip. These can all strengthen your bond."
