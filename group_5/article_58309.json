      "content": "Platonic marriage is a non-sexual or non-romantic legal union. This doesn’t mean that you’re “just friends”—platonic relationships are usually with a person you have a close bond with and who has your trust, confidence, and loyalty. Some couples give each other the freedom to date outside of their marriage, while other partners identify as asexual and don’t have any interest in pursuing that kind of relationship with anyone, including their spouse.

      "content": "Platonic marriages are completely legal. State marriage licenses don’t ask if people who decide to marry are sexually or romantically involved with each other, and because of same-sex marriage legalization, friends of any sex can marry. When you marry, the state only asks if the commitment is authentic and requires that you be honest about your name, birthday, and other legal information. [2] X Research source This means that platonic married couples can get divorced just like traditional marriage couples can. These divorces tend to be more amicable because both people were friends first and don’t split up because someone cheated or lost interest in the other person. International marriages follow different guidelines, and may require a Green Card interview to investigate if the marriage is “authentic.” In this case, platonic marriage might not be a viable option.
