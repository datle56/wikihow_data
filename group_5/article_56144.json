      "content": "Determine load. Based on the load you want to serve, (meaning how much current in amps will be needed from the outlets) a 14-2 Romex® cable, which is a relatively thin cable suitable for up to 15 amps (or 12 amps continuous load) could be selected. Otherwise, a 12-2 Romex® cable, which is one size larger than 14-2 Romex® cable and suitable for up to 20 amp circuits (or 16 amps continuous load) is the other size cable installed for outlets. Most home's outlets are wired with 14-2 Romex®, that supply up to 8 outlets per circuit. Oversimplified, the National Electrical Code (NEC) mandates outlets in the kitchen and dining room must be served by 20 amp circuits. A 12-2 Romex® circuit would provide for this (installing a 30 amp dryer outlet or 50 amp range / welding outlet is beyond the scope of this article, but is similar)."

      "content": "Inspect your breaker box prior to running a new cable to make sure you have additional space for breakers. It is best to identify what type of panel you have and whether or not the breakers are available or obsolete. Part of this process involves removing the dead front assembly (the door over your breakers) and looking inside at the bussing. This can potentially be dangerous if you accidentally short out the metal plate to the bussing in the panel. Depending on the type of panel it can be relatively simple or very hazardous. Murray or Bryant type panels usually are the safest to install into. If your panel happens to be a Zinsco, Stablok or Pushmatic you can set yourself up for serious problems trying to do this yourself. For instance on Pushmatic panels the bussing is usually energized. Without the proper knowledge you could accidentally short the bussing out and cause a catastrophic failure (phase to ground or phase to phase short). The symmetrical amperage faults available are only limited by the primary fusing on the transformer and the overall design of the system. Just something to keep in mind when doing this job yourself. I would recommend disconnecting power and removing the meter and ring if possible to eliminate hazards. This too is often outside the scope of do it yourself type work."

Use of plastic or fiber electrical boxes are quicker to work than steel boxes because they do not require additional grounding. A steel box must be grounded so that it does not require the device for it to be grounded (pigtailing the ground to the device AND the box solves this)."

(24\" by 15\" panel would need 24\" x 3 = 72\" or 6 feet of slack). Again, strip the entire jacket except to allow for about an inch of jacket cable inside the panel . Install the Romex® connector into the panel's 1/2\" k o according to instructions. Wrap the end of the cable with a couple of turns of electrical tape. Push the cable through the connector and help pull it with your other hand once it enters the panel. This push / pull motion speeds installation and reduces risk of damaging the insulation. Once about an inch of jacketed cable is INSIDE the panel, stop advancing cable, and secure it within 18\" of the panel with an insulated staple."

You never know when you might have to move the circuit to a different location in the panel, having enough wire to do so will make the job much easier. Set the handle of the circuit breaker to OFF. Install the circuit breaker into the panel by first hooking or clipping to the grounded or insulated slot or rail (manufacturer dependent) on the outboard side of the insulated electrical contacts, then line up the clip or slot of the circuit breaker with the electrical contact rail or bus. Press the circuit breaker firmly into the panel. Some styles \"click\" into place others just \"bottom out\".
