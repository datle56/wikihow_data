      "content": "The term grew online thanks to the “Gripping Food with Force” trend. In 2020, an internet trend in which users posted photos or videos of themselves grasping food forcefully took off. The posts were captioned with “bussin’,” referring to how delicious their food was, and the term spread widely. [3] X Research source The food-gripping trend eventually died, but the popularity of “bussin’” lives on. The term spread more widely in 2021 after TikTok users began trolling keto food vlogger Janelle Roehner. TikTok user rondeucedeleuche stitched one of her videos in which she eats a bell pepper sandwich with footage of him asking, \"Is it bussin’?\" and the trend took off. The term gained popularity as a synonym for \"delicious,\" but over time it turned into a descriptor for anything awesome, food or not."
