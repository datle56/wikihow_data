      "content": "You should wait at least 3 days before you have sex. Recovering from a vasectomy usually doesn’t take a super long time. You may have pain, swelling, and tenderness for the first few days, but as long as you keep the incision dry and clean, and avoid heavy lifting or activities that require a lot of straining for the first 2 days, you should be able to both have sex and ejaculate by the third day. If you aren’t having any discomfort by then, you should be all set! Keep in mind that a vasectomy isn’t immediately effective. Your partner can still get pregnant for the first 15-20 ejaculations after the procedure. Don’t have unprotected sex until your doctor confirms that there are no sperm in your semen.

      "content": "Talk to your doctor to make sure it’s safe before you do. Even though vasectomies generally heal up pretty quickly, every situation and every person is different. Your doctor may recommend that you wait a week or so before you actually have sex so you don’t injure or damage yourself. Just to be safe, talk to your doctor before you start having sex again after your vasectomy so you don’t jeopardize the healing process. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should rest to recover from a vasectomy. Spend several days away from exertional physical activity and ice the area on and off as needed for discomfort. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Avoid sexual activity or any heavy lifting over ten pounds for the first week. Avoid blood thinners like aspirin for the first few days after your procedure.

      "content": "No, an ejaculation shouldn’t be painful after a vasectomy. Once you’re all healed up from the procedure, you shouldn’t notice any differences or have any pain when you ejaculate. However, if you’re still swollen or tender after the operation, the muscle contractions that are involved in ejaculating could feel uncomfortable. But again, if you’re fully healed, you shouldn’t have any pain. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

      "content": "Yes! After you heal from the procedure, you actually won’t notice any differences in your sexual function or pleasure. You’ll be able to orgasm just as you did before you had the vasectomy. The only thing that changes is you won’t have any sperm whenever you ejaculate. So if you’re worried about being able to orgasm if you have a vasectomy, don’t be! Within a week after the operation, you’ll be back to normal. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Sex will feel the same, but you may enjoy it more. A vasectomy doesn’t actually change anything other than the fact that when you ejaculate, there won’t be any sperm. But if you and your partner aren’t worried about an unplanned pregnancy, you may find that you have sex more often and that it’s more satisfying. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "The truth is, nothing will be any different after your vasectomy. Sure, you won’t have sperm when you ejaculate. But as far as your sex life goes, including how long you can last, everything will be just as it was before. You’ll still be able to have pleasurable sex, ejaculate, and have everything feel the same. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Nope, you’ll feel exactly like you did before your vasectomy. All that happens is your doctor will make a small incision to your urethra, which prevents your sperm from entering your semen and getting out of your body. That’s it! Nothing else will be affected. You’ll still have the same level of testosterone and the same sex drive as you did before.

      "content": "It usually takes about 15-20 ejaculates to flush out any leftover sperm. After your vasectomy, you’ll still have a fair amount of sperm leftover that could potentially cause a pregnancy. Once you’re fully healed from the procedure, you can start resuming your normal sexual activities. However, you need to wait until at least 15 ejaculations to feel confident that the remaining sperm is all gone. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Give a semen sample after 2-3 months to be sure. The only way to be sure that you aren’t still ejaculating sperm is to have a sample analyzed. In fact, your doctor will likely schedule an appointment for you to come in and provide a sample so they can be sure that the procedure was effective. Once your semen is analyzed and it’s confirmed that there isn’t any sperm, you should be all set! [11] X Research source"

In fact, it doesn’t really involve your testes at all, which is why your testosterone levels aren’t affected either. When your urethra is cut in the procedure, the sperm simply can’t get out of your body. Eventually, they’ll simply be reabsorbed. You won’t even notice it.
