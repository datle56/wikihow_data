      "content": "Add hair to the left-most section and braid again. Now that the traditional start of the braid is done, it’s time to start adding hair to make it a French braid. Pull a small strand of hair next to the left-most section and add it to the section before crossing the section into the middle (as you did before). The section will now be slightly larger than the rest. Because you have short hair, it’ll be easiest to grab hair closest to the braid rather than hair closer to your hairline."

      "title": "Continue braiding until there’s no more hair to add.",
      "content": "Continue braiding until there’s no more hair to add. Because your hair is shorter, you may run out of hair to add quicker, and that’s okay! Keep adding and braiding the hair until there’s nothing left to add. Then, tie off the braid with an elastic. Use bobby pins and hairspray to pin back any stragglers. Stray hairs can also be tucked back into the braid. Try tucking the tail of your braid up into the back of the braid at the base of your neck."

[1] X Research source For this style, you'll need to create two standard braids along the front sides of your head. These braids should roughly mirror one another in position, width, and length. This style is good for very short hair, as you can decide to braid only a portion of your short hair if you don’t have enough hair to pull all the way back."

[5] X Research source For this look, you'll create a partial French braid that drapes down along one side of your head. As you form the braid, some hair will be left hanging down from beneath it, creating a “waterfall” effect. This style may be better for individuals with hair that comes to at least their shoulders or just above them."

[9] X Research source To make a halo braid , you'll create one French braid on either side of the part along the lower hairline. Afterward, you secure the 2 braids together, forming the shape of a crown. This style is also known as an “around the world” braid.

[13] X Research source Continue French braiding down the side of your head. Work around the entire lower hairline, drawing in all of the hair from beneath your braid as you do.

This can help your braid look fuller and messier. [16] X Research source Only pull on each braid enough to give it more body. Do not pull hard enough to completely undo the braid. If the top of your head looks too flat or slick, carefully swipe your hand over the hair, working it back and forth several times. Doing so should gently loosen and volumize the hair, making it messy and natural without destroying the braid. Skip over the sides and focus on the front and back of the braid. Doing so will add volume to the braid without sacrificing an appealing face shape."

      "content": "Do side braids for a uniform look. This is an easy option for afro-textured or natural hair, as it only requires you to know how to do simple braids. Because afro-textured hair can be very thick and tricky to work with, many people do small side braids in a row rather than 2 larger side braids. Start with one section and do a small braid with 1/4 of the hair on one side. Start the braid just above your ear, at the top of your hairline. Collect hair as you braid, forming a small braid that lies flat against your scalp. Pull the hair so it is taunt. Once the braid is done, use a bobby pin to secure it. Then, make another small braid above the braid you just created. Make sure the braid starts right at your hairline and is parallel to the first braid. Secure this braid with a bobby pin. Finish with one more small braid above the second braid. Start at your hairline and move parallel to the second braid. There should now be 3 braids on one side of your hair, forming diagonal lines. Repeat these steps on the other side of your head."

      "content": "Try a top mohawk with braids. This option is a more elaborate braided hairstyle and may require a second set of hands or help from a professional. If you’re experienced with braiding, you may be able to do this one at home following these steps: Divide your hair into 4 sections and pin each section back with a hair clip. Unclip the section at the front end of your hair, right above your ear. Then, braid a small section of the hair above your ear, moving upward. Pull the hair taunt as you braid upward. You want the braids to be as vertical as possible. When you reach the top of your head, pin the braid and then let the rest of your hair sit on your head. Move on to braid the next small section of the front section of your hair. Make the braid vertical and tight, leaving the remaining hair from the braid loose once you reach the top of your head. Repeat these steps, moving from section to section of your hair. The braids should all be vertical and in line with each other. Keep the hair at the end of the braids loose and let it sit on your head. This hair will act as the top mohawk."
