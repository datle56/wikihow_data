      "content": "Know the venue. Before choosing what to wear to a concert, you should figure out what type of concert you'll be attending, such as whether it’s inside or outside, if it’s a large or small venue, and what time of year the concert will be taking place. [1] X Research source The type and location of the concert can help you dress appropriately, and will guide you when selecting your outfit. Even for indoor concerts, the time of year still matters because you’ll have to comfortably get to and from the venue. If it’s the middle of winter and below zero outside, you may have to reconsider wearing sandals and shorts. Similarly, if it’s summertime, you may not want to wear a full leather outfit, even if the concert will be in an air-conditioned building. Indoor concerts at a small venue will get hot very quickly, while concerts at large arenas may stay cooler. Outdoor concerts usually only happen in warmer weather, so make sure you go prepared with hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and plenty of water."

      "title": "Layer your clothes.",
      "content": "Layer your clothes. Wearing a layered outfit is always a good idea when there are possible weather and temperature variables involved, because layers mean you can take clothes off if you get too warm, and can put them back on if you get cold. To dress for a rock concert, think about your layered clothes in terms of a cohesive outfit. When choosing colors, opt for a mostly dark outfit with a few accents in a bold color. For instance, you can wear black pants and red shoes with a black sweater layered over a bright red tank top or T-shirt."

      "title": "Select a top.",
      "content": "Select a top. There are a few different styles of tops or shirts you can wear to a rock concert, but one of the main things to keep in mind is comfort. Especially if you'll be dancing or moshing, you want to choose breathable clothes that are easy to move around in. A classic shirt for a rock, punk, or grunge concert is a dark T-shirt or tank top. For a slightly more fashionable look, consider a fitted V-neck tee in black or dark gray. To achieve a more goth or glam rock look, consider a corset, or a fishnet top for men or women. If you're going to wear a band T-shirt to the concert, wear a shirt for a band other than the one you're going to see. [2] X Research source You may want to avoid a dress, skirt, or kilt if you plan to stage dive or crowd surf, [3] X Research source or consider wearing shorts underneath."

      "content": "Find bottoms to complete the ensemble. Weather can be a big factor when choosing bottoms for a concert, but jeans or basic black pants are always a popular choice. Other options include: Shorts Cut-off shorts, a skirt, a dress, or a long sweater paired with leggings Black, gray, or dark blue jeans or skinny jeans Leather or pleather leggings (best reserved for the cooler months) [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a jacket.",
      "content": "Pick a jacket. A top layer over your shirt is a great way to layer your clothes for a concert, and gives you the opportunity to add more style to your look. If you get too warm, you can always check your top layer. Good top layers include a: Cropped and fitted pleather or leather jacket Thin and unlined blazer Knit sweater Hoodie"

      "title": "Choose the right footwear.",
      "content": "Choose the right footwear. Footwear is key at a concert, especially if you're going to be standing for the duration of the event, dancing, or moshing. Ideally, you want sturdy shoes that are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Boots, such as Dr. Martens or combat boots, are a good choice [5] X Research source Running shoes, sneakers, or skater shoes can be comfortable and stylish when paired with the right outfit Avoid dress shoes, which may be uncomfortable after hours of standing Avoid flip flops, which don’t provide any support for your feet, and instead opt for sandals if you want to wear warm-weather shoes [6] X Research source Avoid high heels, but if you must wear them, opt for shoes with a chunky heel."

      "title": "Style your hair.",
      "content": "Style your hair. There are many ways you can style your hair that will be appropriate at a rock concert, and you can be a little more creative than you might otherwise feel comfortable doing. Sticking with your natural hair is always a safe bet, especially if you're going to be getting hot and sweaty. For instance, don’t try to straighten curly hair or curl straight hair, as the heat and humidity at the concert may ruin your style. For a more hard core or punk look, try teasing out short hair or spiking it up. If you’re a dancer or mosher with long hair, consider tying your hair into a ponytail, bun, or braid to keep it out of your face."

      "title": "Do your makeup.",
      "content": "Do your makeup. There's no rule saying you have to wear makeup to a rock concert, but if you choose to, you have several options. Keep the makeup to a minimum, though, especially if you plan on dancing, or you may just sweat it all off! [7] X Research source Thick mascara and smudged black eyeliner is always a safe choice for a rock look. For the lips, try a pale or pinkish lipstick or gloss. If you're feeling bold, go for a lipstick or nail polish in black or bright red. Guys at rock concerts will sometimes sport black lipstick and thick, smudged eyeliner in black or dark gray."

      "title": "Pick a bag.",
      "content": "Pick a bag. Clothes with deep or zippered pockets are great, and mean you can get away with not taking a purse or bag. But if your clothes don’t have such pockets, you may need a bag to store important stuff, like your keys, phone, and wallet. Opt for a small and sturdy bag that goes over the shoulder or across the body, like a messenger bag. This will ensure it stays out of your way if you're dancing, and makes it harder for someone to steal. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try some bold jewelry.",
      "content": "Try some bold jewelry. Thick, metal, and chunky jewelry is optimal for rock concert chic. For durability and the aesthetic, avoid delicate or fine jewelry, and for safety reasons, stay away from anything too long or dangly. A metal bracelet or bangles can be a nice touch on a concert outfit, but chunky wrist cuffs work just as well for guys and girls. A short necklace with a bold design or pendant is also a great choice, or a thick metal chain with a symbol or emblem hanging from it for guys."

      "content": "Opt for the right style of accessory. When it comes to dressing for a rock concert, you can't go wrong with clothes and accessories that are pleather/leather, metal, studded, or decorated with skulls. This includes: Thick, bold belts with lots of metal [9] X Research source Studded leather jackets, boots, and bags Scarves and shirts with skulls"
