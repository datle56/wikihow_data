Or, plant lavender in certain areas where you tend to see scorpions on your property.

      "content": "This removes natural bridges that scorpions can use to get inside. Prune trees so their branches are not touching the sides of your home. That way, scorpions are less likely to find their way into your attic or through an open window. [6] X Research source Scorpions sometimes like to hang out in the shade underneath trees. Be careful when you’re pruning in case there are any nearby."

      "content": "Food scraps attract insects that scorpions feed on. Always sweep up crumbs, spilled pet food, and other scraps from inside and outside your home. Dispose of food scraps in a sealed trash can where insects can’t get to it. [7] X Research source If you have fruit trees, clean up any fallen fruit around your yard so it doesn’t rot and attract bugs."

Walk slowly around the outside of your home and look for holes and gaps, especially around windows, doors, and the foundation. [8] X Expert Source Samuel Ramsey, PhD Entomologist Expert Interview. 20 January 2021. Seal everything up with caulk or spray foam.

      "content": "This way, your lights attract less insects that scorpions like to eat. Change all your outdoor light bulbs to warm, yellow bulbs to attract fewer bugs. Leave your lights off when you’re not using them. [11] X Research source Note that yellow light doesn’t deter insects, it just attracts them less than white light does."

      "content": "This can shift populations away from your property. Wear protective clothing and gloves when hunting for scorpions. Pick a scorpion up with a long pair of kitchen tongs and pit it inside a jar. Seal the jar securely and transport the scorpion far away to an undisturbed natural habitat. [12] X Research source Scorpions come out more at night and they glow in the dark under black UV light. Buy a black light and go looking for scorpions at night to find more that you can catch and relocate."

Repair leaky faucets and any other leaks in your home. [13] X Research source If you have any roof leaks, fix those as well so water doesn’t accumulate in your attic. If you have pets, leave water dishes empty at night or elevate them somewhere that scorpions can’t reach them."
