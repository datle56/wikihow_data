      "content": "Buy wind deflectors made for your car model. Wind deflectors are specially designed for different car models. Make sure that the wind deflectors you buy are suitable for your car. If you purchase the wrong kind, you will not be able to achieve a perfect fit. You can find the car model information on the wind deflector's packaging. If you're not sure what kind to buy, ask a salesperson for advice."

      "content": "Roll your window down. To fit the wind deflector in, you will need to roll your window at least halfway down. If your window does not roll down to the bottom, you can still fit your deflector in but may not be able to clean your window as thoroughly. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the window frame and channel.",
      "content": "Clean the window frame and channel. Spray a window cleaner or mild solvent over the tops and sides of the window and wipe it off with a paper towel or dry cloth. Rub off any dirt, dust, or debris in the window frame so your wind deflector will fit in securely. [2] X Research source If you are installing an adhesive wind deflector, clean off the window's trim (the painted door frame to the top and sides of the window) with the cleaner and dry cloth."

      "content": "Use a damp cloth or screwdriver to scrape dirt away from the bottom of the frame. Pull your cloth through the slot and pick out any large pieces of debris that might be stuck in the slot. If you cannot pull out the debris using the cloth, pick it out with a screwdriver instead.

      "content": "Let the window frame dry before fitting in the deflector. If you install the deflector while the window frame is still wet, your deflector may not attach as tightly. Give the windows time to air dry or wipe the frame and slot down with a dry towel before you prepare your wind deflector. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Attach any window clips, if applicable.",
      "content": "Attach any window clips, if applicable. Some wind deflectors come with clips to adhere the wind deflector's edges in place. If your wind deflector comes with any clips, push them up between the deflector and the window to fasten it in place. [6] X Research source Your wind deflector's instructions should indicate where, specifically, to put the clips in."

      "title": "Check the window for obstructions.",
      "content": "Check the window for obstructions. After you have put the deflector in place, roll the window up to check that it still works properly. If your window cannot roll up, try adjusting the wind deflector to shift it out of the way. [7] X Research source This is especially important for electric windows, which may refuse to roll up if they sense an obstruction in the way. If you adjust the wind deflector, be careful not to force it in any position, as you may accidentally damage it."

      "content": "Keep your window rolled up for 24 hours. Roll the window back up after you've finished adjusting its alignment and let it sit for at least 24 hours. This will give the wind deflector enough time to mold into the window so it will stay in place."

      "content": "Use a maintenance spray on the window if it works slowly. If your wind deflector seems to slow your windows down, use maintenance spray around the window channels and slot to keep it from catching on the frame while rolling up or down.
