      "content": "Bathe yourself daily. Regular bathing eliminates body odors and kills the bacteria that causes bad smells. [1] X Research source Use a mild soap and a loofa or washcloth to clean your body while showering. Look for soaps that advertise as “gentle,” “fragrance-free,” and all-natural. These soaps will be less likely to irritate your skin. If your soap causes any skin irritation, stop using the soap and call your doctor. If you’re concerned about body odors, apply deodorant after showering. Deodorant can be purchased at most pharmacies and grocery stores."

      "content": "Groom your nails. If you don’t have clean nails, you won’t look clean. First, use a nail cutter to trim your nails. Next, use a nail file to soften any sharp edges. If there’s dirt underneath your nails, wash your nails with a soft brush, soap, and water. Alternatively, use a toothpick to scrape any debris out from under your nail. Scrub away stains by mixing a small amount of baking soda with water to create a paste. Rub the paste on your nails with an old toothbrush and rinse it off. Resist the urge to bite your fingernails. This can cause fungal infections in your nail beds. [10] X Research source"

If you don’t want to spend time on your hair, get a low-maintenance haircut. While you’re at the salon or barbershop, tell your stylist that you’re interested in a low-maintenance hairstyle. [11] X Research source For example: Ask your barber for a short, messy haircut that will look good without any special styling. If you want a longer haircut from a salon, ask for a style that will compliment your hair’s natural texture. All you will have to do is brush it."

Jeans, pants, and bras can be worn two to three times before washing. However, if you sweat a lot in your clothing, wash it before wearing it again. For example, any clothes worn while you exercise should be washed after the first wear. [12] X Research source Hang up or fold dry laundry immediately to prevent wrinkling. Look on the tag of your clothing for washing and drying instructions. If you're looking to freshen up your style, think about other people whose style you admire, as well as how you want to feel in your clothing—then, use that to guide you as you choose new clothes."
