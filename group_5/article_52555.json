      "content": "Soak the chickpeas in cold water for at least 6 hours. You should soak 1 cup of dried chickpeas in cold water overnight, or even for 24 hours to get the best results. Alternately, if you're short on time, you can just use a can of chickpeas instead of completing the soaking process, but your dish won't be quite as tasty."

      "title": "Cook the chickpeas in a pressure cooker.",
      "content": "Cook the chickpeas in a pressure cooker. After you've soaked the chickpeas, also known as channa, you can drain and rinse them before placing them in a pressure cooker. Pour just enough water to cover the chickpeas into the pressure cooker. Place 1 tablespoon of salt and 2 bay leaves in the cooker and cook the chana for about 20 minutes, until it is just a bit tender; the chickpeas will soften up more after you fry them. You can also use a heavy saucepan if you don't have a pressure cooker."
