      "content": "Rotate the clock so that the large arrow points to the current time. Turn the yellow clock dial clockwise with your hand until the large arrow facing down points at the current time. It’s important to set this time as accurately as possible so that the timer works at the exact times you want it to. [2] X Research source The dial only turns clockwise, so if you pass the correct time just keep turning it until you get there again. Each line between numbers on the clock represents an interval of 20 minutes. Don’t ever unscrew the arrow for the current time or you will throw off the timer."

Slide the “off” arrow to the time you want it to turn off at.
