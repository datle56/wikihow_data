      "content": "Remove your frozen chicken pieces from their original packaging. Remove the plastic wrap, styrofoam dish, and the absorbent pad that the chicken sits on. These materials may not be microwavable, so you don’t want them to melt or get damaged in your microwave. [1] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source If you got your chicken directly from a butcher counter, remove the butcher’s paper or plastic that it’s wrapped in. Avoid defrosting whole chickens and legs in the microwave. The bones, skin, and other materials won’t defrost correctly, and the meat may taste rubbery when you cook it."

      "content": "Place your chicken on a microwave-safe dish. Choose a microwave-safe plastic tub, bowl, or plate with high sides. The chicken may leak fluid as it thaws, so you’ll want those fluids to have somewhere to collect without spilling. [2] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source Avoid putting your chicken directly onto the glass dish that comes with your microwave (or onto the bottom of your microwave, if it didn’t come with a dish). It’s best not to defrost your chicken on a paper plate or anything absorbent, since the chicken will leak fluid as it thaws."

      "content": "Select the defrost button (or set your microwave to 30% power). Use the defrost button if your microwave has one. Otherwise, use 30% power. Either option will slowly heat your chicken without cooking it. If you use a higher power setting, the outer parts of your chicken might begin to cook before the inside is fully thawed. [3] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source If your microwave has a dial for its power setting, turn the dial to roughly ¼ of the way above the lowest setting. This 30% power recommendation is based on a standard microwave, which uses about 800-1000 watts of power. If your microwave has a lower wattage than this, try a 40% or 50% power setting. Check the product label on your microwave (printed on the back, or on the inside of the door) to confirm its wattage. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave your chicken for 7 minutes per lb. (or 14 min per kg). For example, if you are defrosting 3 lbs. (1.5 kg) of chicken, you should defrost it for a total of 21 minutes. [5] X Research source If your chicken is broken up into pieces, stop the microwave every 2 minutes and pull the frozen pieces apart. This helps them defrost more evenly."

      "content": "Make a small cut to check that the inside of the chicken is defrosted. Use a sharp knife to cut into the thickest part of the chicken. If it’s fully defrosted, you should see no ice crystals in the middle. If you do see ice crystals, put your chicken back in the microwave for another 2 minutes. Then check again by using a knife to cut a different, thick part of the chicken. Repeat this process until the chicken is fully thawed. [6] X Research source Be sure to set your microwave to “defrost” (or 30% power) each time. Cook your chicken immediately after defrosting it. There’s a high risk of bacteria and other foodborne illnesses in warm chicken, so it’s safest to prepare and cook it right away.

      "title": "Defrosting a whole chicken in the microwave is not recommended.",
      "content": "Defrosting a whole chicken in the microwave is not recommended. Since it takes a long time, there’s a much higher chance of bacteria growing as parts of the chicken slowly warm up. It’s also very hard to defrost a whole chicken in the microwave without cooking part of it, since there’s a large amount of meat, bones, and other materials that may defrost at different rates. [8] X Research source Defrost whole chickens in the fridge over several nights. A whole chicken requires 5 hours per lb. (10 hours per kg) to fully defrost. You can also defrost whole chickens in cold water. A whole chicken requires 1 hour per lb. (2 hours per kg) to fully defrost. [9] X Research source"

The benefit of this method is that the chicken never gets too warm, which helps prevent foodborne illness. However, this method also takes the longest. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Never thaw your chicken at room temperature due to the risk of bacteria. Always place the chicken in another pan or plate before putting it in the fridge, even if it’s already in a styrofoam container. This will prevent chicken juices from dripping in your fridge."

Replace the water every 30 minutes to ensure that water doesn’t get too cold, since this could slow the thawing process. After 2 hours, use a knife to cut into the thickest part of the chicken.
