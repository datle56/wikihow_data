      "content": "“If you will” is used to acknowledge that a phrase is unique or uncommon. “If you will” is a polite idiom that literally means “If you wish to call it that” or “If you allow me to describe it like that.” People say this phrase to qualify an expression that other people might find unusual, uncommon, or incorrect. For instance, you often say it after a metaphorical phrase to acknowledge that it’s strange or to make a shocking expression sound more agreeable. [1] X Research source “I’ve never seen someone so stressed out. She looked like she was trying to steer a boat out of the path of an iceberg, if you will.” “This place is a complete mess, a pigsty, if you will.” Note : In this phrase, “will” is not used as an auxiliary verb to form the future tense (e.g., “I will run”). Instead, “will” means “to wish” or “to want.” This is the Old English definition of “will” and is considered archaic except when used in phrases like “If you will” and “If there’s a will, there’s a way.”"
