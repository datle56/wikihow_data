      "content": "Be sure you really like this person and that you're committed. Don't play hard to get and flirt with other people to get their attention. It'll only make them think you're unavailable. A little chat or smile with another person would be good enough. This will make them a little jealous and - most likely - want you more."

      "title": "Get to know them if you don't already.",
      "content": "Get to know them if you don't already. Have conversations about things you two have in common. Look them in the eyes and smile when you talk. If they smile and make eye contact with you, this may be a sign that they're interested in you. Ask them some casual questions, just to know them better. However, don't ask too many! They will probably feel uncomfortable. You don't have to just focus on them - talk a little about yourself as well! If they like you, they might start listening to your favorite band or have an interest in your hobbies to get your attention. Reader Poll: We asked 1074 wikiHow readers how they would approach an introverted person to show youâ€™re interested, and 74% said they would get to know them as a friend first. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Flirt! Start off mildly and work your way up. For those who are beginners at flirting, make eye contact for a second and smile, then look away slowly. Don't stare for too long, as it will make things really awkward. Try making a little physical contact. Brush by them when you can and let your arm linger for a little bit. You could playfully pat their back and - if you're ready - start to hug them! However, be sure you know them well enough and that it won't be awkward if you hug them. Making the first move may be different for everyone. Maybe one person wants to just hang out or go on a date. Perhaps another person wants to \"become official\". This step will focus on choice two. Dress up, but don't try too hard. Approach them and give them a smile. Ask them if they want to hang out after school, or go catch a movie. If they agree, tell them, \"Okay, see ya\" and give them a smile or a hug, then walk off. If they politely decline, then they probably just want to be friends. Don't get discouraged, because there are many fish in the sea!"

    {
      "title": "After the date, make your move.",
      "content": "After the date, make your move. Tell them you had a great time and that you would like to do it again. If they look like they had a good time, then this is a good sign. Now face them and look them in the eyes, and say \"I really like you, and I was wondering if we could be more than friends.\" Smile at them and be confident. Try not to be shy. If they say yes, then you just made a move. If they say no, then just be friends. Don't push them into anything!"

    {
      "title": "Kiss them.",
      "content": "Kiss them. Some girls may skip this step, but others may want to try it. When you're about to leave, give them a quick, soft kiss on the cheek and walk off, not looking back. If you're already dating them and you've already kissed before, move onto the mouth if you two are ready. If neither of you are ready, don't push it. Give them a hug."
