      "content": "Rinse your eyes with warm water under a running faucet for 15 minutes. In a bathroom, set a faucet to a gentle flow of lukewarm water. Bend over and position your eye under the faucet, turning your head as necessary. Let the water flow across your face so that it passes over your eye, and hold your eye open to rinse it. Continue to do so for about 15 minutes, to completely flush the sunscreen from your eye.

      "content": "Spray sunscreen on your hands, not your face. It’s so tempting to just aim and spray, we know, but that’s a recipe for disaster. Instead, spray that sunscreen into your hands, give it a few rubs, then apply it to your face with your fingers, This allows for more deliberate application.

      "content": "Use mineral-formula sunscreen around your eyes.

      "content": "Help small children apply sunscreen, and keep it out of their reach. Kids aren’t the best at thorough and proper sunscreen application (and you can’t really blame them). Their little hands are more likely to deposit a glob of sunscreen right into their eyes. To avert this, help your kid with sunscreen application, and teach them to be careful around their eyes as you do. [10] X Research source Also, keep your sunscreen on a high shelf or locked cabinet, where they’re unlikely to find and use it unsupervised."

      "content": "Rub the sunscreen in completely. This serves a dual purpose: first, it ensures that the sunscreen is completely absorbed and can more effectively protect you from UV rays.

      "content": "Wear sunglasses for added protection. Of course, it’s important to protect your thinnest, most sensitive skin (like the area around your eyes) from harmful UV rays, but you can take some pressure off the sunscreen situation by wearing large, dark sunglasses, as well. Top it off with a wide-brimmed hat to stay cool and safe on your sunny days outside. [12] X Research source"
