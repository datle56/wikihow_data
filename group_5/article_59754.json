      "content": "Take the lead with texting to reassure her and show that you're interested. A Pisces might second-guess herself, especially if it's been a few days since you interacted. Show her that you're attracted by reaching out to her with a text. [1] X Research source Your first text doesn't have to be incredibly thought out. You could message her something like, \"Hi Eleanor, how's your day going?\" or, \"Hey, just wanted to let you know that you're on my mind.\" You might find that she's more comfortable interacting in person, so use texting to set up a date where you can talk face-to-face. Your introduction doesn't have to be anything spectacular! It's perfectly fine to just smile and ask \"How are you doing today?\" [2] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019."

      "content": "A little flattery goes a long way! [3] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. Pisces women like to feel charmed and special. After all, they're looking for someone to sweep them off their feet, so pointing out what makes her special is really important. Here are a few compliments that she might appreciate: [4] X Research source \"You're so smart and you've got such a great heart.\" \"I've just got to let you know how gorgeous you are.\" \"I've been struggling with a work project. I wish I had your creativity!\" Make sure that your compliment is specific and genuine, and that you aren't objectifying her in the process.

      "content": "Send her a passionate, thoughtful text. Don't be afraid to put your feelings on the line and tell her how you feel about her! Just be genuine and she'll be drawn to your honesty. You could text her a romantic poem or send her a link to a heartfelt song that expresses your feelings. For a few text ideas, try: \"I've always wanted to fall in love and I feel like I do that every day with you.\" \"I love the way you look at me—you make me feel like the only person in the world.\" \"Have I told you that you're the whole package? How did I get so lucky?\""

      "title": "Send her a photo of artwork that speaks to you.",
      "content": "Send her a photo of artwork that speaks to you. Not only is this a unique, interesting text that will get her attention, but it also reveals a bit about your personality. A Pisces woman is really creative and she'll appreciate your desire to communicate artistically. [6] X Research source For example, text her a photo of a painting you really like or compose an artistic shot with your camera phone and send it. Say something like, \"I'm really feeling the mood of this painting today,\" or, \"This photo automatically makes me think of you for some reason.\""

      "title": "Pisces have a reputation for being difficult to flirt with, but it's not impossible!",
      "content": "Pisces have a reputation for being difficult to flirt with, but it's not impossible! Sure, she won't fall for slick pick-up lines, but if you send her playful texts that suggest a deeper attachment, she'll be all yours. Remember, a Pisces woman wants to invest in a relationship, so have fun but be genuine. [7] X Research source For example, text, \"I can't believe you dislike Vietnamese food! I suppose it's a good thing that your amazing qualities make up for it. I'd totally give up pho for you.\" Skip the sexting until you know each other really well. Most Pisces don't like explicit or obvious messages since they prefer to be wooed."

      "title": "Pisces are dreamers so try to connect with and support that side of her.",
      "content": "Pisces are dreamers so try to connect with and support that side of her. Enjoy a whimsical texting conversation where you talk about things you imagine—discuss places you'd like to go, things you'd like to see, or experiences you want to have. She'll feel a deeper connection if she realizes you have dreams and support hers. [8] X Research source For example, you might text, \"I've always wanted to sky-dive, but I always find some reason to put it off. What's something you've always wanted to do?\""

      "title": "Let her see your vulnerability by sharing your emotions.",
      "content": "Let her see your vulnerability by sharing your emotions. Pisces women are attracted to honesty. If you reveal your deepest emotions, she'll be much more likely to fall for you and develop a lasting relationship. [9] X Research source An example of an honest, open text might be, \"I've been hesitant to start a new relationship since my ex and I really weren't compatible. I want to figure out your needs and be there for you.\""

    {
      "title": "Use texts as a way to get to know one another.",
      "content": "Use texts as a way to get to know one another. Again, Pisces are looking for a deep connection in a relationship. They love feeling like they're truly part of your life, so text each other questions to strengthen your bond. You might message, \"Best date I've ever been on—walking through a cemetery in the rain. You?\" or, \"I absolutely love Moroccan food. What's your favorite cuisine?\""

    {
      "title": "Pisces are looking for relationships, so make her part of your life.",
      "content": "Pisces are looking for relationships, so make her part of your life. Sure, it may not sound seductive to text her about how your day is going, but she'll be really receptive to that. In her mind, sharing about your day is your way of staying connected to her. These don't have to be romantic texts. Even simple texts like, \"Just got through my shift—I can't wait to meet up,\" or, \"I'm having a really rough day. I hope yours is infinitely better,\" can make her feel invested in your relationship."

      "title": "Ask her out for a fun activity so she enjoys your company.",
      "content": "Ask her out for a fun activity so she enjoys your company. Yes, Pisces are dreamers, but they're also doers! She'll probably love doing things around water—it's her sign after all. You might ask her out for an afternoon at the beach or see if she wants to walk around the lake. [10] X Research source For instance, text, \"I'm thinking you and me at a picnic by the lake. Interested?\" or, \"I want to go swimming with you. Are you game?\""

      "title": "Pisces don't like feeling pressured, so ease up for a day or two.",
      "content": "Pisces don't like feeling pressured, so ease up for a day or two. However, don't wait too long or she'll start thinking that you're the one who needs space! A great text to send is something like, \"Hey Iljama, I haven't heard from you in a few days, but you've been on my mind every day.\" [11] X Research source Sometimes, just letting her know you're still interested is what it takes for her to feel reassured."
