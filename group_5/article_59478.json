      "content": "Send one of these to say, “I shouldn’t laugh at that, but I can’t help it!” When someone adds 👀 to a dirty or controversial joke, it can mean, “Who said that? It wasn’t me.” In this context, crying emojis show that you’re bursting-at-the-seams with laughter. [1] X Research source If the joke makes you crack up so hard you might faint or die, send 💀."

      "title": "Some people use 👀 when they say something they’re not supposed to say.",
      "content": "Some people use 👀 when they say something they’re not supposed to say. They might’ve sent a rude or otherwise inappropriate remark. The fact that they’re telling you means they trust you to not hate them for saying it! Show them you’re 100% behind them by sending this emoji back. [2] X Research source For example, if they ask, “Was it just me, or was that party super lame? 👀” send back “💯 you’re so right.”"

      "content": "People sometimes use 👀 emoji to show that they’re being nosy. If they’re trying to prod juicy gossip or info out of you, use this emoji to show them that you’re unsure if you should tell them or that you really don’t know the answer. [3] X Research source For example, “😶 I have no idea what you’re talking about!” This might not stop them from asking again, so be prepared to either give them the truth or tell them you can’t. On the other hand, by all means, tell them if you want to!"

      "title": "In a flirty context, 👀 can show someone you’re interested.",
      "content": "In a flirty context, 👀 can show someone you’re interested. It’s almost like the sender is peeking at the other person, or trying to make eye contact across a crowded room. Send one back to tell them that you see them, and you’re looking right back at them! [4] X Research source For example, if someone says “Hey 👀,” you can send them “Hi 👀” back. This can be a fun and silly way to start off a flirty exchange."

    {
      "title": "Try this one out if you’re not sure about the intentions behind the 👀.",
      "content": "Try this one out if you’re not sure about the intentions behind the 👀. For instance, if the 👀 was used flirtatiously but you’re not quite ready to get down to the nitty-gritty, just say hi and see where things go from there. This is a way to show that you’re interested in chatting without committing to anything or getting their hopes up. [5] X Research source This can show less mutual attraction than sending 👀 back."

      "content": "To answer a curious 👀, send a wink their way to show that you’re down to flirt. Use this to test the waters before taking the conversation in a spicier direction. The winking emoji lets you play it cool and wait for the other person to make their move. [6] X Research source For example, if they say “Hi handsome 👀,” you can send back “Hi 😉.” Add this to almost anything to make it flirtier. For example, compare “I’m not doing anything” to “I’m not doing anything. 😉” Think of this as a PG-rated response to a flirty 👀."

      "content": "If someone uses 👀 to say they’re interested in you, show them you know your worth. This calm and collected 😎 (sunglasses) emoji says, “Yeah, I know.” Being a little cool and aloof can be both attractive to them and empowering for you! [7] X Research source For example, use this if someone says, “Wow, I can’t stop staring at that photo of you. 👀” To add a little sass, try using 💅 or 💁‍♀️ instead."

      "content": "Win their heart with cute reactions. If the 👀 was used in a flirty way, pretending to be embarrassed can make you look extra cute. In this context, it says, “Me? I have no idea what you’re talking about.” This can be a funny and cute way to get them to keep saying nice things to you or play hard to get. [8] X Research source For example, you could use this if they say, “You’re soooo cute. 👀”"

[9] X Research source Add this emoji in place of 😉 to make your message a little more sexually charged. For example, compare “Want to do something fun? 😉” to “Want to do something fun? 😈” Think of this as a PG13-rated response to a flirty 👀."

This fruit and vegetable duo has dirty implications. Use them for a not-so-subtle invitation to take the conversation further. [10] X Research source Only use these in place of 😉 or 😈 if you know the other person will be into it, too! You could also send a 👅 or 💦 to get the same message across. Think of these as R-rated responses to a flirty 👀."

A quick 😒 says “I’m not amused” and can shut the other person down.
