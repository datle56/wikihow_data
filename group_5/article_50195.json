You'll see a blue light on the corner of the box when it's on. If you don't see the setup process on the screen, press the \"Input\" button until you find the right source. You should see a \"Welcome\" screen. That screen will stay up for a while as your box is connecting to Comcast's cloud services. Older boxes may show an \"Updating\" screen as they are updating the firmware to provide you with the best experience possible. [1] X Research source"

If you don't have a phone number associated with your account or don't have your phone with you, press Verify another way to use a text message or by confirming your account information instead. If your account can't be verified, you need to contact customer support . For most boxes, this will be an instant process. Other boxes may take 10 minutes or more. Once verified, you're done! You will see a \"Downloading your Main Menu\" screen along with some tips on how to use the box and remote. If you don't see the setup guide this way, try using the Xfinity app. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid purchasing used cable boxes. All Comcast cable boxes are the property of Comcast, and none are authorized for sale by other people. If you purchased a cable box from eBay, Craigslist, or any other re-seller, Comcast will not activate it because it is actually an un-returned rental. You should only get cable boxes directly from Comcast for new services, replacements, or additions. Don't believe any listing or review claiming to have Comcast TV cable boxes for sale. They will not activate and are most likely stolen."

Old equipment like amplifiers, boosters, and splitters from previous installations may also be causing the problem. If this is the case, you'll need a Comcast technician to come to inspect and fix the lines. Visit the https://www.xfinity.com/support/contact-us contact customer support page to set that up. [4] X Research source If the problem is with your Comcast equipment or the lines leading to your house or apartment, you likely won't need to pay. If the problem is with the wiring in your home, you may need to pay to have it rewired."

Make note of the HDMI port that you use on your TV so that you can easily switch to it later. Many Comcast cable boxes have multiple HDMI ports. Make sure you're using the \"HDMI Out\" port on the box and not the HDMI Input ports. If you don't have an HDMI port on your TV, you can use a coax cable to connect the \"To TV/RF Out\" port to your TV's coax port. This will not result in high definition image. In fact, if you didn't subscribe to the HD package, you won't get HDMI cables in your box but will get an extra coax cable instead."

      "content": "Connect any additional digital adapters. If you have multiple TVs and active coax outlets, you can use digital adapters to connect your cable to additional TVs. Each adapter will need its own coax wall outlet. Connecting a digital adapter is pretty much the same as a regular cable box. Use a coax cable to attach it to the wall outlet, and HDMI or coax cable to connect the adapter to the TV, and then connect the power adapter. Make sure all of your digital adapters are connected and powered on before starting the activation process."
