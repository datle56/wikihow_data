Leo’s creativity and passion will draw a Pisces man to her , while his ability to listen and his tangible signs of affection—via gift-giving and PDA— make him irresistible to Leo . But while fixed-sign Leo is intense and specific with her loyalty and devotion, Pisces is kind and understanding toward everyone, which can make Leo insecure.

Leo, your need to be in the foreground perfectly complements Pisces’ desire to hang in the background, as long as Pisces is not ignored. [1] X Research source Pisces, as a mutable sign, you're great at tapping into others' emotions, which Leo appreciates—but she must be sure to reciprocate your kindness once in a while!"

      "content": "Pisces’ emotional fluidity complements Leo’s emotional intensity. Pisces men have the ability to adapt their emotions to reflect a Leo woman’s dominating personality. But Pisces’ gentleness is likely to rub off on Leo, giving her the ability to be calmer and more easygoing, and Leo’s pride will help Pisces nurture his own self-confidence. With Leo’s encouragement, a Pisces man will develop a strong and self-assured voice. Leo, be careful: your intensity and aggression can also turn gentle Pisces away! Your Pisces man admires your passion and creativity, but your ability to become aggressive is likely to clash with his sensitive nature."

      "content": "Pushy Leo may overwhelm submissive Pisces. Gentle Pisces is the poster child for emotional sensitivity. Leo’s aggression and tendency to be controlling may overwhelm him, and his submissive and subtle attitude make it easy to talk over him in an argument. Leo, you will have to practice identifying when your subtle, submissive Pisces wants to speak—and then listen to what he has to say.

      "content": "Meanwhile, Pisces’ avoidant style will only frustrate Leo more. While Leo may be overly confrontational, her Pisces mate will try to avoid confrontation if he can help it. These communication styles will keep them in a loop of dysfunction if they are not careful. They will have to work hard on their separate communication styles if they want to avoid falling into a codependent relationship. Pisces, practice standing up for yourself and speaking your mind, rather than withdrawing during an argument. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pisces values showing love, and Leo values being the center of attention.",
      "content": "Pisces values showing love, and Leo values being the center of attention. Pisces is the most sensitive and caring of the Zodiac, and Leo, represented by the lion, is the most prideful. She values being the center of attention, and when she dates a Pisces, she is! Pisces will show his affection for Leo through gifts, through frequent check-ins, and by simply being there. Leo particularly loves tangible signs of adoration, meaning Pisces’ constant flow of gifts, compliments, and PDA are sure to keep her invested in the relationship. Pisces, unlike other signs, is ruled by dual planets Neptune (in modern astrology) and Jupiter (in traditional astrology). These planets give him his ultra-romantic, dreamy, and optimistic edge. [4] X Research source Meanwhile, Leo is unique for being ruled not by a planet, but the sun itself—the star all of the other planets, including Neptune and Jupiter, revolve around. (If this sounds like a metaphor for Leo's need for constant worship, it is!) [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pisces’ need for solitude may conflict with Leo’s need for attention. Leo appreciates a good party more than anyone—especially Pisces. Introverted Pisces may struggle to understand Leo’s extreme extraversion. And Leo is bound to struggle with Pisces' frequent need for peace and quiet. Pisces and Leo, you're likely to experience a bit of friction when one of you wants to go out clubbing on your date night and the other wants to settle in and watch TV together (guess which one is which?). To avoid conflict, try taking turns planning your dates."

      "title": "Leo’s domineering attitude can turn Pisces off if she takes it too far.",
      "content": "Leo’s domineering attitude can turn Pisces off if she takes it too far. While her confidence and strong sense of self draw Pisces to her, the shadow side of her intensity is quickness to anger and desire to control—qualities Pisces does not respond well to. Romantic, caring Pisces will try his hardest to be as close as possible to his Leo lady and do what he can to show he cares—but, just like the fish that represents him, he needs fluidity, room to swim. Leo, to keep the relationship healthy, you'll have to give Pisces a longer leash than you want to. It may help for you both to schedule alone time for Pisces into your week so that you may grow accustomed to his need for freedom. Pisces, you may help Leo loosen her reins by giving her frequent reassurances of your love, and perhaps scheduling regular one-on-one time to make sure she gets the attention she needs."

      "content": "Pisces’ tendency to withdraw will not make Leo a happy camper. Pisces are notorious for emotionally dipping out when they feel mistreated or pressured: they are the ghosts of the Zodiac. In a committed relationship, this is a no-go—especially for a Leo. If Pisces wants to keep his relationship going strong, he will have to practice being emotionally direct with his Leo love, and Leo will have to be patient while he learns how to be forthright. Pisces and Leo, you may benefit from couples therapy to learn how to be together. If you can learn to accept one another’s shortcomings, your relationship will thrive for a long time."
