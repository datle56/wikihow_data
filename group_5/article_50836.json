      "content": "Love a stuffed-shirt hero. It’s fairly common for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl to focus on a love interest who is less free-spirited than she is, especially a man who is brooding but soulfully deep inside.

      "title": "Try to help the person you love.",
      "content": "Try to help the person you love. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl’s key role in many films and TV shows is to help a male love interest come out of his shell. This might sound sexist, but that’s probably why some have criticized the trope as such. The author who coined the term, Nathan Rabin, once described the Manic Pixie Dream Girl as “an archetype... that taps into a particular male fantasy: of being saved from depression and ennui by a fantasy woman who sweeps in like a glittery breeze to save you from yourself, then disappears once her work is done.” [3] X Research source That doesn’t mean you can’t embrace the Manic Pixie Dream Girl’s loving and caring nature. At her best, she deeply cares for those around her, and desires to help them achieve her own sense of happiness and outlook on the world. In the best read, though, it’s OK to help others feel better about themselves, as long as you don’t forget yourself in the process. There’s nothing wrong with helping a depressed friend find a more positive way to look at life or to instill a sense of adventure in someone who could use it."

      "title": "Show your independence.",
      "content": "Show your independence. The trope has been criticized by some who say that women should have independent goals, and the character is known for assisting a love interest. But you can borrow the character’s bubbly and endearing personality without sacrificing your own needs and wants. It's OK to insert your own personality into the archetype. Over time, as others have played with the archetype on film, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl has become less defined by others in her life. For example, in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kate Winslet's character acknowledges she fits the trope, but then rejects it, saying, “Too many guys think I’m a concept, or I complete them, or I’m gonna make them alive.” But, she says, she’s just looking for her “own peace of mind.” You can maintain your own independent goals, and create a richer inner and outer life while still borrowing the character’s best attributes, such as her sunny spirit. For example, you can have career goals of your own, and sometimes go out with your friends, doing things separate from your love interest. Don't hesitate to share your needs and wishes."
