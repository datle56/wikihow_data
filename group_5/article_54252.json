      "content": "Press the wood filler into the hole with your finger or a putty knife . Wood fillers are best for small, nail-sized holes to larger quarter-sized holes or gaps in unfinished wood. [1] X Research source Fill the crack or hole until the compound overfills the area. The filler shrinks as it dries, so overfilling the hole makes sure that no gaps are left. [2] X Research source Furniture refinishing and home remodeling specialists William & Shannon Latil say that “Wood filler of a similar color to your furniture can be found at most furniture hardwood stores.” After the filler dries, you’ll sand down the area to make sure that the hole is flush with the rest of the wood. If you want to color the wood later, make sure the label says the product is stainable. It’ll take on the color of the stain, blending in with the wood."

      "content": "Allow the wood filler to dry for up to 8 hours. Depending on the size of the hole and your product, the filler can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 8 hours to dry completely. Check your manufacturer’s instructions for the specific timeframe. [3] X Research source Water-based wood filler tends to dry slower, while petroleum-based filler is faster. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sand the excess filler until it’s flush with the surrounding wood. Blend the cracked area with a sandpaper that has grit between 120 and 220. Wear away the filler until it’s as flat against the wood as you can make it. [5] X Research source When you’re done, the filler will blend in with the wood. If it doesn’t, the Latils recommend lightly brushing a matching color stain over the area. Follow the instructions on your stain or paint for its instructions on application and drying time."

      "title": "Rub a filler stick that’s the same color as the wood over the hole.",
      "content": "Rub a filler stick that’s the same color as the wood over the hole. Filler sticks are crayon-like wood repair tools used for small holes, like from nails or screws. If you’re using a filler stick, simply rub the stick over the crack until the hole fills. [6] X Research source Some sticks may have you use a lighter or hair dryer to melt the filler so it evenly covers the crack. Once you’re done, wipe off the excess with your finger, a cloth, or a rag."

      "title": "Apply the wood putty over the crack with a putty knife.",
      "content": "Apply the wood putty over the crack with a putty knife. Wood putty is best for minor cracks, dents, and holes for indoor wood that’s already stained or varnished. The filler shrinks as it dries, so try to overfill the hole a little bit, then use a putty knife to scrape away the excess. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a putty knife, use an old credit card or another piece of flat plastic to smooth the surface. Buy wood putty in the same color as your wood. If you can’t find the exact shade, buy different colors and mix them together to create the shade you need. [8] X Research source Wood putty is not stainable, paintable, or sandable, so it’s best for minor holes in wood that has already been colored and finished. [9] X Research source Wood putty is unsafe to use on finished wood. Apply stain or sealant to your wood ahead of time to create a barrier between the wood and the putty. [10] X Research source You can also wipe the palm of your hand back and forth across the surface to smooth it. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the wood filler dry for up to 72 hours. The amount of time needed for the filler material to dry depends on the product, the size of the hole, and the humidity level, so check the label on your putty for the recommended wait time. Wood putty may take as long as 72 hours to dry, but some may take only 8 hours. [12] X Research source If your putty dries out in its container, add a few drops of acetone to soften it and make it usable again. [13] X Research source"

[14] X Research source For small cracks, use a syringe to ensure the glue gets all the way down inside the crack. If the crack goes all the way through the wood, place a piece of painter’s tape on the other side to make sure the glue doesn’t soak through to your surface. Alternatively, make a small pile of sawdust and mix in wood glue until the dust becomes a putty-like texture. Use a putty knife to smooth the putty into the hole. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the glue with sawdust and work it in with your finger. Layer sawdust over the glue to completely cover it. Rub your finger over the crack to ensure the glue holds the sawdust in place. When you’re finished, the sawdust will hide the glue from view, blending in with the rest of the wood. [16] X Research source For the best blend, get some sawdust from the same piece of wood by sawing or sanding it. If that’s not possible, you can also buy sawdust from your local hardware store."

Before sanding the area, allow the glue to dry completely over at least 1 day. [17] X Research source If your crack goes all the way through the wood, secure a clamp around the two sides to make sure the wood keeps its shape."

Carefully rub the treated area with the sandpaper until the filler is flat and unnoticeable. [18] X Research source If there are still small gaps or holes in the wood, go over the area again with the wood glue and sawdust.

This will protect the surface around the hole from the epoxy. [20] X Research source If the crack goes all the way through the wood, tape over one side to protect your surface. Make sure the area you’re working in is well-ventilated. If you’re working indoors, open a window and plug in a fan. Make sure to wear a respirator mask ."

Most epoxy consists of two parts packaged together—the resin and the hardener. [21] X Research source Usually, you will add one pump or bottle of each to a small plastic bowl or cup. The epoxy immediately begins to harden when the parts are combined. You’ll have about 5 minutes to get it into the crack, so start with a small batch."

[24] X Research source If you don’t have enough to fill the entire crack, follow the steps above to make more and pour it into the hole. Use a needle to pop any bubbles that appear when pouring the epoxy. You can also hold a lighter or torch 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) above the epoxy after you’ve finished applying it to the crack to get rid of any bubbles. [25] X Research source"

[26] X Research source Cut away any excess epoxy with a putty knife, then use fine grit (120-220) sandpaper or a file to carefully flatten the epoxy-treated area until it’s level with the rest of the wood. [27] X Research source Using a block chisel can prevent you from sanding off part of the wood. Once you’re done, use a felt tipped marker to fill in any undyed specs in the epoxy."

Otherwise, apply the glue straight onto the wood. [30] X Research source Medium thickness CA glue typically only takes 20 seconds to dry without using an accelerator.

Wait 10 seconds for it to dry, then fill it the rest of the way with the CA glue, overfilling it slightly. Spray accelerator on top.
