    {
      "title": "Everyone likes to talk about themselves.",
      "content": "Everyone likes to talk about themselves. Get a playful conversation going with a pointed question, like: [1] X Research source “Do you like it when someone makes the first move?” “If I were to take you on a date, where would you want to go?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You can get a little heated (in a flirty way).",
      "content": "You can get a little heated (in a flirty way). Bring up something a little controversial, like: [2] X Research source “Pineapple on pizza: yes or no?” “Cats or dogs?” “Hamburgers or hot dogs?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Then say, “This reminded me of you.”",
      "content": "Then say, “This reminded me of you.” It will let them know that you’re thinking about them, but it will also tease them a little bit. [3] X Research source Look for a baby animal making a silly face or an animal tripping over its own feet for extra comedic value."
    },
    {
      "title": "There’s nothing better than a little schoolyard fun!",
      "content": "There’s nothing better than a little schoolyard fun! Playfully ask the person you’re texting to compete with you by saying something like: [4] X Research source “Whoever can make the other person laugh the hardest wins. GO!” “I bet I can text back faster than you can.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make them the hero of your story with a simple question.",
      "content": "Make them the hero of your story with a simple question. If you have an event, class, or meeting that’s going to be excruciating to sit through, see if they can entertain you by saying: [5] X Research source “Ugh, I have this super boring assembly to go to today. Will you text me to make it more fun?” “URGENT: Need distractions. This meeting will never end.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get them thinking about the next time you’ll see each other.",
      "content": "Get them thinking about the next time you’ll see each other. You can make sure you’re on their mind by saying something like: [6] X Research source “Do you miss me yet?” “I bet you miss me already, huh?” “Looking forward to our next date?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flowers, candy, and chocolates set the tone for a date.",
      "content": "Flowers, candy, and chocolates set the tone for a date. You can tell the person you’re texting what kind of gifts to get you if they want to woo you. For example: [7] X Research source “In case you’re wondering, my favorite flowers are roses and I love Hershey’s chocolate.” “If you were thinking about buying me flowers, you should go for daffodils.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Playful humor can go a long way.",
      "content": "Playful humor can go a long way. Pick out one of their quirks and make fun of it, but don’t get too mean! Throw in a few “lol”s or “haha”s if you need to tone it down. For example: [8] X Research source (If they have a complicated coffee order) “Don’t forget to ask for whipped cream made from tiny unicorns! lol” (If they’re always running late) “Fashionably late again? Haha.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "It’ll make them feel good and let them know that you care.",
      "content": "It’ll make them feel good and let them know that you care. You can do it in a playful way so you don’t seem so serious, like: [9] X Research source “I have so much to do, but I keep getting distracted by you.” “I’m trying to fall asleep but you keep running through my mind.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t be afraid to get a little bold.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to get a little bold. The more playful you are, the more lighthearted and fun it will feel. For example: [10] X Research source “We should probably go on another date soon.” “You’re going to love the outfit I wear on our next date.” “Any room for me in your weekend plans?”"
