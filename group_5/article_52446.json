While this isn't advertised on Starlink's website, some users have been able to resolve minor issues by tagging the @Starlink Twitter/X account in a post describing the problem. As Starlink doesn't list this as a method of contacting customer support, it may take a while for you to get a reply, or you may not get one at all.
