      "content": "Know when to defuse the bomb. You will only want to defuse the bomb if you are playing on the Counter-Terrorist team. Your job as a Counter-Terrorist is to either kill all of the terrorists before they plant the bomb or defuse the bomb after it has been planted by the terrorists. [1] X Research source You will know when the bomb has been planted because the announcer will state \"bomb has been planted.\" You will also know when it has been planted because of a timer in the corner of your screen indicating when the bomb will explode, this is not really a timer though because it is only a flashing red image of the bomb. The bomb has a timer of 40 seconds so when the announcer states \"bomb has been planted.\" you will know how long you have to defuse it. Once the bomb has gone off, you will lose the round."

      "title": "Know where the bomb has been planted.",
      "content": "Know where the bomb has been planted. There are two places where the bomb can be planted by the terrorists: Site A and Site B. You will need to pay attention to the minimap or what your teammates are saying over the in-game chat. [2] X Research source The map will show you how to get to the planted bomb. It will be clearly marked on the map. Your teammates may also post in chat or which site the bomb has been planted."

      "title": "Go to the correct site.",
      "content": "Go to the correct site. Most maps in the Counter strike games are fairly simple, with clear markings directing players toward bomb sites. In addition to the in-game map, the walls in the game are painted with arrows pointing toward bomb sites. Follow your teammates if you get confused. Chances are they are going to the same place as you are. It is also better to show up in force to the active bomb site, so try to keep up with them."

      "title": "Enter the bomb site and clear out any enemies.",
      "content": "Enter the bomb site and clear out any enemies. Carefully enter the bomb site while keeping a close lookout for terrorists. The terrorists do not want you to defuse the bomb, so eliminate any the instant you see them, as they will do the same to you. [3] X Research source It is best to strategically and slowly enter the bomb site. Do not run in guns blazing unless you are incredibly confident in your reaction and aiming skills. Coordinate with your team before entering the bomb site. It is best to strategize with your teammates and assign certain roles so that it is not complete chaos once you enter. Decide on who will be defusing the bomb and who will be eliminating enemies. Strategizing beforehand will give you an edge over the opposing team."

      "title": "Locate the bomb within the bomb site.",
      "content": "Locate the bomb within the bomb site. The bomb will be on the ground on on an object somewhere within the bomb site. You will hear beeping which increases in volume the closer you are to the bomb. [4] X Research source The bomb is a timer and a number pad attached to dynamite. Look for the colorful wires which mark the bomb"

      "title": "Once the bomb is located, face it and hold E.",
      "content": "Once the bomb is located, face it and hold E. E is the default key for defusing a bomb. If you have changed it it will show the key you need to press. If you haven't changed it, this is the key you want to press. After E is pressed and held, you will see a meter in your screen start to fill up. Once the meter is full, the bomb is defused and your team has won the round. [5] X Research source It takes 10 seconds to defuse the bomb without a defusing kit. With a kit, the time is reduced to 5 seconds. Purchase a defusing kit from the in-game buy menu for $400 or pick one up off of a dead teammate. [6] X Research source"
