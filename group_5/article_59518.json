      "title": "Salutation",
      "content": "Salutation Greet your recipient with a professional salutation. The most common salutation for a business acquaintance is “Dear.” Since you likely know the recipient personally, it’s acceptable to use their first name as long as that’s how you address them at work. Use your recipient’s professional title and last name if that’s how you refer to them at work. For example, if you work for a veterinarian and call them Dr. Bennett, use that in your salutation. Punctuate your salutation with a colon. For example, use a format like “Dear Dr. Bennett:” for a supervisor with a professional title or “Dear George:” for a more personal salutation."

Write clearly and concisely throughout to maintain a professional tone (you can send more personal sentiments in a card or personal letter, if you prefer). Here is the information you should include: After the salutation, leave a blank line and then clearly state you are retiring from your position at your company with the date of your final day.

For example, “I am writing to inform you that I’m retiring from my role as marketing manager at ABC Agency effective December 5, 2025.” Use additional paragraphs to include some details about your retirement. Briefly mention your immediate retirement plans and express appreciation for the opportunities your employer has given you over the years. Briefly discuss your time with your employer and highlight any of your significant career achievements. If you plan to participate in the transition or training of your replacement, mention it in the body toward the end of the letter."
