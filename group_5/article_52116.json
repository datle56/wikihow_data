      "title": "Lay the bag on the clean surface.",
      "content": "Lay the bag on the clean surface. Wet both sides and the inside of the bag with water. Be careful when handling the bag, make sure it is as flat as possible. Minimize creasing and rubbing it on itself while wet because this will cause bubbling."

      "title": "Start cleaning the inside of the bag as gently as possible.",
      "content": "Start cleaning the inside of the bag as gently as possible. Keep the material as flat as you can while you soap the inside of the bag, don’t forget the inside pocket. Use the brush to gently remove dirt and grime."

    {
      "title": "Start soaping the outside of the bag.",
      "content": "Start soaping the outside of the bag. Gently brush the material to loosen any dirt, making sure the material is still laying as flat as possible. Gently brush until you’re satisfied that you’ve removed as much dirt as you can. Do this to the other side of the bag and the bottom part, too. Make sure not to crease the material.

      "title": "Check the leather if it needs further cleaning.",
      "content": "Check the leather if it needs further cleaning. Generally, the leather is not that dirty and don't need anything more than a quick pass. Try not to get the leather too soaked."

      "title": "Start rinsing the bag.",
      "content": "Start rinsing the bag. Be gentle when handling the bag, avoid crumpling it or causing any creases! Rinse the inside, rinse the pocket, rinse the outside, rinse the leathers — make sure all soap has been rinsed off. Again, please do not crumple the bag or rinse it inside a pail. Just rinse it as best as you can while keeping the material as flat as possible. A hose type shower head is recommended."

      "content": "Dry the bag upside down. The back of a plastic chair is best for this. Put the Longchamp Le Pliage upside down over the back of a clean monobloc chair and let the water drip down. The bag’s zipper is open and the back of the chair is “inside” the bag. Let it dry like this for a day or longer."
