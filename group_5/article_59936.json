      "title": "Assemble sturdy needles and thread if you’d prefer to sew manually.",
      "content": "Assemble sturdy needles and thread if you’d prefer to sew manually. Invest in strong needles designed for sewing canvas sails. Note that sail needles are ordered by size, with higher numbers indicating smaller needles. If you’re stitching a sail, use a curved bench or sailmaker’s hook to hold the canvas in place while you’re stitching it together. Additionally, look for twine or other thread labeled for outdoor use. If your needles and thread aren’t thick enough, then your stitches won’t hold in the thick material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a round stitch if you need a basic seam.",
      "content": "Use a round stitch if you need a basic seam. Work the threaded needle into the connected edges of canvas, stitching in a loop formation down the seam. Pull the thread or twine tightly until you reach the ends of the material. If you’re working with a large canvas project, secure the material into a bench hook. If you’re working with a small canvas project, pin or clip the edges together ahead of time."

      "title": "Thread an awl to stitch more efficiently.",
      "content": "Thread an awl to stitch more efficiently. Follow the product’s instructions to loop the heavy-duty thread through the bobbin and into the awl itself. Check that the thread is looped through the central needle before you start any stitch work. [1] X Research source Keep your thread of choice nearby as you work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loop thread with the awl to create a series of stitches.",
      "content": "Loop thread with the awl to create a series of stitches. Use a firm block of wood or other sturdy surface to arrange and display your canvas, then stick the tip of the awl into the part of the canvas that you’d like to stitch. Measure out your desired stitch length and add 3 inches (7.6 cm) to this sum. Loop this amount of thread around the thread before removing the awl from the canvas. Pull on both ends of the thread to tighten and form your first stitch. [2] X Research source One end of the thread will be attached to the awl, while the other will be attached to the canvas. Repeat the process along your hem until you’ve finished sewing your canvas."

      "title": "Select a size 40 heavy-duty thread.",
      "content": "Select a size 40 heavy-duty thread . Don’t pick a cotton-based thread that’s visibly fraying around the edges. Instead, check your craft store for threads specifically labeled for outdoor use. If you’re planning on using your canvas outside, try and find a thread with a smooth coating and UV protection included. Aim to use threads made out of polyester, as these are more durable in the long run. Since canvas is a thick material, you need to use a thick thread to sew it."

      "content": "Pick out a needle labeled for use with denim. Select a thick, sturdy needle to use in your sewing machine. [3] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. Since canvas is a lot hardier and thicker than many fabrics, you need to be able to puncture the surface with a needle. If you don’t have this type of needle on hand, check your local craft store. [4] X Research source If you can’t find anything with a “denim needle” label, look for needles that are sizes 90/16 or 100/16. A leather needle will also work for sewing through canvas. [5] X Expert Source Alessio Iadicicco Apparel Manufacturing Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2021. Use a straight stitch setting, with a length of around 3.0 to 3.5."

If you don’t have a thicker sewing foot on hand, check online or in a craft store for parts labeled “bulky overlock sewing foot.” [7] X Research source If you’re installing a new sewing foot for the first time, make sure to follow the directions on the foot’s packaging."

If your device can successfully stitch through this denim, it can probably handle canvas projects. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an overlapping seam for simple projects. Think about your project, and decide whether it’s simple or complex. Are you just trying to sew 2 pieces of canvas together, or are you looking to trying to stitch a sail or tote bag? If you’re looking for an easy or quick sewing fix, an overlapping seam might be the best option for you. [9] X Research source Overlapping seams are one of the most simplistic, basic stitching styles available."

      "title": "Mark your seam allowance with soapstone pen.",
      "content": "Mark your seam allowance with soapstone pen. Use a washable soapstone pen and a ruler to indicate how far you want the seam to go. If you want to have more wiggle room in your project, try giving yourself 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of seam allowance to work with. Since you’ll be working with 2 pieces of canvas, make sure that both edges are marked with the same measurement. [10] X Research source Soapstone pens will wear off with water, so the marks won’t be permanent on your canvas. Choose a lighter soapstone pen if you’re working with dark-colored canvas. If you’re working with lighter canvas, use a darker pen."

      "title": "Apply a strip of basting tape over the seam to keep it in place.",
      "content": "Apply a strip of basting tape over the seam to keep it in place. Measure and cut a strip of basting tape from the spool that matches the length of the seam. Try to use basting tape that’s the same width as your seam allowance, so your stitches can be consistent. [11] X Research source Tape allows you to stitch more seamlessly without needing to pull out pins. For instance, if your seam allowance is 0.5 in (1.3 cm), use basting tape that’s 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide. Be sure to peel off the backing tape before you start sewing, so both pieces of fabric can stick together."

      "content": "Press and stick 2 pieces of canvas together using the basting tape. Line the opposite edge of canvas together, so the seam allowances overlap evenly. Match up the edges so that both stick together with the basting tape. Press along the edge of the canvas to fully connect the materials together. [12] X Research source The basting tape provides a more durable hold for your simple overlapping seam. Don’t press on the canvas until both sides are lined up."

      "content": "Feed the fabric through the machine around 0.125 in (0.32 cm) away from 1 edge. Arrange the canvas pieces so the edge of the material is directly aligned beneath the sewing machine foot. Turn on the sewing machine and stitch in a straight line along 1 of the seam edges, keeping the stitches close to the seam’s edge. [13] X Research source You’ll be doing this twice, so don’t stitch in the center of the seam allowance area. If you’re comfortable with a sewing machine, feel free to feed the canvas through the machine more quickly."

Realign the sewing needle, keeping it about 0.125 in (0.32 cm) from the opposite, unstitched side of the seam. [14] X Research source The finished overlapping seam looks like 2 parallel lines of stitches next to one another."

      "content": "Choose a flat fell seam if you don’t want your stitches to be as visible. Use this stitch for more visually appealing projects, where you don’t want the seam to be apparent or visible on either side of the material. Instead of sewing up and down the canvas, flat fell seams require you to fold in some of the fabric. If you aren’t experienced with a sewing machine, this seam might be tricky. This seam is commonly used on the sides of jeans."

Determine how large you’d like this seam to be; if you’re inexperienced with a sewing machine, keep in mind that smaller seam allowances leave less of a margin for error. [17] X Research source Use multiple dashes to mark your seam allowance, so you can keep track of the guidelines later on."

Since you aren’t using basting tape for this, use sturdy pins to keep the material in place.

Check that the folded fabric is covering 1 side of your open seam, and press along this edge to add a second layer to your seam.
