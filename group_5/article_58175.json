      "content": "Smile and make eye contact to form instant connections. It’s easy for a lot of people to just walk past panhandlers and ignore them, so let people see you for the real, authentic person that you are. Make eye contact, smile as people approach, and offer friendly nods. The more approachable and genuine you seem at a glance, the more likely people will be to consider giving you money.

      "title": "Be polite and only ask once.",
      "content": "Be polite and only ask once. If there's one thing that's guaranteed to fail and get you in lots of trouble, it's demanding money from strangers in a rude or confrontational way. Smile, be courteous, and thank people whether or not they choose to give you anything. [2] X Research source A key legal note: In some cities, it’s legal to panhandle so long as you aren’t pushy. If you ask repeatedly or don’t leave people alone when they ask, it qualifies as “aggressive panhandling,” which is universally illegal. [3] X Research source Thanking people will lay the groundwork for developing a reputation in your area. If you develop a good working relationship with the people in the areas you solicit, they'll be more likely to give you money next time."

      "title": "Explain why you’re asking for money if it’s relevant.",
      "content": "Explain why you’re asking for money if it’s relevant. You do not owe anyone an explanation if you don’t want to give one, so don’t feel guilty about asking without reason. However, if you do need a specific amount of money for a very particular reason, an explanation could give passerby the nudge they need to donate to the cause. [4] X Research source You might say something like, \"I need two dollars to get a bus ticket, can you help me out,” or, “Honestly, I ran out of gas and I’m kind of hurting right now. Any way I could bum a dollar to get the car home?”"

    {
      "title": "Be clear and concise.",
      "content": "Be clear and concise. To avoid intimidating people or making them frustrated and unlikely to give you anything, just come out and ask for what you're looking for: \"Excuse me sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but I need some change to get something to eat.\" Ask for one thing and give one reason: \"I need ____ for _____.\" Using a sign can be the easiest way to panhandle. All you need is a piece of cardboard and a marker. Make the lettering bold and clear so it can be read quickly."

    {
      "title": "Try making a joke if you’re not panhandling for dire reasons.",
      "content": "Try making a joke if you’re not panhandling for dire reasons. Often, appealing to someone's sense of humor (rather than their sense of empathy) is more effective than the “woe is me” route. If you aren’t in serious harm’s way, write a sign that says, \"D.B. Cooper owes me money. Need $ to fund a search party\" or \"Why lie? I just want to buy a Snuggie. It’s cold out here,\" might make someone chuckle and donate. If the area skews to the younger side, humor can be particularly effective. Stay abreast of current events and local culture to get a sense of what might go over well. Singing \"I'll stop singing for a dollar\" to the tune of a Taylor Swift song might help rake it in!"

      "content": "Remember the regulars and chat them up. If people in the neighborhood come to know you as an honest, friendly citizen, they’ll be more likely to help you out. If someone seems open to chatting on the street, talk to them! Ask them questions about themselves, tell them your story, and don’t use every convo as a roadmap to ask for money. [5] X Research source If you see the same people on their way to work every day, learn their names and greet them. If they know you're there asking for money, you won't have to ask and you know they'll give it if they feel like it. Everyone wants to help out the friendly guy or gal in their neighborhood who looks out for people and cares about his neighborhood. Treat some interactions as investments in the future! Every convo doesn’t need to end in a donation."

      "title": "Be present and don’t appear bored or disinterested.",
      "content": "Be present and don’t appear bored or disinterested. People mistakenly tend to assume that some panhandlers don’t need help if they don’t look like they’re really grinding for donations. If you just hang out on a corner all day napping and relaxing, you could make people think you’re just hanging out and don’t actually need the money. The worst thing you can do is sit around on your phone. It sends the message that you don’t actually need the money, as silly as that assumption is."

      "title": "Don’t lie or present yourself as something you aren’t.",
      "content": "Don’t lie or present yourself as something you aren’t. It may be tempting to pretend like you’re a veteran or fake an injury to score sympathy points with bystanders but don’t do it. You won’t feel good about it at the end of the day. Beyond that, people can often tell if someone is pulling a scam. By presenting yourself honestly as who you are, you’ll maintain your dignity and earn more money than you probably would by playing games. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider playing an instrument. A lot of people may not be comfortable giving money to someone for no reason, but they may have no qualms about donating to a street musician! If you’ve got some musical talent , take your instrument outside and set a box, cup, or hat out on the sidewalk for donations. [7] X Research source While panhandling is usually illegal everywhere, busking (playing music on the street for money) is often legal. Depending on where you live, you may need a permit to play music as a street performer."

      "title": "Be aware of the local laws regarding panhandling.",
      "content": "Be aware of the local laws regarding panhandling. These days, panhandling is basically illegal everywhere. Just know that you are running the risk of being fined or arrested if you panhandle and you run into law enforcement. For you, this may be worth the risk. Still, it’s something you have to be cognizant of. [8] X Research source Be honest with the police if they try to talk to you about panhandling. Who knows, maybe the cops will have some resources to help you improve where you’re at? The penalty for panhandling is typically a fine (anywhere from $20-500 depending on the local laws and the number of offenses), but you can get up to 60 days in jail if you are caught multiple times."

      "title": "Operate in a well-lit and well-traveled area.",
      "content": "Operate in a well-lit and well-traveled area. There are people out there who will exploit others just because they’re in a tough situation. Minimize the odds that someone tries to victimize you by sticking to busy areas where you won’t be alone. Also, avoid any dark alleys, unlit side streets, or vacant lots. The more visible you are, the safer you’ll be. [9] X Research source Some panhandlers will exclusively seek out less-traveled areas because they’re avoiding law enforcement. This isn’t a risk worth taking—it’s better to end up in some minor legal trouble than run the risk of getting robbed, attacked, or worse."

      "title": "Stay out of traffic and keep to the sidewalk.",
      "content": "Stay out of traffic and keep to the sidewalk. A lot of panhandlers will walk in between cars to solicit donations at red lights. This may be tempting, but it’s actually extremely dangerous. Stay on the sidewalk to avoid accidents. Every year, panhandlers are hurt (or killed) by cars trying to beat a light—it’s just not worth it. [10] X Research source In general, it’s probably more efficient to ask for money from people who aren’t in cars anyways. It’s a lot harder to connect with someone and build rapport if they’re in traffic."

      "title": "Cultivate positive relationships with the locals.",
      "content": "Cultivate positive relationships with the locals. Your relations with nearby businesses and other panhandlers can make or break your efforts. Be courteous and cooperative to business owners and their customers. Show your appreciation for their tolerance by patronizing their shop if you can, and if you’re asked to leave or asked to stand a little further away, do so without argument. [11] X Research source Always be friendly to other beggars, as well. Avoid territorial disputes. At the very least you’ll avoid dangerous and unsightly squabbles and you may even get some good money-making tips and make some friends."

      "content": "Stash your money to hide it from ne'er-do-wells. Unfortunately, panhandlers are frequently the target of robbers. If you've been working all day, you might end up with a fair amount of spare change and cash on hand. Don’t leave it out in the open for people to easily find. Find a spot to stash your cash, or at least a hidden lockbox or instrument case in which you might keep your money. At the very least, keep your money in different places on your person. Some in your shoes, some in your pockets, etc."

      "content": "Reach out to local nonprofits and orgs for free help. Local churches, non-profit organizations, soup kitchens, shelters, and related services are dedicated to helping people who are struggling get back on their feet. Panhandling is at best an inconsistent source of income and at worst a difficult and dangerous profession. Make sure you investigate all the options available in your area. [12] X Research source If you don’t know where or how to access local help, look up the nearest free health center using the National free health center database . If you need food, look up the closest food bank to locate something free to eat."

Panhandling can help if you just need to make $5-15 a day, but if you’re trying to get off of the streets or radically change your situation it’ll take more than that. If you have a friend with access to a computer, ask them to set up a crowdfunding page for you. [13] X Research source"

Locate the nearest shelter using the Government’s official housing database . You’re also likely to find help at your local shelter if you need additional help getting back on your feet. [14] X Research source If you want to get directly in contact with someone who can help find longer-term housing, contact the nearest federally-recognized Homeless Service Provider .
