      "content": "Start with a square paper napkin. Place it on a clean working surface in front of you, oriented as a diamond so that one of the corners is pointing towards you. White napkins are a classic choice here, but you can also use colored or patterned napkins. If using a patterned or colored napkin, begin with the pattern or colored side down ."

      "content": "Fold the napkin in half vertically. Bring the right corner of the napkin over to the left corner and crease the fold. Reinforce the fold by running your fingers along it. It is important to have a crisp line here."

      "title": "Fold the right corner over just past the center crease.",
      "content": "Fold the right corner over just past the center crease. For this fold, imagine the 90-degree angle of the bottom corner as divided into three 30-degree angles. You want to bring the right corner towards the left along a 30-degree line. Crease the fold that you've made. It might help to imagine the new fold as pointing to a one o'clock position."

To be sure that your rolls are equal halves, make a light crease through the center of the napkin for reference by folding it in half and unfolding. (If you're using a rectangular napkin, make the crease so that it runs the longer length of the cloth.)"

      "content": "Put the napkins together to make a heart. It may take a little time to figure out the right positioning for your swans to stay upright. If you're having trouble, try adjusting how much you bend their necks and where you place their heads together. Keep in mind that very smooth table surfaces may cause the swans to slide away from one another; try to place them on a tablecloth, placemat, or other surface that offers a bit of friction."
