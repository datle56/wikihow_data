      "content": "Tilt your head to the side. Sometimes, an object is small enough or loose enough to simply come out on its own. When you notice something stuck in your ear, tilt your head to the side and use gravity to help you get it out. Shake your head gently to increase the chances of the object falling out on its own. [2] X Research source As you tilt your head, pull on the pinna, the outermost part of the ear (not the lobe, but the circle that begins at the top of the ear and stretches down to the lobe). Wiggling this can dislodge the object, after which gravity will do the rest. This method works well for objects like earbuds and cotton. It can also help dislodge live bugs. You can tell something is stuck in your ear if it’s swollen or red. You might also have difficulty hearing or hear something deep inside of your ear (like a bug)."

      "content": "Remove the object with tweezers . Only use this method if part of the object is sticking out and you can easily remove it with a pair of tweezers. Clean a pair of tweezers with soap, then gently grasp the object in the ear. Go slowly and gently to prevent the object from breaking before it’s fully out of the ear. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If the object is far enough inside of the ear that you can’t see it, do not use this method. Tweezers have the potential to push the object deeper inside of your ear canal, which can lead to injury. If you’re trying to remove something from a child’s ear and they won’t hold still, take them to a doctor instead. Moving around with tweezers inside of your ear is dangerous, and it could lead to a perforated eardrum."

      "content": "Flush your ear out with water. Water can help flush out foreign objects, especially if they’re small. Wash your hands and fill up a bulb syringe with warm (not hot) water. Pull your ear up and back, then insert the syringe and gently squeeze water into your ear. Let the water run out of your ear onto a towel to flush out the foreign object.

Instead, head to the doctor."

      "title": "Apply baby oil or vegetable oil to kill insects.",
      "content": "Apply baby oil or vegetable oil to kill insects. You can usually tell there’s a bug in your ear if you hear it buzzing or walking around. In that case, fill your ear canal with oil, and keep your head tilted so the oil doesn’t run out. Wait a couple of minutes until you can’t hear the insect move anymore, then tilt your head again to flush the insect out . [5] X Research source If you’re struggling to get a bug out of your ear, warm the oil up in the microwave so it’s warm, but not hot. The heat from the oil will help kill the bug faster. Only use oil if you are attempting to remove an insect. If there has been pain, bleeding, or any discharges from the ear, it is possible that you have a perforated eardrum, and you should not use oils. See a doctor after using this method to make sure that all insect parts have been removed from the ear."

If that’s the case, your eardrum will typically heal on its own within 2 months. However, your doctor might prescribe you antibiotics for infection, as well as give you instructions on how to clean the ear as it heals.
