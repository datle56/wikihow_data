      "content": "Gamers started using “dogwater” as an insult instead of using profanity. The game Fortnite has voice and text chat features that can be disabled or filtered for inappropriate language by using parental controls. Instead of using profanity for dog feces, players started using the term “dogwater” in the text chat. It’s also a form of algospeak, or words people use in videos or recordings they share on social media platforms to avoid being banned or penalized by the algorithms. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Some think it’s a shorter version of “hot dog water.” A few people on Reddit forums believe “dogwater” refers to “hot dog water,” or the water left over after boiling hot dogs. There’s no confirmation that this is true. “Hot dog water” is also an insulting nickname for one of the animated Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated characters. Voiced by actress Linda Cardellini, Marcie “Hot Dog Water” Fleach was given the name because she smelled like recycled water used to boil hot dogs due to her father’s job at an amusement park. [5] X Research source In March 2024, the convenience store chain 7-Eleven announced they were releasing sparkling water inspired by their signature Big Bite Hot Dog. The product was meant to be an April Fool’s Day joke, but the chain actually produced a limited supply. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Gamers playing Fortnite use many terms to insult other gamers. Several of these terms are often used at the same time as “dogwater” to insult someone and mock their skill level and equipment. With an average of 230 million active players a month, these insults can get creative. [8] X Research source Many of the insults refer to how the winner defeated the loser. They may also say that the loser is “free,” which means they were so easily defeated it didn’t cost the winner anything. Other common themes are that players are so bad they have no earnings from competitive gameplay or use substandard equipment. A few examples of these insults are: “I boxed you like a fish.” “You’re freer than a Costco sample.” “That’s a Dollar Tree headset.” “You’re freer than a public bathroom.” “I caged you like a zoo animal.” “Take off that Goodwill headset. You’re done.” “You play like you have a pawn shop console.” “You’re freer than soiled underpants.” ”404 Earnings Not Found.” “You’re lost like your dad. He’s never coming home.” “You’re freer than a dollar-off coupon to Dollar Tree.” “You have no earnings.”"

This is called “setting up camp.” Camping can also be a strategy, especially for newer players, as they learn how to play the game and build their skill level. “Jake is such a camper you never see him until the battle’s over.” “I’m going behind that wall over there to see if I can bag a camper.” “Watch out for that camper trying to third-party our duel.”"

      "content": "YEET! Players use YEET! or YA-YEET! when throwing an object or another player in the game.

It was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen.” “Oh, yeah! It looks like she’s going to throw a grenade. YEET!”"
