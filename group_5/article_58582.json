When an artist or label sets up a pre-save campaign, fans can click the Pre-Save button on an artist's website or social media profile to automatically add upcoming songs or albums to their Spotify libraries upon release. If you're a fan, pre-saving an artist's upcoming song or album shows support for the release. It also guarantees that the album or song will automatically be added to your Spotify library as soon as it comes out. If you're an artist, setting up a pre-save campaign is a great way to energize your fans before upcoming releases. When fans pre-save your new releases, you'll increase your first-day stream stats as well as your stream-to-save ratio. [1] X Research source"

While Spotify has announced Countdown Pages, a feature that will allow artists to set up pre-save links within the Spotify app, the feature is not yet available unless you're a big artist like Ed Sheeran or Karol G.

Fortunately, there are plenty to choose from: If you use Distrokid as your distributor, you can set up pre-saves through Distrokid's free Hyperfollow service. [7] X Research source Just go to https://hyperfollow.com to claim your URL and sign up. If you use CDBaby, set up a free Show.co account, which allows you to create pre-save campaigns and use other marketing tools. [8] X Research source To get started, go to your CDBaby dashboard and click Free Marketing Tools with Show.co . [9] X Research source Many other distributors offer options for creating pre-save buttons. Check with your distributor if you're not sure. You can also use a music-friendly \"Link in Bio\" tool like Linkfire, Feature.fm, or Hypeddit. Just keep in mind that most of these services do charge a fee. Sign up for an account and follow the on-screen instructions to create your artist landing page."
