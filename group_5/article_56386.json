      "title": "Team up.",
      "content": "Team up. Not every class is tanky, and sorcerers are notoriously not great punching bags. If you're a lower level and don't have many skills available to you, group up with other players for an easier time fighting the Butcher. Barbarians should tank him while ranged classes, like sorcerers and necromancers, damage him from afar. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay out of melee range.",
      "content": "Stay out of melee range. You want to find that sweet spot where you aren't in danger of his Double Swing, but he also won't use Headbutt or Sickle Grab to pull you in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use terrain as an obstacle.",
      "content": "Use terrain as an obstacle. This is a good way to stay out of melee range. By putting walls or doors between the two of you, you're safe from his melee attacks as he lumbers toward you. The easiest tactic to use is to kite him around terrain, like an archway. [2] X Research source Some players find that elevation does the trick: you can climb a ladder to safety and continue to deal damage while he sits hopelessly below! Other players note that he disappears sometimes, and he won't be found in the dungeon again if he despawns."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run around him while attacking.",
      "content": "Run around him while attacking. Doing this ensures that you're staying behind him while still doing damage. The Butcher isn't able to turn as quickly as you can run around him, so he'll have a harder time hitting you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch for attack indicators.",
      "content": "Watch for attack indicators. Depending on whether or not you changed the default settings for the colors, there'll be red indicators on the ground that show where the next attack will strike. If you watch out for them, you'll be able to dodge the damage! If you defeat the Butcher, you could win his cleaver!"

    {
      "title": "The Butcher appears randomly in dungeons in Sanctuary.",
      "content": "The Butcher appears randomly in dungeons in Sanctuary. You might not see him the first time you enter a non-story dungeon, or you might still be looking for him the 20th time you enter a dungeon. He's a random appearance, so don't fret about not finding him easily! Some players have noted audio clues that let you know if the Butcher is near. So if you have headphones on, listen for the boss music to begin playing. It's notably faster and more exciting than the normal background music, and it will stop playing when you leave your current area. [3] X Research source If you die, climb a ladder and keep running away, or leave the area, the Butcher will despawn and no longer appear in that dungeon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get him stuck in a doorway.",
      "content": "Get him stuck in a doorway. The Butcher isn't an agile boss, so he can get stuck on things, like doorways that he doesn't easily fit through. His weakness is doors; specifically, closed doors and doorways that are smaller than him."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use ranged attacks through closed doors.",
      "content": "Use ranged attacks through closed doors. Sometimes, a shut and locked door seems like an obstacle to get rid of. But, if you can target the Butcher, you can damage him!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take advantage of collision detection.",
      "content": "Take advantage of collision detection. Diablo 4 has great graphics, and part of that includes how objects interact with each other. Luckily for you, the Butcher can't walk straight through a solid object, like an altar, so you have time to damage him while he lumbers around it! This is also in play when you get the Butcher stuck in a doorway that's too small for him, or if you surround him with necromancer minions, which he gets stuck on and can't get around."
