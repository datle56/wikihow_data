      "content": "A few well-chosen words can make your message special. Instead of just saying “Happy Birthday,” write a short message reflecting on a favorite shared memory, explaining what makes your friend special to you, or dropping a reference to a shared in-joke between the two of you. Go to your friend’s wall and click Write something to [your friend’s name] at the top of the page to leave your message. If their birthday shows up in your list of notifications, you can also click on the notification. You’ll get the option to send them a private message or write a message on their timeline. For example, try saying something like, “Happy birthday to the funniest guy I know! Here’s to many more years of game nights and cooking show marathons.” Or, “Even though we can’t get together in person for your birthday this year, know that I’m thinking of you. Have the best day ever!” Once you’ve crafted your message, click the background button at the bottom left side of the text box. Choose a festive background to give your birthday wishes some extra pizzazz. [1] X Research source"
