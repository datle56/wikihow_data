      "title": "Virgo men tend to be attracted to clean, well-groomed women.",
      "content": "Virgo men tend to be attracted to clean, well-groomed women. When it comes to his appearance, the typical Virgo man could best be described as \"fastidious.\" He's a perfectionist and expects his companion to have similar standards. Your Cancerian closet full of timeless classics should provide plenty of options to draw in that Virgo guy. He does like expensive brands, but that doesn't mean that you have to break out designer duds all the time. It's more important to wear clean, well-maintained clothes that fit your body well. Stick to neutral or muted colors, which he prefers to anything bright and bold. If you usually wear makeup, keep it minimal around him. He's not necessarily one for dramatic or bold looks."

      "title": "Virgo men admire a natural mothering instinct.",
      "content": "Virgo men admire a natural mothering instinct. Cancer women are daughters of the celestial mother figure the Moon. For this reason, your sign is considered the most nurturing of the zodiac, so this shouldn't be hard for you at all. [1] X Research source Snuggle a puppy or hold a baby and he'll be putty in your hands. If you dream of being a mother someday, tell him about it! You don't have to worry about scaring him off—Virgos tend to look forward to starting a family as well, so chances are you're on the same page."

      "title": "The typical Virgo loves to be helpful.",
      "content": "The typical Virgo loves to be helpful. If you've got a problem that you can't figure out, he'll be happy to help you solve it. Even better, ask him about something you know he's really good at—he'll appreciate that you acknowledge his expertise. Since, as a Cancer, you love to be catered to and taken care of in a relationship, this is a great way to get that ball rolling. It's also a great way to strike up that first conversation if you've never really spoken to him before. For example, if he's a computer science major, you might ask him about a particularly sticky problem you keep having with your computer. As a practical Earth sign, Virgo men also tend to be good with their hands, so don't hesitate to ask if he can take a look at that wobbly chair or the leaky faucet in your bathroom. Reader Poll: We asked 490 wikiHow readers who've dated a Virgo man, and 77% of them agreed that the best way to attract his attention is by asking for help with a project. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Your Virgo man is going to be a bit standoffish at first. [2] X Research source Unfortunately, Cancer women tend to be pretty standoffish as well, so this might be hard for you. But if you're into this guy, you might have to make the first move (and the second, and the third). Rest assured, though, he's not going out with you to humor you—if he accepts your invitations, he's into you as well. At the same time, you don't want to be too pushy—although that shouldn't be a problem for a guarded crab. Try gently suggesting something fun, such as a concert or a trip to a local museum, and he'll be game."

      "content": "Virgos are typically homebodies too so a night in is perfect for him. You know how you'd rather stay in and watch a movie than go out on the town? That Virgo guy is right there with you. If you know your way around a kitchen, you might cook him dinner as well—then he'll really be interested. Keep this in mind any time you're planning something for the two of you to do together. He tends to be introverted (which you can likely understand as a Cancer), so he's going to need time to recharge after a raucous party or a night at a dance club.

      "content": "Virgos tend to be pretty strait-laced and a little old-fashioned. You'll likely know if your guy fits this Virgo stereotype by his reputation and how he acts in public, but most Virgos are perfect gentlemen. Luckily for you as a Cancer, this is probably right up your alley. But if you have a bit of a wild side, keep it under wraps until the two of you know each other a little better. Keep in mind that Virgos tend to be pretty shy as well, so he's not one who wants to be the center of attention. He's not going to be attracted to the loud, bold type—not that Cancers have the reputation for that anyway."

      "title": "Virgo men tend to be very charitable by nature.",
      "content": "Virgo men tend to be very charitable by nature. If you're involved with a local charity, bring it up around him and he'll definitely be impressed. For a great date idea, suggest going to a charity dinner and he'll swoon. An opportunity to dress up and help the less fortunate? It's hard to plan a better evening for a Virgo. For example, if you volunteer to serve food at a local homeless shelter, invite him along with you—he'll love helping out and really appreciate that you're right there with him. Cancers are nurturing types, so it's likely you work with some sort of organization that helps the downtrodden or defenseless, such as an animal shelter or a children's charity."

      "content": "Virgos are known for their intelligence and love witty banter. You don't have to worry about hiding your intelligence around a Virgo guy. Ruled by the logical planet Mercury, Virgos are some of the most intelligent and analytical guys in the zodiac. Moon maidens are known to be smart, so just show him that you're his intellectual equal and you'll have him wrapped around your finger in no time. [4] X Research source This is really easy if you happen to go to school together. Just ask him about his favorite classes or talk to him about your latest research project. You might also ask him about the last book he read, or talk about your favorite book that you've read recently. Virgos also tend to love in-depth documentaries."

      "content": "Virgo men tend to be very efficient and exacting about time. If you tell him you're going to meet him at a café at noon, be there at 11:55. He'll appreciate that you're reliable and consistent. This can be tough for you, Cancer, since your sign has a reputation for being notoriously late—but if you set him as a priority, you'll get better at it. If something happens and you're going to be late or need to reschedule, text him as soon as possible and let him know. Show that you're respectful of his time and don't want to keep him waiting and he'll love that."

      "content": "Virgos tend to take a while to open up, so this relationship will likely move slowly. Just keep in mind that the best things are worth waiting for. A Virgo guy typically wants to be really comfortable around someone before he truly lets them in. As a guarded Cancer, you likely understand this very well. [5] X Research source When he does start talking about his feelings, listen and ask questions to encourage him to open up more. If you interrupt him or make light of what he's saying, he'll think twice before he shares his emotions with you again."

      "title": "Your Virgo guy understands the importance of keepsakes.",
      "content": "Your Virgo guy understands the importance of keepsakes. Cancers have the reputation for being packrats, and a Virgo won't mind that at all (because he's typically the same way). That hair ribbon from your final dance recital? The remnants of your favorite baby blanket? He'll treasure those things—and the stories behind them—as much as you do. [6] X Research source This is also a good way to get him to open up. Virgo guys tend to have a hard time expressing their emotions, but sharing a beloved possession with him gives him an opening to share something of his own."

      "content": "Virgo men typically adore quality handcrafted items. It doesn't have to be big or expensive, but if it was made especially for him, he'll swoon. As a Water sign, your Cancerian intuition will tell you exactly what the perfect gift for him would be. He's a big fan of thoughtful gifts that he'll use every day, such as a fancy shaving kit. If you're crafty, you might make him something yourself—he'll treasure it forever if he knows that you created it especially for him."
