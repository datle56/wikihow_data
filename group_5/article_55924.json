      "content": "Idk is short for “I don’t know.” People mostly use this when texting or messaging. If you don’t feel like typing out “I don’t know” in full, then idk will work just fine. You might see it stylized as idk, IDK, or I.D.K., but just know that they all mean the exact same thing. [1] X Research source Idk is a very informal slang expression. Avoid using it in professional settings or when you’re talking to someone in a formal manner, such as if you’re talking to your boss or teacher. A similar abbreviation is idek which is short for “I don’t even know.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Type idk when you don’t know the answer to something. Just as you would use “I don’t know,” reply with idk when you don’t know the answer to someone’s question or aren’t completely sure. Feel free to just send idk by itself, or add on an explanation or any information that you do have to help the other person out. [3] X Research source Them: “Do you know when Jennie’s birthday is?” You: “Idk 🤷” Them: “Were we supposed to turn in that paper today?” You: “Uh idk? 😬 I thought it was due tomorrow??” Them: “Where’s my jacket?” You: “Idk I haven’t seen it.”"

      "content": "Let someone know you’re confused by sending idk. If you don’t have enough information or are just genuinely puzzled, send idk via text to let the other person know. For example, send it when you’re not sure where something is or if you don’t know what your exact plans are. “Idk where my book went…😭” “Idk if I’ll be home tonight, so just eat without me.” “Idk where we’re going but we’ll be back later.” “Tell me which version I should use cuz idk 😅” “Idk what she thinks about the idea but I hope it works out 🤞”"

      "content": "Express frustration with idk. When you’re feeling a bit fed up or frustrated, sticking idk (or idek) in your text can help get the message across. Be sure to also throw in some exasperated-looking emojis as well to better convey your feelings. “Idk anymore 🙄” “Idek. I don’t want to talk about it 😒” “Idk bro. Do whatever you want.” “Idk just pick whatever.” “Idk it’s fine. You can all just go ahead.”"

      "content": "Show that you’re hesitating by sending idk. When you want to let someone know that you’re not 100% certain about a decision or answer, send idk along with your message. It’s also good to add if you’re reluctant to do or say something. For example: “Idk if I should go or not 😬 What if something goes wrong?” “I might buy this dress online but idk…It’s kind of expensive 😳” “Idk if it’s a good idea to meet up Friday. I have so much work to do 😢” “Jason wants to go get dinner. Idk should we?” “I want to go on a vacation but idk. Where would I even go? 🤔”"

      "content": "Express nonchalance with idk. Since you usually only use idk in casual situations, it’s the perfect thing to add to your message if you want to come off as carefree and relaxed. It gives off the impression that you’re open to anything and are willing to go with the flow. For example: “Idk I’m down for anything really.” “I’m free on Friday. We can just hang out or something idk.” “Idk I might go for a walk or something. We’ll see 🤷” “We’re trying to decide on a movie but idk I’m really good with anything.” “Idk I think I’m just going to stay in this weekend and sleep haha 😴”"
