      "title": "Choose a Sim with the ability to get pregnant.",
      "content": "Choose a Sim with the ability to get pregnant. The gender of your Sim doesn't matter as long as they can get pregnant and their partner can get others pregnant. Make sure less than eight Sims are living on the lot. If your Sim is part of an eight-Sim household, someone will need to move out before your Sim can get pregnant. Only Young Adults and Adults can get pregnant. Teens and Elders cannot get pregnant without third-party hacks."

      "content": "Make your Sim friends with a Sim who can impregnate others. If your Sim isn't already in a relationship with a Sim that can impregnate them, you'll need to have them befriend one. Find or create a Sim who can get others pregnant and build their friendship with Friendly or Funny interactions. Female Sims you didn’t create usually can’t impregnate you. You may want to ensure the Sim is single. If they’re taken, it can be harder to build romance."

      "content": "Build up a romantic relationship between the two Sims. For your Sims to be able to WooHoo, they'll need a romantic relationship of at least 40% to 50%. [1] X Research source If their relationship is higher than that, they're less likely to get rejected."

      "title": "Direct your Sim to take a pregnancy test.",
      "content": "Direct your Sim to take a pregnancy test. Unlike in previous games, there is no chime after Try For Baby to tell you whether your Sim is pregnant. Instead, click on the toilet and select Take Pregnancy Test , which costs 15 Simoleons. If your Sim is pregnant, you'll get the \"Eating for Two\" notification, and your Sim will walk over to their partner and share the news. If your Sim is not pregnant, they'll get a Sad moodlet and you'll need to try again. Don't stress if your Sim is incredibly poor and can't afford the test; if they're pregnant, the game will give you the \"Eating for Two\" notification after a few in-game hours."

      "content": "Influence the pregnancy. If you want your Sim to have a certain number of children, there are ways to increase the chances of that happening besides letting the game choose. To have twins or triplets, buy the Fertile reward trait. This costs 3000 Satisfaction points. (Fertility Massages are an option for players with Spa Day, but they must be administered before the Sim tries for a baby.)

If you want your Sim to have a girl, direct them to eat strawberries or listen to pop music."

Once your Sim goes into labor, you have two options: Keep your Sim at home. They'll be in labor for a few hours, and then give birth. Send your Sim to give birth at a hospital. Click on your Sim and send them to the hospital. If you don't have Get To Work, the Sim will disappear off the lot for a few hours; if you do, you'll go with them to the hospital. (If you send them to the hospital, their partner will come with them.) They'll give birth at the hospital and bring their child home."
