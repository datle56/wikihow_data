      "title": "Pick the right pineapple.",
      "content": "Pick the right pineapple. If your pineapple is under ripe it will be sour. If it is overripe, it may be way too sweet. Picking the right pineapple is the most important step for making delicious pineapple juice. Smell the pineapple. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's not ripe. Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it. Look at the pineapple's color. It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green pineapple is not necessarily unripe. Be aware that some pineapples are considered ripe when green. Place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance. Avoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves. You want the pineapple to be firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it on the bottom indentation. While you can use frozen or canned pineapple, fresh pineapples usually produce a better tasting juice."

      "title": "Cut off the stem.",
      "content": "Cut off the stem. Set the pineapple on your cutting board. You will need a very sharp chef’s knife to peel a pineapple well. Lay it on its side. Place your knife one-fourth inch (0.6cm) below the leaves. Slice until you reach the leaves. Turn the pineapple and repeat until you have cut the top of the pineapple and many of the leaves away in a circle. Lift them up through the center leaves and discard them. You can use the remaining center leaves to hold the pineapple steady as you cut it. Some cooks suggest cutting the entire top off. You can do this also, but you should be careful not to let your hand slip from the top of the pineapple. Cutting the pineapple releases a lot of slippery juice."

      "content": "Peel the pineapple . Start at the top of the pineapple and slice through the outside peel until you reach the bottom. You can cut in a slight outward facing arc in order to save more pineapple fruit. Turn the pineapple clockwise about two to four inches (five to 10cm) and repeat. Turn, slice and repeat until you have removed the peel and only the eyes remain. Place the pineapple on its side and cut the bottom off horizontally. Discard the skin of the pineapple in your compost or the garbage can."
