      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. You’ll need 3 iron for a bucket, a source of lava, and a source of water. Mine iron underground or look for it on the walls of a cave. Smelt the iron in a furnace and then craft a bucket. Lava sometimes appears in pools on the surface, but you’ll need to get underground below Y:9 for them to be common. Craft two buckets if you want to carry both the lava and water at the same time. Some cobblestone (or another non-flammable block) can be used to reduce the chance of the generated cobblestone falling in lava. If you are playing SkyBlock, you may have a block of ice instead of a water bucket. You can place the ice down and break it to get water."

      "content": "Dig a one block deep hole and a two block deep hole next to it. Place the water in the one block deep hole so that it flows into the two block hole. If the water turns the lava into obsidian, you may not have dug the second hole two blocks deep."

      "title": "Improve your generator.",
      "content": "Improve your generator. Cover up the lava and water so that you don’t fall into it with non-flammable blocks (cobblestone, dirt, clay, etc.). This will also help prevent cobblestone you mine from being burned by the lava. Break a block in front of the generator to stand in so that you can mine and pick up your cobblestone more easily."
