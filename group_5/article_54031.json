      "content": "Raise Tyrunt to Level 39. This is the first level that Tyrunt can evolve at. You can raise Tyrunt's level by fighting other Pokémon, or by using Rare Candies. Tyrunt is very effective against Flying, Poison, Fire, and Electric-Type Pokémon. Fight Pokémon like Pidgeotto, Koffing, Charmeleon, and Pikachu to quickly win battles and raise Tyrunt's level."

      "content": "Wait for daytime. In order to evolve, Tyrunt must level up during the day. This can be Level 39, or any level after that. Daytime counts both Morning and Day, so you can perform this evolution anytime between 4 AM and 8 PM. [1] X Research source Changing your system's clock to make daytime occur will prevent any time-based evolutions for 24 hours. Pokémon X, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Omega Ruby all follow the same schedules."

      "title": "Level up one more time during the day to evolve into Tyrantrum.",
      "content": "Level up one more time during the day to evolve into Tyrantrum. Again, you can fight Pokémon or use a Rare Candy. Tyrunt can start evolving at Level 39, so if you reach Level 39 during the day it will evolve immediately into Tyrantrum. [2] X Research source"
