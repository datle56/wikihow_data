And once they choose you, they become your cat to love and take care of. [1] X Research source This idea is also called the Universal Cat Distribution System and the Cat Distribution Theory."

      "content": "The system has a semi-mystical explanation. Many believe that the universe pairs up people with cats or kittens, seemingly at random. You may be going to work or sitting in your backyard, and then a cat appears out of nowhere. People explain it by saying that the universe has determined you’re a good person and entrusted you with a cat to care for. In some cases, you may even intend on adopting a kitten, but then you end up coming home with 2 kittens instead of 1."

      "content": "A friendly cat shows up unexpectedly. A cat or kitten, usually a stray but possibly an adventurous pet, approaches a stranger. Even though they have never met before, the cat meows and demands attention. Some even report the cat jumping onto their lap or into their car. Small kittens have been said to approach a stranger and climb up their pant legs."

      "content": "The cat doesn’t leave, or they come back regularly. If the person manages to resist the cat the first time they meet, the cat will reappear in the same spot, seemingly waiting for the person to arrive. They may even follow the person home. These cats can continue reappearing, showing more affection and acting cute until the person gives in to the will of the universe (or the cat) and takes them home."

      "content": "The person begins to feed the cat and show them affection. The person starts to look forward to seeing the cat every day. They show the cat affection and buy a small bag of food. Of course, they don’t want the cat to starve. If the cat doesn’t appear one day, the person may worry about them. They may keep checking back or take time out of their daily routine to try to find the cat."

      "content": "The cat now belongs to the person and is allowed in the house. The next time the person sees the cat, they will feel relieved. Since they already have food for the cat, they gather up their new friend and take them home for a flea bath and a trip to the vet for any necessary medical treatment or vaccinations. While this is a commonly reported sequence for the Cat Distribution System, there are also many cases where the person takes the cat into their home immediately."

      "content": "The first recognized use of the term was on TikTok in November 2022. The user @hermes.the.cynic posted a video explaining the Cat Distribution System. Since posting this video, the idea of a Cat Distribution System has gone viral, with users across multiple social media platforms sharing their stories about being granted a cat or kitten by the universe. There’s also a dedicated Reddit forum with multiple posts a day sharing their experiences with the Cat Distribution System. The idea that cats choose their owners was around before 2022, but most believe it became known as the Cat Distribution System after that time."

This viral buzz has taken the Cat Distribution System beyond the status of a meme. With users now actually believing in the system, many feel it’s approaching folklore status. A meme is a piece of information – like catchphrases, emojis, or gifs – that spread through culture.

Talk to neighbors or other people who frequent the area to determine if the cat is a stray or simply a beloved pet who spends some time outdoors. [4] X Research source Post notices on neighborhood social media networks like Facebook or NextDoor . You must sign up for a Facebook account or join NextDoor to post. Hang signs around the neighborhood, preferably with pictures, asking if the cat belongs to anyone. Contact local shelters and veterinary clinics to see if anyone has reported a lost pet."

Whether you keep the cat, return them to their owner, or help them find a new home, it may be a good idea to take them in for a wellness check.

Even friendly cats can bite or claw if they become frightened, so take it slow and lure them into the carrier with food. [6] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source If you aren’t able to place the cat in a pet carrier, try using a live trap to catch the stray cat . A live trap opens at both ends and has a basic trigger in the center where you can put food to entice the cat. When they trigger the trap, the doors shut, enclosing the cat inside the cage. Some spay and neuter organizations allow you to borrow a live trap to catch feral cats."

      "content": "Give the cat a safe place to hang out for a few days at least. First, prepare a safe room with all the basics the cat will need as they adjust to living inside. Cat safe room essentials include food, water, a litter box, toys, a scratching post or pad, and a soft place to sleep. A covered cat bed is a good choice because it gives the cat a cozy hiding spot. [7] X Research source Always use a pet carrier to bring them inside, especially if you have other pets or children. Take the cat to the safe room and close the door. Allowing them to roam the whole house right away can make them feel stressed or afraid. The cat may need to spend a week or more in the safe room, so set aside time to sit with them. Don’t pet them if they seem standoffish. Allow them to come to you for affection. Only bring the cat into your home once you have determined they are healthy and not someone else’s pet."

This is fine as long as interactions are friendly.

This way, the pets can get used to each other without injuries or fighting. Gradually let them spend more time together under supervision to ensure both are safe. If a dog shows too much interest in the new cat, reward them with a treat when they ignore the cat or distract them with a toy. If the cat is not able to get along with your current pets after a month, it may be time to consider finding another home for them or talking to an animal behavior specialist."

      "content": "Is the Cat Distribution System real? While there’s no way to prove if the universe is sending you a cat or that a cat instinctively knows who the “right” owner is, there are many people who believe the Cat Distribution System is real. However, it may simply be the result of the large number of stray or feral cats that exist in the world. It’s difficult to know how many feral cats there are in the US, but the best estimate is about 32 million, with roughly 76% living in urban areas. [10] X Research source While a truly feral cat is unsocialized and unlikely to approach humans, many strays are former pets or kittens who have not yet developed a fear of humans."

There is also a dedicated Dog Distribution System Reddit forum and some social media activity. However, the Reddit forum is less active and the phrase appears to be much less popular on social media than the Cat Distribution System. Many believe the Dog Distribution System results from irresponsible owners abandoning a pet dog or dumping a pregnant female dog."
