Bleach creates harsh fumes and can irritate your skin, so wear a respirator mask and gloves when you work with it. Move to a well-ventilated area, like your kitchen or outside, and pour ¾ cup (180 ml) of bleach into a bucket. Then, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and mix the solution together.

      "content": "Dip a cloth in the bleach solution and wipe down the gasket. Open the washing machine door and locate the gray, rubber gasket between the door and the drum. Then, soak an old washcloth or towel in the bleach solution and squeeze out the excess moisture. Rub the cloth over the surface of the gasket and then pull the rubber apart to wipe inside the crevice. [2] X Research source Soak the cloth in the bleach solution whenever the rag looks dirty or feels dry. If there are any clothes in your washer, take them out before you clean. Or, use sodium percarbonate (oxygenated bleach) to remove mold from the gasket. This powerful ingredient can be found in OxyClean."

Leaving the bleach on the gasket gives it time to kill the bacteria, black mold, mildew, and soap scum that are creating unpleasant odors. Just set a timer for 5 minutes, or 10 minutes if the gasket is covered in mold or mildew. [3] X Research source"

Then, wipe the surface and crevice of the gasket to remove the bleach and the mold or mildew residue. Inspect the gasket to ensure it’s clean, then use a dry, clean cloth to wipe the gasket completely dry. [4] X Research source If there is still mold, mildew, or soap scum on or inside the gasket, spray the spots with the bleach solution and scrub them with a toothbrush or sponge. Leave the door open or ajar so moisture doesn't get trapped in the gasket."

Then, fill a spray bottle with distilled white vinegar and spray the surface of the gasket and inside the crevice. Scrub the gasket with a scrubbing sponge or toothbrush to get rid of the mold. [5] X Research source Wipe the gasket with a clean damp cloth to rinse away the baking soda, vinegar, and debris, or run an empty washing cycle. Dry the gasket with a clean cloth after rinsing off the baking soda and vinegar. Warning : Never mix or use bleach with vinegar, baking soda, or other cleaners.

[17] X Research source If you left clothes in the washer and they smell like mildew, remove the smell by adding 1 cup (240 ml) of vinegar or ½ cup (110 g) of baking soda onto your clothes.

Closing the washing machine door after you take wet clothes out of the machine traps moisture near the gasket, which leads to mold, mildew, and odors. Instead, leave the machine door completely open to help the gasket dry out. Or, keep it cracked open to allow the moisture to evaporate. If you have small children or pets that can access the washing machine, keep the door closed to prevent any potential injuries. And for extra security, keep the door to the laundry room locked."

Wipe down the surface, then carefully pull the gasket back to dry inside the crevice. Use a clean cloth so you don't transfer bacteria or moisture from dirty fabric to the gasket. Front-loading washers tend to accumulate more mold and mildew because they have gaskets, unlike top-loading washers. The gasket ensures that no water leaks out of the machine during the wash cycle, but it also traps moisture that mold loves to grow in. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the recommended amount and type of detergent for your washer. Check the label on your detergent to see how much to use for different-sized washes. Using more detergent than the recommended amount creates more suds which creates more soap scum and mildew buildup. If you have a high-efficiency (HE) washer, only use high-efficiency detergent . HE washers use less water and need fewer suds, which HE detergents provide. [20] X Research source Switch to powder detergent if possible, too. Powder detergent tends to produce fewer suds than liquid. Use dryer sheets or dryer balls instead of liquid fabric softener if you want to make your clothes smell extra nice. Fabric softener tends to leave behind residue that attracts mold and mildew."
