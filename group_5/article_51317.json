So long as you check both of those boxes, you’ll be able to buy a pistol. [1] X Research source Only Michigan residents may purchase a pistol in Michigan unless you have a CPL (concealed pistol license) or a license to purchase, carry, or transport a weapon from another state. [2] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source You only have to be 18 to buy a long gun in Michigan. Long guns refer to rifles, carbines, and shotguns. Since these weapons are less likely to be used in the commission of a crime, the legal restrictions aren’t as intense. As of 2023, the purchasing process for handguns and long guns is identical (outside of the different age requirements). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a permit from your local police department (if you don’t have a CPL). If you are purchasing a gun from a friend, online private seller, or at gun show, you must get a purchase permit. This is also called a license to purchase, or an LTP. Stop by your local police department and tell them you want to buy a gun from a private seller. They’ll fill out the permit for you. [4] X Research source Do you have a CPL? If you are a CPL holder and you’re purchasing privately, all you need is to fill out an RI-60 and drop it off at your local police department. There are other organizations that can grant purchase permits, but it’ll be fastest and easiest to just go to your local police department. If you’re in a rural area with no local PD, go to the sheriff’s office. Bring valid identification with you. You must present police with a current ID that shows your photograph."

      "content": "Pass the background check at the police precinct. Once you fill out the permit at your local police department, they’ll run a background check. It's not super invasive—they're mainly checking to see if you've got a criminal history, a “red flag” marker, or any restraining orders to your name. [5] X Research source Michigan no longer requires the Basic Pistol Safety Questionnaire for handgun buyers, just for the record."

The police can only deny the permit if you've been convicted of a felony, you have a “red flag” on your background check, or you have displayed a history of violent or mentally unstable behavior. [6] X Research source You'll also receive a sales record (PSR) in triplicate. One will be for you, one will be for the police, and one will be for your seller. Don't lose these! Some police stations will charge a $5-10 filing fee for this service."

If you forget to drop a copy of your PSR off, do it ASAP! You may be issued a $250 ticket, but they may not follow up with you. If you never turn the copy in, you could end up in hot water for carrying an illegal weapon."
