Although the web-based Google Earth can technically open topographical map overlay files, it sometimes has difficulty displaying them if they contain too much data. To download Google Earth, go to https://www.google.com/earth/download/gep/agree.html?hl=en-GB , review the terms, click Agree and Download . Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded file to install Google Earth Pro."

[1] X Research source A great way to find a map is to search the web for \"topographical map of (region) in KML format.\" You could replace \"KML\" with \"KMZ\" or \"Google Earth\" in your search. Here are a few options for United States and worldwide maps: To download a quick broad topographical map file for the entire United States, go to https://www.earthpoint.us/topomap.aspx in a web browser, click View On Google Earth , and download the KML file to your computer. For more detailed maps focused on smaller regions within the US, go to https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview . Click the red circle that says View and Download , type the location you're looking for, and then click the search icon to search. Click the third icon at the top-left to toggle on the topographical map overlay. When you find a map you want, click the map, click the number at the top-right, then click the KMZ link to download it. You'll need to unzip the file after downloading it.
