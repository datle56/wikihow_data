      "content": "Discharging a LiPo battery fully makes it safe for disposal. Plug the battery into the charger and place them in a fireproof container . Turn the charger on to the “discharge” setting. Set the voltage to 0, and change the discharge rate to the one printed on the battery. Then, just allow the battery to drain slowly until it has no power. [1] X Research source Always discharge your LiPo battery away from other flammable materials to prevent any risk of fire. If your charger has a discharge voltage limit or doesn’t have a setting at all, contact a professional battery disposal service to find out the next steps. Avoid using DIY methods to discharge your battery, such as connecting it to a light bulb, soaking it in saltwater, or physically destroying it. These methods may not discharge the battery to a safe level and could be dangerous. If your LiPo battery is damaged, swollen, or punctured, stop using it immediately and avoid discharging it because it’s more likely to start a fire. [2] X Research source"
