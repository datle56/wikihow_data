      "title": "Select Fimo Eberhard Faber clay.",
      "content": "Select Fimo Eberhard Faber clay. This is the most widely-available polymer clay and the most popular among clay artists. Fimo comes in 58g (2 ounces) and 350g (12.5 ounces) packages. It is the stiffest of the clays and the most difficult to condition. [1] X Research source Fimo's firmness lets it hold very fine detail, and smearing is rare. This is important to consider if you plan on painting your rose after crafting it. When fired, Fimo is very strong. It has a slightly glossy surface. It also buffs well and develops a high shine. This brand of clay also comes in a beautiful selection of colors, including two transparent clays, six \"stone\" textured clays, a glow-in-the-dark clay, and metallic colored clay (\"perglantz\"). There is also a soft formulation of Fimo that comes in a different selection of colors."

      "content": "Choose Promat Polyform Products Co. clay. This is another strong type of clay - ideal for making a rose - but is slowly becoming hard to acquire because it is being phased out by Premo Sculpey clay. Promat is firmer than texture than Premo (its common substitute). It is harder to condition but less prone to smearing and stronger when fired. It is also flexible in thin sheets, which is optimal for when you craft the rose petals."

      "title": "Opt for Cernit T&F GmbH clay.",
      "content": "Opt for Cernit T&F GmbH clay. Cernit is the strongest of the polymer clays. Cernit has a porcelain, waxy finish when fired and is often used for doll-making because of its high quality when fired. Though Cernit is the strongest of the clays, it is not as difficult to condition as Fimo. If you have delicate hands, choose Cernit over Fimo to go easy on your hands while still ensuring sturdiness."

      "title": "Pick a clay color to use as the rose petals.",
      "content": "Pick a clay color to use as the rose petals. For a better finished product, choose one as close to the color red as possible. If you're going for texture, Fimo and Cernit are your best options because of their refined finish after being fired. If you're going for color, Fimo has the wider range of colors and may produce the best contrast when crafting your rose. Light pink is also a nice color. When you attach the calyx, or the green outer whorl of the flower, the contrast between colors will make your rose pop with contrast."

      "title": "Stretch and compress the clay with your hands.",
      "content": "Stretch and compress the clay with your hands. This is known as conditioning, and it is necessary for making the clay ready to work with. The physical process of stretching and compressing, combined with the warmth of your hands, changes the texture of the clay, making it softer and more pliable. [2] X Research source It also makes the clay stickier and less brittle, which is ideal when making thin sheets for the petals. Take a chunk of clay (about a half an ounce or so) and squish it between your fingers. As it warms and softens, roll it between your palms into a snake shape. Then move your hands against each other in a circular motion to compress the snake back into ball. Repeat this process several times until the clay is soft and easily molded. For stubborn clay like Fimo, there are techniques for speeding up the conditioning process. Sit on the clay for 15-20 minutes to mildly warm it. Do not lay it in the sun or on a heating pad, as excessive heat will cause the clay to start curing, making it unusable. You can also use a food processor to chop the clay into smaller pieces to condition."

      "content": "Roll a ball of clay into the size you want your rose to be. Further divide this ball into seven even pieces, as these will be used to form your petals. [3] X Research source The pieces should be about the same size, but they don't need to be exact. Having different sized petals will actually make your rose look realistic and natural. For a 2 inch (5.1 cm) wide rose, roll your clay into a 1 inch (2.5 cm) ball."

You want few visible lines on the surface of your petal. The size and shape of this petal should be similar to a standard guitar pick. The point, which will become the base of the rose, should be thicker than the opposite edge, which will be the top of the petal. The top edge should be about 1/16 of an inch thick.

Heating causes chemical changes in the clay, making it hard and strong. Polymer clays, like the ones used for clay rose, don't require a special kiln and can harden normally in a standard kitchen oven. The oven temperature must reach at least 210 °F (99 °C) for the polymer to fuse properly; however, if the temperature goes above 300 °F (149 °C), the clay may burn, giving off dangerous fumes. [5] X Research source Most manufacturers recommend temperatures between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit for all clays that are not translucent. If you are using translucent clay, keep the temperature between 210 and 220 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid changing its color [6] X Research source"

Make a box out of strong clay and carefully attach several clay roses to the top. Attaching fired roses is ideal since joining two soft clay items can be difficult and can distort the shape. After you've successfully attached the items, fire it in the oven using the same temperature and bake time as the clay rose. Your box is now both practical and pleasant."
