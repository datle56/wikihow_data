      "title": "Dab the stain with a paper towel to soak up excess ink.",
      "content": "Dab the stain with a paper towel to soak up excess ink. It’s important to do this right away, while the ink is still wet. Don’t rub or wipe the area—this pushes the ink deeper into the fabric and causes it to spread, which makes it harder to remove. Simply press the paper towel gently into the stain and continue to blot until you've removed as much of the ink as possible. [1] X Research source Check the care label on your jeans before moving onto the next step. If the label says “dry clean only,” pause here and take your jeans to the dry cleaners to remove the stain. If it says your jeans are machine washable, move on to the next step."

      "content": "Place a clean wash cloth inside the jeans under the stain. This prevents the ink from transferring to other parts of the fabric during the stain removal process. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a towel or a wash cloth, a few paper towels should do the trick."

      "title": "Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to the stain. For a larger stain, slowly and carefully pour a few drops of 90% isopropyl alcohol directly to the area. For a smaller stain, wet a cotton ball or cotton swab with the alcohol and apply it to the stain. [3] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Stain Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Make sure you’re only getting the alcohol on the stained area, so the ink doesn’t bleed or spread. If you’re worried about how the alcohol will affect the fabric, do a patch test on a small, unnoticeable area first."

      "title": "Blot the stain with a clean cloth, paper towel, or cotton ball.",
      "content": "Blot the stain with a clean cloth, paper towel, or cotton ball. As you dab, the ink should be drawn out of the fabric. [4] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Stain Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. When your towel or cotton ball starts to get stained, discard it and use a fresh one to continue dabbing at the area. Continue this process until you’ve soaked up as much of the ink as possible. For older, more severe stains, allow the alcohol to sit for about 15 minutes before blotting."

Make sure to follow any special instructions on the care label of your jeans regarding water temperature and wash cycles as well. [6] X Research source Make sure that the ink stain is fully removed before drying your jeans. Once the jeans are dry, leftover ink will be harder to remove. If the stain is still visible, repeat the entire one more time to remove the rest of the ink."

      "content": "Apply hand sanitizer to the ink stain as soon as you see it. Due to its high alcohol content, hand sanitizer is a great alternative to rubbing alcohol if you don’t have any on hand, and it’s also a good on-the-go option. Simply apply a small amount of hand sanitizer to the stain, and allow it to sit for a few minutes to break up the ink. Then, wash your jeans in the washing machine as usual, according to the instructions on the care label. [7] X Research source Be sure to perform a patch test on an inconspicuous area of the jeans first to make sure the hand sanitizer won’t affect the color of the fabric."

[19] X Research source Regardless, always perform a patch test with rubbing alcohol before applying it to the stain, just to be safe. [20] X Research source This is especially important if you're treating a more delicate fabric, like silk or wool. If you notice that the fabric becomes slightly discolored after your patch test, try out a gentler stain removal option, like white vinegar or baking soda, instead."
