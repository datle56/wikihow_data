      "content": "Heat your stainless steel pan over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes. The goal here is to get the pan really hot. Stainless steel pans are actually covered with small pores, and when the pan is exposed to heat, the pores close. This creates a smooth surface that your food won't stick to. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a few drops of water to test if your pan is ready.",
      "content": "Add a few drops of water to test if your pan is ready. When your pan is hot enough, the water will bead up and easily glide across the surface. Once this happens, your pan is effectively nonstick, and you’re ready to add oil and start cooking. If the water splatters, evaporates, or starts boiling, your pan isn’t ready yet. [2] X Research source If the pan is too hot, the water will break down into several droplets instead of forming a bead. If this happens, reduce the heat and try again."

      "title": "Heat your stainless steel skillet over medium or medium-high heat.",
      "content": "Heat your stainless steel skillet over medium or medium-high heat. Don’t add any oil at this point and allow the skillet to heat for about 2 minutes. This allows the pan’s pores to close, and when you add the oil, it will create a nonstick surface that can be used repeatedly. This is called seasoning the pan. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Coat the bottom of the pan with canola or vegetable oil. It’s important to use an oil with a high smoking point like canola oil or vegetable oil. There should be about an ⅛ inch of oil in the bottom of the pan. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Heat the oil until smoke appears.",
      "content": "Heat the oil until smoke appears. The pan should start smoking after about 6 minutes. When it does, remove it from the heat and allow the oil to cool completely. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour out the cool oil and wipe the pan.",
      "content": "Pour out the cool oil and wipe the pan. Use a paper towel to remove any excess oil, leaving a glossy sheen in the base of the pan. This becomes your nonstick surface. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid washing the pan after it’s seasoned.",
      "content": "Avoid washing the pan after it’s seasoned. If possible, just wipe it clean between uses. When the pan gets too dirty, wash it with soap and water, then season it again using the same process. [7] X Research source"
