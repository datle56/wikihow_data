      "title": "In a relationship, their emotional needs can be out of sync.",
      "content": "In a relationship, their emotional needs can be out of sync. Sometimes Libra can end up playing the role of damsel in distress, which can make the independent-minded Sagittarius feel frustrated when they need space. Libra’s sense of aesthetics and sophistication might not match up well with Sagittarius’ grittier outlook. [4] X Research source Since Libras and Sagittariuses genuinely enjoy each other’s company, they can make up for their incompatibilities with quality time spent together. If you’re in one of these relationships and are feeling a little misunderstood, schedule some time together to do an activity—you’ll soon remember why you’re a great pair."

      "title": "Trust can be a hurdle for these signs.",
      "content": "Trust can be a hurdle for these signs. Libra is often romantic and starts planning a fairy tale ending with Sagittarius after they first get a hint of mutual attraction. On the other hand, Sagittarius can be infamous for their unwillingness to commit. This can lead to friction—Libra wants a fantasy of love that Sagittarius feels really uncomfortable in. On the other hand, Libras can also tend to flip-flop between wanting to be in a relationship and wanting to be out of one. This kind of indecisiveness can drive Sagittarius crazy, and make them feel like Libra isn’t trustworthy because they aren’t consistent. In order to develop trust in a relationship, Libra and Sagittarius will need to communicate openly and not try to assume the other’s feelings. Luckily, Sagittarius and Libra can both appreciate a straightforward conversation, so try opening a conversation with something like, “Where do you think our relationship is heading?”"

As an air sign, Libras love diving into ideas, philosophy, and art. These signs naturally appreciate the other’s thoughts and are a formidable intellectual duo. Watching unusual movies or listening to niche music can get both Sagittarius and Libra excited—Libra because of their love for art, and Sagittarius for their interest in new experiences."

      "content": "No relationship is perfect, but this one gets close. Although trust can be an issue between these two signs when Libra’s fantasies don’t give Sagittarius the room they need, communication can overcome this issue. Once there’s trust, Libra and Sagittarius can enjoy their fantastic chemistry in and out of the bedroom and find a partner for their shared journey to discover truth and beauty in the world."
