      "content": "Make a list of your strengths. Narcissists are drawn to people who are less aware of their own abilities and who do not accept themselves the way that they are. To work on self-acceptance , it can be helpful to identify your strengths. You can read over the list on a daily basis to help affirm yourself and work towards accepting yourself for who you are.

      "content": "Acknowledge your needs and emotions. People with low self-esteem may ignore their needs and emotions in favor of other people’s needs and emotions, which can be an attractive quality to a narcissist. If you often find that you put other people’s needs and feelings ahead of your own, then someone who is narcissistic may notice this and use it to his or her advantage. To prevent this, work on being more accepting of your needs and emotions. [4] X Research source When you have an emotion, do not ignore it. Instead, take a moment to acknowledge it, such as by asking yourself, “What am I feeling?” For example, if someone has said something insulting to you, then you might be feeling hurt or angry. After you have identified your emotion, figure out what you think you need to do about it. You can do this by asking yourself, “What do I need?” If you are feeling hurt or angry because of something someone said to you, then you might need to get away from the person for a while or confront the person for insulting you. Practice identifying your feelings and needs every time you experience an emotion. With repetition, acknowledging your emotions and acting on them in a constructive way should become easier."

This can make you vulnerable to someone who is narcissistic. To avoid damaging your self-esteem, try to set small reasonable goals for yourself. [5] X Research source A great way to be reasonable with goal setting is to set SMART goals. SMART stands for: Specific. The goal should be clear. What exactly do you want to accomplish? Who else is involved in the goal? How are you going to do it? Measurable. You should be able to measure your goal, such as with numbers. Attainable. The goal should be something that you can realistically accomplish in the time frame you have given yourself. Relevant. The goal should pertain to a larger objective. For example, if your larger goal is to lose 20 pounds, then a relevant sub-goal of that would be to exercise for 30 minutes five days every week. Time-based. There should be a specific time frame for completing the goal. You might set a date or a number of days to accomplish your goal."

Everyone messes up sometimes, but refusing to forgive yourself can be detrimental to your self-esteem and this may make you seem more attractive to a narcissist. To avoid this, try to treat yourself as you would a good friend and forgive yourself if you make a mistake. Don’t beat yourself up when something goes wrong. [6] X Research source To forgive yourself, you could try writing a letter to yourself as a compassionate friend. What might a friend say to make you feel better? How might he or she talk to you?

Try telling yourself something like, “What happened is upsetting, and you are entitled to feel upset about it, but I want to move forward. I forgive you for what happened.”"

      "content": "Validate yourself. People who have narcissistic tendencies may be attracted to people who seek validation or approval from other people. If you often feel insecure and need other people to tell you that you have done something well, then this may indicate that you are dependent on the praise and feedback of others. This can make it easy for someone who is narcissistic to control you. [14] X Research source Try to work on validating yourself rather than seeking the approval of others. For example, if you earn a promotion, then congratulate yourself for it rather than calling up someone else right away. Look at yourself in the mirror and say, “You did it! I am so proud of you!” You might also try keeping a record of your accomplishments as a self-validation exercise. Every time you succeed at something, make a note of it in your journal. You might even write yourself a brief congratulations in the journal to mark the accomplishment."

[15] X Research source They may talk about their accomplishments and worth with the expectation that you will heap praise on them. However, offering constant praise will cause a narcissist to want to spend more time around you. To avoid attracting narcissists to you, withhold praise from people who constantly seek it. If someone is going on and on about an accomplishment, then you might acknowledge the person and then try changing the subject. For example, you could say something like, “That’s awesome! Good for you! I accomplished some pretty awesome stuff this week too! Hey, did you catch the local news last night?” If the person continues to talk about themselves and their accomplishments, then try excusing yourself. Say something like, \"It has been nice talking with you, but I have to run. Have a great day!\""

[16] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 Aug 2020. [17] X Research source One way that you might let a narcissist know that you will not overlook his or her faults or mistakes is to offer constructive criticism when it is warranted. Doing this from time to time may cause the narcissist to avoid you. For example, if you are playing golf with the person and you notice that he or she is using the wrong type of club for a shot, then you might say something like, “That club is great for long shots, but you might find this shot a little easier if you use this club instead.” Don’t criticize the person for the sake of criticizing. For example, don’t say mean or rude things like, “That dress makes you look fat,” or “Your presentation was a train wreck.” Make sure that you always have something helpful to say if you decide to offer constructive criticism to the person."
