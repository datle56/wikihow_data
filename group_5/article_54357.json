      "content": "Visit your local police station as soon as you suspect that the individual is missing. Tell the officers on duty that you’d like to file a missing person report, and provide as much useful info as you can about the individual (e.g., what they look like, what they were wearing, where they were last). Explain how and why their disappearance feels out of the ordinary. [1] X Research source Many cities and states should let you file a missing person right away, but double-check with law enforcement officers to see what the policy in your area is. Give the police your contact info so they can stay in touch with you in case anything develops. [2] X Research source If at least 72 hours pass and the individual is still missing, make sure that law enforcement passes along their info to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) list. In the event of child abduction, law enforcement may put out an AMBER Alert to help locate the child more efficiently (especially if the child is in major danger). [3] X Research source Tip: While you’re at the police station, check and see if the missing person is booked in jail."
