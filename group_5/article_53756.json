      "content": "Pick up a bottle of malt vinegar at your local supermarket. You’ll find malt vinegar on the same shelf as other popular varieties of vinegar. It’s typically a deep amber or reddish-brown color, which comes from fermenting the malted grains of barley—in other words, beer. Make sure the vinegar you buy is clearly labelled with the word “malt.” Other common types of vinegar, like white and balsamic, don’t qualify as malted, and may not offer the same nutritional perks."

      "content": "Portion out the daily recommended dose of 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL). Use a liquid measuring spoon or a small measuring cup to ensure that you’re getting just the right amount. If you’re not sure exactly how much to use, start with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) and gradually increase the quantity over time as you grow accustomed to the taste. [3] X Research source In a 2009 study designed to observe the effects of vinegar as a dietary supplement, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) was the maximum effective dosage administered to test subjects."

      "content": "Mix the vinegar with 2–3 fluid ounces (59–89 mL) of water in a small glass. Not only will cutting the vinegar with water improve the flavor of the drink (or at least keep it from being quite as objectionable), it will also reduce its overall acidity. This is an important consideration if health is your primary concern. [5] X Research source For a more pleasant drinking experience, you can also add a squirt of honey, which will offset the acidity of the vinegar a bit. Like other varieties of vinegar, malt vinegar contains a high concentration of acetic acid, which can cause esophageal irritation, deterioration of tooth enamel, and other harmful effects if consumed by itself.

You may be surprised by how easily it goes down, especially knowing all of the good things it could be doing for your body. You may even find yourself looking forward to your next shot! [7] X Research source You may want to toss your beverage down quickly if you’re not a fan of the way vinegar tastes."

      "content": "Add a little malt vinegar to a drink that’s already lightly sweetened. Things like bottled tea, fruit juice, and lemonade can make good vehicles for vinegar because of their high sugar content. Fill a glass with your beverage of choice, then stir in 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) and throw it down the hatch. [8] X Research source Using iced coffee or cola as the base for your concoction could also make it more palatable."

      "content": "Blend some vinegar into a nutritious smoothie. Start by tossing a few fruits, vegetables, and other healthy offerings into the blender. Then, measure out your vinegar and sprinkle it over the rest of your ingredients before blending it all to a smooth consistency. When it’s all said and done, the vinegar will be so well-incorporated that you probably won’t even be able to tell that it’s there. Bottoms up! [9] X Research source Bananas, apples, peaches, mango, pineapple, broccoli, kale, spinach, and carrots are all delicious and nutritious options, but you can pretty much go wild here. It’s your smoothie, so feel free to customize it however you please! [10] X Research source Keep the big picture in mind while selecting your add-ins. Fruits that are high in sugar are safe choices, as are most vegetables. However, things like berries and citrus may prove to be a bit much when combined with the bright acidic notes of the vinegar."

      "content": "Mix up a vinegar-based cocktail. Just bring your ingredients together in a large glass or shaker and dump in the vinegar right before you start mixing. Most drink recipes call for somewhere between 1 ⁄ 4 fluid ounce (7.4 mL) and 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounce (15 mL) of vinegar, but you can use more or less to suit your tastes, if you like. [11] X Research source Garnish your completed cocktail with one or more sweet items to offset the acidic tang. Some good possible choices include a rim of sugar, some fresh fruit slices, a couple mouth-puckering cherries, or a sprig of mint. There are a number of mixed drinks that rely on vinegar to impart a sharp, zesty undertone. The most well-known examples are shrubs and gimlets, but various vinegars are also catching on as that all-important acidic component in traditional cocktails like Manhattans and Bloody Marys.

      "content": "Brew a comforting cup of vinegar “tea.” Bring a kettle of water to a low boil on the stovetop. While your water is heating up, grab your favorite mug and add 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of malt vinegar, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey and a pinch of cinnamon. Once your water is ready, pour in 10–12 fluid ounces (300–350 mL), stir the mixture well, and let it cool to a safe temperature before enjoying. [13] X Research source Go as heavy on the honey as you need to mask the taste of the vinegar. This type of drink can also make a nice hot toddy when you’re feeling under the weather."
