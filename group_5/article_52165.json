      "content": "Turn off your mower and give it time to cool down. If you've used it recently, the inside of your lawn mower could be extremely hot to the touch. To avoid risking a burn, turn your lawn mower off and wait until it's cooled before getting started.

      "content": "Remove the spark plug cable. Grip the (usually black) plug and pull directly away from the engine. This may require a bit of force but make sure to not pull on the actual cable, just the plug, as you could damage it. This is an extremely important safety step, as with this plug attached the engine is 'live' and could start suddenly with any movement of the blades of the engine or work on the rest of the mower. Even though you won't be working directly on the blades or parts that could cause the engine to start, it's still best practice to remove the cable."

      "content": "Clamp the fuel line with a vice clamp or turn the shut-off valve. Typically, the fuel line will be a black, rubber cord running from under your gas tank into your carburetor. Gas runs from the fuel line into the carburetor, so to keep from making a huge mess—stop the flow of glass. If your fuel line has a shut-off value, simply turn it. Or, use a vice grip to clamp the fuel line. [3] X Research source Note that there will already be a little gas in the fuel line, so you’ll need to catch some gas drips. Lay out a rag or a bowl that you don’t mind getting dirty under the line."

Unscrew this and clean the bolt thoroughly with carburetor cleaner and a brush, removing all gunk and debris. It’s also extremely important to use a paper clip to clean out the hole found halfway down the side of the bolt. If grass of dirt gets stuck here, it could cause the entire carburetor to stop working. [7] X Research source"
