If you live in a city or community that doesn't have plenty of road access, you may not see Sunday as a delivery option. Regardless of Amazon Prime status, all customers are able to get Sunday delivery in eligible locations. If your location is eligible for Sunday deliveries, you should expect to see your package between 9 A.M. and 8 P.M."
