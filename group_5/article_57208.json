      "content": "Relationships are work, but that doesn’t mean the work won’t be fun. There are two things you need to recognize before you start trying to reinvigorate your relationship. First, relationships require effort. Think of this as a job; you need to check in, pay attention, and be active when it comes to maintaining your relationship. Second, you should look forward to the work! In a healthy relationship, you get more out of it than you put into it. Amp yourself up and get excited to start mixing things up! [1] X Research source It’s easy to think that a healthy relationship is a breeze since that’s what every romantic comedy, commercial, and love song tells us! The reality is that a relationship is a lot like a car; it requires regular maintenance and you need to work on it every now and then to make sure the drive stays smooth. Boredom in your relationship may be a serious concern if you and/or your partner are becoming apathetic, you’re fighting more often (or more intensely) than you normally do, or the two of you are drifting apart emotionally and/or physically. If this is the case, it may be worth exploring couples therapy."

      "content": "Bring this up during a quiet moment and just ask them where they’re at. There’s no way to diagnose the problem if you don’t know what’s wrong! This doesn’t need to be a big, deep thing. Just check in to see where the both of you stand. [2] X Research source You might say, “Hey, are you doing alright? Do you feel like we’ve kind of been a rut lately?” or, “Do you feel like we’ve fallen into too much of a routine? I won’t take it the wrong way if you say yes.” Try to be open and just listen to their response. If they say they aren’t bored but you definitely are, open up about it. Tell them you’d like to mix things up, and see how they respond. So long as you don’t blame them for how you’re feeling, they should respond positively. If they say they’re not bored and you aren’t either, no problem! You checked in and now you know you’re both happy. If your partner admits they’re bored and you’re bored too, talk about it! Discuss a strategy and set a goal to tackle the problem together. You’ll both feel much better by the time you’re done talking!"

      "content": "Go against the grain and stop being so serious. Engage with your partner in fresh and unexpected ways. If your partner laughs at a bad Christmas sweater you own, secretly wear it on your next date. Pretend to have amnesia in the grocery store, or give the barista at the coffee shop a goofy fake name. Couples that laugh together stay together, and sharing regular jokes is a great way to break any monotony. [3] X Research source Some couples absolutely loathe going to the grocery store. Some couples turn it into an exciting activity where they discuss all the fancy meals they’re going to make while joking around. Even if the things you’re doing together aren’t necessarily intrinsically fun, that doesn’t mean you can’t turn them into something more interesting!"

If you’re always saying, “How was your day?” whenever your partner comes home from work, try to break the habit with “What was the best part about your day?” These little curveballs tend to bring a lot more spark into your daily interactions. [4] X Research source If you get a lot of stock answers to basic questions, probe them to really answer! If you ask them what they want to eat for dinner and they just say, “Whatever you want,” you might say, “No, really! Today is international you choose dinner day; what is your heart’s desire?” Affirm your partner randomly. Throw out a random “I love you” and compliment their clothing choices before they head out for work. These daily affirmations will really cultivate a more positive feeling for your partner, which will encourage more positive interactions. Be totally, unabashedly honest. If they ask you a question, tell them the truth. Don’t hide negative feelings or keep quiet if you’re feeling phenomenal. The more open you are, the more open your partner will be."

If conflict arises, make a good faith effort to deescalate the situation. [19] X Research source Treat conflicts as “us vs. the problem” and not “me vs. you,” and if you make a mistake, apologize. [20] X Research source Conflict is natural in a relationship, so don’t look at this as a sign that something is necessarily wrong. However, you do want to keep unnecessary arguments to a minimum. Do your best to meet your partner halfway whenever you can."
