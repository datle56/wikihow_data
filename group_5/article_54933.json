      "content": "Rinse the fabric under cold water to remove the bleach. In order to avoid mixing the bleach with the clear alcohol, thoroughly rinse the item with cold water until the smell of bleach dissipates. Since the clear alcohol seeps into the fabric dye and spreads it, any bleach left in the fabric might spread with the dye. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak a cotton ball in clear alcohol like gin or vodka.",
      "content": "Soak a cotton ball in clear alcohol like gin or vodka. Clear alcohol works best on small bleach spots or on dark fabrics. This is because the alcohol dilutes the dye in the fabrics and redistributes it to the whitened area. [2] X Research source Clear alcohol is not an effective treatment for large bleach stains or for lighter fabrics as there is not enough dye for the clear alcohol to redistribute. Try an alternative method to treat the stain if this applies to you. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the fabric air dry, and then wash it to remove excess alcohol. You want to give the dyes in the fabric a chance to settle before you wash away the clear alcohol. As soon as the fabric is dry, wash it as you normally would to avoid any additional discoloring that can occur from the residue of the clear alcohol. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase some sodium thiosulfate at your local department store. Sodium thiosulfate, also known as photograph fixer, can be used to neutralize the effects of bleach stains on fabric. It can be purchased at local department and pet stores, or it can be purchased through big-box stores and online retailers. [6] X Research source Find products that are advertised as chlorine neutralizers. Those will contain the sodium thiosulfate needed to treat the bleach stain on the fabric. [7] X Research source This works well as an immediate treatment. If the stain has been sitting for a while, the diluted solution might not remove the stain entirely, but instead make it considerably less noticeable. [8] X Research source"

If you rub the fabric with the diluted solution you could potentially damage the fabric. [11] X Research source Rinse the fabric in cold water if the stain is still visible.

[14] X Research source For carpet, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dishwasher detergent with 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water. [15] X Research source Warm water is typically preferred over cold water to treat or clean carpets as it is more effective in lifting dirt and liquid residues from the carpet fibers. Most professional carpet cleaners only use warm water to clean carpets. [16] X Research source"

[25] X Research source Warm water will pull up more of the bleach stain from the carpet fibers, along with any of the dirt and grime the bleach might have adhered to. This is why warm water is typically used to steam clean carpets. [26] X Research source"
