Think of how it feels to be consumed by your element (e.g. water, underwater, fire, on a hot summer's day, earth, buried underground, and air, in the centre of a windstorm). Imagine it taking care of you, making sure you can breathe underwater, that you don't get too hot, so you don't get crushed by the earth, or that you don't get whipped away by the wind. Think of the things related to that element, the feelings that element evokes within you, the positive helpful side of the element, and the strong destructive force it has within it (e.g. water's cool refreshment and the power of a tsunami, fire's warmth and usefulness in cooking and the power of a raging inferno, the soft gentle breeze and the raging tornado, earth's power to nourish growing things and the power of an earthquake)"
