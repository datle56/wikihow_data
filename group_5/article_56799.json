      "title": "Decide what fruit you’d like to use to make wine.",
      "content": "Decide what fruit you’d like to use to make wine. You can use grapes, strawberries, cherries, or even apples (cider) with this process. You will need between 12 and 18 pounds (5.4 and 8.2 kg) of ripe fruit. Most people suggest that you go the extra step to find organic and/or locally produced fruit. Insecticides and fertilizers can impart an unpleasant taste to homemade alcohol. If you don’t have fresh fruit, purchase some 100% fruit juice. It should have a sugar content of 20% percent or more. Buy 1 gallon (3.8 L) of juice."

      "content": "Visit a homebrew store to purchase wine yeast. You will also need 2 glass 1 US gal (3.8 L) containers, a hydrometer, equipment sanitizer, corks, a corker, a sanitized food pail, airlocks, and tubing. If you want to make apple cider, inquire about renting a cider press. Some presses are available for rent and are necessary for getting the fresh apple juice out of the apples. Purchase champagne yeast if you are going to make cider or wine from fruit juice."

      "title": "Wash everything thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash everything thoroughly. Fill your sink with professional sanitizer and wash all the equipment according to the package directions just before you use it. Consider buying a special produce wash to ensure the fruit is very clean before it is used."

      "title": "Remove any rotten fruit.",
      "content": "Remove any rotten fruit. Examine your fruit carefully. Remove any pieces of fruit that are mushy, moldy, or obviously spoiled. Pick off any stems. Leaving them in the mix will create bitter wine."

      "title": "Set up a fruit press.",
      "content": "Set up a fruit press. If you don’t have access to one, you can hand crush your grapes or other soft fruit. Try using a sanitized metal ricer or masher to press the juice out of the pulp. [1] X Research source Press the fruit into a 2–4 US gal (7.6–15.1 L) food grade pail. This is where your initial fermentation will take place. The act of pressing the fruit releases juice, referred to as “must” in winemaking."

      "content": "Add a packet of wine yeast that is dissolved in water. Mix the yeast and juice well. If you are using fruit juice, you can pour out some juice and add the packet of yeast straight into the 1 US gal (3.8 L) fruit juice bottle."

    {
      "title": "Insert your hydrometer into the mixture.",
      "content": "Insert your hydrometer into the mixture. You will need a reading of 1.010 (22 degrees Brix) or higher to make the wine. If it is lower than that, make sugar syrup and mix it in until the hydrometer registers an adequate amount of sugar content. Make the syrup by dissolving granulated sugar in distilled water on the stove. Let it cool slightly, then add it in increments of 1 tablespoon (15 mL) until your reading is high enough. If you are using juice with high sugar content, you will not need to use a hydrometer or add extra sugar. If your sugar content is too high, you can dilute it with distilled water."

      "title": "Cover the pail with cheesecloth and let it sit for about a week.",
      "content": "Cover the pail with cheesecloth and let it sit for about a week. This will allow the CO2 to leave during the fermentation process. Leave it for 7 to 10 days in a dark place. You’ll also need to control the temperature of the space, but the required temperature depends on the type of wine you’re making. Your mixture will need a temperature of approximately 70 to 75 °F (21 to 24 °C) to ferment. If your initial fermentation mixture is too cool, wrap an electric blanket around the pail to heat it up gently. To cool the temperature of the mixture, wrap ice packs around the pail for a little while. White wines require approximately 55 to 65 °F (13 to 18 °C)."

      "content": "Insert an airlock at the top of the container. Let the jug sit for 2 weeks. Then, siphon the wine every few weeks to remove further sediment. Siphoning, or “racking,” wine requires you to place an empty bottle lower than the current fermentation bottle. Use plastic tubing to create a siphon and allow it to pour into the clean bottle. Make sure the tubing sits above the sediment, so that you are purifying your wine. [2] X Research source If you are making wine from store-bought juice, you will pour in the yeast and insert the airlock. Wait 3 days to 2 weeks to produce alcohol you can bottle."

Store the wine bottles upright for 3 days. Then, store them on their side. At 55 °F (13 °C), red wine can be stored for up to 1 year and white wine can be stored for up to 6 months.

The following are good guidelines, made safe through practice: “The fore shots” are the alcohol that comes out first. They are high in acetone and methyl alcohol (a toxic type of alcohol otherwise known as methanol) and are considered poisonous. They have a bad smell and you should discard them and the glass they are in. Combined with the heads, they are usually the first 50-100 mL of spirit to come out of the still. “The heads” is a mix of unusable alcohol. It can be saved to distill 2 or 3 times to make it usable. “The hearts” are the next glass. They are composed of ethanol. Aim to collect it at 1 drop every 1 to 2 seconds. Remove it in shot glass quantities to use. The hearts should smell pure. “The tails” are the ethanol diluted with water. They smell less pure and pleasant. You can save them to distill like you did the heads. [6] X Research source"
