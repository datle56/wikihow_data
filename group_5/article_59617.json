      "content": "Sag-Capricorn cusps can be uncompromising and isolated at times. They have lots of energy and passion but prefer to focus it fully on their work and ambitions, which doesn’t leave much time for fun and personal relationships. Although they’re very loyal, they can’t always devote as much energy as they should to friendships and romances. This cusp can be: Intense. While intensity isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it can definitely be intimidating (and isolating) when Sagittarius-Capricorn cusps start to laser-focus on work, giving everything they have to find success. Stubborn. Sagittarius-Capricorn cusps can be uncompromising, especially when it comes to their worldview. They may even come off as combative if they feel their opinions are being challenged. Indecisive. Normally, Capricorns are rigid and very decisive, but as a mutable sign, Sagittarius is much more flexible and open-minded (which also means Sag-Capricorn cusps may struggle to make decisions at times)."
