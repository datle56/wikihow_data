To get your new coefficient, simply multiply the whole numbers together. [2] X Research source For example: Let’s say our problem is ( 2 × 10 4 ) × ( 6 × 10 7 ) {\\displaystyle (2\\times 10^{4})\\times (6\\times 10^{7})} Our first step would be to multiply the coefficients: 2 × 6 = 12 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 6=12}"

      "content": "Use the rule of exponents to multiply the powers of 10. The rule of exponents tells us that when we multiply powers of 10, all we need to do is add the exponents together. This will give us our base. [3] X Research source To continue our example from above, multiplying the bases would look like this: 10 4 × 10 7 {\\displaystyle 10^{4}\\times 10^{7}} Using the rule of exponents, we would convert the problem to 10 4 + 10 7 = 10 11 {\\displaystyle 10^{4}+10^{7}=10^{11}} , because 4 + 7 = 11 {\\displaystyle 4+7=11}"

Simply multiply your whole number by the new power of 10 to get the answer. [4] X Research source In our example above, our answer would be 12 × 10 11 {\\displaystyle 12\\times 10^{11}}"

      "title": "If your coefficient is not in scientific notation, convert it to scientific notation.",
      "content": "If your coefficient is not in scientific notation, convert it to scientific notation . To do that, move the decimal point to the left, then count how many times it’s moved. After that, multiply your new base by the base you solved for to get your answer. [5] X Research source For example: ( 2.3 × 10 4 ) × ( 6.6 × 10 7 ) {\\displaystyle (2.3\\times 10^{4})\\times (6.6\\times 10^{7})} ( 2.3 × 6.6 = 16.38 ) × ( 10 4 × 10 7 ) {\\displaystyle (2.3\\times 6.6=16.38)\\times (10^{4}\\times 10^{7})} 16.38 × 10 11 {\\displaystyle 16.38\\times 10^{11}} Since your coefficient is not in scientific notation (because it’s greater than 10), move the decimal point to the left and convert the problem to scientific notation: 1.638 × 10 1 {\\displaystyle 1.638\\times 10^{1}} Now, multiply that base by the base we solved for earlier: 10 1 × 10 11 {\\displaystyle 10^{1}\\times 10^{11}} The answer is 1.638 × 10 12 {\\displaystyle 1.638\\times 10^{12}}"
