Follow these steps to restart Chrome: Close Chrome by clicking the \"X\" in the top right-hand corner. Use Task Manager or Activity Monitor to make sure Chrome isn't running.

To clear the cache in Chrome, follow these steps: Press Cmd + Shift + Return (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + Delete (Windows) to open the \"Delete browsing data\" window. Check all the boxes and select a time range. The default selection of \"Last 4 weeks\" is usually good enough, but select \"All time\" if you haven't deleted all this data in a long time. Click Delete Data . Close Chrome and restart it."

Maybe an extension you're using is causing the error, so following these troubleshooting steps to disable them will help you figure out if an extension or something else is the culprit. Click the jigsaw puzzle piece icon in your toolbar or click the three-dot menu icon and go to \"Extensions\". Click Manage Extensions from either menu. Toggle off any extensions that are on. The switch will be grey and pointing to the left if it's off. You want all your extensions off for this step. Restart Chrome and see if the error message still appears on that page. If you don't get the error message anymore, you know that an extension was the trigger for the caching error. To figure out which extension is guilty of causing the error, turn one back on in the \"Manage Extensions\" menu, then restart Chrome. When you see the error message again, you know that the last extension that you turned on is the causing the caching error. Update or remove that extension from your browser."
