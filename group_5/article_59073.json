      "title": "Soak a microfiber cloth in rubbing alcohol to rub the adhesive off.",
      "content": "Soak a microfiber cloth in rubbing alcohol to rub the adhesive off. Use a soft, clean cloth to avoid damaging the surface you're treating. Dampen the cloth with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and gently rub it back and forth over the affected area. Always test an indiscriminate area before proceeding. [1] X Research source Best for: Non-porous surfaces, like stone, leather, chrome, and carpet. Alternatively, use acetone or non-acetone nail polish remover . However, acetone may strip the paint off of metal surfaces. As a substitute for rubbing alcohol, use hard, clear liquor like vodka. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrub duct tape residue with dish soap and warm water.",
      "content": "Scrub duct tape residue with dish soap and warm water. Place 1 US tbsp (3.0 tsp) of liquid dish detergent in 2 c (16 fl oz) of warm water. Stir until the mixture is bubbly. Then, dip a soft cloth into the soapy water to gently scrub the sticky residue. Keep rubbing the area until it no longer feels slippery or sticky. [3] X Research source Best for: Any surface. If you're removing residue from a light-colored fabric surface, opt for dye-free dish soap to avoid staining the fabric."

      "title": "Use a 1:1 ratio of detergent and washing soda.",
      "content": "Use a 1:1 ratio of detergent and washing soda. Combine equal parts of laundry detergent and washing soda into a bowl. Add small amounts of water, adding more as needed, to form a paste. Apply with a soft-bristle toothbrush or cloth. Let it soak for 10 minutes before using a damp cloth to remove it. [4] X Research source Best for: Stone, fabric, metal, vinyl, and more. Use warm water and a clean cloth to wipe the surface afterward. Washing soda is also known as soda ash or sodium carbonate. It is a natural cleaner and water softener that converts fats and grease into water-soluble salts. [5] X Research source Make washing soda at home by putting a tray of baking soda in the oven at 400°F (204°C) for 15 minutes."

      "title": "Cover the residue with cooking oil and wipe the surface after 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the residue with cooking oil and wipe the surface after 5 minutes. Use any cooking oil you have on hand—vegetable, canola, olive oil, it doesn't matter! Once it soaks in, rub or scrape the residue with a soft-bristle brush, dull knife, or a gloved finger. Wipe any excess oil off with an all-purpose cleaner. [6] X Research source Best for: Non-porous surfaces like glass, plastic, or metal. Applying oil to absorbent materials such as carpets or clothing may cause stains."

Lay the paper towel over the residue, then lift it after a few minutes. Rub or scrape the loosened residue. [7] X Research source Best for: Glass, tile, chrome, and fabric. Avoid using vinegar on stone, steel, and iron surfaces."

      "content": "Mix equal parts baking soda and oil to make a paste. If duct tape has left a stubborn mess on your surface, you may need something with a little more grit. Make a paste of equal parts baking soda and cooking oil or water. Let the paste sit for 5 or more minutes before wiping it away. [8] X Research source Best for: Fabric, metal, marble, silver, and plastic. Baking soda is ideal for kitchen surfaces since it's non-toxic. Avoid using baking soda on aluminum, gold-plated, marble, or antique silver pieces or surfaces since it's abrasive. It may scratch or oxidize certain surfaces. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray WD-40 to treat metal surfaces. Spray the solution directly onto areas with a lot of residue or dampen a terry cloth to treat smaller patches of residue. Leave it on for a minute—longer if the residue is really stubborn—then scrub it off with soap and water to remove the oils. [10] X Research source WD-40 is perfect for car surfaces, too. Some users say it can help remove minor scratches on a car's paint job. Read the warnings on the canister to avoid using it on surfaces that may stain. [11] X Research source Best for: Metal and painted surfaces. As a substitute to WD-40, use Vaseline or car wax ."

      "content": "Scrub sticky residue with lighter fluid for non-porous surfaces. Apply a small amount of lighter fluid to a paper towel. Lightly scrub the adhesive until it lifts. If there's a blurry residue left, take an alcohol wipe (or rubbing alcohol) to clean the surface. [12] X Research source Best for: Stainless steel, plastic, and most surfaces. Lighter fluid may affect some paint surfaces or certain plastics. Perform a test patch on beforehand."
