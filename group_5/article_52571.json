      "content": "Liquid eggs are blended whole eggs that usually have citric acid added. The citric acid doesn't change the flavor—it just prevents the eggs from discoloring when you cook them. Liquid eggs have the same nutrients as whole eggs. For example, a 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) serving of liquid eggs has the same amount of protein (6 g) as a whole egg. [1] X Research source You might find that the texture of liquid eggs is a little thicker, but this shouldn't change the flavor or way you cook them."

      "title": "Yes, you can use liquid egg whites in place of whole eggs.",
      "content": "Yes, you can use liquid egg whites in place of whole eggs. It's totally fine to make scrambled egg whites or omelettes with liquid egg whites. They just won't have the same micronutrients as liquid whole eggs. Specifically, liquid egg whites won't have as much vitamin D, choline, and iodine, but they're lower in cholesterol and saturated fat. [2] X Research source Liquid egg whites can taste a little bland, so plan on seasoning them well with spices, fresh herbs, or flavorful ingredients like lean sausage or sautéed mushrooms. Liquid egg whites and liquid whole eggs have the same amount of protein, so either of these are great if you're mainly eating eggs to stay full throughout the day."

      "content": "You can make anything that you usually use eggs for! Liquid eggs are great for omelettes—just pour as much as you like into a preheated skillet. Keep in mind that 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of liquid eggs equals 1 whole egg. Add any fillings you want, like sliced mushrooms, cheese, or spinach, and flip the omelette once it's set.

Then, gently stir the eggs so they break into clumps while they cook. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on top just before you serve them."

To make 8 big pieces of french toast, pour 1 1⁄2 cups (350 ml) of liquid eggs into a shallow dish and whisk in 1⁄2 cup (120 ml) of milk. If you want to flavor this base, whisk in 3/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of cinnamon. Then, dip both sides of your bread into the custard and cook them on a griddle or in a skillet. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes—it's really easy to customize and bake a pan of eggs for meals throughout the week. Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C) and grease a rimmed baking sheet with butter or cooking spray. Scatter cooked meat or diced veggies across the sheet if you want to add nutrients and flavor to your eggs. Then, whisk 2 teaspoons (10 g) of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of pepper into 4 cups (0.95 L) of liquid eggs before you pour it into the pan. Bake your eggs for 15 minutes or until they're set in the center. [5] X Research source Cooked or smoked meat like bacon, ham, and sausage pack a ton of flavor. For vegetable options, try adding diced bell peppers, green onions, or roasted tomatoes. You can also scatter your favorite shredded or crumbled cheese on top of the eggs before you bake them. Slice your baked eggs or stir them to make scrambled eggs. You can refrigerate the leftovers in an airtight container or cover the pan with plastic wrap before you chill it. Eat the eggs within 3 days."

      "content": "Stir in your favorite spices to boost the flavor. Liquid eggs can be a little boring on their own, especially since they don't have salt or pepper added. Whisk spices like cumin, paprika, seasoned salt, or taco seasoning into the liquid eggs and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes to absorb the flavor before you cook them. [6] X Research source Want creamier eggs? Whisk 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of milk or cream into the eggs along with the salt and pepper."

Fresh red salsa, salsa verde, tomatillo sauce, and spicy adobo sauce are also fantastic in liquid eggs. [7] X Research source You don't need to let the eggs absorb the liquid seasonings—just stir them in and you're ready to cook!"

      "content": "Keep liquid eggs in the fridge and use the opened package within 3 days. Most liquid eggs come in resealable cartons, so just close them and stick them in the fridge in between uses. You may want to label the package with the date that you opened it so you know when to use the eggs by. Plan on using them within 3 days of opening the package. [8] X Research source You can keep unopened, thawed packages of liquid eggs in the fridge for up to 1 week."
