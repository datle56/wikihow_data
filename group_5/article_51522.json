Just calmly tell her you don’t wish to hear about any alternatives, and you would simply like to cancel your Weight Watchers membership. Dealing with people on the phone can be frustrating. But it’s best to remember that in most cases this person is doing her job and probably following a script. Being rude will only make the process more difficult, so it’s best to calmly and firmly state what you want. You’ll also be asked for account and billing information so it’s best to have all of that on hand so you can complete the process as quickly as possible. Make sure that you receive a cancellation number before you hang up."

Your leader may be able to either help change your experience, or provide you with tools and advice to stay on track losing or maintaining weight outside of regular meetings. If you find that the program is working for you, but not on your schedule or within your budget, you may not need to cancel completely. Talk to your meeting leader about the OnlinePlus plan, or Personal Coaching as they may cost less. If you want to cancel because you are not succeeding with your weight loss, your leader can try to pinpoint the problem. However, if you know that you want to cancel your Weight Watchers membership, stay firm with your meeting leader and calmly tell her you don’t wish for any other options, you just want to cancel. Note that if you are a Monthly Pass or eTools subscriber, you won’t be able to cancel in person through your leader or meeting staff, and will have to cancel your membership online, via email, or postal mail."
