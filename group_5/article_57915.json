      "title": "Run a wet and dry vacuum cleaner over the affected spot.",
      "content": "Run a wet and dry vacuum cleaner over the affected spot. Using the vacuum, suction all of the urine from the carpet or flooring. Doing this will help to prevent the urine from getting absorbed into the carpet or flooring’s deeper layers. Urine that has been absorbed into the deeper layer will create an odor that will be very hard to get rid of. [1] X Research source If you do not have a vacuum cleaner, lay several sheets of newspaper or paper towels down on the spot. This is best to do right after the dog has urinated. Remove the soaked paper and replace with new sheets until it seems like the paper is not soaking up anymore urine. This will help to keep the urine from sinking deep down into the carpet."

      "content": "Use a UV light to detect any dried urine spots. If you were unable to soak up the urine right when it happened, and you’re not sure where the smell is coming from, you can use a cheap UV blacklight to find the spots where your dog has urinated. Once you’ve found the spots, mark them by placing an object next to them so you don’t lose them again. Cheap UV lights can generally be bought at your local home goods or hardware store."

      "content": "Create a vinegar-water solution. The solution should be 50% vinegar and 50% water. For instance, if you use two cups of water, you should mix it with two cups of vinegar. The amount of liquid you use will depend on how large the spot where your dog urinated is. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a generous amount of solution to the urine spot. You will want to use a generous amount to make sure that the solution absorbs into the deeper layers of the carpet, eradicating the urine odor along the way. The solution will help to soften and neutralize the hardened, deeper layers of the urine spot."

      "title": "Scrub the spot gently.",
      "content": "Scrub the spot gently. Use a new sponge or washcloth to scrub in the vinegar mixture. Doing this will help to remove the hardened layers of urine in both the superficial fibers of the carpet (the surface of the carpet), as well as the deeper layers of the carpet or flooring."

      "content": "Run your vacuum over the urine spot again. Once you have scrubbed in the vinegar, run your vacuum over the spot again to pull up the vinegar mixture and the urine that is has broken up and neutralized. Again, if you don’t have a vacuum, use paper towels or newspaper to soak up the vinegar and broken up urine."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over the urine spot. Once you have dried the area, pour baking soda over the entire affected area. Make sure that the baking soda covers all of the affected carpet or flooring. The baking soda will help to ensure that the urine gets neutralized."

After you’ve soaked up as much urine as you can, spray the cleaning mixture on to the affected area. Let it soak into the urine spot for several minutes. If the urine spot is old, spray the affected area and then let the solution soak into the spot for 30 or more minutes. The longer you let the solution sit, the more effective it will be in breaking up and dissolving the urine that has dried in the carpet."

This will ensure that you remove all of the dissolved urine that the mixture broke up. Once you have gotten the spot relatively dry, spray the solution on the spot again. This time, let it dry.

      "content": "Make sure you use the right amount of neutralizer. When using either enzyme or oxidizing products, it is important to use more product than the amount of urine that your dog expelled. A medium-sized dog can usually pass half a cup of urine, so in that case, you would use a cup of neutralizing agent."

      "title": "Apply the neutralizer.",
      "content": "Apply the neutralizer. For this step, it is best to read the instructions on the bottle or package that the neutralizer came in. However, most neutralizers need to be applied to the spot and then let to soak for a certain amount of time. When they have soaked into the carpet, it is best to vacuum the spot or soak the liquid up with paper towels, newspaper, or old fabric towels. When washing urine off of concrete, use three times the amount of neutralizer. For instance, if your dog passed roughly one-fourth a cup of urine, you would use three-fourths cup of neutralizer. When treating carpets that have been heavily soiled with urine on multiple occasions, it is best to lift the carpet up and clean the floor as well. If you do not, there is a good chance that the odor will continue to linger. If you are treating a car seat, use double the amount of neutralizer to account for the fact that the foam in car seats is much more absorbent that most carpets and floorings."
