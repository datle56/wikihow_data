Get a mask that's designed for the job of filtering asbestos, not a simple paper one you might use in a shop. Send the kids and pets away, too. Especially the kidsâ€”you don't want them anywhere near this project, not even for a moment.

Spread the shoes apart from the top and disengage the shoes from the wheel cylinder pins. Remove both shoes and the self-adjuster as one unit. Lay the old shoes on the ground next to the new ones. Sometimes the front and back shoes are different. The shoe with the shorter strip of lining usually goes towards the front. Carefully tip the tops of the shoes inward to loosen the tension on the self-adjuster spring. Remove the self adjuster. Inspect and clean all brake parts to be reused and check for signs of damage or wear and replace as needed. It is recommended to replace all the springs with a new set. The adjuster should be unscrewed, cleaned and lubed with anti-seize. Remove the spring and immediately hook it onto the new shoes exactly as you removed it. Inspect the brake wheel cylinder for any signs of leakage and replace if needed."

Put the shoes back in place and slip the retaining pins through the right holes. Install the shoe retainer springs. Attach the shoes to the wheel cylinder pins. Reattach the parking brake lever.

Check brake adjustment and readjust as needed to have a slight drag on the drum. Do not over tighten the brakes or they could lock up. Remove the jack stand. Lower the jack. Torque the lug nuts and reinstall the hub cap. Repeat on other side. Bleed out the brake system if any wheel cylinders were replaced. Road test the vehicle to verify brakes work correctly."
