      "content": "It’s easy to get fired up when your family is fighting. If you feel like you might yell or explode instead of talking calmly, take a walk around the block to calm down first. No matter who you’re talking to, doing it in a calm manner will go much better than yelling or screaming. You can also try breathing deeply or counting to 10 anytime you feel yourself getting stressed."

      "content": "It will be much easier to talk to everyone at the same time. See if there’s a good time and day that works for everyone in your family to get together.

If the problem is with your extended family, consider asking them to talk over video chat or on the phone."

This can help people feel less defensive and more able to work through issues with you. [6] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “You yell at me too much,” you could say, “When you yell at me, I feel afraid.” Or, instead of saying, “You never listen to me,” you could say, “When you talk over me, it makes me feel like I don’t have a say in what the family does.”"
