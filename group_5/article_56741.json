      "content": "“Love is an action word” means expressing love through your actions. Along with saying “I love you,” using your actions and gestures to show your love helps you to express these deep feelings of affection in a different way. Not only can you convey this love through your words, but you can also physically show your loved ones how much you adore them through things like acts of service, physical touch, and spending quality time together. [1] X Research source Some might say that love is a decision that we make through our actions. Deciding to change to become a better person, to work on communicating, or to listen better are all actions that a person can take to show they love someone. Love has different meanings for each individual person. The best way to find out what makes a person feel loved is to ask them about it directly, such as “What can I do to make you feel loved?”"

      "content": "The Bible has many verses that promote love as an action. This is perfectly captured in lines such as John 3:16, which says “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” It wasn’t through words that God showed his love for the world, but rather through His actions and sacrifices. Some other verses that emphasize this idea include: [2] X Research source “Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.”—1 John 3:18 “Let all that you do be done in love.”—1 Corinthians 16:14 “Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.”—1 Corinthians 13:4-8 This is a popular passage to read during Christian weddings."

      "content": "Prioritize the things they like to do. Being selfless is a very significant gesture when it comes to showing someone how much you love them. Forgoing your own wants so that your partner, friend, or family member can be happy shows that spending quality time together is more important to you than the actual activity. Some examples include: [3] X Research source Watching their favorite movie even if it’s no longer that interesting to you Eating to a restaurant that serves food they absolutely love but you’re not really a fan of Going on a shopping spree with them even when you don’t really like shopping Treat every day like a new opportunity to remind the other person how much you love them. Even as time passes, continue to treat this love just like you did at the very beginning of your relationship. Prioritizing the other person doesn’t mean you should neglect your own wants and needs. Work together to find a good balance."

      "content": "Find different words to convey how much you love someone. Saying “I love you” isn’t the only way to express your adoration and affection for another person. When you say you love someone, you’re saying that you believe in them, you trust them, and you value them for who they are. Offering them encouragement and compliments is another way to show that you love them. Some things you might say include: [4] X Research source “I trust you completely.” “You are one of the best things to have ever happened to me.” “You’ve worked so hard and deserve only the best.” “Thank you for always being there for me. I appreciate you so much.”"

Doing things like running errands for your partner or doing chores around the house for your parents are all ways to tell someone you love them without actually saying the words. Showing your gratitude through these acts of service is one way to express your love. Other acts of service include: [5] X Research source Making a meal for your partner who usually does the cooking Helping your siblings with their homework Volunteering out in your community Offering to listen to a friend and give them advice during a hard time Doing manual labor for an elderly neighbor or relative"

      "content": "Give someone a gift to remind them how much they mean to you. When you give a gift to someone you love, it doesn’t have to be anything grandiose or expensive. In fact, sometimes the smallest gifts have the biggest meaning. Picking your partner up their favorite snack after a long day of work or giving your friend a photo album of all your memories are examples of gifts that are simple, yet incredibly meaningful. Some people feel most loved when they receive a gift that shows someone truly cares about them. Here are some other gift ideas: [6] X Research source Takeout from their favorite restaurant A bouquet of flowers A personalized playlist or CD with all their favorite songs A framed photo of you and them together Tickets to a local museum, art exhibition, zoo, or aquarium"

Quality time looks different for every person, but the important thing is that you and the person you love are together, and you’re only focussing on each other. Some things that might qualify as quality time to you include: [7] X Research source Making dinner together and spending the night watching a movie Running errands together Taking a walk and getting out in nature Going to your favorite restaurant or cafe Playing a game together"

      "title": "Use physical touch to show them affection and love.",
      "content": "Use physical touch to show them affection and love. Sometimes holding someone’s hand, cuddling with them, or giving them a hug or kiss conveys more than words ever could. If physical touch is something you and the other person are comfortable with and comforted by, use it more often to convey your feelings of love for them. Here are some examples: [8] X Research source Give them a nice massage after a long day. Cuddle up together on the couch to watch a movie on a Friday night. Hold hands when you’re out and about. Love is different from sexual desire. Sexual desire is driven by a person’s biology while love is a deep-rooted emotion as well as a choice. While being sexually intimate with your partner can certainly strengthen your relationship, sex shouldn’t be mistaken for love. [9] X Research source"

Being proactive and making an effort to be the best possible version of yourself in your relationship will show the other person just how committed to them you are. [10] X Research source If you’re in a romantic relationship, sit down with your partner and have a conversation about what you both can do to keep your relationship strong and healthy. Work on improving your communication skills in your relationship to make sure you and the other person are always on the same page. Taking care of yourself shows the other person that you love them and want to be your best self around them."

Opening yourself up to another person’s love can help you relax within your relationship. Also, seeing how another person chooses to express their love might inspire you and help you figure out how you can do the same. [11] X Research source"
