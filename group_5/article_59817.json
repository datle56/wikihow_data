      "content": "Conduct research on publishing houses and categories they specialize in. As you do your research, make sure you highlight the publishers that specialize in the genre you are writing in. A mystery publisher would not accept a submission or proposal for a science fiction or young adult fantasy manuscript. [1] X Research source Talk to booksellers in your community. They will give you good advice on which publishers you should target as you prepare to submit your book idea. Take a notepad and pen to the bookstores in your community. Do targeted research in the category under which your book falls. You should look for which publishers are the most dominant. Look through individual books for a numbering sequence -- this tells you how many printings the book has had -- the more printings, the more successful the book is. Find this sequence on the copyright page and make a note of these books on your notepad. Visit your library. Talk to the reference librarian and ask for his or her advice and write it down."
