      "content": "Cut the butter into small pieces. First, determine the amount of butter you need for your recipe (1 stick, a half stick, etc). Once you’ve set apart the desired amount of butter, use a knife to cut it into small chunks. This helps it melt more quickly and evenly. Here are some butter measurement conversions you might need: 2 sticks of butter = 1 cup = 16 Tbsp 1 stick of butter = ½ cup = 8 Tbsp ⅔ stick of butter = ⅓ cup = 5 Tbsp + 1 Tsp ½ stick of butter = ¼ cup = 4 Tbsp ¼ stick of butter =⅛ cup = 2 Tbsp [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave in 10-second increments until melted. Microwaves are much faster at melting butter than the stovetop, but they're also much more likely to cause burning, separation, or other problems. Start out cautiously by setting the microwave to \"low\" or \"defrost\" if possible, then microwave your butter for ten seconds at a time. Check progress between each 10-second interval. The butter will likely not be fully melted within the first few rounds, but it will melt quickly, and you don't want to overcook it. While you’re checking your butter’s progress, stir it to evenly distribute the heat. Continue in this way until the butter is fully melted. Note: remember to remove silverware from the bowl before returning it to the microwave."

Measure out the amount of butter you need, then cut this amount into small chunks to speed up the melting process. The more surface area you expose to the heat, the faster the butter will melt."

      "content": "Stir the butter regularly until it’s about 3/4 melted. At this point, turn off the burner and remove the butter from the heat. The butter and pan will still be hot, which should be enough to melt any remaining chunks. Stir until the butter is fully melted and an even consistency. This ensures that you don’t brown or burn your butter, which changes its flavor."

Next, place small pieces of butter into the heat-safe bowl. Finally, place the heat-safe boil over the pot of boiling water (the steam from the boiling water will be the heat source that melts the butter). Stir until the butter is fully melted, then remove from the heat. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the butter out on your counter for 1-2 hours. During this period of time, the butter will come to room temperature. It should have a soft, smooth consistency and be easily squashed by a spoon, but still hold its shape when left alone. [5] X Research source Many recipes call for softened butter (rather than cold butter) to ensure that it gets properly incorporated with other ingredients. This is especially common for baking recipes. [6] X Research source If you’re short on time, chop the butter into small pieces before leaving it out on the counter. These smaller chunks take less time to come to room temperature, so your softened butter will be ready faster! [7] X Research source"

Stick the butter in a sealed zip lock bag with most of the air squeezed out. Using a rolling pin, your hands, or any heavy object, roll or mash the butter repeatedly. [8] X Research source After a few minutes, the butter should feel significantly softer, without any signs of melting. If you don’t have a zip lock bag, you can also put the butter between two sheets of parchment paper or wax paper before mashing it."

      "content": "If you frequently use butter to fry food at high temperatures, or you want to extend its shelf life, consider clarifying it. Clarified butter is more resistant to smoking and burning at high temperatures than regular butter. [11] X Research source Here’s how to make it: Melt your desired amount of butter in a saucepan over low heat. Eventually, the butter should bubble and become foamy on the top. At this point, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the butter to cool for 5 minutes. Once the butter has cooled, skim the foam off the surface of the butter, and pour the clear buttery liquid into another container. It should be golden yellow in color. Leave the residue from the milk solids in the saucepan. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Browning butter involves heating it until it fully melts and starts to change color. Browned butter has a toastier, nuttier, and more caramel-y taste than regular butter. [13] X Research source Here are the steps to make it: Cut the butter into small, equal pieces and place in a skillet. Cook the butter over medium heat, swirling the pan and stirring occasionally so the butter melts evenly. Let the butter bubble gently as it cooks. If it seems like the butter is cooking too fast or boiling, lower the burner’s heat. When the butter turns a golden brown color and starts to smell nutty and toasted, it’s ready! Remove from the burner and immediately transfer the butter into a heat-safe bowl to avoid overcooking. [14] X Research source"
