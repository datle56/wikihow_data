      "title": "Meeting with someone face-to-face makes your apology more genuine.",
      "content": "Meeting with someone face-to-face makes your apology more genuine. It takes courage to say sorry in person. Being that open and honest with someone shows that you're really making an effort to communicate your remorse. Pick a quiet place away from other people and apologize in person. [1] X Research source If you're at school, try a spot on campus away from others, like in the courtyard or at an empty lunch table. When you're out of school, try a bench at a neighborhood park."

      "title": "You might not be able to meet in person.",
      "content": "You might not be able to meet in person. It's also possible that you're nervous and worried you may say the wrong thing. If that's the case, write a letter instead. If you go this route, make sure you really think about your words. You want the girl to know that you spent a lot of time thinking about your apology. Try writing out a few drafts if you're not sure what to say. [2] X Research source Avoid texting an apology if you can. This may not seem as sincere, as it doesn't take much effort to type out a text."

    {
      "title": "An apology that doesn't address your actions won't be as sincere.",
      "content": "An apology that doesn't address your actions won't be as sincere. Be specific and refer back to exactly what rude things you said or did. This shows her that you understand the mistake that you made and that you've really thought about how your behavior affected her. [3] X Research source Say something like, \"I'm so sorry for making fun of your outfit yesterday. That was so rude and inconsiderate, and I should never have said that.\" Avoid generalized apologies like, \"I'm sorry I'm such a bad person.\" This doesn't address what you did to hurt her specifically. It's much more meaningful to show her that you understand exactly what you did wrong."

    {
      "title": "Don't blame the girl or other people for what you said.",
      "content": "Don't blame the girl or other people for what you said. It's super hard to admit when you've messed up, but blaming your actions on others is like taking the easy way out. Do the right thing and hold yourself accountable. As difficult as it may be, tell her that what you did was a mistake that you alone made. [4] X Research source You could say, \"There are no excuses for what I did. I was just being flat-out rude and I couldn't be more sorry for hurting you.\" Avoid providing justifications for what you did. Don't say anything like, \"I know I hurt your feelings, but you were being really annoying.\""

      "title": "Show her that you've thought about her point of view.",
      "content": "Show her that you've thought about her point of view. Maybe you laughed at a girl for dropping all of her books in the hallway. That probably made her feel pretty insecure and embarrassed. When you're apologizing, let her know that you've considered how your actions made her feel. [5] X Research source To express empathy, say, \"I can only imagine how you must have felt when I laughed at you like that. I'm so sorry if I made you feel embarrassed.\""

      "content": "Follow your apology with meaningful actions. Before apologizing, take a moment to think about what you can do differently going forward. Maybe you want to think more before you speak or treat girls with more respect. Once you come up with positive changes you can make, include those in your apology. If your friends with this girl and want to keep spending time with her, make sure you avoid making the mistake again. Make a promise to yourself and her so that you can repair your friendship. This will help you both move forward! [6] X Research source Even if you're not good friends, you can tell the girl that you intend to treat people better in the future. You can say something like, \"I realize now that my words can hurt people. I promise I won't be so careless about your feelings next time.\""

      "content": "A good apology involves a conversation, not a monologue. When apologizing to a girl, give her a chance to respond. Pause every now and then to let her speak. If she asks you questions, try your best to answer them. She may need to express in person how hurt she was by your behavior. Avoid getting defensive, and listen. [7] X Research source It may be really hard to hear how hurt she was by your behavior. Try your best to be open to hearing her perspective and reiterate how apologetic you are. Try to practice active listening by avoiding interruptions, nodding your head, making eye contact, and asking follow-up questions. However, prioritize listening to what the other person is saying (rather than thinking about what you’ll say next). Reader Poll: We asked 440 wikiHow readers how they like to show that they’re actively listening, and only 12% of them said that they like to ask thoughtful questions . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "She may not be able to forgive you just yet. Although a sincere apology can repair a friendship or make someone feel better, it doesn't always fix everything. Depending on what you did or how hurt she is, she may need some time before forgiving you. In some cases, she may not be able to forgive. Regardless, respect how she feels and don't pressure her for forgiveness. [8] X Research source It's important to say you're sorry regardless of how she responds. Apologizing just so she will forgive you or make you feel better isn't coming from a genuine place."
