      "title": "Wear a thong.",
      "content": "Wear a thong. A thong is the go-to underwear of choice for fashion stylists for many reasons – they're completely invisible under even the tightest pants and skirts, plus because they lack seams, they can sometimes be more comfortable to sit on. [1] X Expert Source Cassandra Sethi Personal Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. In addition to reducing panty lines, wearing a thong can also help cure any acne you might have on your backside. Certain fabrics cause friction when they rub up against the skin, which can lead to acne. Wear a cotton thong to avoid or help clear up any pimples you might have on your butt. Many people prefer thongs because it's almost impossible to grow out of them. Since there is less fabric, thongs tend to grow and shrink to accommodate any weight fluctuations you may have. Wear a thong underneath a pair of tight fitting jeans or skirt."

      "content": "Try a G-string. The G-string or V-string as it's sometimes called, is the skimpiest form of underwear.

      "title": "Experiment with boyshorts.",
      "content": "Experiment with boyshorts. If you can't bear to part with your fuller cut underwear, boyshorts might be a good alternative for you. Boyshorts are cut similar to briefs, but they fall under the butt cheek, which means they are less likely to be noticed underneath tight pants or skirts. [4] X Research source Look for a lace boyshort – the lace will help the panty line look less conspicuous. Always choose a flat lace. Textured lace will cause your underwear to bunch underneath your clothing. Wear a boyshort under yoga pants for coverage and comfort as you work out."

      "content": "Wear a jockstrap under fitted dress pants. Men can get panty lines too, so if you're wearing a pair of tailored pants that hugs your rear, you may want to swap out the boxers for a jockstrap.

      "content": "Pick the right fabric. There are certain fabrics that naturally disguise panty lines and the thicker the fabric, the less likely you are to see any underwear.

[9] X Research source If you still want to wear fabrics like jersey or silk, look for clothing in loose cuts. Prints can also be useful in disguising panty lines."

      "content": "Wear nude underwear under white pants. White pants are a summertime classic, but if you choose the wrong underwear, they can be a disaster.

Avoid wearing white or black underwear underneath white pants – both colors are equally noticeable."

Those details might show through your dress, even if the rest of the underwear doesn't. Choose your underwear in a size bigger than normal so bulges won't be visible through the dress.

      "content": "Be comfortable while working out. Depending on who you are and your underwear preferences, this advice may sound like heresy. But there are times when going sans underwear can be effective – for instance, when you're working out.

Men should wear boxer briefs for sports with medium intensity and jockstraps for high intensity sports."
