      "content": "Sim swapping (stealing your phone number). Knowing just a target's phone number, a scammer contacts their mobile service provider, pretending to be the target, and asks them to transfer their phone number to a new phone. Once the scammer gains control of the phone number, they will receive all their text messages, including the two-step authentication codes sent by Zelle (and your bank) to verify logins. The scammer can then send themselves money straight from the victim's Zelle account."

      "content": "Strangers sending money. Scammers use stolen credit cards to send money to random phone numbers through Zelle. After the target receives the money, the scammer sends them a frantic message, claiming they've sent it accidentally and need to get it back. The victim then refunds the Zelle payment, thinking the interaction is over. Later, when the actual owner of the credit card reports it stolen, the original amount is deducted from the victim's bank account as well."

      "content": "Contact your phone provider to create a password. To prevent somebody from hacking your Zelle account with nothing but your phone number, you must ensure your phone provider will not hand your phone number over to a stranger. Now that sim swapping is common, most phone providers allow you to create a secret password you must provide each time you call. Once you create a password, customer service will not answer any questions about or perform tasks on your account unless the caller provides your password. Choose a password that is very hard to guess—something arbitrary that nobody would expect. Don't use your social security number, the birthday of somebody you know, your favorite musical artist, your pet's name, or anything a scammer could find out."
