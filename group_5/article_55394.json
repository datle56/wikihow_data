      "content": "Cut a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) piece of mint. You can get a cutting from a friend or cut a stem from a mint that you already have. Just be sure to use a healthy stem that has bright green leaves on it. Cut the stem just below a node which is where the plant branches off. Then, trim off all of the leaves near the bottom and leave around 5 or 6 at the top. If your cutting has too many leaves, it will take longer for the cutting to start growing roots since it's putting its energy into all of those leaves."

      "title": "Of course—store-bought mint works just fine!",
      "content": "Of course—store-bought mint works just fine! The key thing is that you use a mint cutting that's healthy. The stem should be vibrant and green while the leaves shouldn't be dried or blackened. [1] X Research source If you know you're going to be growing mint from some of your store-bought mint, why not get the cutting started as soon as you bring it home? You can enjoy the mint leaves that you trim off of the cutting and you won't accidentally use up all of your mint before you start the cutting."

      "title": "Put the cutting into a glass of cool water.",
      "content": "Put the cutting into a glass of cool water. Stick the cutting into the water so the bottom 2 inches (5.1 cm) are submerged. The water keeps the cutting from drying out so roots can start growing. [2] X Research source Use a clear glass so you can easily see when the plant begins to grow roots."

    {
      "title": "Set the glass in a sunny spot and let the roots grow for 1 to 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Set the glass in a sunny spot and let the roots grow for 1 to 2 weeks. Place your glass of water in a sunny window and change the water every day so the stem stays healthy. Check your cutting every few days to watch for tiny white roots growing from the bottom. [3] X Research source Mint really likes temperatures between 55 and 70 °F (13 and 21 °C). Place your cutting in a warm room, patio, or garage so it grows quickly."

      "title": "Plant your mint cutting in soil so a new plant can grow.",
      "content": "Plant your mint cutting in soil so a new plant can grow. When you see small, white roots coming from the base of the stem, you know it's time to plant! Fill a plant pot with peat-free multipurpose compost or potting soil. Then, use your fingers to make a 2 in (5.1 cm) deep hole and put your cutting into it. Fill in the hole with soil and press down gently. Give your plant a drink of water and let it grow! [4] X Research source Don't forget that your mint loves sunshine. Put your plant pot in a sunny spot in your house or set it outside where it will get lots of natural sunlight."

      "title": "Water your new plant whenever the soil starts to feel dry.",
      "content": "Water your new plant whenever the soil starts to feel dry. It should be kept fairly moist. To check, use your finger to dig into the soil around the mint. If it feels like it's drying out, water the plant until the soil is moist. If it still feels moist, wait a day or two and check the soil again. [5] X Research source If your plant is in a container, the pot should have drainage holes so excess water won't be trapped. If there's too much water around the roots, they can rot."

      "title": "Mint roots grow 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) deep!",
      "content": "Mint roots grow 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) deep! The roots also spread if you plant a cutting directly into the ground and new plants can quickly take over the space. Mint is a creeping species and needs a lot of space for its roots. This is why it's important to put the mint cutting into a container. Choose a pot that's around 12 inches (30 cm) tall so the roots have room to grow. [6] X Research source To give your mint plants space to grow, plant the cuttings 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) apart in rows that are 18 to 24 inches (46 to 61 cm) apart."

      "title": "No—you can grow the cutting in water until it stops putting on growth.",
      "content": "No—you can grow the cutting in water until it stops putting on growth. If you love the look of plants growing in water or you just don't want to mess with soil, you can leave the cutting to grow in the water. Just change the water every day so the mint stays healthy. The mint will stop growing, though, so pay attention to yellowing leaves or stems. This means it's time to grow a new cutting or transfer your cutting to soil. [7] X Research source This is a cool way to grow a small amount of mint, especially if you've got space in a kitchen window and want a little herb garden."

      "title": "It may not grow if the cutting wasn't healthy to begin with.",
      "content": "It may not grow if the cutting wasn't healthy to begin with. Look at the leaves of the cutting and the original mint plant, if you still have it. If you spot rust- or orange-colored patches, the plant might have mint rust. This is a fungal disease that can easily spread to other plants. If your cutting has mint rust, it won't put on healthy growth. The best thing you can do is to start with a new, healthy stem."

      "title": "The stem might be rotting because the water needs to be changed.",
      "content": "The stem might be rotting because the water needs to be changed. It's super important to change the water in the cutting glass every single day. If you don't, the water can turn cloudy as bacteria grow. This bacteria can sicken the mint stem so it starts looking dark or slimy. If this happens, you've got to start with a healthy cutting and a new glass of water. You don't need to use fancy water—tap water is fine as long as it's fresh!"
