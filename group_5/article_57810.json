To make your own paw balm, melt 2 ounces (2 tbsp.) of olive oil, 2 ounces (2 tbsp.) of coconut oil, 1 ounce (1 tbsp.) of shea butter , and ½ ounce (4 tsp.) of beeswax in a small pan.

Use sunflower or sweet almond oil instead of olive oil if you prefer. Store the balm at room temperature. It’s usually good for 1-2 years."

Only use as much as you need to spread a thin layer on your pup’s paws. For the average dog, this is only about a pea-sized amount.

Your pup’s pads should be firm and callused enough to handle rough terrain but soft enough that they aren’t cracking or drying out entirely. Some dogs can go months without their paws needing to be moisturized. For a pup whose pads tend to dry out, you likely want to apply moisturizer a few times a week. [10] X Research source Different breeds and energy levels require different levels of attention. A laid-back bulldog who takes calm strolls will likely need less moisturizing than a hyper border collie who runs miles daily."

Concrete or pavement will help toughen your dog’s paw pads so they don’t get hurt easily, and it will help file your dog’s nails and keep them an appropriate length. Soft grass or dirt will give your dog’s paws a break (and give them time to use the bathroom and do some sniffing). Don’t overdo it on either surface for best results. [13] X Research source Stay away from trash piles or loose asphalt. These surfaces can wedge all kinds of contaminants and junk in between your dog’s pads. Keep an eye out for shattered glass on your walks—especially if you live in a city. It can be hard to see translucent glass on the ground, but it can seriously hurt your dog’s paws."

A dog’s paw pads are tougher than the skin on the rest of their body, but they can still be affected by extreme heat and cold, chemicals, and especially rough terrain. Keep your pup’s paws safe from the elements with a paw balm or booties. [19] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Exposure to Chemicals: In the wintertime, road salt and other deicers can cause irritation, sores, and even blistering or infection. Plus, when your dog licks their paws they can ingest a toxic chemical. Wipe your dog's paws with warm water after walks to help prevent issues. Extreme Weather: Extremely hot or cold days can be hard on your dog’s paws due to heating or cooling the surface they walk on. Boots are the best way to protect dog paws in extremely cold weather. For excessive heat, test the walking surface by placing your bare foot on it for 5 seconds. If it’s too hot for you, it’s too hot for your pup. Try taking walks in the mornings and evenings or sticking to grassy areas. Rough Terrain: Hiking with your best fuzzy buddy can be a lot of fun, but make sure you pay attention to the terrain. Too much walking on rough ground can cause tears in paw pads. Try booties or check their paws often. Allergies: Dog have allergies, too. They can be allergic to something they come into contact with, breathe in, or eat. In many cases, their allergies can result in dry skin. Wiping and moisturizing your dog’s paws after walking can help with contact allergies, but if that doesn’t help, it might be time to visit your vet."
