      "title": "Ask your friend to write down a number with three different digits.",
      "content": "Ask your friend to write down a number with three different digits. Tell him not to show you the number or tell you what it is. Make sure he understands that none of the three digits can be the same. For example, he could pick 481 . He might need a simple calculator as well."

      "title": "Instruct him to write down the number in reverse.",
      "content": "Instruct him to write down the number in reverse. On the next line underneath the number, he should write down the same digits in reverse order. For example, 481 backwards is 184 ."

      "content": "Make it into a subtraction problem. Now that your volunteer has two numbers, have him subtract the smaller one from the larger one. 481 - 184 = 297 ."

      "content": "If the number is only two digits, add a zero at the beginning. Now ask him if his number is two or three digits long, without telling you the actual number. If it is only two digits long, have him place a 0 at the beginning. In our example, 297 has three digits, so you can skip this step. Sometimes your friend will end up at 99, and this step will turn that into \"099.\""

      "title": "Reverse this number as well.",
      "content": "Reverse this number as well. Ask him to take his answer and reverse the digit order again. If he added the zero the beginning, remind him to include it as part of the number. For example, the reverse of 297 is 792 ."
