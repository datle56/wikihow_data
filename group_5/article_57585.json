[1] X Research source Keep checking on the bread while you are preparing the eggs to make sure it doesn’t burn! If the toast is done before the eggs, remove it from the toaster. If you are toasting the bread in a toaster oven or inside your regular oven, top one piece of bread with the slice of cheese when it is partially toasted. The heat of the oven will melt the cheese."
