      "content": "Hold the fork in your left hand. Most Europeans hold their knife and fork throughout the entire meal. They keep the knife in their right hand for cutting, and the fork in their left hand for eating. [1] X Research source The European style is considered more efficient than the American style because you don’t have to switch your fork to your other hand or set it down until you are finished eating. [2] X Research source Always start with silverware that is on the outside and work your way in. [3] X Research source If you're eating European (or Continental) style, set the table with the fork on the left side of the plate and the knife on the right side of the plate. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the fork with the tines facing down.",
      "content": "Use the fork with the tines facing down. Hold the handle between your thumb and your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Place your index finger at the end of the handle where it meets the base of the fork tines, and let the end of the handle rest in the crease of your palm. Think of it like a surgeon’s scalpel, with the tines of the fork facing down toward the plate. [5] X Research source The lower you place your index finger on the fork handle, the more leverage you'll have picking up your food and eating it."

      "content": "Pick up the knife in your right hand. Hold your knife in the same closed-fist manner as your fork, and use it as a tool to push food onto the tines of your fork. If you’re cutting meat or a tougher food, pierce the food with the fork in your left hand and use a gentle sawing motion with the knife in your right hand. Always cut your food with the tines facing down. [6] X Research source You can actually push more food securely onto your fork with the European method than with the scooping American method."

      "title": "Rest the fork on your plate with the tines facing down.",
      "content": "Rest the fork on your plate with the tines facing down. If you want to take a break in the middle of your meal, place your fork and knife perpendicular to each other, with the handles on opposite sides of the plate and the blade of the knife facing toward you. When you’re finished eating, rest your fork and knife parallel on the plate; if you view the plate as the face of a clock, the tines and blade should be at 10:00 and the handles at 4:00. [7] X Research source Whether you’re cutting food, placing it in your mouth, or resting your fork on your plate, keep the tines of your fork down. Do not turn the fork up or put it into your right hand."

      "title": "Hold your fork like a pencil.",
      "content": "Hold your fork like a pencil. Americans hold forks in their dominant hand, whether it’s on the right or left. According to Claytor, the correct way to hold a fork is to “hold it by your index finger and your thumb, and then rest it on your third finger.” [8] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. The end of the fork should rest on the webbing of your hand (the space connecting your index finger and thumb). [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Eat with the tines of the fork facing up or down.",
      "content": "Eat with the tines of the fork facing up or down. Traditionally, the tines of the fork should be facing upward, but most Americans do not pay attention to this when eating. [10] X Research source It may be easier for you to pick up food with the tines up, like a shovel, but feel free to hold the fork however it feels the most comfortable to you."

      "title": "Cut food with the knife in your right hand and the fork in your left.",
      "content": "Cut food with the knife in your right hand and the fork in your left. Use your left hand to hold the food in place with the tines of your fork, then use a sawing motion to slice the food with your knife. Claytor says you should “cut four to five small bites” of food and “never cut the whole [thing] at one time.” [11] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. This is the same technique as the European (or Continental) method."

      "content": "Switch your fork to your right hand to eat. After you've cut the food into pieces, place your knife on the edge of the plate with the blade facing inward. Then, switch your fork to your right hand and bring the food to your mouth. Switch the fork back over to your left hand when you’re ready to cut another piece of food, and continue switching hands every time you need to cut more pieces. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Rest the fork on your plate with the tines facing up. If you’re still eating your food, place your fork and knife perpendicular to each other with each handle on the same side of the plate. Position the knife on the edge of the plate with the blade facing toward you. When you’re finished eating, place your utensils parallel to each other on the plate; if the plate was a clock, the tines and blade should be at 10:00 and the handles at 4:00. [13] X Research source For both American and European styles of dining, your fork and knife are in the same position when you’re finished eating."

      "content": "Many believe the European style is more efficient than the American style. Modern eaters and etiquette critics claim that the European style is less disruptive to the eating process because you keep your fork and knife in your hands the entire time. With that being said, there is no “right” or “wrong” way to hold a fork, as long as you can eat your meal comfortably, so practice both styles and choose the one that feels most comfortable to you. [14] X Research source If you’re a slow eater, the European style of dining may speed up the process. If you’re a fast eater, the American method might be better since it takes longer to cut your food and switch the utensils in your hands. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "The American “zig-zag” style developed in 19th century France. During this time, French nobility came up with more rigorous table etiquette, including cutting a piece of food with a knife in the right hand and a fork in the left hand. American followed the French, and it became a trend to eat using your dominant hand. By the 1850s, the French stopped this “zig-zag” style of fork-switching (also called “cut-and-switch”), but Americans continued to do it. [16] X Research source"
