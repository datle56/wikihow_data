      "content": "The logic behind this makes sense, but there's not a ton of evidence it will work. Most of the research on acne and salt focuses on Epsom salts and Dead Sea Salt, but the premise behind sea salt, in general, makes sense. Acne is often caused by a buildup of oils in the skin, and salt dries skin out and absorbs oils, so it makes sense. There isn’t any conclusive evidence that sea salt will do anything for your pimple, but it’s probably not going to hurt anything. [1] X Research source If possible, use Dead Sea salt instead of regular sea salt. Unlike the standard stuff, there’s a lot more scientific evidence that Dead Sea salt is going to be good for your skin! [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Unfortunately, Epsom salts probably aren’t going to have as big an impact. [3] X Research source The difference between sea salt and regular table salt is that sea salt is made by evaporating salt water, while table salt is usually mined underground. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source They have the same nutritional value, but sea salt carries all kinds of minerals, like calcium and potassium, which may give your skin a healing boost.

      "content": "Try mixing salt and honey to create a cleansing face mask. In a bowl, mix 1 tsp (5.5 g) of sea salt with 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of Manuka or medical honey. Rinse your face and then gently work the honey and salt into your skin. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes, and then wash the honey-salt mixture off of your face with cold water. This may help with your pimple by reducing inflammation and removing any excess oils that may be clogging your pores. [6] X Research source It’s possible that this works mainly because of the honey; the sea salt may not actually be the key ingredient here. Unlike salt, honey has a proven track record of reducing inflammation and soothing skin. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Manuka and medical-grade honey are scientifically proven to contain antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This makes them great options for skincare health! [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can buy Manuka honey from most organic grocery stores, while medical-grade honey is often sold in pharmacies. You can also buy them online. Keep the salt and honey away from your eyes."

      "content": "It might help, but it’s not clear there’s any benefit. There aren't many studies that prove this is effective, but you can try it if you’d like. Mix 1 cup (275 g) of sea salt with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of apricot kernel oil or sweet almond oil. If you’d like, mix a few drops of rosemary or geranium essential oil to the salt and oil. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly and hop in the shower. Gently rub the oily salt into your pimple using soft circular motions and rinse it off before you get out. [9] X Research source The essential oils may have some minor antimicrobial properties, but they aren’t a cure for your pimples and the impact is mostly going to be minimal. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you don’t have any rosemary or geranium essential oils, just use the salt and carrier oil. If the essential oil irritates your skin, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water and discontinue use. Don’t use this scrub near your eyes, mouth, or nose."

Soaking in a bath will definitely help you relax, which is great if stress is making your acne worse, and the salt is unlikely to harm your skin. Unfortunately, the only studies on this tend to focus on dry skin and Dead Sea salt baths. While Dead Sea salt baths do appear to be good for your skin, there’s no way to know if regular sea salt baths will improve acne. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you want to try a sea salt bath, pour 1/3 cup (82 g) of sea salt into the water while the tub is filling up. Hop in and relax in the warm water for 10-30 minutes before rinsing off. [12] X Research source Don’t worry about the salt water drying your skin out if you’re only bathing for 10-30 minutes. So long as you moisturize after you get out, it shouldn’t be a big deal."

Most of the research on this subject focuses on Epsom salt and Dead Sea Salt. Of those two, it looks like Dead Sea salt might be very beneficial for your skin; it can reduce inflammation, improve dry skin, and revitalize your skin barrier, which is likely going to help with any pimples you get. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dead Sea salt refers to any sea salt that has been extracted from the Dead Sea. You can buy this stuff online or from some specialty skincare stores. You could use Dead Sea salt the same way you’d use sea salt in a face mask or exfoliating wash. The other salt often used for skin issues is Epsom salt. While bathing in Epsom salt may help you relax and you may experience some benefit, there isn’t a whole lot of proof that Epsom salt does anything for your skin. [14] X Research source"

It can be tempting to mess around with your skin when you’ve got a pimple, but letting the pimple be is the best way to accelerate healing.
