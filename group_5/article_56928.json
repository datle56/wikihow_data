Since you want to use a Google product with your Apple device, you'll need to switch default apps like Chrome and Gmail so you can use Google Maps. By changing your default mail and web browser apps, you'll be using Chrome and Gmail more often than Apple services like Safari and Mail. If you're using a product in the Google ecosystem, you're more likely to open another Google service, like Google Maps instead of Apple Maps."
