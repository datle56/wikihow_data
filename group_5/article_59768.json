      "content": "Make contact. If a match occurs between a man and a woman, the woman has 24 hours to start the conversation to solidify the match. In matches that occur between two men, two women, or any two genders that aren't specifically male and female, either party can make the first contact. If no contact is made within 24 hours, the match will expire. But don't worryâ€”you can rematch with expired matches instantly if you use Bumble Premium or Bumble Boost. If you don't have a paid Bumble subscription, you can rematch the next time that person appears in your match queue."
