      "content": "Make a circle with a piece of string that’s 40 in (100 cm) long. Any type of string or cord will work to play Cat’s Cradle as long as it fits around your hands, but 40 in (100 cm) is the perfect length. Tie the 2 ends of the string together to form a large ring or circle. Can’t find a piece of string the exact length? Try cutting a piece of yarn, twine, or cord yourself. Use a long shoelace to play the game if you’re in a pinch and need a quick way to pass the time."

      "title": "Choose a player to start the game.",
      "content": "Choose a player to start the game. Traditionally, Cat’s Cradle is played with at least 2 people. The person who starts the game will start with the string in their hands. After each shape, the string will be passed from person to person so everyone will get a turn. Keep in mind that there’s generally no “winner” with this game—the goal is to see how far you and your friend(s) can go without making a mistake. You can play Cat’s Cradle with as many people as you want, moving the string from one person to the next after each cycle. Try picking a partner whose hands are roughly the size of your own to make the game a little easier. For the sake of these instructions, let’s pretend you start the game."

    {
      "title": "Loop the string around the back of both hands.",
      "content": "Loop the string around the back of both hands. Thread your hands into the string, and tug them away from each other, so the string becomes taught. Let the string rest just behind your knuckles. Point your thumbs up and keep them outside of the string. This way, the string won’t slip out of your hands. [1] X Research source Some players prefer to lace the string around their middle and ring finger to start the game, but that could make it a bit harder for beginners."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the string around your wrists.",
      "content": "Wrap the string around your wrists. Rotate your hands so that the loop doubles up around your palms. Now you should have 2 strands of string running parallel to each other from either side of your palms, forming a rectangle. [2] X Research source Turn your wrists so that only 1 strand gets wrapped around twice. Otherwise, both strands will twist together and you won’t have the same setup. If you’re having trouble looping the string around your wrists a second time, have another player help you."

    {
      "title": "Catch the inner strand of the string with your middle fingers.",
      "content": "Catch the inner strand of the string with your middle fingers. Reach across and slide a middle finger under the strand looped in front of your finger’s opposite palm. Repeat with your opposite hand, only grabbing the section in front. Then, pull the strands apart to form a double “X” in the middle. You’ve just formed “Cat’s Cradle!” [3] X Research source To keep the game going, have the next player form a new shape."

      "title": "Hand the Cradle off to the next player.",
      "content": "Hand the Cradle off to the next player. Once you’ve made the first Cradle, have your friend use their thumb and pointer fingers to grab the “Xs” from the outside of the Cradle, pinching the middle of the “X” from the inside. Pull the “Xs” out and under the bottom strings of the Cradle. As your friend pushes the string up, gently release all the strings from your hands. [4] X Research source When your friend opens their thumb and forefinger, they’ll have the second shape: “Solider’s Bed.”"

Bring the “Xs” out, around, and under the bottom strings. Continue threading your hands up and open your thumbs and pointer fingers. Have your friend pull their hands away to transfer the strings back onto your hands. [5] X Research source This is the third shape in the Cat’s Cradle sequence and is called “Candles.” Candles is also known as “Chopsticks” in Korea and “Mirror” in parts of Europe.

      "content": "Give the string back to your partner to make “The Manger.” From Candles, your partner can hook the top strand with their right pinky, then reach across from the opposite side to snag the bottom strand with their left. While holding on with their pinky fingers, they can bring their thumb and pointer finger under and around the inner 2 strands. When you hand off the string, you’ll have formed “The Manger.” [7] X Research source The Manger is essentially an upside-down version of Cat’s Cradle. If you continue from The Manger in the same order, you’ll make “Diamonds,” which is an inverted Soldier’s Bed. [8] X Research source"

Bring the pinky back out over the bottom string. Go over the far index finger strings with your pinkies and pick up the far thumb strings. Drop off the thumb strings, turn your hands sideways, and you’ve formed “Cat’s Eye.” [9] X Research source Soldier’s Bed and Diamonds are often used interchangeably to discuss the same “X” formation."

Then, have them do the same with their left pinky and the opposite single string. Ask them to pinch their thumbs and pointer fingers together, weaving them through the triangle, under, up, and around to the shape's center. While you release the string, your friend will open their fingers to form the second Cat’s Cradle. Make sure your friend doesn’t let go of the strings in their pinkies while they weave in and out of the triangles. And now you’ve completed your first cycle of Cat’s Cradle! Keep the game going by doing your friend’s steps with your friend doing your steps in the next cycle. Try transitioning into different shapes and following a new sequence as you get better and better at the game."

If this happens, start back from the beginning with Cat’s Cradle. Keep playing to see how many times you and your friend(s) can go through the cycle flawlessly. [10] X Research source Practice slowly the first few times until you get the hang of the game. For an added challenge, increase your speed each time you successfully complete a cycle."

Then, no matter how you start, thread your middle finger through the string on the opposite hand. Repeat with the other hand, and you’ve made your Cat’s Cradle. [11] X Research source Make your string a little longer if you’re just learning how to play. The length of the string dictates how far apart your hands need to be in order to hold the string taut.
