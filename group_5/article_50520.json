      "title": "The rising (or “ascendant”) sign is your outer-most identity, or “mask.”",
      "content": "The rising (or “ascendant”) sign is your outer-most identity, or “mask.” Different placements like sun, moon, and Venus signs all rule different parts of your personality, and your rising sign is special: it’s the most finicky sign—the one that you need your exact birth time to calculate. It’s also a big one, responsible for the way you’re initially perceived by others. It also affects your appearance, so you might relate to the way your rising sign dresses or the vibe they’re meant to project. [1] X Research source Theories on risings differ among astrologists. Some believe that it’s not your true personality, and that it hides more authentic sides of you that come out later on in relationships. On the other hand, some astrologists think of it as one of the primary parts of your persona, because it’s the first thing people see. And some people feel that even down the line, their rising signs’ traits continue to be the best representation of their true personality, even more so than the sun. Our advice? Go with what feels right to you. Your birth chart is as much an art as a science, and in the end, your experience is the most important thing."

      "content": "Face: Aquarius risings are known to have an otherworldly look to them. So picture big, curious eyes set below a prominent forehead. When they look at you, you’ll feel like they’re staring into the bottom of your soul. Typically, their face is outlined by stunning, sharp bone structure. They might also have some unique, striking features that set them apart from everyone else, like they were beamed in from another planet."

      "title": "Body:",
      "content": "Body: Though bodies differ from one Aquarius rising to the next, they tend to lean in the tall, slender direction. They also might look strong and toned, but not particularly muscled. This sign is known for having a quiet presence and power about them, so when they walk into a room, they tend to catch eyes."

      "title": "Mannerisms:",
      "content": "Mannerisms: Aquarius risings mix detached confidence and playful clumsiness, which makes them fascinating to watch. They’ll shoot you the most calm-and-collected look that could rock anyone’s confidence, then go on to trip over a stationary object. And when they do, Aquarius risings are unlikely to act embarrassed. They don't mind."

      "title": "Unique style:",
      "content": "Unique style: Aquarius rising puts the “personal” in “personal style.” To them, unconventionality is an art. They’re always true to themselves, and their fashion choices reflect this. Expression and uniqueness come before trends and fitting in. So big style choices might come into play, like piercings, tattoos, and bright hair colors. Or, Aquarius might prefer to make subtler (but still bold) style choices, like a giant, funky ring."

      "title": "Intellectual.",
      "content": "Intellectual. As an Aquarius rising, people probably perceive you as being very intelligent and sharp. At first meeting, you have a natural authority that fascinates others (and in all likelihood, intimidates them, too!). It seems like no matter what the group discusses, you have something insightful to say. And people see you as being very well-spoken and confident, which only increases your rep.

      "title": "Unique.",
      "content": "Unique. When people meet you, they’re struck by your individuality. You seem unconcerned with others’ opinions of you, and instead, totally set on making your own way. It might be the way you dress, or the way you move, or the way you say exactly what’s on your mind…but one thing’s for sure: when people meet you, they see you as authentic, and unlike anyone they’ve met before."

      "title": "Aloof.",
      "content": "Aloof. Cool and detached, party of one! Aquarius is a sign that’s famous for their self-possessed nature. Aquarius always gives off the impression that they have somewhere better to be, that they’re bored by the world around them. As an Aquarius rising, this might be part of your first impression. People meet you and they think: “Wow, I feel like I need to impress them for some reason…”"

      "content": "Humanitarian. Aquarius is a sign famous for their massive heart. Their MO isn’t sweet and cuddly, though—Aquarius isn’t nice, they’re kind. Aquarius isn’t polite, they’re moral. As an Aquarius rising, this just means that, though you might not win any awards for table manners, people do get the sense that you’re a really good person deep down. Right away, they see that you care about the world at large. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius rising, you’re an exciting, inspiring, and supportive partner.",
      "content": "Aquarius rising, you’re an exciting, inspiring, and supportive partner. In love, rising signs effect who you attract and who you are in lighter, unserious moments. So as an Aquarius rising, you’re likely to draw in people who like quirkiness, a quick mind, and a good heart. Though other placements might be more important down the line, it’s important that you and your partner know how to have fun, silly moments together, and your rising sign’s a big part of that. You should date someone who enjoys random adventures and challenging debates. Bonus points if they appreciate individuality and out-of-the-box thinking, because you’re likely to offer that right away. Our advice: Try to open up early on. Aquarius risings’ cool, aloof demeanor can be attractive, but it also might leave crushes to think you’re not interested. If you like someone, try to get out of your comfort zone and show them (you might not be making it as obvious as you think you are)."

      "title": "Aquarius risings make awesome—albeit unpredictable—pals.",
      "content": "Aquarius risings make awesome—albeit unpredictable—pals. As a friend, you immediately draw others into your unique, bright light. They love your sense of humor, your silliness, and your ability to surprise them at every turn. Though, when friends try to transition from acquaintances to close pals, you may struggle to make the leap. As an Aquarius rising, you're a little flighty and closed-off with people you’re still getting to know. What to look out for: Rising signs that are more open (like Gemini, Pisces, and Cancer) might find your distance a little worrisome at first, which could cause them to bolt. Our advice: If you like someone, try to open up earlier than you normally would. Down the line, your other placements might end up taking center stage anyway. It’s just about getting past this first barrier. So what are you waiting for? Take the leap!"

      "content": "Aquarius risings might gravitate towards tech, non-profits, and the arts. Generally, other placements, especially your sun sign, tend to give better professional insights, but still: your rising sign can be a crucial piece to understanding your career goals and strengths. Aquarius is associated with innovation, technology, service, and creativity—so it might be wise to look into these areas if you’re looking for inspiration. Dream careers: scientist, app developer, social worker, judge, environmentalist, astronomer, or activist. Professional strengths: Your out-of-the-box thinking. Creative problem-solving. An air of authority and intelligence. Empathy for others. Detail-orientedness."
