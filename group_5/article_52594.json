      "content": "Crack 3 eggs into a bowl and whisk them together. McNally suggests adding a pinch of salt, pepper, and 1-2 tbsp (15-29 mL) of milk as well for some added flavor. Using a fork or a whisk, beat everything together until the yolks, whites, seasonings, and milk are thoroughly mixed. If you don’t have any milk or prefer not to use it, that’s completely fine! It’s 100% optional, and you can still make a delicious omelet without it. [1] X Research source"

Once you’ve selected your fillings, chop them up into bite-sized pieces, and aim to have about ½ cup of filling for one 2-3 egg omelet. [2] X Research source Here are some common ingredients if you’re looking for inspiration: Veggies: Onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, kale, roasted potatoes, hash browns Meats: Bacon, ham, breakfast sausage, smoked salmon, chorizo Cheeses: Cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, gruyère, ricotta, feta Herbs: Chives, parsley, dill, thyme, basil, cilantro Other toppings: Avocado, pesto, hot sauce, sour cream, crushed red pepper"

[3] X Research source To do this, simply add a bit of cooking oil to pan over medium heat. Next, add ½ cup of the chopped fillings of your choice (except for cheeses and herbs–you don’t need to pre-cook these), and sauté until the ingredients are cooked through and slightly browned."

Heat 1 tbsp (14 g) of butter or 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil over medium heat, then pour your beaten egg mixture into the pan. Tilt your skillet around to make sure the eggs coat the entire bottom of it.

      "content": "Let the edges of the omelet set, then use a spatula to gently push them inward. When the edges of the omelet start to set (become solid and look more cooked), use a rubber spatula to push the cooked outer portions of the egg toward the center of the omelet. As you do this, let the raw egg run toward the edges of the pan to fill those spaces. [5] X Research source Keep doing this until the bottom of the omelet is set, but the top is still slightly runny. [6] X Research source Carefully lift one corner of the omelet with your spatula to see if the bottom holds together. If it does, it’s ready for your fillings."

You have a delicious, perfectly-cooked omelet. [9] X Research source Finish your omelet with freshly chopped herbs, such as chives or parsley, for an extra fancy touch.

      "content": "Keep the heat on the lower side. Eggs cook very fast, so if you turn your burner up to medium-high or high heat, you risk ending up with a burnt omelet. Keep your heat in the low to medium range, and make sure to keep a close eye on your omelet while it’s cooking so you can adjust as needed."

Eggs tend to stick pretty easily, so a nonstick pan can save you lots of frustration down the road. [12] X Research source You’ll also want to avoid using a pan that’s too large, since this may cause your eggs to spread out into a layer that’s too thin."

      "content": "Caramelized mushrooms and cheese To prepare your caramelized mushrooms, McNally recommends adding avocado oil to a nonstick skillet over medium heat, then adding your sliced mushrooms with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Stir the mushrooms until they’re thoroughly coated with oil, salt and pepper, then let them sit for a couple minutes. “You can tell the mushrooms are caramelizing when they begin to turn golden brown on the edges—this is where a lot of flavor develops,” says McNally. As your mushrooms finish cooking, crack 3 eggs into a bowl and add a pinch of salt, pepper, a little bit of milk, and a handful of either parmesan or cheddar cheese (whichever you prefer). Use your spatula to lay all the mushrooms evenly on the bottom of the pan, then pour your beaten egg mixture over the top. “Gently swirl the eggs around so you achieve a perfect circle of egg in your pan, then wait 2-3 minutes before doing anything else,” says McNally. “Once you see the edges start to form and keep their shape, carefully flip one half of the omelet on top of the other.” “Cover and let it cook for a few more minutes and done! You’ve got yourself a delicious, tasty mushroom omelet,” she says."

      "content": "French and American omelets have different shapes and textures. French omelets are typically a little creamy and custard-y on the inside, rather than cooked all the way through. They also have a cylinder-like shape, achieved by either rolling the omelet or folding each of the sides in toward the middle. American omelets, on the other hand, feature fluffy eggs that are cooked through with no runniness, and they’re folded in half into a semi-circle shape. [18] X Research source The recipe above is for an American-style omelet, which is generally considered to be easier to cook for home chefs."
