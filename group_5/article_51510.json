Grubhub states that orders cannot be canceled once the restaurant starts preparing the food. This is true, although you should still be able to contact a Grubhub agent and describe your reason for cancellation at any point in the process."

      "title": "Explain your cancellation to the agent.",
      "content": "Explain your cancellation to the agent. Once you are connected to an agent, you can type out what went wrong with your order, or why you would like to cancel it. The agents are often cooperative and understanding of most cancellations, but not necessarily of refunds associated with such cancellations. If you would like a refund, include that request in your conversation. Certain reasons for cancellation, such as an order that never arrived or arrived incorrectly, will prompt the agent to automatically refund you. If you are having trouble getting a refund, check out the next section. These refunds tend to arrive within 3-5 business days. If you are attempting to cancel an order that is currently being prepared by the restaurant, or has just been sent out with the driver, you may be denied from doing so."

      "content": "Call Grubhub at 877-585-7878. If the agent did not process a refund when you first canceled your Grubhub order, you should call Grubhub in order to request one. You can also try to repeat the steps in the first part of this guide to start another live chat with an agent and request a refund. You will likely have better luck over the phone, as your order likely would have been refunded when you first canceled the order had the agent recognized a reason to do so. You may have to wait on hold for several minutes, but you should eventually connect with an agent who can assist you. If you are trying to cancel an order on Seamless (which is owned by Grubhub) the phone number is 877-951-2500."
