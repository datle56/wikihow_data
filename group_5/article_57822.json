      "content": "The major difference between these cells is their function. Both monocytes and lymphocytes are types of leukocytes, or white blood cells. These white blood cells both patrol your immune system for antigens, or foreign molecules on pathogens like viruses and bacteria. When they find antigens, they fight them off. Monocytes do this by directly killing antigens, while lymphocytes target them with antibodies, or special proteins that neutralize antigens.

      "content": "Function When monocytes find antigens in your blood and tissues, they envelop the pathogen and kill them in a process called phagocytosis. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Instead of directly killing antigens, lymphocytes create antibodies that attach to specific antigens. They then send out the antibodies which neutralize the antigens. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source During phagocytosis, monocytes essentially eat and consume the pathogen."

      "title": "Immunity",
      "content": "Immunity Your body has 2 immune responses: innate and adaptive. When an antigen enters your body, monocytes immediately respond to the invader and kill them; this is the innate response. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The adaptive immune response is slower and more specialized. Lymphocytes identify and target the antigens with individualized antibodies. They then form a memory of the antigen so if it infects you again later, the adaptive response is quicker and more efficient. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Basically, monocytes are like first responders that respond quickly and non-specifically to antigens. Lymphocytes are like specialized back-ups that operate more slowly. They typically take over when monocytes aren’t killing the antigens effectively. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Lymphocytes are the reason why you can only get some diseases once, like chicken pox, or why secondary infections are milder."

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source On the other hand, monocytes are about twice as big as red blood cells. They’re also the largest white blood cell, typically making them the easiest to identify, too. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Reactive or atypical lymphocytes are large lymphocytes. They typically transform and enlarge when they sense and respond to antigens. [9] X Research source"

Lymphocytes make up a larger proportion, accounting for 20-40% of all the white blood cells in your system. [10] X Research source Lymphocytes are typically the second most populous white blood cell in your body. They come in after neutrophils, which are the most abundant white blood cells in your body."

      "title": "Nucleus",
      "content": "Nucleus One of the other distinguishing factors between lymphocytes and monocytes is their nucleus shape. Lymphocytes have an identifiably large and round nucleus. A monocyte’s nucleus is also pretty unique. It has a distinct U-shape, often looking like a kidney bean. [11] X Research source The nucleus is a rounded structure that typically rests in the middle of a cell. It functions as the cell’s control center and contains genetic information like DNA and RNA. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you stain monocytes and lymphocytes in a blood smear, it’s easy to tell that they’re different. While they both have a light blue cytoplasm, which is the fluid inside a cell, and a deep purple nucleus, the different shape of the nucleus is very apparent."

      "content": "Monocytes are your first line of defense to kill pathogens. As the first responders in your immune system, monocytes use their receptors to detect when antigens enter your body. They quickly move through your blood to find the affected tissues, where they either eat the harmful pathogen or call for backup. The 2 types of monocytes that take on these roles: [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Macrophages : these monocytes are responsible for eating pathogens through phagocytosis. They engulf the pathogen and remove the toxic enzymes inside. They then remove these dead cells from your body. Dendritic cells : these monocytes alert other white blood cells to the presence of pathogens. They take antigens from the pathogen, which helps other white blood cells form neutralizing antibodies, and release cytokines to show the white blood cells where to find the pathogen."

      "content": "Lymphocytes create antibodies and remember pathogens. These white blood cells also kill pathogens, but they take their time doing so. Lymphocytes find out how to destroy them by creating antibodies, a type of protein that specifically targets certain antigens. They then catalog the pathogens so they’re prepared the next time they enter your body. The 3 different types of lymphocytes share these responsibilities: [21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source B cells : these lymphocytes make antibodies. They secrete the antibodies to cover pathogens, which marks them to be killed. T cells : these are either cytotoxic T cells or helper T cells. Cytotoxic T cells directly kill pathogens, working alongside macrophages. Helper T cells draw more macrophages to the area by distributing cytokines. Natural killer cells : these lymphocytes use enzymes to target and kill tumor cells.
