      "content": "Find a local studio that offers Judo lessons. Look to make sure there are people there of your own size and weight. You can learn the most by training with people who are a similar size to yourself. But make sure that the coach is a Black (or Red) Belt (the highest rank, depending on your country), especially above 1st degree. Having an experienced instructor is important not just for quality of learning but also for your safety!"

      "content": "Get the kit. Get the Judo \"gi\" (pronounced ghee, commonly and incorrectly called a \"kimono\"), the judo uniform. The gi top is like a sturdy jacket for grip-training, and the pants roomy and good for movement. This can be acquired online, at sports stores, or through your club. Ask for help finding your size as they will be able to let you try on other member's jackets for comparison. Always bear in mind that your gi is likely to shrink when it is laundered.

      "content": "Learn the breakfalls. Ukemi (breakfalls) are what stops the fall from hurting and, without them, you'll be black and blue very quickly. Falling the wrong way can also knock the wind from you, which is uncomfortable and cuts into your practice time. Done properly, getting thrown should not hurt at all. Protect your head. If you know someone is going to drop to their knees during a throw then tuck it in to prevent it hitting the mat. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Work on learning a few moves, and perfecting them. Add new ones, expanding your moves. Learning cool new judo techniques will keep you motivated, but never forget to adhere to your basics. Watch the Judo masters: they often have a tournament arsenal no bigger than 4-6 throws. It's better to do a few judo moves well, than many moves badly."

      "content": "Drill! The conditioning may not seem fun, but you will feel ten times better on the mat if you practice a few cursory sweeping and balance drills regularly in your spare time. Drilling will increase your physical fitness, strength and stamina over time which will improve your performance. It will also build your \"muscle memory\" of different moves which will increase the fluency and ease you can perform them- particularly during a fight. \"Muscle memory\" is referring to the fact that muscles \"remember\" what they have done before and can replicate the move more easily.
