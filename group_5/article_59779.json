Although this won't tell you whether someone follows a particular playlist of yours, it can still be helpful to gauge who's following you. Plus, if someone follows your profile, there's a chance they are also following one or more of your playlists. To open your profile in the Spotify app, tap the Home tab, tap the gear at the top, and then tap your name. Then, tap the number of followers at the top to view your entire follower list. You can tap a follower's name to check out their profile, which can give you an idea of what type of music they enjoy. You can also see that user's own public playlists, as well as any playlists by others they follow that they've marked as public. Which brings us toâ€¦"

      "content": "You might be able to see which playlists a certain person follows. Might is the key word here. Once upon a time, Spotify publicly displayed every new playlist its users followed on their profiles. But now, when someone follows a playlist, that information stays private unless the user manually marks the playlist as public. If you're trying to figure out if a certain Spotify user is following your playlist, open that person's profile and tap Playlists at the top. Browse the list to see if your playlist is among those that user follows publicly. Keep in mind that even if you don't see your playlist on this user's profile, they may still be following it and just haven't marked it as public."

      "content": "You can vote to bring the feature to Spotify. One cool thing about Spotify's online community is that members can suggest new Spotify features on the forum. Other users can vote on whether they'd like to see these features implemented, and Spotify's development team takes notice. The follower list feature was first suggested as an idea back in 2013, but people are still casting their votes for its comeback in 2021. [1] X Research source Spotify developers have marked the idea as something they don't want to implement right now, but that doesn't mean they won't bring it back in the future. To cast your vote, visit https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-View-all-Playlist-Followers/idi-p/291448 and click +Vote . If you aren't already a registered member of the Spotify Community, you'll be asked to sign in with your Spotify account to complete your vote."
