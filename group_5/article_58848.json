      "title": "Select a play.",
      "content": "Select a play. If you are able to choose your own play, pick something easy and something you might already be familiar with to start. Most editions will have a brief synopsis printed on the back cover. If the play sounds intriguing, it might make for a good selection. Romeo and Juliet is often a good starting point because many of us are familiar with the “star-crossed lovers” plot. Consider a comedy, like Taming of the Shrew, a play which has been adapted to film for modern audiences. Macbeth is another popular Shakespearean tragedy, and if you are interested in political intrigue, this might be the play for you."

      "title": "Choose a good edition.",
      "content": "Choose a good edition. There are two major choices to make. The first choice is between texts that have been modernized to smooth over the differences in language use from Shakespeare’s time to our own time, or texts that have not been modernized. The second choice is between texts that are annotated or non-annotated. Annotated texts may provide definitions, context, and value-added information that will help you to form a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play. The \"No Fear Shakespeare\" series is a good option that offers the original text side-by-side with modernized text. Remember that modernized text should support understanding, and not replace the original. Popular annotated versions are available by Arden and Oxford. Non-annotated texts will provide just the text as it was originally written."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the most frequent “Shakespearisms.”",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the most frequent “Shakespearisms.” Language is always evolving, and some of the words in Shakespeare's plays have a different meaning today than when the plays were written, or they are no longer in use. When in doubt, use the context of the sentence to figure out the meaning or reference an online Shakespearean glossary. Here are some examples: ”Thee” as “you.” For example: “When will I see thee next?” ”Thou” as “you.” For example: “Thou art a villain.” ”Thy as “your.” For example: “Thy name is more hateful than thy face.” ”Hath” as “has.” For example: “He hath killed many a man.” OR “He hath a horse."

      "title": "Understand Shakespeare’s use of grammar.",
      "content": "Understand Shakespeare’s use of grammar. In Shakespeare’s writing, parts of speech are frequently switched and \"normal\" sentence order is often varied, often for the sake of rhyme or meter (which is like rhythm). Shakespeare often played with standard language; some common features include: Nouns or adjectives used as verbs Verbs and subjects which don't agree Omitted or implied words Word endings such as \"-ly\" applied inconsistently Tricky sentence construction. For instance, where we say \"John caught the ball,\" Shakespeare might write \"John the ball caught,\" or even \"The ball John caught.\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Enjoy Shakespeare’s wordplay.",
      "content": "Enjoy Shakespeare’s wordplay. In Shakespeare’s writing, metaphors and similes may make some passages more difficult to understand. Shakespeare also heavily used puns, double meanings, and malapropisms for comedic effect. An example of a Shakespearean metaphor compares life to the theatre stage: \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.\" An example of a Shakespearean pun: after Hamlet has killed Polonius and hidden his body, the king asks him where Polonius is. Hamlet tells him he is at supper – “not where he eats, but where he is eaten,” meaning that Polonius is the supper – for worms. An example of a Shakespearean malapropism: officer Dogberry said, \"Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons\" (apprehended two suspicious persons).

If you have finished reading one of Shakespeare's more popular plays, there is a very good chance it has been produced into a film. There are also a wide variety of Shakespeare’s plays on audiobook that you can download to your iPod or another device. But remember, modern plays or film adaptations might give different meaning or be shown in a different context than the original play. Think about the below questions when you watch the play or film. How does the performance compare with your perceptions of the play? Was there something the actor provided that you did not consider? Was there something you would have done differently?
