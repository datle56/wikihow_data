[2] X Research source You can also feed a fledgling pigeon chick crumbles that can be crushed into smaller pieces and mixed with water. These can be purchased at a pet store. In emergency situations, you can feed a fledgling pigeon dog biscuits that have been crushed and softened by mixing with warm water. Do not feed a fledgling milk or bread crumbs."

      "content": "Mix the baby bird formula with water. Follow the instructions provided on the package in order to prepare the formula for feeding. In most cases you will need to mix the formula with warm water. For young birds you will mix 1 part formula with 6 parts water. As the pigeon ages you will decrease the water content. [3] X Research source Do not heat the water or formula in the microwave because this can create hot pockets that will burn the fledgling."

      "title": "Push the sides of the beak to open the pigeons mouth.",
      "content": "Push the sides of the beak to open the pigeons mouth. Pigeons don’t open their mouths when they want to be fed. As a result, you will need to push the sides of the beak in order to open the mouth. Have someone hold the body of the pigeon while you use your hands to open the mouth and insert the syringe. Gently squeeze out the formula. [5] X Research source Stop feeding the pigeon once the crop is full. The crop is a pocket that hangs on the inside of the chest. When full the chest should feel squishy, like a balloon filled with water."
