      "content": "Talk to the person privately about their pornography problem. Choose a private area where the two of you can talk without distractions. Let them know that you aren't criticizing or judging them and listen actively if they're willing to open up to you about it. [1] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I've noticed that you spend a lot of time online looking at porn lately. There's nothing wrong with looking at porn, but it seems like you're a little off balance. Would you like to talk about it?\" Tell the person that you care for them and you just want what's best for them. You might also mention that they should never feel too guilty or ashamed to talk to you about it. If the person adamantly refuses that they have a problem and doesn't believe they need to do anything about it, reassure them that you're there for them if they change their mind. Look for patterns and triggers for their behavior. Helping them to disrupt these patterns could possibly help them have a healthier relationship with porn, if not eliminate it completely from their life. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that the person might not be aware that they have a problem. If the person has already mentioned to you that they believe their pornography viewing is a problem, on the other hand, you can help them by gently pointing out these patterns."

      "content": "Make a plan to help the person cut back or stop viewing porn. Based on the person's viewing patterns, think of activities that would be a replacement for watching pornography. Include options for the person to taper off their viewing before they eliminate it from their life completely—quitting something cold turkey can be extremely difficult. [3] X Research source Include ways to limit the behavior in your plan as well. For example, you might look at blocking or filtering apps for their electronic devices. Accountability is important. Think about ways you can help them here—look at monitoring apps that will send you reports so you can evaluate their progress. You don't necessarily have to do this on your own! Talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in sex or porn addiction and they can give you some tips."

      "content": "Share your plan with the person if they're open to it. If the person agrees with you that their pornography viewing is a problem and they want to cut back or quit, that's a great thing. They've taken the first step on the road to recovery, which is to admit that they have a problem. [4] X Research source Talk about the plan together. If there's anything they disagree with, ask them what they think might work better. If they don't think they have a problem or they aren't interested in your plan, don't push it. Just tell them that you're available any time they want to talk about it and leave it at that. Remember, you can't force someone to change if they're not ready to."

      "content": "Volunteer to be an accountability partner. An accountability partner gets reports on a regular basis about how much time the addicted person is spending online and what they were doing there. If the person addicted to porn happens to be your live-in romantic partner, you're probably their ideal accountability partner. But even if you're just a close friend, you can still help them out. [5] X Research source Look for a filtering or blocking app that automatically generates reports and sends them to you. This works great for accountability because the person can't manipulate the reports."

      "content": "Set filters and screen limits on electronic devices. If the person is trying to quit porn entirely, install an app or browser extension that will block pornographic content . You can also set the preferences in search engines to block adult content . [6] X Research source On the other hand, if the person is trying to cut down before they quit entirely, a screen time limit app can help them keep track of time so they're not looking at porn for hours on end. Most smartphones come with these apps pre-installed. If the person regularly gets pornography-related emails, encourage them to consider changing their email address so they don't have to see those anymore."

      "content": "Help the person identify their triggers so they can avoid them. People who have a porn addiction typically have specific situations or feelings that make them want to watch porn. Talk to them and help them make a list of these triggers. Then, together you can brainstorm ways to avoid those situations. If a trigger is unavoidable, you can help them think of things they could do instead to take their mind off the idea of wanting to watch porn. [7] X Research source For example, if the person wants to watch porn every time they sit down at the computer in the bedroom, you might move the computer out of the bedroom and into the living room. For some porn addicts, the trigger might also be simply that they're trying to fill a void in their life. If they figure out what they're not happy with or what they're trying to cover up with pornography, they can work on that and eliminate the source of the problem."

Journaling is a great way for the person to reflect on the role of porn in their life and keep track of how often they watch porn and for how long. As they start moving away from pornography, they can look back and see how far they've come and how much they've added to their life by cutting back or eliminating it. [8] X Research source They can also use their journal to write about their feelings and identify triggers that potentially cause them to want to watch porn so they can avoid those triggers or find ways to deal with them in a healthier way."

Plan activities to do with them so that they're not alone and can be accountable for what they're doing. If people are expecting them to show up, they'll be less likely to bail on the activity in favor of watching porn. You might also suggest new hobbies or clubs that are aligned with their interests. [9] X Research source Getting active also triggers the person's brain to produce dopamine and other feel-good chemicals, which can help them if they feel down or depressed after quitting pornography, which is a common thing."

When someone meditates , they learn to live more in the moment and identify their thoughts and feelings, which can help them control their craving for pornography. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A regular meditation practice can also reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety the person might experience when you quit viewing porn after being addicted to it."

When someone has a pornography addiction, they watch porn compulsively and are unable to stop or control that behavior, even if it results in negative consequences. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Some people disagree with using the word \"addiction\" to describe behavioral addictions. But it is an addiction in the sense that using pornography triggers a rush of dopamine. Over time, the porn addict's brain stops producing dopamine in response to normal, everyday things so they are forced to turn to porn for that dopamine rush."

They might also find that they get distracted by porn instead of doing something they should be doing. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This lack of control is one of the \"4 Cs\" of behavioral addiction.

They might even start taking greater risks with their porn viewing, such as watching it on their phone in public when there are people around. Basically, if they're addicted to that behavior, they will take every chance they get to watch porn. [16] X Research source Another aspect of this is that when they start watching porn, they lose track of time. For example, they might only intend to watch for 20 minutes, but then suddenly realize that two hours have passed and they're late for some prior commitment. They might also find that their tolerance increases so that they feel like they need to watch more porn, or more explicit porn, to continue to get the same results. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Trying to stop or cut down and failing Someone who knows that they have a problem with porn might've tried to cut back or quit before without success. A lot of people with behavioral addictions try to quit unsuccessfully several times before they finally end up quitting for good. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This inability to quit or cut down is connected to the lack of control that the person has over their porn-viewing habit. Relapses are also quite common and nothing to be ashamed of. Ending a behavioral addiction can be difficult, but a slip-up doesn't mean the addiction is impossible to end. The person just has to forgive themselves and recommit to their quit plan."

Their brains are going to get more dopamine from watching porn than from doing other things and they've prioritized that dopamine rush. [19] X Research source For example, they might be late to work because they stayed up late watching porn or were watching porn in the morning before work and lost track of time. Neglecting to do housework or other chores and letting things fall by the wayside in favor of watching porn is another sign that the person might be addicted to porn."

This is especially important if the person refuses to admit that they have a problem and doesn't want to seek help.
