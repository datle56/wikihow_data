      "content": "Mood rings change color thanks to thermotropic liquid crystals. These liquid crystals turn different colors in different temperatures. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source So, when you put on a mood ring , the crystals inside the band or gem react to your skin’s temperature, showing a unique and vibrant color. The base of your ring conducts heat, transferring your body’s temperature to the liquid crystals inside. The crystals twist and move in response, and as their wavelengths change with the heat, their color changes. [2] X Research source When your body temperature is stable, the crystals stay in a neutral state and project a blue or green color. As your temperature rises, the crystals compress into shorter wavelengths and appear purple in color. Thermotropic crystals are also used in watches, calculators, and computer screens to display images."

      "content": "Mood rings offer an educated guess, but can't accurately read emotions. Body temp changes are associated with your emotions. For example, happier emotions are associated with temperature rises, whereas sad feelings sometimes cause your body temp to drop. [3] X Research source Mood rings can accurately read temperature (thanks to their thermotropic liquid crystals), so their readings can offer some insight. However, temperature alone can't predict your emotions. Other factors alter body temp besides your feelings, and at the end of the day, only you know exactly how you're feeling . Your body temperature can also be affected by the environment and your activity levels. Are you someplace cold? Have you been exercising? Mood rings can’t predict complex emotions, complicated feelings, or subtle mood shifts, as one simple color can’t describe everything you’re experiencing. Even if a mood ring isn’t always right, they’re still super fun to use and wear!"
