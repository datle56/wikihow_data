      "content": "Identify the magnitude of the vector. The magnitude of a vector a {\\displaystyle a} is notated as | a | {\\displaystyle |a|} . To identify the magnitude of a 2-dimensional vector, you must first identify the horizontal and vertical components of the vector—that is, identify the coordinates of the vector along the x-axis and y-axis (for instance, 3 on the x-axis and 4 on the y-axis, usually notated as i ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {i}}} and j ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {j}}} , respectively) and find the sum of the squares of each of the components (which would be expressed as 3 2 + 4 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}+4^{2}} ). Take that sum, and find its square root in order to determine the magnitude. In other words, | a | {\\displaystyle |a|} = √ ( 3 2 + 4 2 ) {\\displaystyle (3^{2}+4^{2})} = √ 25 {\\displaystyle 25} = 5 {\\displaystyle 5} . [2] X Research source To determine the magnitude of a 3-dimensional vector, follow the exact same formula, except add the z-axis—that is, the axis that usually intersects with the x- and y-axes diagonally (notated as k ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {k}}} ). For instance, if 3-dimensional vector a {\\displaystyle a} = 3 i ^ + 4 j ^ + 5 k ^ {\\displaystyle 3{\\widehat {i}}+4{\\widehat {j}}+5{\\widehat {k}}} , you would determine | a | {\\displaystyle |a|} using the following equation: | a | {\\displaystyle |a|} = √ ( 3 2 + 4 2 + 5 2 ) {\\displaystyle (3^{2}+4^{2}+5^{2})} ."

      "content": "A vector is an object that contains both direction and magnitude. A vector is represented as a line on the Cartesian coordinate system, and it is denoted as a set of numbers representing its relationship to the x-axis (the vertical line on the graph) and the y-axis (the horizontal line). A vector’s magnitude refers to the size of the vector and is represented by a line with an arrow on the end. The length of the line denotes the length of the vector, while the direction of the arrow denotes the direction of the vector. Vectors possess both a starting point (the tail) and an ending point (the head, where the arrow is). [4] X Research source The vector is identified by its intersecting axes, the x-axis (usually represented by the mathematical notation i {\\displaystyle i} ) and the y-axis (notated as j {\\displaystyle j} ). Thus, the vector v {\\displaystyle v} may be formulated as v {\\displaystyle v} = ( i , j ) {\\displaystyle (i,j)} . Vectors are used in various arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Vectors are also sometimes called Euclidean vectors, geometric vectors, or spatial vectors."

      "content": "The magnitude is the length or size of the vector. A vector’s magnitude, also called its norm, denotes its length on an x-axis (or the vertical line on the graph on which the vector appears), giving it numeric value. The magnitude on summarizes the length of the vector on the x-axis, y-axis (the horizontal line), and z-axis. Magnitude is denoted as 2 vertical lines, one on each side of the vector: | v | {\\displaystyle |v|} . To calculate the magnitude of a given vector with the direction of the x-axis, y-axis, or z-axis, follow the Pythagorean Theorem : add the squares of the vector’s direction ratios. Then, calculate the square root of that sum. [6] X Research source The magnitude of i ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {i}}} would be | i | {\\displaystyle |i|} , the magnitude of j ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {j}}} would be | j | {\\displaystyle |j|} , and the magnitude of k ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {k}}} would be | k | {\\displaystyle |k|} . To find the magnitude of vector A {\\displaystyle A} , where A {\\displaystyle A} = a i + b j + c k {\\displaystyle ai+bj+ck} (and where i {\\displaystyle i} , j {\\displaystyle j} , and k {\\displaystyle k} represent the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively), use the following equation: | A | {\\displaystyle |A|} = √ ( a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ) {\\displaystyle (a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2})} . For example, if a = 1 {\\displaystyle a=1} and b = 2 {\\displaystyle b=2} and c = 3 {\\displaystyle c=3} , then A = 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 {\\displaystyle A=1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}} , and | A | {\\displaystyle |A|} = √ ( 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 ) {\\displaystyle (1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2})} = √ 9 {\\displaystyle 9} = 3 {\\displaystyle 3} .
