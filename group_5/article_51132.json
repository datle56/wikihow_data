Then, insert the cornhole bags you wish to break in inside. Let them soak in the still water for around 2 hours.

[5] X Research source There are lots of different “bag relaxing” serums that can be purchased online. Brands like “Sac Relax” and “Toss Sauce” are used by most cornhole players, but see which one is right for you!"
