During mating season, male peacocks fan out their bright feathers to create a flamboyant display as they strut in front of their potential mates.

      "content": "Masculinity Most people associate peacocks with eye-catching blue and green feathers, but only male peacocks look like this. Female peacocks are rather plain-looking in comparison since their plumage tends to be gray, tan, brown, and cream. The popular image of the peacock, along with their elaborate mating rituals, have long been connected to ideas of masculinity. Over time, the word \"peacock\" also became a verb that describes the behavior of men who are proud of their appearance, style themselves to get attention, and strut around vainly. For example, \"He peacocked in front of the crowd in his attention-grabbing outfit.\""
