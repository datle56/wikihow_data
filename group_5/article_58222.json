      "content": "Fill 2/3 of a plastic container with cold water. Turn on your faucet and make sure your water is cool. Place a plastic container under the faucet until it is about ⅔ of the way full. Then, turn off your water. [1] X Research source Eggs peel easily when they are cold because the whites of the eggs constrict away from the shell."

      "title": "Place your eggs in the water so they are totally submerged.",
      "content": "Place your eggs in the water so they are totally submerged. After you boil your eggs and let them cool for about 30 minutes - 1 hour, you can store them in water so the shell easily peels off. You can fill your plastic container up with your eggs, or grab another if you have too many eggs for 1 container. No need to put a lid on the eggs! They will cool fine without a lid. [2] X Research source You can pour out some of water if it is close to overflowing."

      "title": "Store your eggs in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.",
      "content": "Store your eggs in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. The cool temperature of the refrigerator will chill your water, making it easy to peel even difficult eggs. They should easily peel off after about 1 hour. You can leave them in your fridge for up to 3-4 days. [3] X Research source Storing eggs in cold water helps the egg separate from the shell, so you can easily peel it away."

      "title": "Peel your eggs",
      "content": "Peel your eggs using your hands and remove the shell entirely. After your eggs sit in cold water for a bit, take them out of the fridge and pour out the water from your container. Tap the egg with a spoon or on your counter to break the shell, and chip away the pieces using your fingers. [4] X Research source Once you peel off some of the shell, you can easily remove the remaining layer."

      "title": "Turn on your faucet and let cold water run for about 15 seconds.",
      "content": "Turn on your faucet and let cold water run for about 15 seconds. Putting your eggs in the cold constrict the whites of the eggs, making it easier to remove the shell. To use the cold water, let your water run for a few seconds so the temperature can adjust. [5] X Research source Your water does not have to be ice cold, but the colder the water, the easier it may be to peel away the shell. It is helpful to wash any dishes in your sink and wipe your sink with a soapy sponge."

      "title": "Hold your egg under running water for 5-15 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold your egg under running water for 5-15 seconds. Cup your hand around your hard-boiled egg, and place it under the running water. Let the water run over your egg for 5-15 seconds or so. [6] X Research source You can leave it under the running water for more or less time if you’d like. Holding it under the water helps the egg adjust to the new temperature."

      "title": "Tap the bottom of your egg 1-3 times on your sink to start your peel.",
      "content": "Tap the bottom of your egg 1-3 times on your sink to start your peel. After your egg soaks under the running water for a few seconds, tap it a few times on your sink. It is best to tap your egg at the bottom for best results. This breaks the shell so you can easily peel it away. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you can tap it on the side of your faucet instead. Take it out from under the water, and tap the bottom of your egg on the top of your faucet."

    {
      "title": "Peel the egg starting from the bottom.",
      "content": "Peel the egg starting from the bottom. The base of the egg is slightly wider than the tip, and it is easier to peel since there is more surface area. Remove the shell where you made your dents, and pull back on the shell using your finger. Do this as running water pours on your egg. [8] X Research source Since the shell should easily slip off in the water, you should be able to easily peel even difficult hard boiled eggs."

      "content": "Collect the shells and dispose of them in your compost bin or trash can. Turn off your water, and place your egg on a plate or in a bowl. Then, scoop up the eggshell pieces from your sink. Eggshells make great compost, so toss them in your bin! If you don’t have a compost bin, you can simply throw them in the trash. It is best to use a collector at the bottom of your sink so the shells do not go down your drain. If you have a garbage disposal, you can turn it on to get rid of any shells that fall down your drain."

      "content": "Boil your eggs in 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) vinegar and 1 tsp (4.9 mL) salt. Use medium heat to bring your water to a boil, and pour in your vinegar and salt. You can pour in your ingredients when the water starts to bubble. [9] X Research source These ingredients help separate the shell from the egg so you can easily remove them, even from difficult eggs."

      "title": "Try adding baking soda to your boiling water if you don't have vinegar.",
      "content": "Try adding baking soda to your boiling water if you don't have vinegar. Rather than using vinegar and salt, you can also use baking soda to make it easier to peel your eggs. Fill your pot up with about 1 quart (0.95 L) of water, and add 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of baking soda once the water starts to boil. [10] X Research source The baking soda gets absorbed into your eggs, loosening the bond between the egg white and membrane of the shell."

      "title": "Pierce your egg with a pin before you boil it so it is easier to peel.",
      "content": "Pierce your egg with a pin before you boil it so it is easier to peel. Before you boil your eggs, poke a hole in them so more water can absorb into the egg, making them easier to peel. You can use a push pin or a sewing pin to make your holes. Hold your egg in 1 hand, and insert your pin with gentle pressure to pierce through the shell. Then, gently place them inside your boiling water. [11] X Research source Extra water in your eggs helps separate the egg white from the shell membrane. Poke your hole with care to prevent shattering the eggshell."

      "title": "Run the eggs under cool water to prevent them from overcooking.",
      "content": "Run the eggs under cool water to prevent them from overcooking. Eggs can continue cooking even after you remove them from the heat. To stop their cooking, place them in cold water immediately after you boil your eggs . If you overcook your egg, the egg will start to expand from excess water, making it more difficult to remove the shell. Alternatively, fill a bowl with ice and place your eggs inside the bowl. Then, place the bowl inside the refrigerator for at least 1 hour."
