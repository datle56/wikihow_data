      "content": "Cutting back on washing your hair prevents dryness and frizz. Washing your hair with shampoo every day strips away its natural oils, which can lead to frizzy, poofy hair. If you’re a guy who’s washing your hair every day, try cutting back to once every 2 or 3 days. If your hair feels way too greasy after you’ve cut back on washing it, try using a dry shampoo ."

      "content": "Well-moisturized hair starts with the right products in the shower. A hydrating shampoo and conditioner , especially one made for curly hair, can lead to quick results. A lot of guys tend to skip a separate conditioner step, instead just using shampoo or a combined shampoo and conditioner project, but you shouldn’t. Be sure to apply conditioner immediately after each time you shampoo.

      "content": "Cold water at the end of your shower helps smooth hair texture. While this doesn’t mean you have to start taking cold showers, after shampooing your hair with warm water, try using cold water during the conditioning phase. Rinsing your hair with cold water closes up your hair’s cuticle (the outermost layer of your hair), leading to a stronger, shinier, and less frizzy appearance.

      "content": "A simple t-shirt removes excess water without breakage or frizz. Drying your hair with a regular towel creates a lot of friction, which is one of the major culprits when it comes to poofy hair. An old t-shirt is a much more gentle alternative, especially if you use it to simply mop up excess water from your hair—try not to rub it harshly on your scalp. Instead of a t-shirt, you can also use a soft microfiber towel ."

Although deep conditioning can keep your hair in good condition, there’s nothing that can be done about seriously damaged hair other than cutting it off. Visit a barber every few weeks to trim your split ends. [7] X Research source With a little bit of practice, you can even trim your own split ends , which can save you a trip to your barber. Your barber can also use thinning shears to remove any areas of your hair that jut out or feel too full."

Keratin treatments have become extremely popular, including among guys. Although they’re commonly thought of as being for straightening hair, they’re actually used to deal with frizz. After getting a hair treatment, be sure to use any shampoos or other products that your stylist recommends. This will help your treatment last much longer."
