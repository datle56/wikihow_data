Just keep in mind that it's not necessarily definitive proof that you still own the house. As long as there's no one challenging your ownership of the property, purchase contracts are typically enough to prove ownership. It's better if you can combine them with other documents, such as receipts for property tax payments or a homeowner's insurance policy."

      "content": "Property tax receipts You don't have to be the record owner of a piece of real estate to pay the property taxes on it—but in practice, most people aren't going to pay taxes on a property they don't own. If you've been paying property taxes regularly for the same house for several years, that can definitely be evidence that you own the property. [3] X Research source The best part about this is that if you don't have your own records, they'll have records at your county tax assessor's office. Those records typically list the name of the person making the payment, so as long as you were the one paying your property taxes, you're all good! If your property taxes were paid through your mortgage company, a combination of mortgage records and property tax records should do the trick to show your ownership."

      "content": "Mortgage payment records As with property taxes, it's highly unlikely that someone would be making mortgage payments on a house that wasn't theirs, which makes this a pretty convincing way to prove you own a property. And even if you've lost your personal records of mortgage payments, you can guarantee that the mortgage company still has them. If the mortgage is in your name, that provides even additional proof of ownership because the lender would have done due diligence to determine that you were the rightful owner of the property before issuing the mortgage."

You might need to come to court as a witness, but you're usually not expected to show up since you can prove ownership through documentation.

[11] X Research source As strange as it may sound, if people live in a house for an extended period of time, they may acquire the same rights as tenants—even if they entered illegally and have never paid you any rent. This gives them some rights to occupy the property until you can get a court order throwing them out. There are plenty of free forms you can find online to use for eviction. Just make sure the form you use is valid in your area. The best thing to do is check on the website of the court where you plan to file for eviction."

Once you've gone through the time-consuming and stressful process of evicting squatters, make sure it doesn't happen again. If you own vacant property or unoccupied homes, check them regularly to make sure no one has set up residence. The sooner you have them removed, the easier the process will be. If you catch a squatter quickly, you can often have the police remove them as trespassers without having to go through the whole court process. You might also make the property less attractive to potential squatters. Keep weeds and brush clear, install motion-sensitive lights, and place security cameras around entry points. While it is technically possible for squatters to acquire a legal right to live on a property by squatting there, in practice it rarely happens. In most states, squatters have to live in a place continually for at least 15 years. [13] X Research source"
