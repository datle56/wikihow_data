      "title": "Fatuous love is love with passion and commitment but lacking intimacy.",
      "content": "Fatuous love is love with passion and commitment but lacking intimacy. This type of love comes from psychologist Robert Sternberg's triangular theory of love, which states that there are 3 components—intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment—that mix in different combinations to form a total of 8 types of love. Fatuous love is high in passion and commitment, but it lacks intimacy between partners, which often results in a fast-paced relationship where there’s no real emotional bond between the people involved. [1] X Research source Intimacy describes feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness partners feel in a relationship. Passion is the physical and sexual attraction partners feel for one another, and it might manifest as lust. Decision/commitment has a short-term and long-term definition. In the short term, it defines a person’s decision to love their partner. In the long term, it’s the decision to maintain that love for as long as possible."

      "title": "The relationship is very fast-paced.",
      "content": "The relationship is very fast-paced. People who experience fatuous love are often described as getting swept up in the passion of their newfound relationship, which can cause them and their partner to move exceptionally fast through the various stages of their relationship. Since there’s usually little or no intimacy, partners likely don’t feel the need to take things slow for the sake of forming a deeper connection. [2] X Research source For example, people experiencing fatuous love might be quick to move in with each other or get married despite not being together for that long."

      "title": "Partners lack a deeper knowledge of each other.",
      "content": "Partners lack a deeper knowledge of each other. When it comes to fatuous love, partners generally don’t know more than the surface-level details about each other. They may not feel the urge or desire to explore deeper topics that would help establish a more emotional and intimate bond. Instead, they’re more likely to stick to lighter, everyday topics when talking. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, partners may not feel the need to explore topics like each other’s dreams, fears, and values. Instead, they might stick to more familiar topics, such as asking each other how their days were or talking about other people they know."

    {
      "title": "The relationship may be dominated by sexual attraction.",
      "content": "The relationship may be dominated by sexual attraction. Since fatuous love is high in passion, there may be a lot of sexual attraction and lust that fuels the relationship. For some fatuous relationships, sexual attraction may be the foundation of two people’s commitment to one another as opposed to an emotional bond. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When it comes to fatuous love, two people might feel a lot of lust for one another when they first meet and may be quick to establish a romantic relationship based on these initial sparks."

      "title": "Partners often don’t open up to one another.",
      "content": "Partners often don’t open up to one another. Intimacy is all about being open with your partner and exploring your vulnerabilities in order to form a deeper emotional connection. However, since fatuous love is usually lacking in intimacy, partners likely don’t take the time to open up or share their deeper thoughts with one another. [5] X Research source Partners who do experience intimacy often have a deep friendship that lies at the core of their romantic relationship. On the other hand, fatuous partners may simply view one another as someone they’re physically attracted to or someone they like but don’t feel emotionally connected to."

      "title": "The relationship may burn out quickly.",
      "content": "The relationship may burn out quickly. Since relationships built on fatuous love tend to be fast-paced and often lack a deeper emotional connection, it’s not uncommon for some to end quickly. Even though they might be quick to announce their commitment to one another, they may also be just as quick to fall out of love. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It can be hard to get out of a relationship that was built on fatuous love. Someone may find that they don’t enjoy the lack of emotional connection, but the fact that they’ve already committed themselves to their partner can make it hard to leave."
