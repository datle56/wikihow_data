The vacuum should pull the string through the pipe. [2] X Research source . Watch the end where the string is feeding into the pipe to make sure it doesn't get snagged and stop. It is important to be aware of how much string has been pulled in, so you know when to expect the string's exit on the other end. Watch the end where the vacuum is for the appearance of the string. If you don't, a lot of string can be sucked into the bowels of the vacuum cleaner."

      "content": "Once the heavier string / rope has been pulled through the pipe, attach your final wire or cable, and pull this through manually. If needing to pull more than one to three smaller wires, connect wires in such a way that the point of connection to the heavy string is not a single \"clump of wires\" folded over. This will make for a difficult \"pull\" through the conduit. Instead, connect only one wire directly to the string, create one or more loops in this wire 6 - 8 or more inches down the wire from the connection point. Slip any additional wire(s) several inches into the loop, fold over and wrap around the first wire. Repeat this as often as required and wrap electrical tape around the string / rope just above the connection point all the way down just beyond the last wrap of the last wire hooked through the loops. The result should look like the end of a pencil and will pass much easier through the conduit. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a metal or fiberglass fish tape or snake. If the conduit run is long, has several bends, has more than 25% of its area filled with wires, etc., the strength and flexibility offered by a fish tape or snake will make pushing into the conduit much easier. Often times it can be used to pull new wires directly into the pipe - saving time of multiple pulls of increasing strength string / rope. Fiberglass does not conduct electricity and is highly recommended for use instead of metal fish tapes and snakes. [4] X Research source"
