      "content": "Cut your own Birkin Bangs. Cutting your own bangs requires a steady hand and a good pair of hair-cutting shears. If you’re feeling adventurous, cutting your own bangs gives you more control over the final look and makes upkeep easier. Start with clean hair that has been dried flat and straight. Then, section out a triangle-shaped wedge of hair that starts at the spot where the top of your head slopes down to your forehead. Using a comb, part the sides of the bang section down to the outside corner of each eyebrow. [4] X Research source As you cut your bangs , cut the center of the bangs slightly shorter than the outer edges so they fall softly around your brows in a soft A shape. [5] X Research source Slide cut the ends of the bangs to give them direction and remove weight without making them shorter. Slide cutting is when you slightly close and open the shears as you run along the length of a small section of hair. [6] X Research source Blend the sides of the bangs into the rest of your hair by cutting them so they angle down to meet the sides of your hair. To give yourself a little more leeway when cutting your bangs, twist the section of hair and then use a point-cutting technique . If you’re worried about cutting too much, you may want to make an appointment with a professional hairstylist."

Use the round brush and hair dryer to dry the bottom section, rotating the brush so the hair curls under. Then, repeat with the top section. [8] X Research source Use a flat brush to blow dry your hair for bangs with a little less volume. As you dry the sides of your fringe, angle the brush to blend the shorter pieces in with the rest of your hair. [9] X Research source Once your bangs are dry, use the blow dryer and brush to position them evenly over your forehead again, then work a small dab of texturizing paste into the ends for a piece-y look.
