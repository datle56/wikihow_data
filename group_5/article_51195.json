A run is the total length of the steps from the edge of the porch to where the steps end. Stringers are usually 2 x 12-inch (5.1 x 30.5 cm) treated wood boards to which the tread and riser are attached. You can buy pre-cut stringers at most lumber or home improvement stores. The treads are 2 x 6-inch (5.1 x 15.2 cm) treated wood boards that lay parallel to each other to form a single step that is approximately 10.5 inches (26.7 cm) wide. You will attach a riser, a 1 x 8-inch (2.5 X 20.3 cm) board, resembling a toe board, to the back or upright section of the step. Most steps are 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in height."

      "content": "Measure from the bottom of the level to the ground using a 4-foot (1.2 m) level set on the top of the porch. Take the total height and divide it by the height of the riser. This tells you the number of steps you will need. Remember that the riser height averages between 6 and 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) high. As an example, a height of 35 inches (88.9 cm) divided by a 7-inch (17.8 cm) riser will result in 5 equal steps. Don't forget to consider the blocking or apron at the bottom of the stairs to support the stairs."
