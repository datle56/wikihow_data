      "content": "Understand the various parts of the tie. Knowing a quality tie when you spot it, is dependent on knowing what you should look for. The following elements of the tie are things to check: [2] X Research source Look at the lining of the tie. The purpose of the lining is to make tying the tie easier and to prevent it from wrinkling. The lining should be made from 100 percent wool. The more gold bars on the lining, the heavier the lining. Feel and look at the fabric of the tie. If you're after silk (the ideal tie fabric), make sure it is by feeling it. Silk is smooth; other fabrics mimicking silk tend to feel brittle. A quality tie will be made from three pieces of fabric, while a cheaper one will be made from only two. Check for hand rolling: A hand-rolled and hand-stitched hem keeps a much better shape than a machine-made one. Look for the slip stitch . This can be pulled to gather the tie together. This helps to maintain the shape of the tie. Note the bar tack. This is the piece that supplements the slip stitch and keeps the two ends of the tie from separating."

      "content": "Size it up. Pick a tie that hits the top of your belt buckle and measures between 2 ¼ and 4 inches (5.5 cm - 10 cm) wide. For a classic look, choose a width that corresponds to the width of your jacket’s lapel. A tie should not be too loose or too tight; both ends of the spectrum are incredibly uncomfortable, so be sure it fits well around your neck."

      "content": "Take care with weekend wear. The addition of a tie to casual weekend wear is something to be done with discretion. You don't want to dress it up too much as casual shirts aren't supposed to look as if they're about to go to the office or the annual director's dinner. The way around this is to wear a simple, classic tie over casual shirts with a simple but bold pattern. To go really casual, wear a plain T-shirt (or one with a subtle design) with a loose tie."
