      "content": "Remove the shell of the soft boiled eggs. Taking the shell off is the first step to eating or using your soft boiled eggs in recipes. Firmly tap the egg at one of its ends with a teaspoon or bread knife to create a small crack. Then you can peel off the shell carefully either as you eat, or all in one go. Cracking the eggs at the end rather than in the centre will reduce the chance of damaging the egg white. [1] X Research source If there are any small pieces of shell leftover after peeling, you can dunk the whole egg in an ice water bath to get rid of these. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an egg cup if you want to eat the soft boiled egg plain. Place the egg in the egg cup with the larger end facing down. The egg cup will keep your egg steady and upright if you want to take the shell off as you eat, rather than all in one go. You can then use a spoon to eat the egg straight out of the shell. An egg cup is a small cup which holds the egg upright for you to eat. You can buy these from homeware stores or online."

You can keep it simple with buttering the bread and roughly smearing the eggs on top. A popular way for kids to enjoy soft boiled eggs is to make toast soldiers. In an egg cup, crack the top off a soft boiled egg, and then dip strips of thinly sliced toast into the slightly gooey center. Avocado on toast with soft boiled eggs is also a delicious meal. Mash 1 avocado with a salt and pepper to taste until the mixture is smooth. Then, spread the avocado on top of two slices of toast. Place half of a soft boiled egg on each, and enjoy!"

Cut each egg in half first, and then sprinkle or dip each half into different herbs, spices, or seeds. You can also roll whole eggs in seasoning mixes if preferred. [3] X Research source For a chili flavor, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt, a pinch of ground chili, and a pinch of ground white pepper. [4] X Research source For a simple seasoning, mix together 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt with 1/2 tsp (2 g) of finely grated lemon rind. [5] X Research source For a classic savoury taste, combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (18 g) of table salt, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (3 g) of finely chopped fresh chives, and a pinch of ground white pepper.

Don't worry if the yolk spills onto the white, as it will all be caramelized eventually. [7] X Research source To get perfectly halved eggs, you could use fishing wire instead of a knife to slice through them. This is similar to slicing cheese with a wire. [8] X Research source"

Just enough to thinly cover the yolk will do. The sugar is necessary for the eggs to caramelize, and the salt balances out the sweet flavor. [9] X Research source Season one egg half and then caramelize it before seasoning the next. This stops the sugar from dissolving into the eggs, which can happen if it sits there for too long.

The eggs will be done when the yolk starts to bubble up and the sugar caramelizes.

      "content": "Coat the soft boiled eggs in the batter. Place 4 oz (110 g) of plain flour on one plate, 7 oz (200 g) of fresh breadcrumbs on another plate, and 1 raw, beaten egg in a bowl. Cover each boiled egg in flour, then dip it into the beaten egg, and finally coat the egg with the fresh breadcrumbs. If you don't want to deep-fry the eggs straight away, they can be left on a tray in the refrigerator until needed."

      "content": "Deep-fry the battered soft boiled eggs. Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fat fryer to 350°F (180°C), and then deep-fry each egg for around 30 seconds or until it is golden brown. Once finished, remove each egg with a slotted spoon, and drain away the excess oil using a paper towel. If you don't have a deep-fat fryer, you could instead use a stovetop for this step. Use a deep, heavy-based pan with ¾ in (2 cm) of vegetable oil, and bring the pan up to the same temperature as the deep-fat fryer. Never leave the pan unattended, as the hot oil can be very dangerous."
