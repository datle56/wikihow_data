For a simple seasoning, sprinkle 1 teaspoon (5 g) of kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) of ground black pepper, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of dried thyme over the fillets. [5] X Research source If you’re in a hurry or have to prep other items, add the seasoning to the salmon before putting it in the oven. If you’ve got a bit more time, sprinkle the seasoning on after the salmon has cooked for 4-5 minutes. That way, the seasoning can stick better than it can to the fully frozen surface."
