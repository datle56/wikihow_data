      "content": "Midheaven in Leo means your definition of success is influenced by Leo. Your Midheaven sign represents your desired career, accomplishments, and legacy. It always sits at the beginning of your 10th House, which also speaks to your career and public image.

      "title": "An MC in Leo means you also have your Imum Coeli in Aquarius.",
      "content": "An MC in Leo means you also have your Imum Coeli in Aquarius. Imum Coeli represents the lowest point in the sky at the time of your birth—and if your Midheaven is in Leo, that automatically means your Imum Coeli, or IC, is in Aquarius. IC speaks to your roots and childhood, and IC in Aquarius individuals tend to come from childhoods characterized by detachment. They often have to grow up faster than everyone else and may ignore their inner child in favor of logic and rationality as a result. If your IC is Aquarius and MC is Leo, it might be time to start listening to that inner child a little more. Midheaven in Leo possesses a childlike sense of playfulness—so remind yourself that it’s okay to goof off and have a little fun, even if it feels ridiculous at first! IC in Aquarius also tends to have a unique taste in home decor and may move around a lot. They don’t like staying in one place for too long and get bored of routines."

It’s not uncommon to see Leo Midheavens incorporating their creativity and artistry into whatever career they eventually choose. [3] X Research source Midheaven in Leo’s creativity and desire for autonomy often go hand-in-hand, which is why they gravitate toward jobs that give them the freedom to do as they see fit and use their artistic gifts.

      "title": "Dramatic",
      "content": "Dramatic Leo Midheavens have big personalities, and that’s often a very good thing! However, Leo MCs also tend to make a big deal out of things that other Midheaven signs might find relatively insignificant, making them seem a little dramatic to the people around them. Midheaven in Leo doesn’t always mean to be dramatic, either—their unconscious way of commanding attention simply makes them seem a bit showy or over-the-top at times. If you’re a Midheaven in Leo, try being a little more aware of your behavior and how it might come off to other people. For example, try calmly talking things out instead of getting worked up about something. That way, you won’t escalate any drama!"

      "title": "Midheaven in Leo may come off as detached and logical at first.",
      "content": "Midheaven in Leo may come off as detached and logical at first. Because of their IC in Aquarius, Leo Midheavens may approach life with a detached, calculating attitude at first—but the truth is, Leo MCs truly shine when they shed their unemotional mask and let their true passion and positivity show. In other words, self-expression is super important for Midheaven in Leo, and the more they stifle themselves, the less fulfilled they may feel. If you’re a Leo MC, practice being more expressive little by little. It’s okay to show people how warm and enthusiastic you really are! Be yourself and start leading with your heart rather than your head sometimes."

      "title": "Leo Midheavens may struggle to give up control at times.",
      "content": "Leo Midheavens may struggle to give up control at times. Leo MCs are very self-sufficient and prefer to maintain control over whatever they’re working on at the moment. It can be tough for them to accept someone else’s input or direction, especially if they’re already in a position of authority. Midheaven in Leo individuals tend to have such strong convictions that they have a hard time considering someone else’s perspective. If you’re a Leo Midheaven, remember that giving up control here and there is an important part of collaborating with others—which is something everyone has to do sometimes. Work on listening to other people’s ideas and seriously consider them when you’re working on a cooperative project, and be sure to give them credit for their contributions!"

      "title": "Midheaven in Leo may need to learn to accept constructive criticism.",
      "content": "Midheaven in Leo may need to learn to accept constructive criticism. Leo MC’s innate confidence is one of their greatest strengths—but that sense of ego also makes it difficult for them to accept that they might not have all the answers right off the bat! Midheaven in Leo can be a little arrogant from time to time, and as a result, they may ignore constructive criticism, even when it’s totally valid. Leo is a fixed sign, which makes them fairly stubborn and set in their ways. This is also true of Leo Midheavens—another reason why it’s difficult for them to consider other perspectives. If you’re a Leo MC, remember that constructive criticism is not an insult. Someone who offers you advice isn’t trying to make you look wrong or stupid; they want to help your work be the best that it can be, and that’s a good thing! Try to be more receptive to constructive criticism . It’s perfectly okay to disagree with someone else’s opinion, but an outside perspective can also be very helpful and insightful, so try not to dismiss someone without hearing them out first."
