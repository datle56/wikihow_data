      "title": "Complete the initial application.",
      "content": "Complete the initial application. This document is in the form of a basic questionnaire. It will ask for contact information at the start. Then, it progresses on to more detailed questions to verify your eligibility for certification. Your application will be assessed by the local AIP on the basis of the following criteria: financial record and standing; staff qualifications and experience; identification and accessibility of premises; and security and procedures. Do not embellish or lie on a resume. For example, say you have five years of experience when you have only five months of experience. Do not say you went to a school, college, or prestigious high school if you did not go to it. The systems and teams can research and find out the truth. Do not try to bulk up a resume with a bunch of fillers. It's okay if it's a half-page resume if that's all you have at that time. People have short attention spans. So make the content clear."

      "content": "Provide evidence of your regular business operations. Print out documents from your official website showing the hours that you provide services to customers. It's also helpful if you can attach a copy of your agreement to serve as a branch of a larger corporation.

If you are an agency with multiple agents, then you must show that at least 1 of them has met the professional criteria to operate a business in your local area. If you are a solo agent, then you must submit your business license or copies of any other certifications that you've received. These documents serve as proof of qualifications. [2] X Research source For example, training courses can count towards showing a minimal level of experience and training required to become certified, as long as they were offered by the IATA. Scan in and submit copies of any training certifications."

      "content": "Send along proof showing prior travel experience. If you've worked for an IATA accredited agent or airline in the past, then include this information in your resume and application materials. If you can send along a letter from that employer or documentation of employment, then that's even better. [3] X Research source The IATA is particularly interested in experience that shows a prior knowledge of airline operations and ticketing procedures. You could even submit a copy of a prior business card as proof of travel employment experience."

If this happens, get the materials together for them as quickly as possible. In most cases, they are simply trying to fill in gaps from your application timeline. For example, they might ask that you send along a particular financial statement that might have been left out from the prior packet."
