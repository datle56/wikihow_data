To find the area of a regular polygon , all you have to do is follow this simple formula: area = 1/2 x perimeter x apothem.

If the apothem is provided for you and you know that you're working with a regular polygon, then you can use it to find the perimeter. Here's how you do it: [4] X Research source Think of the apothem as being the \"x√3\" side of a 30-60-90 triangle. You can think of it this way because the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles. The apothem cuts one of them in half, creating a triangle with 30-60-90 degree angles. You know that the side across from the 60 degree angle has length = x√3, the side across from the 30 degree angle has length = x, and the side across from the 90 degree angle has length = 2x. If 10√3 represents \"x√3,\" then you can see that x = 10. You know that x = half the length of the bottom side of the triangle. Double it to get the full length. The bottom side of the triangle is 20 units long. There are six of these sides to the hexagon, so multiply 20 x 6 to get 120, the perimeter of the hexagon."
