      "content": "Measure spaghetti, fettuccini, spaghettini, capellini, fedelini, or vermicelli using your hand. Place a bunch of spaghetti between your thumb and forefinger. 1 serving of pasta, or 2 oz. (57 g), will be equivalent to a bunch of pasta between your fingers with a diameter of 7/8 inch (24.26 mm). [2] X Research source This is the diameter of a United States quarter. Two servings = 1.75 inches (4.44 cm); four servings = 3.5 inches (12.7 cm); six servings = 5.25 inches; eight servings = 7 inches. Spaghetti , linguine, and other long pastas can be measured using a pasta measure. A pasta measure is a tool that is available at kitchen supply stores, in pasta-making kits, and online. [3] X Research source You place the long pasta in various loops to measure a serving of the pasta. Some pasta spoons have a hole in the middle; this will measure one serving of long pasta."

      "content": "Measure ribbed lasagna using a food scale or individual pieces. A 2 oz. (57 g) serving of lasagna is approximately 2 pieces of dry lasagna sheets. It is typically best to use about four layers of noodles when making a lasagna . The typical baking dish used to make lasagna is either 8x8 inches or 10x8 inches [4] X Research source . With four layers of lasagna noodles, an 8x8 pan of lasagna will typically feed four people, while a 10x8 pan will usually serve six."

      "content": "Measure egg noodles using measuring cups or a food scale. When measuring egg noodles using measuring cups, 2 oz. (56 g) of egg noodles is approximately 1 1/4 cup of egg noodles and also 1 1/4 cup of cooked noodles. Unlike macaroni pastas, egg noodles measured in measuring cups are typically the same both dry and cooked. Typically, for extra wide egg noodles, a 2 oz. serving equals 1 1/4 cups of dry egg noodles, which will yield approximately 1 1/2 cups of cooked noodles."
