Then search popular hashtags and hashtags for subjects you're interested in. Follow a couple dozen accounts there as well. Follow very popular accounts, like One Direction, Justin Bieber, and Kim Kardashian. This often gains a fair number of followers immediately."

Popular theme pages for Instagram include yoga, cooking, inspirational quotes, restaurants or bars, humor, fashion and pet pictures. Unless you're already super popular, you're not going to attract thousands of followers by only posting selfies. Consider making a tribute page. If you love comic books, pro wrestling, or a particular fictional figure or athlete, it's sometimes common to start a tribute page to your favorites. Instead of posting your own pictures, post pictures of your particular tribute subject from around the web instead."
