      "content": "Dip the brush just enough. Dip your paintbrush approximately halfway into the paint so the paint does not over-saturate the bristles."

      "title": "Start painting.",
      "content": "Start painting. Begin on the left side of the wall if you are right handed; if you are left handed, begin on the right side of the wall. This will allow you to pull the brush at a comfortable angle, which will help you avoid mistakes or paint smears."

      "title": "Hold the brush against the ceiling.",
      "content": "Hold the brush against the ceiling. This is so only the tips of the bristles rest against it without bending. This will hold the handle of the brush closer to the ceiling."

      "content": "Apply the paint evenly. Brush along the ceiling in short strokes, stopping as often as needed to reload the brush with paint."

      "title": "Hold the brush against the ceiling with the handle of the brush below the bristles.",
      "content": "Hold the brush against the ceiling with the handle of the brush below the bristles. This will bend the bristles of the brush so the long fibers of the brush, rather than the tips, are in contact with the ceiling. Applying the brush this way will remove many of the brush marks that can be left behind by a paintbrush, and provide you with a smooth edge."
