      "title": "Assess what is bothering you.",
      "content": "Assess what is bothering you. Are the neighbors simply noisy? Is their property a nuisance or hazard? Have they damaged your property in some way? The level of annoyance should determine how much action you take. For example, the neighbor with an infant who cries at 4 A.M. isn't doing anything bad on purpose. Some things you may not be able to prevent or control. Before taking any official actions, consider how you might solve the problem on your own by talking to your neighbors. However, if your neighbor's behavior puts you at immediate risk, such as a sanitation issue, don't hesitate to speak up."

    {
      "title": "Consider your own behavior and lifestyle.",
      "content": "Consider your own behavior and lifestyle. You may have behaviors or habits that cause issues for your neighbors. If you tend to be noisy or messy, consider quieting down or cleaning up. If you have annoying habits, your neighbors will be less accommodating if you complain about them. Therefore, make sure you are on your best behavior and see if your neighbors follow suit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your other neighbors.",
      "content": "Talk to your other neighbors. You should see if they are having problems or issues with the people you find annoying or that are causing issues for you. If others are having the same problems with the offending neighbors, this justifies your complaint. If more than one person is having the same problem, you can consider talking to the offending neighbors together. There is strength in numbers. If you need to make a formal complaint, you should do this jointly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to the offending neighbors nicely.",
      "content": "Talk to the offending neighbors nicely. Being demanding and mean to your neighbors can cause hard feelings and may tempt them to be more annoying. Instead, use kindness and reason when dealing with them. Be clear about what is bothering you. You just can't say they are bothering you for no reason. Be straightforward, but reasonable. Don't yell or shout at your neighbor as that will just cause the situation to escalate. Be very polite. Do not approach them with a confrontational attitude. [1] X Research source For example, you can say Hi, James. We have been neighbors for a long time. I am so sorry. But last night, I couldn't fall asleep. I know you guys are having a good time. But, you know, I have to get up early in the morning. And I was just wondering if you could, keep the volume down late at night. [2] X Research source If it is someone you are close with, and you think it may jeopardize the relationship, you can take a little box of cookies when you go to talk to them. But it may not be necessary. If your neighbors aren't home often or if you can't get them to agree to sit down and talk, write them a polite letter that states your concerns."

    {
      "title": "Suggest alternatives.",
      "content": "Suggest alternatives. Be creative in thinking of ways to allow the neighbors to do what they do, but in a less annoying manner. For example, if they like to have noisy parties, ask them to end them earlier or have them only on the weekend. If their property is a nuisance with tall weeds, garbage, or clutter, offer to help them clean it up. If they have a pet that is causing a problem, suggest how they can keep the animal on a leash or build a fence. If they have caused damage to your property you can suggest how they can fix it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take matters into your own hands.",
      "content": "Take matters into your own hands. Do what you can to fix the situation, especially if it is something the neighbors can't help or aren't able to fix. For example, if your problem is a crying infant at night, try sound proofing your walls. If pets or kids are coming into your yard, consider building a fence. Try to resolve the situation yourself before lodging a complaint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take notes.",
      "content": "Take notes. Make sure you document every incident involving your complaint. Write down the date, time, and nature of the complaint. For example, noise or disturbances, unkempt property etc. If it is a constant problem you are more likely to get help from your landlord, neighborhood association, or the police. Document any attempts to clear this up with the neighbors. Save any returned calls, emails, or letters that they use to respond to your request. Simply letting your troublesome neighbor know you are making note of their annoying behavior can act as a deterrent from further violations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check your lease, if you rent.",
      "content": "Check your lease, if you rent. There might be rules in it regarding noise, property maintenance, visitors, or pets. If you find your neighbor's behavior is violating terms of the lease in your building, then you can let them know politely they are breaking the lease. If they are breaking established rules set out in a lease, this can give you some leverage if you make a complaint with your landlord. If they aren't violating the lease, you can still try to complain to the landlord."
    },
    {
      "title": "File a complaint with your landlord.",
      "content": "File a complaint with your landlord. Give them documentation about the incident with the offending neighbors and any attempts to get the neighbors to clean up their act. The landlord might not want to hear about minor complaints such as small amounts of noise or things beyond your control, like a crying infant. It your complaint regards a larger issue such as property damage or illegal activity, the landlord or management company will likely want to step in quickly. Make sure you give them evidence you have resolved the issue yourself. Landlords will not want to deal with someone who is a constant complainer."

    {
      "title": "Check local ordinances.",
      "content": "Check local ordinances. There may be local laws regarding noise and disturbance, property maintenance, and pet control. See if your neighbors are violating any of these. If they are, consider making a complaint to a condo association or neighborhood organization. You can also call the police if any of these violations get out of hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go to the authorities.",
      "content": "Go to the authorities. If you feel threatened in any way, you should call the police. The police will respond to complaints about noise or domestic disturbance. You may even save someone's life if you call about a domestic disturbance at a neighbor's property. The police can visit the property to determine if a violation is taking place. For example, if they are violating a noise level ordinance the police can assess that and write a citation. The police can keep your identity anonymous so the neighbors won't know who made the complaint. Make a complaint to your local precinct for less immediate concerns. Use these wisely, as too many complaints will be a nuisance to police and may be a distraction from their job. The police are unlikely to be able to help about something like a dangerous tree limb or overgrown property, so keep your complaints to noise, disturbances, or troublesome behavior.

      "content": "Consider taking your neighbors to court if they have caused you significant financial losses. This can be for many different issues. [4] X Research source One of the most common reasons people take neighbors to court is property damage, vandalism, or property destruction. You can also take a neighbor to court for ordinance violations, property maintenance issues, noise violations and disturbances. Donâ€™t expect any financial reimbursements unless you have lost money due to your neighbors. If your neighbors, for example, have a dangerous tree limb or overgrown property, the court can order them to remedy the issue and/or pay a fine."

      "content": "Consult a lawyer if you have doubts about filing a court case. Your lawyer can give you insight on how to file a suit and what to expect from your complaint. [5] X Research source Provide all details, documentation, and evidence of formal complaint to your attorney. Make sure you tell your attorney about any attempts to remedy the situation outside of court. Provide any documents relevant to these attempts such as voicemails, text messages, letters, etc. If you have suffered property damage or financial losses due to your neighbors, then provide any receipts you have, photos, insurance claims etc."

      "content": "File a court case with your local small claims court. Keep in mind that only cases where smaller amounts of money are requested or complaints about local ordinance violations can be processed by small claims courts. [6] X Research source Most small claims cases have a damages request limit of $5000.00. You will need to fill out an application and provide documentation behind your complaint. Provide receipts or estimates of the damages, and how you arrived at the amount of your requested damages. Provide any other documentation regarding your complaint against your neighbors such as letters, voicemails, text messages, or emails. You can also provide photos of property damage or a poorly kept property. If you have called the police, provide any police reports filed in relation to your suit. Pay the court fee."

      "content": "Understand the process of a small claims court case. There are several stages to a small claims suit. [7] X Research source You will have to file an application and pay a fee, and provide any documentation. The court will have to notify your neighbors or any other defendants of the suit. The court will then schedule the court date, and this may take several weeks. The court case will then take place and the judge or magistrate will make a judgement. If damages are awarded to you, it may take several weeks or even months to start receiving your settlement. You may even receive it in installments."
