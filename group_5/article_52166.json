      "content": "Use a spring bar tool or small screwdriver to remove the pins. Flip the watch face upside down and press the leather straps back so you can see the tiny spring bar pins holding the straps in place. Depending on what kind of pins your watch has, you'll either need to press down on the pin with the spring bar tool to dislodge it or simply unscrew the pin with a small flathead screwdriver. [1] X Research source Put the pins and watch face in a safe place so you won’t lose them. If the band can’t be removed, you can follow the rest of the steps! Just be super careful not to get soap, liquid, or conditioner on the watch face."

      "content": "A simple wipe-down gently removes minor dirt and grime from the strap. Before getting any liquids involved, wipe the front and back of each strap with a dry microfiber cloth to remove grainy debris. Otherwise, the debris may scratch the leather surface when you’re scrubbing it later on. [2] X Research source If your watch is really expensive, you may want to check the manufacturer's website for any special cleaning instructions (just in case)."

      "title": "Use circular motions to wash the strap with the soapy cloth.",
      "content": "Use circular motions to wash the strap with the soapy cloth. Start at one end of the strap, and slowly work your way down to the other end. The circular motions help to gently scrub away the oil and grime on the outside of the leather. [4] X Research source Repeat this process 1-3 times to get rid of tough stains (like sweat stains)."

      "content": "Keep the leather strap detached from the watch face as it dries. Lay the strap on a flat surface to dry. Avoid putting the leather in direct sunlight, though, since this can cause the leather to fade, dry out, or even crack over time. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The conditioner softens, deodorizes, and restores the leather. Use a cloth to rub a pea-sized amount of leather conditioner onto the strap using circular motions. Then, buff away any excess conditioner. Flip the strap over and repeat the process on the other side. [6] X Research source You can also use saddle soap to condition the leather."

      "content": "Let the strap air-dry overnight before reattaching it. Use the spring bar tool or flat head screwdriver to fasten the straps to the watch face. Avoid reattaching the strap or wearing the band while it's damp or wet with conditioner since this can stretch or damage the leather."

      "content": "Wipe down the leather with a soft cloth after each wear. Then, wash it with soap and apply leather conditioner once a week. Regular cleaning and conditioning will extend the life of your strap, keep the leather looking great, and prevent odor buildup.
