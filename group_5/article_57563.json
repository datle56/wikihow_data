For example, if you're making a jewelry box, consider thin pieces of cedar, ash or oak. [1] X Research source It will be easier to make a smaller box with thinner wood. Save larger pieces or boards for bigger boxes. This will also prevent you from having to do too much trimming."

Then, mark the measurements on your boards using a ruler and pencil. If you're building a box for a specific purpose or to hold a certain item, measure the item to ensure it will fit inside your finished box. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut your boards, if not already to size. Use a hand or circular saw to cut the boards according to your measurements. Remember you'll need four boards for the sides, one for the base, and one for your lid. Power tools can make the job easier, but are not necessary. You can easily make your box using a screwdriver, carpenter's square, hand saw, and hammer."

      "content": "Assemble the side pieces using a butt joint. Join the sides together at a right angle using glue between the joints for durability. At this point, it should look like a square with no base or lid attached yet. Next, hammer or drill in finishing nails, wood screws or dowels. [3] X Research source You may want to use clamps to hold the glued sides together while you drill nails or screws into them. [4] X Research source If you're using dowels, drill a hole through the side of one piece into the side of another. Use a wooden dowel to pin the pieces together in an \"L\" shape. After the sides are pinned, cut the dowel flush with the sides. You can even drill at an angle with a drill bit. First, use a smaller bit to act as a guide. Then use a larger bit to make the bigger part of the hole."

Keep the hinge knuckle facing out from the back of your box and drill or hammer to attach it to the side and then the lid. When laying out the hinges, it is important that you square them to the top and to the sides of the case. Otherwise, the door will not close or open correctly. It's helpful to clamp the side and lid together when measuring and installing the hinges. [5] X Research source"

First, take one of the sides that you've already cut a groove into and measure from the top, where the lid will be, to the bottom of the groove you cut. Use the same distance to cut a straight horizontal line across the top of your box front. After this point, you should be able to test sliding the lid into the grooves and over the front if you clamp the sides together."
