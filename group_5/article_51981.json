      "content": "Make sure there's enough space for the tree to fall without hitting anything. Roughly estimate the tree’s total height, then check that there are no buildings, structures, or power lines that your tree could collide with after you cut it down. While you’re at it, make sure that no people, pets, or other obstacles are anywhere in this radius, either. [1] X Research source Postpone your tree-felling plans for another day if the upcoming weather forecast calls for rain or wind. [2] X Research source Play it safe and consult a tree-felling professional for a second opinion if you’re worried about your tree’s location."

      "content": "Safety equipment helps keep you protected as you work with your chainsaw. Always slide into a pair of sturdy, close-toed shoes, like leather boots, so your feet are completely protected. To guard your arms and legs, wear chainsaw chaps or pants, as well as a long-sleeved top. Then, put on a hard hat and some goggles to protect your head and eyes. Wear work gloves and earmuffs or earplugs, too. [3] X Research source Experts suggest using a chainsaw to chop down most trees. An ax will work if you’re handling a really small tree or sapling; otherwise, a chainsaw is your best bet. [4] X Research source A chainsaw with a 16 to 18 in (41 to 46 cm) bar is a good choice for small- or medium-sized trees, while a 20 to 24 in (51 to 61 cm) bar is a better option for bigger trees. Use a larger bar if you’re planning to cut a large tree into firewood, too. In general, only chop down trees that have a smaller diameter than the length of your chainsaw. [5] X Research source For example, you wouldn’t use a 24 in (61 cm) chainsaw to fell a 30 in (76 cm) wide tree."

[6] X Research source Then, double-check that there’s enough space for your tree to safely go down, and make sure the ground is completely flat and level before you get started. [7] X Research source If the ground is uneven, call a professional for help. You don’t want your tree rolling or bouncing after it hits the dirt."

Then, turn yourself 45 degrees to the left—this is your ideal escape path. [10] X Research source Create an escape path that’s at least 15 ft (4.6 m) long, so you can be a safe distance away from the tree as it goes down. [11] X Research source As an extra precaution, plan a second escape route that's 90 degrees to the right of your first escape route. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Create the notch on the side of the tree where you’d like it to fall. Stand to the right of where you’ll be cutting the notch. While holding the chainsaw horizontally, cut into the trunk at a 70-degree angle—this cut will be the first part of your notch. [13] X Research source Continue slicing until you’ve cut about ⅓ of the way into the tree trunk. [14] X Research source Picture this notch as a triangle. The outer tree bark makes up one side of the triangle. During this step, you’ll be creating the long, diagonal edge of your triangle. Always wear your helmet, goggles, gloves, and ear protection before you turn on and use your chainsaw."

      "content": "Make a horizontal cut directly beneath the angled cut. Continue holding the chainsaw horizontally, lining up the chainsaw with the very bottom of the angled cut. Then, cut in a straight line, eventually connecting with the end of the angled cut. At this point, a triangular chunk of wood will fall out of the tree. [15] X Research source With this cut, you’ll create the flat, bottom edge of the triangle. Make this bottom cut no more than 2 ft (61 cm) above the ground. [16] X Research source"

[17] X Research source Before cutting, some people like to hammer felling wedges into the gap. These are small, triangular tools that help you complete your felling cut. Always lock your chainsaw before using any of these wedges."

      "content": "Continue sawing until the tree starts to give way. As a general rule of thumb, stop cutting when about 10% of the total tree trunk is left between your notch and your felling cut. At this point, your tree should start leaning and falling. [18] X Research source Always stand to the right side of the notch as you cut, keeping the chainsaw perpendicular to the tree trunk. If you used any felling wedges, unlock your chainsaw blade before you continue cutting."

Then, run down your escape path so you’re a safe distance away. As you back away, continue watching the tree to make sure it doesn’t tilt or fall in your direction. [19] X Research source"
