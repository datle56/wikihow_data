      "content": "Choose a spot inside or outside that is peaceful and comforting. There’s no right or wrong place to set up your altar. The place you choose just needs to feel good to you, so find somewhere that puts you at ease and feels sacred. That spot might be private, such as in the corner of your bedroom, in a closet, or in your garden. Or, it might be in the center of your home, like your dining room, kitchen, or living room. [1] X Research source An altar is a sacred space that’s used as a focal point for your practice, whether that’s meditating, casting spells, or channeling your energy. You don’t have to have an altar to be a Wiccan , as many Wiccans don’t have one. Paganism is a general name for religions that revere nature. Some Pagans worship many nature-based deities while others believe in a general God and Goddess. Wicca is a subsect of Paganism that follows Pagan traditions. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Select a surface to set your altar items on. Again, there’s no perfect place for your altar, just make sure it’s somewhere convenient for you to access. You might choose a permanent setup on your dresser or nightstand in your room. Or, you might make your altar on a windowsill, your kitchen table, a shelf on a bookcase, a coffee table, a tree stump, or a plastic crate. [3] X Research source Your altar doesn’t have to be permanent, especially if you’re not comfortable with it out in the open. It’s perfectly fine to keep your items tucked in a box and bring them out when you’re practicing. There are a lot of basic tools that Pagans and Wiccans use, so choose a surface that gives you space to spread out and neatly organize your supplies."

      "content": "Face your altar towards the north, south, east, or west. Most Pagans and Wiccans decide to face their altar towards the north, south, east, or west to help focus their energy. So, choose a direction that feels powerful and sacred to you. Lots of Wiccans face their altar to the east, which is where the sun rises. Another popular choice is north, as many rituals tend to start in this direction. [4] X Research source Use a compass to help you identify the direction of your altar. If you’re drawn to a particular element, face your altar towards it. Air represents the east, fire the south, water the west, and earth the north. When you face your altar in the direction you like, you’re really facing the back of your altar towards it. This way, you’re pointed in that direction when you’re at your altar. In Christian churches and masonic temples, it’s traditional to face altars to the east."

Your altar is your space to channel your energy and deepen your spirituality, so there are no set rules on who or what you worship. We’ll share the basic ceremonial tools that lots of Pagans and Wiccans use, but know that this is only a guideline. Just consider your personal spiritual practice and how your altar reflects you and your spirituality. [5] X Research source It’s perfectly fine to wait for your tools to call out to you so they’re meaningful to you, or to get your practice started with a basic altar kit . Only include items on your altar that make you feel good. If there are any items below that you don’t like or don’t feel significant to you, don’t include them. For example, if you like Celtic paganism, set up your altar to worship Celtic deities. If you revere Native American beliefs, use those symbols on your altar."
