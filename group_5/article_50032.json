While you only need 2 people to play 21 Questions , it’s more fun if you have a large group of 4 or more players. The goal of the game is for everyone to answer 21 questions, so choose someone to ask the first question and wait for everyone to respond. Once everyone has answered, move onto the next person. [2] X Research source Before playing, determine questions that are “off-limits,” such as ones about sex and intimacy, past relationships, or family upbringing. Be mindful of your questions and set rules that allow each person to skip a turn. If you think your question might be too serious or make someone feel uncomfortable, it’s best to save it for another occasion, such as a one-on-one conversation with the other person."
