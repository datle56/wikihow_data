      "content": "Some studies show people speak as few as 6,000 words a day. There’s no single concrete answer to this question, although there have been dozens of studies on this topic! On the lower end of the scale, people have been measured to say 6,000-7,000 words daily. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you wrote all of that down, 6,000-7,000 words translates to about 12 single-spaced pages. For most people, that would amount to 20 minutes of speech."

      "content": "Higher-end estimates indicate people say about 16,000 words daily. On the other end of the spectrum, a lot of studies show that people speak around 15,000 to 16,000 words, which is a little more than twice as many words as the lower estimates. When looking at the data as a whole, the higher end estimates seem like they’re probably a little more accurate for younger people. [2] X Research source This would translate to roughly 28 single-spaced pages and it’d take someone roughly an hour to say all of it out loud."

      "title": "The average person says around 150 words per minute.",
      "content": "The average person says around 150 words per minute. While this is unique for everybody and it matters if you’re just having a normal conversation or giving a presentation of some kind, most people say around 150 words a minute when they talk. On the higher end, someone might say up to 180. On the lower end, a slower speaker may say around 120 words. [3] X Research source Want to see how fast you speak? Give Debatrix’s speech calculator a try. Time yourself reading a short speech out loud and then enter the speech in the calculator to see how long it’d take other speakers."

      "content": "Cultural background If you grew up in a packed household in Boston where everyone loved debating hot topics, you’re probably going to speak a lot more often than someone who grew up in rural New Mexico working by themselves outdoors all day. Your ethnic background, family, childhood, and geography all contribute to your propensity for speech. [4] X Research source For example, it’s considered strange in Finland to make casual small talk, and many tourists get the vibe that Finns are quiet and untalkative.

[6] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source Younger people tend to be a little more communicative and expressive than older people, who tend to be a little better at regulating when they talk. Of course, there are always exceptions, but in general you’ll probably talk more if you’re younger. [7] X Research source The same goes for written forms of communication. Younger people are more likely to text or talk on social media."

Everyone has somebody in their life who can talk an ear off like nobody’s business, and everyone knows someone who would rather dunk their head in a bowl of oatmeal than voluntarily spark a convo with a stranger. It’s just natural for some people to speak more often than others.

People tend to talk a lot more often if they’re secure about their knowledge in the topic of discussion or if the topic of discussion is a hobby or passion of theirs. [9] X Research source"

A communications major is probably talking a lot more often than someone attending math lectures, the same way a customer service rep will likely talk a lot more than an accountant.

      "content": "Men and women seem to talk roughly as much as one another. There’s some minor evidence that women say a few more words a day than men, but it’s not a statistically significant difference. [11] X Research source The reality is that men and women seem to talk more or less the same amount as one another, so there’s not much truth in this urban legend. [12] X Research source While most studies show women speak a little more often than men, there are a handful of studies that actually demonstrate the opposite, so it’s hard to say women talk more with any serious authority.
