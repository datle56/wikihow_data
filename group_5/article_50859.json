      "content": "Writing activates more regions in your brain and can boost memory. If you can, use a pen or pencil and a notebook as your main way to take notes in class. It might take a little longer to write them out by hand, but it may actually help you remember the information. [1] X Research source Some classes, especially in college, may require you to bring a laptop to use during the class. But if you don’t need one, try ditching it and taking notes by hand instead."

      "content": "Put away any distractions when you’re in class or studying. Studies show that when people aren’t distracted by their phones or email, they’re more productive and focused. Set your phone on silent and pack it away in your bag. If you’re using your computer in class, close any unrelated tabs and avoid the temptation to check your social media. [2] X Research source Give your teacher your undivided attention. You’ll absorb more of the information and they’ll notice that you’re attentive and focused."

      "content": "Keep everything in its place so you can stay on top of your studies. Organize your assignments and class information by subject. Put all of your materials in binders, notebooks, or folders so they’re kept together. It’s also helpful to periodically reorganize and clean out your backpack or bag to keep everything in order and get rid of things you don’t need anymore.

      "content": "Help yourself stay focused. Whether you’re attending online school or taking virtual classes because of COVID-19, it’s important that you create an area that will help you focus and get your work done. Find a spot in your home that you can use and set up a desk with all of the supplies you’ll need. [4] X Research source Put up some posters or decorations to make the space your own so you’re excited to use it for class.

      "content": "Actively engage and discuss the material with your classmates. If you’re taking an online or virtual class, check out the forum or discussion board where students can post assignments and questions. Participate in the discussions and ask questions if you aren’t sure about something. The more you can engage with the class, the more you’ll learn and the more your teacher will notice. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re unsure about a homework assignment, you can usually post on the forum or discussion board and ask people for help. You can also use the discussion board to put together study groups. Try posting and asking people if they’d like to study as a group. Some online classes may require you to post and respond on the discussion board, so don’t lose points by not participating!"

      "content": "Just by being there you’re already setting yourself up for success. It may seem like a no-brainer, but the truth is, going to class really is one of the most effective things you can do to be a good student. If you don’t miss class, you’ll stay up to speed on all of the new material and you’ll be able to ask questions about things that you aren’t sure of or that you find confusing. You’ll also get in the good graces of your teacher, which may come in handy if you need a deadline extension or help with an assignment. [6] X Research source Try to get to class on time as well and sit somewhere where your teacher can see you. You don’t have to sit in the front row, but avoid hiding in the corner. The simple truth is that if you don’t show up for class, it’s much tougher to get good grades. [7] X Expert Source Alicia Oglesby Professional School Counselor Expert Interview. 29 October 2020."

      "content": "They’ll help you stay on top of the subjects you’re studying. Homework isn’t just a boring thing that you have to do to get a good grade. It’s actually really useful for retaining the knowledge you’re learning in class. It can also help identify any areas where you’re confused or that you’re struggling with. Do all of your homework so you can be as knowledgeable about the subject matter as possible. [8] X Research source Plus, if you’re a student who completes all of their assignments on time, if you ever need an extension or maybe even a small bump in your grade, your teacher may be more willing to help you out. Try to do your assignments as soon as you can. For instance, if a report is due by Monday and you've had three weeks to do it, don't wait until Sunday the night before to get started. Try to work on it daily for a while until you are finished with the report. [9] X Expert Source Alicia Oglesby Professional School Counselor Expert Interview. 29 October 2020."

The key is to find a balance. Use a calendar or planner to make a schedule that includes all of your activities such as work, classes, study time, free time, exercise, or whatever else you want to do. Stay on top of your schedule and you won’t be as stressed out. [11] X Research source Check your class syllabus and add big tests and projects to your calendar so you can keep track of them as well."

      "content": "Block out periods of time dedicated to focusing on studying. “Chunking” is the practice of focusing on specific things for set periods of time. Research suggests that 25-minute chunks are effective for studying and will help you retain the information and recall it later. Schedule times for you to focus specifically on studying. [12] X Research source For example, rather than spending 1 day a week studying for 4 hours, break it down into 25-minute periods over a week. Chunking also makes studying feel more manageable and can keep you from feeling overwhelmed by the information."

      "content": "If you know your stuff, you won’t be as nervous come test day. Stick to a consistent study schedule a few weeks ahead of any upcoming tests or exams. Concentrate your studies on the most significant topics first, then work your way into the smaller details. Try to summarize or outline the information that you learn in class and in your textbooks in your own words to make sure you fully understand it. When it’s time for your test, you’ll be as prepared as you can be. [13] X Research source If you have access to old exams, try studying them to get an idea of what the test looks like. Look for study groups you can join to go over the material with other people if that’s helpful for you."

      "content": "Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Find out if your school offers tutoring services or look online for professional tutors you can hire to help you. Go over the material with your tutor and work with them to retain as much of it as possible. There’s nothing wrong with getting help from a tutor, and it can actually make a really big impact on your grades. [14] X Research source Some schools offer tutoring programs that pair you with older students who are familiar with the material."

      "content": "Give your body the fuel it needs to succeed. If you’re busy studying or you’re feeling stressed out, it’s tempting to reach for easy, tasty foods like junk food or processed snacks. But foods that are rich in sodium, sugar, and saturated fats can actually make your stress worse and may even affect how well you retain the information you study. Instead, stick to a healthy diet that includes lots of veggies and snack on foods that have been shown to improve memory such as yogurt, chocolate, and coffee. [16] X Research source"
