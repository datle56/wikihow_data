      "title": "Slowly remove paper.",
      "content": "Slowly remove paper. To remove paper, grasp it firmly and pull very slowly. If the paper tears, it can spread paper fibers that interfere with printing. Pulling too roughly can also cause injury, as even a powered-off printer may pinch or scrape your fingers. Use tweezers to reach narrow areas. Pull even more slowly when using tweezers, and alternate tugging from the left and right ends of the paper. Whenever possible, pull in the direction the paper would travel through the printer. If there's no way to avoid tearing, grab the paper from both ends of the jam. Try to catch hold of all torn pieces."

      "title": "Remove the print head and try again.",
      "content": "Remove the print head and try again. If the paper is still stuck, follow the instructions for your printer model to remove the print head or the ink cartridges. Gently tug out torn paper scraps, or grasp intact crumpled paper with both hands and pull gently downward. If you don't have your printer manual, search online for \"manual\" and the name of your printer model."

      "title": "Check the output tray.",
      "content": "Check the output tray. On inkjet printers, paper sometimes gets stuck in mechanisms near the output tray. Look into the slot feeding the output tray and gently remove any visible paper. [1] X Research source Some models have a knob that will enlarge this slot, making removal easier."

    {
      "title": "Try further disassembly.",
      "content": "Try further disassembly. If the printer still will not function, you can try taking it all apart to search for paper. Because there are many different models of printer, you should look for specific instructions in your user manual. Search online or contact the printer manufacturer if you do not have a manual. [2] X Research source Many printers have a basic way to remove the back panel and/or the input tray, which are good places to start. Check for movable access panels on the back, and a plastic tab deep inside the input tray."

      "title": "Clean the print heads",
      "content": "Clean the print heads . If you've removed the bulk of the paper but still have printing issues, run a print head cleaning process. This should get rid of paper microfibers clogging the nozzles. Close all access panels and return all trays before you print again."

      "title": "Look for repair or replacement.",
      "content": "Look for repair or replacement. If the printer still won't work, consider contacting a printer repair service. In some cases, buying a new desktop inkjet printer may be the cheaper option."

      "content": "Wait 30 minutes for the printer to cool down. During laser printing, the paper passes between two heated rollers, called the \"fuser.\" [3] X Research source If the paper has jammed in or near the fuser, wait at least thirty minutes for it to cool down. The fuser reaches dangerously high temperatures. Some printer models recommend waiting at least thirty minutes."

      "content": "Pull out the print cartridge if you do not see the paper jam. In a laser printer, one of the front or top covers will usually expose the print cartridge. If you have not yet found the paper, pull out the cartridge carefully. Pull very slowly, to avoid tearing the paper. Continue patiently until the paper is freed. If the paper does not move, move on to the next step. Do not use force. Most just pull out. A few may require disengaging a latch or a pair of latches. [4] X Research source If you can't reach the paper, use wide grip tweezers."

    {
      "title": "Inspect the rollers.",
      "content": "Inspect the rollers. Paper jams often occur as the paper passes between the two rollers. If the rollers turn easily when touched, rotate them slowly until the paper is free. If the jamming is complex, with multiple folds or tears, look for the mechanism attaching the roller to the rest of the printer. Carefully remove one roller and lift it out of the printer, freeing the paper. [5] X Research source It's best to follow user manual instructions. Do not try to force the mechanism. Many models use rollers attached with a \"hole and pin\" latch. Push down on the pin to release the roller."

      "title": "Restart the printer.",
      "content": "Restart the printer. Turn off the printer and let it finish its shutdown process. Wait a few moments, then turn it back on again. Sometimes a printer will clear the jam itself during its start-up cycle. Resetting a printer can get it to recheck the paper path and stop detecting a jam that is no longer there."

If a panel won't open with gentle pressure, look for a release latch or consult the manual. Warning: Do not reach into the printer while it is still on. This can cause serious injury. Some drawer-style trays can be fully removed. Look for a release catch. It may help to use a mirror when checking trays and panels in the back. If possible, have the printer moved away from the wall to allow for more access."

      "content": "Locate the feed rollers. Shine a flashlight into the inner workings, near the input tray. You should see a long cylindrical rubber object, or a rod with small rubber objects attached to it. These rubber parts are the rollers that feed the paper into the machine. If you do not see the rollers, try turning the paper upside down, or opening a back or side panel. You may need to check the manual to figure out how to remove these panels. If your roller is clearly broken, that's the source of your problem. Refer to your printer manual or contact the manufacturer to find out whether your roller is replaceable."

      "title": "Check the feed rollers for debris.",
      "content": "Check the feed rollers for debris. If your printer displays a \"paper jam\" error message when there's no paper stuck inside, there's probably some other blockage. Inspect the length of this roller for objects that have fallen into the printer. Remove these with tweezers or by turning the printer upside down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a cloth and cleaning liquid.",
      "content": "Choose a cloth and cleaning liquid. Dust and stuck debris on the rollers can cause a paper jam error. [8] X Research source Cleaning can help, but the type of cleaning supplies you need depends on your printer type: Laser printers contain toner particles that can irritate lungs. Wear a mask that filters fine particles, and buy a special toner cloth that picks up most of these particles. Moisten it with 99% isopropyl alcohol. (Some rollers crack when exposed to alcohol. You may want to check your printer manual for advice, or use distilled water instead.) Inkjets printers are easier to clean. Use any lint-free cloth (such as microfiber) and moisten it slightly with isopropyl alcohol, or distilled water if you don't want to risk damage. For extremely dirty feed rollers, use a special rubber rejuvenator product. Read all safety instructions first. These products can cause serious skin and eye damage, and corrode plastic parts of the printer."

      "title": "Clean the rollers",
      "content": "Clean the rollers . Swab the feed rollers with your slightly damp cloth. If your rollers don't rotate, snap out the clips holding them in and remove them so you can clean every side. [9] X Research source Toner cloth tears easily. Move slowly to avoid leaving shreds behind that can clog your printer."

    {
      "title": "Check other parts for debris.",
      "content": "Check other parts for debris. Jams can also happen at other parts of the printer. Remove the printer tray and any other removable covers. All laser printers and some inkjets have a second pair of rollers near the output tray. A paper jam error could mean an object has fallen against these. Warning: The \"output rollers\" on the laser printers get hot enough to cause burns. These are actually \"fusers\" which bake the ink onto the paper. Warning: These rollers are close to delicate machinery, and on laser printers they require special treatment. It's best to refer to your printer manual for precise cleaning instructions."
