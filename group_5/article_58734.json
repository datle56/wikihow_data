      "content": "It’s theorized that Disney employees control who pulls out the sword. While no one knows for sure how the magical sword of Excalibur, located in Fantasyland at Disney World and Disneyland, is controlled, it’s theorized to be held in place by an electromagnet. Cast members are thought to have some kind of device that can disengage the sword when they discover someone trying to remove the sword who they deem worthy—it could be you! [1] X Research source While you may think pulling the sword from the stone comes down to strength, it’s really a matter of luck. The sword can be accessed by anyone at any time during park hours. Just be sure to have patience and wait your turn, as it’s become a popular hidden gem."

      "content": "Pull the sword up from the crossguard. Increase your chances of pulling up this magical sword by getting a good grip on the crossguard (t-shape hold) with both hands at the sword's base. Don’t forget to firmly plant your feet on the ground and bend your knees to really lift that bad boy up! While it ultimately comes down to luck, using all your might to lift can’t hurt. Keep in mind that the sword will only lift around 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) if you’re considered worthy. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to fully remove the sword or keep it as a souvenir—hey, at least you can keep the happy memories! Fun Fact: The Sword in the Stone monument was temporarily removed from the park when a super strong man ripped the sword straight out of the stone and broke it! Don’t worry, it’s back now."

      "content": "Attend the Royal Majesty Makers show. Around once a day, the Royal Majesty Makers (group of “The Sword in the Stone” specific cast members) or a single cast member dressed as Merlin will show up to the stone to act out a fun skit or invite people to test their worth. It’s theorized that participating in the show may increase your odds of pulling up the sword, as they typically choose 1 worthy person per show. [2] X Research source You may not be as lucky if you try to lift the sword when no cast members are around to watch. No matter who you are, you’re allowed a shot at pulling the sword from the stone. That said, cast members may favor younger guests pulling up the sword, as it’s an extra-magical experience for the little ones!"

You never know who might be controlling the sword, so try to politely interact with any cast members hanging around the area near King Arthur Carousel at Disney World, or Prince Charming’s Regal Carousel at Disneyland, located by \"The Sword in the Stone\" attraction. You might ask a cast member if they have any tricks on what it takes to pull the sword up—they might just give you a helpful hint or disengage the sword from the stone when you go to try! [3] X Research source If you pull up the sword, you get nothing besides an awesome memory and picture opportunity. Some people theorize that a light in the castle window near \"The Sword in the Stone\" attraction indicates when someone can pull the sword out. The sword can’t be released when it's red, but you might just get lucky when it's green."

Where many big and burly men tried to lift the sword from the stone in hopes of becoming the heir to England’s throne, young Arthur alone, pure of heart and mind, lifted it, becoming the King of England.
