To maximize your chances of your debit card working with Zelle , get a prepaid debit card in the Visa or Mastercard network. Also make sure to get a debit card that associates your phone number or email address with the card. As Zelle uses your phone number and/or email address to identify you, having one of these identifiers connected to your card is important. As you will also need to provide a billing address, get a prepaid debit card that asks for this information as well."
