      "title": "Review the different parts of the table.",
      "content": "Review the different parts of the table. A game of table football looks like a mini soccer field, with 8 rods going across the field. These are labeled based on the number of mini “players” on each rod. Each side has 2 offensive rods, known as a 5-rod and a 3-rod , along with 2 defensive rods, known as the 2-rod and goalie-rod . Along the sides of the table, look for the serving hole where the ball goes into the field to start the game. [1] X Research source Once the ball enters a goal, it rolls into the table’s cabinet. Look for slots or openings along the sides of the table where you can find and reuse the scored balls."

      "title": "Play 1-v-1 or split into teams.",
      "content": "Play 1-v-1 or split into teams. You control all 4 of your team’s rods if you play by yourself, or you can divide them between 2 players. In this format, one player will control the offensive 3-rod and 5-rod, while the other player will control the defensive 2-rod and goalie-rod. You can also divide up the rods between 3 or 4 people if you have more people who want to join in. [2] X Research source When you play with multiple people, you only control your assigned rod and no switching is allowed during the game. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Push the ball through the serving hole to start the game.",
      "content": "Push the ball through the serving hole to start the game. Block off the serving hole with your left hand, then slide the ball into the hole. Lift your left hand away from the covering and move it to the handle of the 5-rod offensive pole. Push the ball through the hole, and try to spin the hand holding the ball so the ball lands on your side of the table. [4] X Research source Flip a coin to decide who gets to serve first."

    {
      "title": "Hit the ball within 10-15 seconds of touching it with a player.",
      "content": "Hit the ball within 10-15 seconds of touching it with a player. Turn the rod handles to hit the ball toward your opponent’s goal using the players on the field. Keep a mental clock going in your head as you play the game. Count down from 10 as soon as a player on the 5-rod receives the ball. If your 3-rod, 2-rod, or goalie rod gets the ball, then you have 15 seconds to make a play. [5] X Research source If you don’t play the ball within 10 seconds, the play is reset and your opponent gets to serve."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reset the ball when it’s “dead.”",
      "content": "Reset the ball when it’s “dead.” A ball is considered dead if it flies off the table or stops moving in a spot where a player can’t reach it. When it goes off the table, place the ball near the server’s 2-rod so they can restart the game. If the ball rolls into a dead zone near the goalie, move it to the nearest corner. If the ball becomes dead on another part of the table, you can place the ball in front of the original server for the round. [6] X Research source The ball goes to the opponent of whoever kicked the ball off the table or forced it into a dead zone. If the ball is spinning, it isn’t dead. Wait for it to stop moving completely."

      "title": "Score 5 goals before your opponent to win.",
      "content": "Score 5 goals before your opponent to win. Table football is very similar to a real game of football, or soccer. Use both hands to maneuver the rods and control your “players,” which kick and pass the ball along the table. Like in a real game of football, try to kick the ball past the goalie and score a point for your team. Once you score 5 goals, you’ve won the game! [7] X Research source You can set your own custom game terms, too. If you’re playing a quick match, the first person to 1-2 goals can be the winner. For a longer game, play up until someone scores 10 points."

    {
      "title": "Switch sides after each game if you’re playing multiple games.",
      "content": "Switch sides after each game if you’re playing multiple games. Play through your first game of foosball until 1 team scores 5 points. At this point, switch sides so that you’re using the bars and players on the opposite side of the table. You have 60 seconds to make the switch, or else you’ll be penalized for slowing the game down. [8] X Research source You can penalize someone by letting the other team serve first, or by choosing another similar punishment. After a team wins their third game, they win the full match!"

      "title": "Wrap your hand around the handle without your thumb and fingers touching.",
      "content": "Wrap your hand around the handle without your thumb and fingers touching. Try not to squeeze or grip the handle too much—instead, wrap your hand around gently, with your palm on top of the handle and your thumb and fingers on opposite sides of one another. Grip the handles so you can make sturdy, stable plays. [9] X Research source Try to keep your thumb on the side or bottom of the handle, or else you won’t have a lot of control over your swings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Space out your playing rods so you can make clearer shots.",
      "content": "Space out your playing rods so you can make clearer shots. Keep your 2 offensive playing rods spaced out, leaving an ample gap for passing and serving the ball successfully. Keep your players lined up so you can pass the ball between them cleanly and neatly, which lets you make more effective shots on the goal. [10] X Research source Try to stagger your offensive players so they’re spaced between your opponent’s defensive players."

    {
      "title": "Pass the ball forward to your 3-rod row of players.",
      "content": "Pass the ball forward to your 3-rod row of players. Secure the ball beneath a player on your 5-rod pole after your serve. Rotate the pole so the player’s foot is at a 90-degree angle behind the ball. Move the player forward to “kick” the ball, but continue to swing the player upwards to follow through with the kick. With your 3-rod row, “receive” the pass by holding your 3-rod player at a 30- to 45-degree angle behind the ball. [11] X Research source Similar to real football or soccer, passing is a valuable strategy that can help you keep the ball moving to a better position."

    {
      "title": "Try an open-handed grip when making offensive shots.",
      "content": "Try an open-handed grip when making offensive shots. Loosen your grip, but leave the bottom of your palm and the top of your wrist touching the handle. Slide your wrist and hand up to create a powerful offensive kick. Try to flick your wrist as you do this, so your movements can be as fluid as possible. Avoid spinning the rod in a full circle because it’s considered illegal in most foosball games."

    {
      "title": "Block your opponent’s plays with your 2 defensive rods.",
      "content": "Block your opponent’s plays with your 2 defensive rods. Slide and rotate the 2 rods that are closest to your goal to help you block and defend your goal. Keep an eye on the ball and slide your defenders and goalie accordingly so the ball stays away from your goal. [12] X Research source While the goalie and defending rods can be used to score, they’re usually used to defend and clear out the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stagger your defensive rods to block the ball more effectively.",
      "content": "Stagger your defensive rods to block the ball more effectively. Slide your 2 defensive rods so the goalie and one of your defenders are shoulder-to-shoulder. Keep these players close together so your opponent doesn’t have as many clear opportunities to shoot on your goal. [13] X Research source The ball shouldn’t be able to pass through your goalie or your defender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clear the ball from your goal with one of your defensive rods.",
      "content": "Clear the ball from your goal with one of your defensive rods. Put a lot of power into your “kick” when the ball ends up in your defensive area. Pause the ball with your player before passing or kicking it forward. If you send a rolling ball towards your opponent, you may give them a free shot on your goal. The main focus of clearing the ball is keeping your goal safe, not scoring points."
    },
    {
      "title": "Deflect bad shots from your opponent into their goal.",
      "content": "Deflect bad shots from your opponent into their goal. Keep your eyes peeled for weak shots leveled by your opponent, which leaves the ball rolling toward your players. Take these opportunities to kick the ball with your own players. Depending on the set-up, you may be able to turn your opponent’s bad play into an unlikely goal!"
