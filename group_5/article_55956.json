      "title": "An IF receiver (RX) is an optical sensor that detects a signal from the IR transmitter (TX) on your remote.",
      "content": "An IF receiver (RX) is an optical sensor that detects a signal from the IR transmitter (TX) on your remote. Look for the receiver on the front face of the TV or device. Most often, the IR receiver is discretely placed along the top or bottom edge of the screen and covered by a red or gray film or plastic lens. Use a flashlight to better locate the receiver lenses. Sometimes they are so small and placed within the protective edge of LCD screens or the covers color match and are flushed in with the surface."

      "content": "Replace remote batteries with a fresh set every 3 - 4 months. When batteries weaken, signal can suffer. Never mix different batteries or new with used. Alkaline batteries may be too strong for a remote control even though they are rated with same voltage."
