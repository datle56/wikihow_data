      "title": "Fold it in half again.",
      "content": "Fold it in half again. You will have a square, roughly 6\" wide, that is 4 layers thick. The thickness will help keep the pipe from overheating and also make it strong enough so that it isn't crumpled the first time it's used."

      "title": "Create a cone.",
      "content": "Create a cone. Roll the square into a tube that is slightly flared at one end (like a very narrow cone). [2] X Research source The narrow end will be the end you will smoke from. If you want to, use a pencil or barrel of a pen to roll the foil around at the point. This will keep the tube open and give you a nice round opening to smoke out of."

      "content": "Create the bowl. Using a credit card, make a sharp crease at the 1\" mark and bend the end up to form the bowl. Be careful not to crumple the tube when you do this. Keeping the pencil in the tube can help. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the smokeable material. Insert smoking material of your choice into bowl. You may or may not way to add an aluminum filter before adding in the material. [4] X Research source You can make a quick filter to hold the material in place by taking a very small square, poking hold in it with a needle, and then covering the entrance to the stem of the pipe with it."
