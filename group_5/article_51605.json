      "content": "Give small amounts of water to your puppy. Encourage your puppy to drink water, as it is important to keep it hydrated while it is recovering from an illness.

      "title": "Feed your puppy a bland diet if it is vomiting or having diarrhea.",
      "content": "Feed your puppy a bland diet if it is vomiting or having diarrhea. If your puppy is able to eat, feed it white meat, such as boiled chicken or boiled fish (cod or coley), with white rice. You should give your pet one cup (0.24 liters) of food per 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of weight each day. Continue this bland diet for 1-2 days following the day your puppy first became sick. You can then return your pup to its normal diet if the symptoms cease. [2] X Research source If your puppy refuses to eat, or if it is having severe diarrhea or vomiting, take it to the vet right away. These problems can contribute to low blood sugar and dehydration, which can make your puppy's illness much worse."

      "content": "Call the veterinarian. Look up the number for a local pet doctor either online or in the phone book. Clearly specify what you have observed the puppy's symptoms to be, and express your worries. It's a great plan to choose an animal hospital that's been accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), especially if there is a chance that your puppy may be seriously ill. Sometimes, the veterinarian will know immediately what is wrong with your dog, so they may tell you over the phone to ease your concern. However, sometimes they will not be sure until they check the puppy in person."

Take note of the agreed-upon appointment so that you do not forget. Try to be patient, since although your puppy's sickness is your number-one concern, the doctor may have a full schedule of appointments already.

      "content": "Care for your puppy's overall health. Clean your dog's teeth daily, give it regular baths, and groom it each month so that its hair stays out of its line of vision. Be sure to clip your puppy's toenails to keep the puppy comfortable and prevent accidental scratching. If your puppy begins itching behind its ears more than usual, check the ears for potential pests, such as ticks, that may be hiding there. If you notice redness or unusual discharge inside the ear, take your puppy to the vet to be checked for an ear infection. As a general rule, you should bathe your puppy whenever it becomes noticeably oily, smelly, or dirty. Bathing your puppy every week may dry out and damage its skin and fur, unless you are using a very gentle, high-quality shampoo."
