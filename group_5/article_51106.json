      "content": "Yes, the term “bop” is problematic because it’s usually directed at women. While the term may apply to both men and women, it most often refers to women who are “promiscuous” or have a lot of sexual history. Many TikTok users have pointed out that calling a woman a “bop” is derogatory and misogynistic, and that someone’s sexual history doesn’t lower their value as a potential partner or as a person in general. Since the term is primarily used to shame or mock someone for their sexual history, it’s not okay to use! Calling someone a “bop” online or in person is immature, disrespectful, and cruel."
