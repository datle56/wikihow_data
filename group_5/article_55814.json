      "content": "HWP is an acronym that stands for “height and weight proportional.” In many cases, the person using HWP to write their dating profile is saying they have or want a partner with an average body type who is not overweight or underweight. [1] X Research source What it means to be proportional can be subjective, which can lead to some confusion over exactly what the person using the terms means. Some people may consider HWP to mean people under the Normal Weight category on the Body Mass Index (BMI) chart, which is defined as a BMI score between 18.5 and 24.9. The BMI score is calculated using your height and weight and has been used historically as a general indicator of health. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source However, the BMI has been largely debunked as an inaccurate indicator of health, partly because it doesn’t take into account how much fat or muscle a person has.

      "content": "People often use HWP to say they are searching for a fit partner. Many interpret this to mean that the user is not interested in dating overweight people without coming out and saying it. However, users may be using it to indicate they want a partner who enjoys an active lifestyle with a focus on health (although it’s typically impossible to tell if someone lives an active or healthy lifestyle based on looks alone)."

      "content": "Some people add HWP to their profiles to describe their own appearance. They may also use it while texting on a dating app as a way to convey that they are fit, healthy, and have a Normal BMI. Some users on online forums and social media believe a person using the term to describe themself is attempting to hide their body type by not giving exact measurements, but there’s no evidence to show that this is how people use the term."

      "content": "Different genders may use HWP to mean different things. Some feel that men and women generally use the term differently, with men highlighting athleticism and women communicating confidence in their appearance and signaling that they align with societal beauty standards. This difference in perception about how the term is used may be due to how men and women value attractiveness in a mate, with men statistically placing a higher value on appearance and body type than women.

[5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Women may also be less open to putting specific details about their bodies online because they are more likely to experience body shaming.

      "content": "HWP is used in dating profiles to indicate health and fitness. Whether describing the type of partner they are interested in or their own appearance, most dating app users add HWP to communicate “fit and healthy.” Here are a few examples of how HWP is used on dating apps and personal ads: “Searching for an outgoing HWP individual who takes care of themself and loves staying active.” “Looking for an HWP partner who loves hitting the gym and outdoor activities.” “Active HWP man searching for a like-minded person interested in fun and adventure.” “HWP non-smoker looking for someone who shares my commitment to physical fitness.” Remember, everyone’s body is different, and HWP can mean different things to different people. It’s not possible to determine health, fitness level, or even appearance based on height and weight alone."

      "content": "HWP was originally used in personal ads before online dating became popular. As dating moved online to early websites like Match.com, people still used the abbreviations they were familiar with from print personal ads (which had character limits). Even though there was little to no space limitation for online dating profiles, the abbreviations caught on. People continue to use them on platforms like Bumble, Tinder, and Hinge. Space limitations in print ads made people create abbreviations to get the information across in the smallest amount of space possible. Abbreviations often focused on describing marital status, ethnic group, and gender identity. They also described traits, like marriage-minded (MM), good sense of humor (GSOH), and age (##YO). The use of acronyms in online dating has evolved with the culture. While many of the older abbreviations are still in use, new ones – like ENM (Ethically Mon-Monogamous), NP (Nesting Partner), or NBY (Non-Binary) – are now used to reflect current cultural norms."

      "content": "People have many acronyms to choose from to signal their preferences. These acronyms allow them to quickly give readers key details about who they are and what they’re looking for in a partner. This may help them to get to know someone better when online dating . Here are a few of the most common dating acronyms: DDF: Drug & Disease Free – They don’t use illegal drugs or have sexually transmitted diseases or infections. For example, “DDF NBY looking for NSA,” meaning, “I’m a drug and disease-free non-binary person looking for a no-strings-attached relationship.” ISO: In Search Of – This is usually used to indicate the type of person or relationship they are searching for. For example, “ISO SF for NP,” meaning, “In search of a single female for a nesting partner.” NBM: Never Been Married – This means the person is not married or divorced. For example, “NBM ISO LTR,” meaning, “I’ve never been married, but I’m in search of a long-term commitment.” TDH: Tall, Dark, & Handsome – This is how someone would describe themselves or what they are looking for, usually in a male-presenting partner. For example, “TDH ISO same,” meaning, “I’m tall, dark, and handsome, and I’m looking for someone who is also tall, dark, and handsome.” VGL: Very Good Looking – This is also how a user would describe themselves or what they are looking for, but it could be used to describe any gender identity. “ISO LTR with VGL woman,” meaning, “I’m in search of a long-term relationship with a very good-looking woman.” WTR: Willing To Relocate – This means the person is willing to move to be near someone or wants someone who will move closer to them. For example, “I’m a divorced father ISO LTR with someone WTR,” meaning that they’re interested in a long-term relationship with someone who will ultimately move to be close to them."
