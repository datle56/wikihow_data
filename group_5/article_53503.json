      "content": "Airplane Mode doesn't disable GPS, but it does turn off location sharing online. Airplane Mode only disables radio signals, like cellular, Wi-Fi, and sometimes Bluetooth. These radio signals can interfere with commercial airline sensors. [1] X Research source However, your smartphone, tablet, or laptop does not need to transmit radio signals to use GPS, so Airplane Mode leaves GPS turned on. But because Airplane Mode turns off Wi-Fi and cellular data, your device can't share its location online or with other devices. While your phone, tablet, or laptop can't be tracked by other devices, apps, and websites while you're in Airplane Mode, other apps on your device may still have access to your location. Airplane Mode doesn't make Wi-Fi and Bluetooth unusable on your phone; it just turns them off. You can enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth while you're in Airplane Mode, your phone will leave Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth on the next time you enable Airplane Mode unless you disable it while Airplane Mode is on.
