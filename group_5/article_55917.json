      "content": "Look for pale or clear liquid to identify amniotic fluid. This fluid is typically odorless and very light in color. If your water breaks, you may feel a rush of water, but that's not always true! Sometimes, it's a light trickle. [2] X Research source Your vaginal area may just feel wet or damp. Pay attention to the amount of the discharge so that you can tell your doctor about it."

      "content": "Watch for stringy mucus toward the end of labor, called the mucus plug. This mucus is wedged in the entrance of your uterus while you're pregnant to keep bacteria out. As you get closer to giving birth, usually within a few days or even just hours, your body will naturally push this plug out. [3] X Research source This can be bloody or pink, but it can also be clear."

      "content": "Sniff the fluid to determine if it's urine. During the late stages of pregnancy, the baby can put pressure on your bladder, causing you to leak pee. While a little gross, try sniffing it to see if it seems to be urine. If it doesn't smell like urine, it might be amniotic fluid instead. [4] X Research source It's likely urine if you only get a little fluid when you sneeze or cough."

      "title": "Call your doctor if the fluid is green, brown, or smells bad.",
      "content": "Call your doctor if the fluid is green, brown, or smells bad. If you have liquid coming out that is more green in color, that could point to an infection, particularly if it has a bad smell. It could also indicate meconium, which is in the baby's digestion system. Either sign requires immediate medical attention. [5] X Research source Meconium can be more brownish."

      "content": "Check for blood in the discharge early in the pregnancy. Seeing blood in your discharge is relatively common in pregnancy; however, itâ€™s always best to see a doctor right away to be safe. If your amniotic sac has ruptured, then you will likely see blood if you're still in your first trimester. If it's not, it could just be vaginal discharge, which does increase during pregnancy for some people.

Your doctor or midwife will measure your belly to check your baby's growth. If it's low, they may recommend you get an ultrasound.

      "content": "Pay attention to clear or pale liquid flowing from your vagina. Sometimes, a small leak may cause the issue of low amniotic fluid. However, this symptom is relatively rare. The liquid will be clear and mostly odorless, and the flow can be at random intervals or constant. [8] X Research source If it's just when you sneeze or cough, it's more likely to be urine. However, it doesn't hurt to get checked out by your doctor."

      "content": "Ask for an ultrasound if you're concerned. With an ultrasound, the medical professional can measure pockets of fluid in your uterus. They can then determine if it's below what it should be. [9] X Research source The most reliable method is to measure the largest pocket, which should be above 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) at the end of the second trimester."

Typically, you might feel around 10 kicks in an hour, but not every baby is the same. The key is to notice if the movement suddenly drops off or goes completely absent. If it does, you need to go to the emergency room or contact your doctor immediately.
