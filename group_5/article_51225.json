      "content": "Cut the boards to match the outline. This project used a miter saw with a laser site. However, these cuts could be made with a table, circular or handsaw. At this point, unless you are an expert woodworker, you will notice that the length of the sides doesn't match the drawing exactly. Don't worry, this isn't critical."
