      "title": "He’s closed off from you.",
      "content": "He’s closed off from you. Being private isn’t a bad thing, but a change in your husband’s privacy habits could mean a switch in his feelings. If he used to be an open book but now he’s much more private and closed off, it might mean that he’s falling out of love with you. [1] X Research source Other signs to look for include: Making decisions without talking to you first. Not talking about how he’s feeling. Not seeking your support or advice anymore. Confiding in friends or coworkers instead of you."

      "title": "He’s not affectionate with you anymore.",
      "content": "He’s not affectionate with you anymore. If your husband used to be very affectionate (holding your hand, giving you kisses, or hugging you) and he suddenly changes, it could mean that he’s falling out of love with you. A change in his habits could mean that something is up or that he’s struggling with his feelings. [2] X Research source Watch for other similar signs, like: Not saying “I love you” anymore. Not doing any romantic gestures toward you anymore. Not initiating sex anymore. Going through the motions of sex without enjoying it. Not sitting or standing close to you anymore.

      "title": "He spends a lot of time alone or apart from you.",
      "content": "He spends a lot of time alone or apart from you. It’s totally normal to need your alone time. But when your husband makes it a point to get out of the house or spend time apart from you, it could mean he’s making excuses to be on his own. If he needs more alone time, it might mean he’s struggling with his feelings for you. [3] X Research source This can result in things like: Working late or working more often without complaint. Engaging more in his hobbies that take him outside the house. Making plans with friends and specifying that you aren't invited. Not checking in with you before making plans. Being too busy to take you out on dates or spend alone time together."

    {
      "title": "He doesn’t put effort into the relationship anymore.",
      "content": "He doesn’t put effort into the relationship anymore. All relationships take work, even if you’ve been together for decades. If your husband doesn’t plan dates or do nice things for you anymore, it might mean he’s not willing to put in any effort. [4] X Research source Look for other signs of this too, like: Not planning dates or date nights. Not seeking out fun activities to do together. Not doing small gestures for you anymore, like making you coffee or buying you flowers. Talking to you as a roommate instead of as a romantic partner. Not getting excited when talking about previous memories or experiences together."

      "title": "He doesn’t want to work through any issues that come up.",
      "content": "He doesn’t want to work through any issues that come up. Just like relationships take work on their best days, they also take work when there are problems. If your husband brushes off your concerns or won’t tell you when he’s upset, it could be a sign that he’s struggling with his feelings. [5] X Research source Other signs include: Not checking in with you about how you’re feeling about the relationship. Not engaging in serious or deep conversations with you. Using passive-aggressive behavior rather than stating problems directly. Agreeing with you without seeming to actually care."

      "title": "Not being in love doesn’t mean he doesn’t love you anymore.",
      "content": "Not being in love doesn’t mean he doesn’t love you anymore. There’s a difference between being “in love” and loving someone. If your husband tells you that he doesn't love you anymore, it doesn’t mean that all of his love is gone. It could mean that you two need to work on bringing the spark back into your relationship or inserting more romance into your marriage, which you can easily do if both of you commit. [6] X Research source Even if your husband tells you that he doesn’t love you, it doesn’t mean your marriage is over. If you’re both willing to work on things, you can get the love back in your relationship."

      "title": "Figure out what’s changed about your relationship.",
      "content": "Figure out what’s changed about your relationship. Your husband’s feelings probably have changed over time. Take a moment to think to yourself: what’s different about your relationship now? How has your relationship changed over time? Have you both grown as people? These could all be factors that have led to your husband’s behavior. [7] X Research source For instance, maybe you both used to love romance, but as you’ve gotten more comfortable, that part of the relationship isn’t a priority anymore. Or, maybe your husband has new priorities and goals in his life that you aren’t onboard with, which is creating tension in your home. As you think, try to identify whether these changes you’re noticing in your husband could be caused by other things, like work stress or financial burdens."

      "title": "Talk to your husband about his feelings.",
      "content": "Talk to your husband about his feelings. If you aren’t totally sure what your husband is feeling, sit down and talk to him about it. Let him know that you’ve noticed some changes, and you’d like to chat about what’s going on. Give him space to open up without judgment, and listen to him talk about what he’s been feeling. “Honey, could we talk? I’ve noticed that you seem a bit more closed off and distant lately. Is there anything you want to bring up?” “I know you’ve been stressed lately, but it seems like you’re just too tired to engage in conversations with me. Have your feelings about me changed?”"

      "title": "Make a decision on what to do next.",
      "content": "Make a decision on what to do next. Once you’ve listened to your husband explain his side, talk about what you both can do moving forward. If you would both like to stay in the marriage and work on things, decide what small changes you can make together to rectify the relationship. For instance, maybe your husband is feeling neglected as a partner and feels more like a roommate. In that case, you could dedicate 1 night per week to going out together and having alone time where you share your inner thoughts and focus on having fun together. Or, maybe your husband feels like he’s grown and changed as a person. You could commit to picking a new skill and learning it together so you can both grow as people. There is a chance that your husband isn’t willing to work on the marriage. In that case, you two can talk about whether or not you’d like to stay together at this point."

They will also be able to support you as you work on the relationship and express your own needs. Make an appointment with a couples counselor to work on the marriage and commit to each other again. [8] X Research source Bring this up to your husband by saying something like, “I know we’ve been having some problems lately, and I think a professional could help. Let’s try out 1 appointment and talk about what we’re going through, then see how we feel.”"

      "title": "Ask him if he wants to work on the marriage.",
      "content": "Ask him if he wants to work on the marriage. A lack of love doesn’t have to mean not being in a relationship anymore. If there is still an undercurrent of respect, appreciation, and affection in your marriage, it’s possible that your husband loves you, but isn’t in love with you. Ask him whether he’d like to work on things or if he wants to get a divorce for clarification. “Does this mean you’d like to separate? Or do you want to work on things and try to repair our relationship?” “I didn’t know you felt this way. Is there anything we can do together to bring those feelings back?”"

      "title": "Express your own feelings about the situation.",
      "content": "Express your own feelings about the situation. Hearing that your husband doesn’t love you anymore can be devastating, and it’s natural to feel upset. Let your husband know that while you’re glad he’s expressing himself, his words and his feelings have hurt you. “I want you to know that I still love you, and I’d like to work on things. Hearing that you don’t love me anymore makes me very sad.” “I knew you were upset about something, but I could never have guessed our issues went this deep. I’m willing to do anything to save this marriage.”"

    {
      "title": "Continue to respect each other.",
      "content": "Continue to respect each other. Even if there is a lack of love in the relationship, it doesn’t mean you two have to be enemies now. Your husband’s feelings may have changed, but you can both still respect each other as partners, parents, or cohabitors. As you work on your relationship and decide what to do next, always respect your husband (and make sure he respects you). For instance, just because your husband is having some wavering feelings doesn’t mean he should go out and date other people or seek other relationships (since that would be disrespectful to you). Similarly, just because your husband has opened up about his feelings doesn’t mean you should get upset with him for how he’s feeling or tell him not to express himself."
