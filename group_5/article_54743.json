      "content": "Cold call. Most freelancers start out the same way. They cold call a media outlet to inform them of their status as a freelance photographer or writer. Next, the freelancer will pitch an offer to go to the event and interview and photograph the band, crew or venue manger. Many media outlets frequently make use of freelancers to achieve wider coverage. They’ll be used to these calls, so when you call, sound like you’ve done it before. Most people will use the Ultimate Backstage Book which is the industry standard. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Work at the venue. There is always a need for volunteers to direct backstage traffic, to provide security or janitorial services at big events. Stage production companies need people to lug cases of instruments and sound or lighting equipment on and off the trucks. You may even be able to hand out promotional flyers. Staging a large event is a coordinated effort that requires a lot of manpower. They always welcome an extra hand -- especially if it’s free. You may want to contact them a few weeks in advance to volunteer your time and get a free concert in the process. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Say \"I'm on the list.\" If you are inconspicuous enough, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the guest list. Once you have been able to do so, pick a name of a person that you could pass as. Try to select a corporate sponsor if possible, as many don’t attend and they often receive passes as a courtesy. This is a little sketchy and can get you in trouble. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Go as press.",
      "content": "Go as press. This is probably the most effective way to get backstage passes. When artists have concerts, usually in the contract, the concert promoter is required to give comped passes to the artist. The artist uses the comped passes for friends, family, and press. In order to get on this list and get comped passes, you will need to contact the manager or publicist of the artist in advance of the concert. Sometimes you can find the contact info for their manager or publicist sometimes through their Facebook page. Once you get the artist's or manager's contact information, then you will need to send an email with information about the publication that you are representing, and what exactly that you are looking to do.
