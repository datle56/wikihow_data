      "title": "Refrigerate the raw milk for at least 24 hours.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the raw milk for at least 24 hours. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Put you raw milk in a wide-mouthed jar with a lid, and let it chill in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days before you’re ready to make the butter. This will give the cream time to rise to the top of the jar so you can easily separate it. Find raw milk at your local health food store, grocery store, or farmer’s market. While you can use a regular-mouth jar, it will be harder to skim the cream off of the top. If you're making butter from heavy cream instead of raw milk, skip these steps and move on to the next part ."

      "title": "Use a ladle to skim the cream from the top of the milk.",
      "content": "Use a ladle to skim the cream from the top of the milk. Once the cream has risen to the top, remove the raw milk from the refrigerator. Slowly dip a sterilized ladle into the cream and spoon it into a glass measuring cup. Continue to skim until there is no more cream at the top of the jar. [2] X Research source To sterilize the ladle, place it in boiling water for 10 minutes or run it through the dishwasher. If you get raw milk in the winter, it will yield slightly less cream than raw milk you get in the summer. In general, you’ll get between 1 and 2 cups (236 to 473 ml) of cream."

      "title": "Stir in the buttermilk if you want to culture the butter.",
      "content": "Stir in the buttermilk if you want to culture the butter. For slightly tangy, cultured butter, stir ½ tablespoon (7 ml) of buttermilk into every 1 cup (240 ml) of cream you skimmed. If you want classic butter, skip this step and leave out the buttermilk. [3] X Research source For example if you skimmed 2 cups (470 ml) of cream from the top of the milk, stir in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of buttermilk."

      "title": "Transfer the cream to a sterilized jar.",
      "content": "Transfer the cream to a sterilized jar. Sterilize an empty quart (0.9 liter) jar and lid by submerging them in boiling water for 10 minutes. Then, slowly pour the cream into the sterilized jar and screw the lid on top. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you prefer, run the jar and lid through the dishwasher to sterilize them. It’s fine if the jar is still warm from being sterilized. Pouring the cold cream into the warm jar will help take the chill off of the cream."

      "title": "Ripen the cream in warm water for 5 to 12 hours.",
      "content": "Ripen the cream in warm water for 5 to 12 hours. Place the jar into an insulated cooler and pour in enough warm water to come halfway up the side of the jar. Leave the cream until it reaches 75 °F (24 °C). [5] X Research source Use a thermometer to check the temperature or hold the jar to feel if the cream has warmed up. If you left out the buttermilk, the cream will need to ripen closer to 12 hours while cultured cream will take closer to 5 hours."

      "title": "Chill the jar of cream in an ice bath for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Chill the jar of cream in an ice bath for 5 to 10 minutes. Fill a bowl half full with ice water and set the jar of cream into it. Leave the jar in the ice bath until the cream feels cold to the touch. It should be between 50 and 60 degrees F (10 and 15 degrees C). Save the bowl of ice water for later. [6] X Research source Chilling the cream will make it easier to shake or churn into butter."

    {
      "title": "Pour fresh, heavy cream into a chilled bowl.",
      "content": "Pour fresh, heavy cream into a chilled bowl. If you don’t have raw milk, heavy or whipping cream can be used to make butter. Heavy whipping cream has the highest fat percentage, so it’s the easiest to turn into butter. Chill a large bowl in the refrigerator, as this will prevent the butter from melting later on if you choose to whip the cream into butter with a mixer. Then, pour the cream into the bowl. [7] X Research source If you plan on shaking the butter in a jar, the bowl doesn’t have to be chilled. Don’t fill the bowl to the brim, as the cream will expand before turning into butter. For best results, use raw cream, which can be bought from a local dairy. If raw cream is not available, vat-pasteurized cream is the next best option, followed by ordinary pasteurized cream. Ultra-pasteurized (UHT) cream will also work, though the flavor likely won’t be as good. Avoid cream with added sugar. The cream’s fat percentage tells you how much cream will turn into butter. 35% or higher is recommended. If you’re using the cream from raw milk, skip these steps and move on to the next part."

      "title": "Add cultures for a stronger flavor (optional).",
      "content": "Add cultures for a stronger flavor (optional). If you want a more complex, tangy flavor than regular sweet cream butter, add cultures to help ferment the butter. Try adding either buttermilk or plain yogurt with added cultures, using one tablespoon (15 ml) for each cup (240 ml) of cream. Alternatively, add packets of culture , like C21 Buttermilk Culture, following the instructions on the packet. [8] X Research source If you’re using raw cream, skip this step, as it ferments on its own. The acid in the culture speeds up the breakdown of fat and liquid, which shortens the churning time."

      "title": "Let cultured cream stand at room temperature for up to 72 hours.",
      "content": "Let cultured cream stand at room temperature for up to 72 hours. In many cases, the cream will only need to stand for about 12 to 24 hours. Check on the cream every few hours to see its progress. When it is properly cultured, it will be slightly thick, foamy, and smell sour. [9] X Research source If you didn’t use culture additives, just leave the cream out until it reaches 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit (10-16 degrees Celsius). This makes it easier to churn while still being cold enough to make the butter firm. If you’re going to shake the cream into butter by hand, transfer the cream to a jar with a lid. If you’re going to whip it with a mixer, leave it in the bowl, or transfer to another chilled bowl if you left the cream out for several hours."

      "content": "Shake the jar for 5 to 12 minutes. Once the cream has properly chilled, keep the lid on the jar and vigorously shake the cream until it begins to feel heavy. The butter should start to clump on the sides of the jar as it separates from the buttermilk. [10] X Research source If you don’t want to shake the butter, use a stand mixer. Pour the cream into the mixing bowl and use a whisk attachment to beat the cream on low speed. Increase the speed until the butter and buttermilk separate."

      "content": "Pour the butter and buttermilk into butter muslin. Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and lay a piece of butter muslin in the strainer. Open the jar and slowly pour the liquid and solid butter into the strainer. The buttermilk will pass through into the bowl and the butter will be collected in the muslin. [11] X Research source The butter muslin will catch even the smallest pieces of butter. If you can’t find butter muslin, fold cheesecloth a few times so it’s layered. Use the buttermilk that you pour off for making ricotta cheese or baked goods like cakes, cookies, and pancakes."

Continue holding the ends and lower the butter into the bowl of ice water that you used earlier. Swish the butter back and forth for about 30 seconds.
