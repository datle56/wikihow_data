      "content": "For maximum points, collect the fruit when it pops up, and eat the ghosts when they turn blue. Every now and then, the ghosts will change direction and head to a certain corner to circle the corner of the maze. Use this time to grab a fruit if there is one in the middle, or eat as many pellets as possible."

      "title": "Each ghost behaves differently.",
      "content": "Each ghost behaves differently. Red follows Pac-man, Pink and Blue try to travel to where Pac-man seems to be headed and orange takes a random path throughout the maze. This is crucial to obtain very high scores if you know how each ghost acts. One way to never get caught by one Ghost is to follow them since they cannot change their direction. If you have many ghosts on your tail, try to get to a Blink Dot as quickly as you can. If there are ghosts on your tail, go through a section of the maze where there are no pellets because you travel faster when not eating pellets."
