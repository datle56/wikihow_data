[2] X Research source When you find your life partner , they’re eventually going to learn all your quirks anyway. Be confident and let your personality shine through.

They’ll be right there by your side, helping you in any way that they can. You’ll always have a shoulder to cry on. [4] X Research source One of the best ways to be a supportive partner is to check in on them regularly. Even if they say they’re doing fine and can handle a tough situation on their own, ask how they are and if there’s anything you can do to help. Even if they refuse, they know they can rely on you."

You and your partner might not agree on every single detail in life, but you’ll know they’re the one when they see the world the same way you do. You won’t have to worry about arguing about politics, religion, or how many kids to have. You’ll be on the same page and know you can make important decisions without much conflict. [6] X Research source If you do disagree on something important to you, discuss it. Listen carefully to what your partner has to say and ask them questions to better understand their perspective. They should do the same for you, and together you can reach an understanding of the situation. Relationship expert Lauren Sanders believes shared values are one of the key factors to a successful relationship. She says, “You’ll be able to tell you and your partner have good compatibility by several factors such as communication styles that are in sync with each other. You will also share common interests, values, and life goals. You’ll have a lot of the same beliefs about life in general, such as religious beliefs.”"

      "content": "You’re excited to try their favorite hobby or cuisine. These could be things you’ve always wanted to try but never had the chance to, or they could be things you were firmly against at one point. Seeing how much your partner loves them makes you want to love them, too. Even if you end up hating it, you put in the effort to do something important to your partner and they’re sure to appreciate it. [7] X Research source For example, if your partner’s favorite food is sushi, but you’ve never understood the appeal of raw fish, try it anyway.

[8] X Research source When handling a conflict, remember to use “I feel” statements to avoid placing blame on your partner.

[9] X Research source Don’t be afraid to spice things up. If you and your partner both consent, why not try roleplaying or something else adventurous?

[10] X Research source Remember, just because the relationship feels effortless doesn’t mean you don’t need to put in the effort.

It’s easy for you to imagine spending the rest of your life doing these things with your partner. [11] X Research source This doesn’t mean you should never plan a date , however. Make your partner feel special by taking them out for a night on the town. It doesn’t have to be elaborate—take them to the restaurant they’ve been dying to try or to watch a movie they’ve been eagerly anticipating."

You let each other know if plans change and don’t get upset when there’s something your partner can’t control. It’s important to build each other up rather than tearing each other down. [14] X Research source To show your partner you respect them , remember to acknowledge them for their contributions to the relationship.

      "content": "When you’re with your soulmate, you want to better yourself. While you should never pretend to be someone you’re not for your partner, you may find that you’re more willing to work on some of your weaknesses or negative traits. For example, if you’re constantly late, you might make an effort to be on time to show your partner you value their time. If you communicate well, your partner will likely do the same for you. [15] X Research source Don’t try to force your partner to change. If one of their behaviors bothers you, calmly tell them why you don’t like it. Because they respect you, they’ll want to change any negative behaviors on their own. If it’s something they can’t change, you two can try to reach a compromise."

[16] X Research source Sometimes, you accept your soulmate because of their flaws. Traits that may have bothered you in past relationships are suddenly cute and endearing. This is usually a sign you truly care about your partner. Relationship expert Jennifer McVey says you’ll know you’ve found the one when you’re comfortable with each other.

[17] X Research source A great time to get to know your partner is while you’re cuddling, as you’ll have their full attention. Ask them things like what their love language is, their dream career, and what their relationship with their family is like. Knowing these things helps you build a healthy foundation for your relationship. If you struggle to be vulnerable yourself, start by telling your partner just that. If they know it’s difficult for you to open up, it will mean even more to them when you do tell them something emotional. Start gradually, and soon you’ll be able to tell them anything."

Because you’re on the same wavelength and generally want the same things out of life, heated arguments won’t usually be a problem. [23] X Research source Having an argument with your partner every now and then is normal. The important thing is to not blow it out of proportion and communicate.

[24] X Research source A great way to be dependable in a relationship is to delegate tasks between you and your partner.

[29] X Research source To maintain your independence in a relationship , set aside some time each week to do something without your partner. This can be a new hobby they’re not interested in or hanging out with your friends or family alone.
