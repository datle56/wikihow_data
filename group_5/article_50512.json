      "content": "It’s an international driving permit, not a driving license. Technically speaking, there’s no such thing as an “international driving license” that authorizes you to drive abroad. Instead, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is a document that translates your existing driving license into 10 languages. That means the IDP is meaningless on its own; you must carry your regular driving license with you at all times. [1] X Research source The permit is recognized in more than 150 countries. [2] X Research source This means that, if you have both a valid driving license and a valid IDP, you (under most circumstances) can legally drive in any of those countries. Before traveling to a specific country, contact their embassy or consulate to confirm whether they accept the IDP."

In addition, there are a few other requirements: [3] X Research source Your U.S. state/territory/etc. driving license must be valid for at least 6 months after your IDP is issued. If your license will expire during the 6 month period, renew it before applying for the IDP. You must be 18 years old to get an IDP, regardless of the minimum age to get a driving license where you live."

The American Automobile Association (AAA) is the only organization authorized to issue IDPs in the U.S. (The American Automobile Touring Alliance (AATA) used to issue IDPs along with AAA, but no longer does so. [6] X Research source ) Do not pay any other organization for an IDP. Such offers are often scams. Even if you do receive something that appears to be a permit, it may not be a legal document. [7] X Research source The United Nations does not issue IDPs. If you obtained a document purported to be an IDP issued by the U.N., you do not have a valid international driving permit. A real, valid IDP is a multi-page booklet 4 in × 6 in (10 cm × 15 cm) in size, with a gray cover. It includes a page displaying the holder's name, date and place of birth, and home address. This information is repeated in 9 other languages on separate pages. If you have any questions regarding the validity of an IDP, take it to your nearest AAA office."
