      "content": "”Let the dead bury the dead” is a metaphor referring to non-believers. When Jesus spoke these words, He didn’t mean that He wanted dead people to bury other dead people. Instead, He used this as a metaphor to say, “Allow those who don’t believe, or who are spiritually “dead,” to worry about themselves.” This is a way of telling followers of Jesus to keep their priorities focused on Him.

      "content": "“Let the dead bury the dead” refers to the need to follow Jesus immediately. When someone died back in Biblical times, burying them was usually a pretty urgent matter. But in the case of “Let the dead bury the dead,” Jesus is urging His followers to forget about the happenings of everyday life here on earth—stepping up to join Him needs to be done now, not later. [2] X Research source In other words, whatever God is calling you to do should be done without hesitation or interference."

      "title": "”Let the dead bury the dead” is a passage from the Bible.",
      "content": "”Let the dead bury the dead” is a passage from the Bible. In Luke 9:59-60 and Matthew 8:21-22, Jesus calls upon one man to become a preacher of the gospel. The man replies, “Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.” Jesus says in response, “Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God” (Luke 9:59-60 and Matthew 8:21-22). [3] X Research source In this passage, Jesus is telling the man that living for Him is much more important than anything else in the man’s life—even burying his own father. “The dead” refers to those who are “spiritually dead,” meaning they haven’t chosen to follow Jesus. Jesus is telling the man to focus on his faith and relationship with the Lord instead of those who are “spiritually dead.” Some interpret the father in this passage to not actually be dead. Instead, his son simply wants to be by his side until he does die so he can eventually bury him. Either way, the son is prioritizing his father over Jesus at that moment. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Each version of the Bible translates this passage a bit differently. While each version holds the same metaphor and meaning, “Let the dead bury the dead” is worded in its own way.

      "content": "Put Jesus first. This passage in the Bible reminds Christians that God’s calling should always come first. Just as Jesus urged the man not to worry about burying his father, it’s believed that He is also urging His followers to put serving Christ before their relationships, responsibilities, and other obligations. [6] X Research source If you feel a calling in your heart from the Lord, act upon it as soon as possible. This passage is a reminder that the work of Jesus Christ is the most important part of a Christian’s life, even if that means changing your priorities or canceling plans."

      "title": "Let go of things that don’t serve the Lord.",
      "content": "Let go of things that don’t serve the Lord. In Luke 9:59-60 and Matthew 8:21-22, the man was called upon by Jesus to forget about the burial of his own father in order to preach the Lord’s gospel. In this case, the man was asked to prioritize his faith over something very important to him. This passage asks Christians to do the same thing—to let go of things they may love so Jesus comes first in their hearts. As a Christian, putting others first is a great way to serve the Lord. Some ways to do that include: Giving up a free Saturday to volunteer at a shelter for those in need. Sharing your God-given talents with the world—whether that's singing songs of worship or painting spiritual portraits. Forgiving others and practicing humility . Getting up early on a Sunday morning to go to church instead of sleeping in."

      "content": "Make time for Jesus. While Jesus’ message may seem a bit harsh at first glance, Luke 9:59-60 and Matthew 8:21-22 encourage Christians to make their faith a priority. Life gets busy and it’s easy for work, relationships, and even hobbies to pull Christians’ focus from their worship and duties to the Lord. “Let the dead bury the dead” can be a helpful reminder to concentrate on your relationship with Jesus and make an effort to prioritize your faith. [7] X Research source Take small steps to make time for Jesus in your life. For instance, say a prayer or read a verse of the Bible in the morning before starting your day. Or, listen to Christian radio stations or podcasts as you work, study, drive, or clean. It’s completely normal to sometimes struggle in your pursuit of the Lord. If you’re having a hard time motivating yourself to pray or read scripture, set aside designated time in your calendar to worship God . Ask a family member, friend, or member of your church to help keep you accountable and motivated."

      "content": "Offer all of yourself, not just a portion, to Jesus. “Let the dead bury the dead” reminds Christians to follow Jesus wholeheartedly. In the Bible passage, the man tells Jesus that he wants to follow Him, he just wants to take care of his father first. Jesus then reminds him that he needs to give his entire self, not just a little bit of it, to Christ. [8] X Research source If you’re having a hard time giving all of yourself to Jesus, follow the Bible’s guidance for devoting yourself to the Lord . Or, speak with a spiritual leader at your church for help and support."
