    },
    {
      "title": "“As mentioned…”",
      "content": "“As mentioned…” If you want to remind a colleague or manager of something specific you said in the previous conversation, use this phrase to let them know you’ve brought this up to them before. It’s handy for pointing out smaller details or restarting conversations that have been interrupted—or even claiming credit without being too pushy about it. It. [2] X Research source Example : \"As mentioned, I will be sending out calendar invites to the Christmas party later today.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“Last time we spoke…”",
      "content": "“Last time we spoke…” “Last time we spoke” is a slightly more casual yet polite way to bring up something mentioned in a previous conversation. It’s especially useful when you want to gently remind someone of an obligation they agreed to and check on their progress without being too confrontational or follow up on a question from the last time you spoke. [3] X Research source Example : \"Last time we spoke, you mentioned you would be sending out calendar invites for an all-staff meeting.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“After we spoke…”",
      "content": "“After we spoke…” This phrase works best when you want to inform someone about events after a past conversation. You might use this phrase if you did research or thought something over and changed your mind following a discussion, for example. “After we spoke” lets you use an old conversation as a reference point before sharing a subsequent update. [4] X Research source Example : \"After we spoke, I implemented a few of your suggestions into the presentation and would love your thoughts on the new draft.” Other ways to say this include: “Following our conversation…” “Based on what we talked about…” Example : \"Following our conversation, I took your advice to heart and applied for the full-time role on the design team.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“To clarify…”",
      "content": "“To clarify…” Use this phrase to either explain any information you provided in more detail or, alternatively, get more clarification for yourself and ask any questions you might have. [5] X Research source Either way, this phrase is handy because it can help you clear up misunderstandings , decipher unclear instructions, and confirm the next steps in a process (especially with a trainee or employee). Example : \"To clarify, any designs we do for this client will need to follow the branding guide they provided.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“According to…”",
      "content": "“According to…” You might use this phrase to summarize something said by another person (like your boss or another coworker). It can be used to make sure everyone remembers the key points of a conversation or understands what what being said; it can also be used to check and see if the information someone else gave you is still correct. [6] X Research source Example : \"According to my conversation with the HR supervisor, the department is still looking for a summer intern.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“As per your request…”",
      "content": "“As per your request…” If you’re directly tasked with working on or looking into something in a previous discussion, use this phrase before giving someone an update on your progress. It lets the other person know what, exactly, you’re talking about and what you’ve been doing; use this phrase when talking about someone else’s request, not requesting something from them. [7] X Research source Example : \"As per your request, I looked into our end-of-year numbers, and it looks like we’re down in sales in this region.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“Here are the next steps…”",
      "content": "“Here are the next steps…” Similar to the phrase \"To clarify,\" this phrase can help you break down a task or rehash key points from a conversation with someone. If you’re worried they don’t know what to do next or want to explain how to proceed in a training session, this can be a polite way to ensure they have the instructions they need or give large groups an idea of what to work on next. [8] X Research source Example : \"Here are the next steps you can take after this interview: 1) Please send us three references from past employers. 2) Please let us know your preferred start date. 3) Let us know what equipment you’ll need for the job.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“As promised…”",
      "content": "“As promised…” If you committed to doing a task in your last conversation with someone, use this phrase to give them an update or tell them that you completed the promised task. “As promised” shows the other person that you didn’t forget about them or their request and went out of your way to fulfill your promise—which they’ll likely appreciate. [9] X Research source Example : \"As promised, here is the book you asked about borrowing!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“As agreed…”",
      "content": "“As agreed…” Though it sounds similar to “As promised,” you can use “As agreed” to remind a colleague or manager about an agreement you previously made. Maybe the other person forgot they agreed to something, they’re acting against that agreement, or you simply want to ensure they remember it. Either way, it’s a direct way to clear up a misunderstanding or emphasize a decision. [10] X Research source Example : \"As agreed, I said I would work on the report for sales made in the US while you worked on the report for our international regions.\" You could alternatively say something like, “In agreement with our previous discussion,” if you want to sound more formal."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Did you have a chance to…?”",
      "content": "“Did you have a chance to…?” Sometimes, a direct approach is most effective! “Did you have a chance to…?” is similar to “As agreed.” It’s a simple yet not too confrontational way to ask someone if they took whatever action they said they would in a previous conversation—or at least get an update on their progress. [11] X Research source Example : “Did you have a chance to file those documents? I remember you were aiming to have it done by this morning.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I wanted to follow up on what you were saying…”",
      "content": "“I wanted to follow up on what you were saying…” This phase is a little wordy and less direct, but it’s also more conversational and informal. Use this phrase to bring up a talking point someone else might’ve said to you or a group; it can also be a nice way to show someone you were interested in what they had to say and want to ask more about it. [12] X Research source Example : \"I wanted to follow up on what you were saying in your company presentation today!\""
    },
    {
      "title": "“Do you still want to…?”",
      "content": "“Do you still want to…?” “Do you still want to” is a more direct statement that not only reminds someone what you talked about previously but also what your ultimate goal is. So, if you’re wondering whether a colleague or manager still wants to do something a certain way based on a conversation you had, this is an easy way to check in (and spur them to action). [13] X Research source Example : “Do you still want to send those new guidelines tomorrow? I know you had mentioned it earlier.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Pursuant to our conversation…”",
      "content": "“Pursuant to our conversation…” This phrase is much more formal than most of the previous ones and mainly used in legal correspondence. It can be used to let someone know that you’re acting according to your last discussion (since “pursuant” means acting “in accordance with” or carrying out something). So, “Pursuant to” is used when an action follows as the result of a conversation. [14] X Research source Example : \"Pursuant to our conversation, I put together this report with the requested layout.\" Only use this if formalities are needed with clients or, at times, managers; in everyday exchanges with coworkers, a more casual phrase is usually better. Other ways to say this include: “In accordance with our discussion…” “In line with our previous dialogue…” “In keeping with our earlier exchange…” “Consistent with our earlier chat…” Example : “In keeping with our previous talk, I prepared prototypes for the meeting tomorrow.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“As per the contract…”",
      "content": "“As per the contract…” This is another formal phrase best used when you need to be firm about a contractual obligation made in the past. For example, you might say this if a freelancer missed the deadline to deliver their finished work—or, conversely, if an employer breached their contract with you somehow. In serious cases, you can use it to reference direct points made in the contract. [15] X Research source Example : \"As per the contract, I was only paid to provide ten designs a month.\""

    {
      "title": "“Per our conversation” is a polite way to follow up on a discussion.",
      "content": "“Per our conversation” is a polite way to follow up on a discussion. When you say, “Per our conversation,” it means you’re addressing some aspect of a previous discussion—whether you’re speaking to a colleague, client, or manager. This phrase usually refers to a specific idea you want to call back to, especially if you’re trying to remind the other person what you spoke about politely. Other uses for this term include: [16] X Research source Clarifying a conversation or set of instructions. Repeating key points to ensure you understand (or someone else does). Summarizing a discussion. Giving credit to someone for whatever was discussed previously."

    {
      "title": "“Per our conversation” and “As per our conversation” are both correct.",
      "content": "“Per our conversation” and “As per our conversation” are both correct. Common usage allows you to use either phrasing; the “As” isn’t necessary but can absolutely be used, so it’s ultimately up to you. Many native English speakers end up dropping “As” and simply saying, “Per our conversation,” but both versions of the phrase are accurate and appropriate to use in the workplace. [17] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use an alternative phrase to avoid saying the same thing multiple times.",
      "content": "Use an alternative phrase to avoid saying the same thing multiple times. If you feel like you’ve said “As per our conversation” too many times (especially to the same person), it’s never a bad idea to add a few synonyms to your vocabulary. After all, overusing a phrase can make it sound generic and meaningless—so try cycling between different phrases. You can also use alternate phrases when you want to: [18] X Research source Give your exchanges a different tone . Depending on who you’re talking to and what you’re discussing, you might want to sound more formal, casual, or somewhere in between—so choose a phrase that fits your needs. Request something . If you’re the one asking for a follow-up from someone (such as a client or employee), try choosing one of the alternate, less direct phrases to avoid sounding accusatory."
