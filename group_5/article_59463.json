[1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source A neutral “Thank you!” can keep the door open for conversation without initiating anything yourself. A short “Thanks” can tell the other person you appreciated the compliment but aren’t really interested in continuing the conversation. A lengthy “Thank you so much! That’s so sweet of you to say. 😊” can show that you really like the attention and want to keep chatting. You should always be polite. You can say thank you so much for the compliment. It made me smile. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Tease the other person to show off some sass. Let the other person know you’re funny, and that you don’t take yourself too seriously. This is especially appropriate if the other person’s compliment is cheesy, like “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” [3] X Research source “Wow, that was smooth. 😏” “Did you come up with that one yourself?” “I know, right? 😋”"

      "content": "Show some enthusiasm. In addition to emojis, exclamation points and all-caps can tell the other person that you’re outgoing and fun.

      "title": "Turn the focus onto the other person.",
      "content": "Turn the focus onto the other person. If you’re not really comfortable being in the spotlight, try following up a quick “thanks” with a question. This can redirect the conversation and get the other person to talk about something else. “Really? Your bio cracks me up. How’d you come up with that?” “I like that picture, too. Do you have a favorite picture on your profile?” “Aw, shucks. So what are you into?”"

      "content": "Tell the backstory behind what you’re complimented on. If the person comments on something specific, like a picture on your profile, try telling a story that’s related to it. This can turn a compliment into a way to share something funny or interesting about yourself.

GIFs from popular TV shows, movies, and viral videos can be used to respond to a compliment in a funny, lighthearted way. [6] X Research source Use a GIF or memes that are funny without explanation so the other person doesn’t feel confused. When in doubt, send an animal GIF."

      "content": "Send a message back as soon as you can. An integral part of letting someone know you’re interested on an app like Bumble is timeliness. You don’t have to respond immediately, but don’t let so much time pass that they think you’re ghosting them. [7] X Research source If you don’t want to respond right away because you’re busy or don’t want to be on the app, you can say something like, \"Sorry for the late response!\""

      "content": "Let them know if you’re not interested to be direct. You don’t have to be invested in every person that messages you. Still, if the compliment is genuine and friendly, it can be nice of you to acknowledge it and leave it at that. Again, a short “Thanks” can get the message across that you’re not interested. If you’re worried about hurting the other person’s feelings, you can lie and say, “Sorry, I’m actually already talking to someone else.” If you want to deflect, you can talk about something else and ask questions. [8] X Research source If it is too much too soon, you can be honest and say, although I appreciate it, it's making me feel uncomfortable."

      "title": "Ignore messages if you really don’t feel like interacting.",
      "content": "Ignore messages if you really don’t feel like interacting. It may seem cold, but it’s actually very common on dating apps to not respond to every message. This is especially the case if a “compliment” you receive makes you uncomfortable in any way. Feel free to block people that make you feel unsafe."
