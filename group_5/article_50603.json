      "content": "Clean off any old adhesive or dirt. If your laptop’s rubber feet have fallen off, reattaching them with a silicone adhesive is a good option. Silicone dries flexible and bonds well to rubber, plastic, and metal, and it may last longer than other types of glue. Before you start, use tweezers to peel away any of the old glue that’s still in place. You may be able to remove any stubborn glue, dirt, and oils with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. Look for alcohol with a high concentration, such as 70% or more. [1] X Research source You can also try vinegar or baby oil to dissolve the glue. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a thin layer of silicone glue to the spots where the feet go. Typically, the rubber feet on a laptop sit inside indentations that are built into the baseplate. Use a small applicator brush to apply a thin layer of glue into each of the indentations. For some types of laptops, such as the MacBook Pro, you’ll need to detach the baseplate before attaching the feet. This is because the feet have a backing piece that needs to be pushed through a hole in the baseplate and glued down from the other side. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the feet in place.",
      "content": "Press the feet in place. Use firm pressure to stick the feet into the indentations on the bottom of your laptop. If you’re using a pressure-sensitive silicone adhesive, hold the feet firmly in place for at least 30 seconds—or as long as recommended by the instructions—to help the glue bond the feet to the baseplate."

Peel the backings off the feet and press them firmly into the indentations where the old feet were. [6] X Research source For some computer models, the process can be a little more complicated. For example, if you have a MacBook, you may need to take the baseplate off your computer and push the backs of the feet through the holes on the bottom. If your replacement feet come with special instructions, follow them carefully to make sure your feet fit properly and stay in place."

If you’ve lost the feet on your laptop, one easy and affordable solution is to fill the indentations with hot glue or a moldable silicone glue. To get started, clean away any dirt or traces of glue residue so your new feet will stick better. You may be able to remove most of the old glue by peeling it off with your fingers or rubbing it away with a cotton swab. [7] X Research source Use a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol (at least 70%), vinegar, or baby oil to dissolve any stubborn glue."

This will help prevent air bubbles from forming. Fill the indentation until the level of the glue is slightly above the edges of the indentation.

      "content": "Try moldable silicone glue as an alternative to hot glue. If you want your new feet to have a more rubbery finish, try filling the indentations with a moldable silicone glue, such as Sugru or E/Fusing. Mold the glue into the desired shape and press it into the indentations for your laptop’s feet, then give it 12-24 hours to fully set. You can also make your own silicone glue by mixing a little cornstarch with 100% silicone caulk. Keep adding small amounts of cornstarch until the caulk has a putty-like consistency and isn’t sticky to the touch. [11] X Research source"
