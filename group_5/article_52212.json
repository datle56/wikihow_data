      "content": "Clean the reservoir in your dishwasher. Remove the reservoir from the unit. If applicable, remove the small black reservoir valve by pushing on it from the bottom. Put the reservoir with the open side facing down into the top dishwasher rack. Run the dishwasher. Allow the reservoir to air dry rather than running a heat cycle. [2] X Research source If you’re unsure how to remove the reservoir, review the Waterpik product manual for your model. If you don’t have a dishwasher, hand wash your Waterpik reservoir with warm soapy water. A handheld waterpik’s reservoir can be cleaned in the same way. Remove the reservoir and place it in the top rack of the dishwasher. [3] X Research source Repeat this deep cleaning of the reservoir and valve every 1-3 months—otherwise, “mineral deposits and other substances can accumulate within your Waterpik, causing a decrease in pressure and effectiveness,” says Adatrow."

      "content": "Wash the valve, if applicable. Hold the valve under warm running water. Massage it continuously under the water for 30 to 45 seconds. Set it aside to air dry. [4] X Research source Reattach the valve to the reservoir by pressing it back into place. The valve should be dome side up with the four prongs visible on the bottom of the reservoir. Both the valve and the reservoir should be completely clean and dry before reattaching them together."

      "title": "Purge the flosser before and after each use.",
      "content": "Purge the flosser before and after each use. “Remove the reservoir and run the flosser for at least ten seconds with the reservoir detached,” instructs Adatrow. Turn off the unit. Wipe down the cavity under the reservoir with a paper towel. Replace the reservoir but sit it at an angle so that the inner cavity and tubes can air dry. Adatrow asserts that this step is crucial in order to “prevent the growth of bacteria, mold, and mildew inside your Waterpik.”"

      "title": "Run diluted vinegar through the flosser.",
      "content": "Run diluted vinegar through the flosser. “Mix 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) of warm water with 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of white vinegar,” as recommended by Adatrow. “Run this solution through the Waterpik until the reservoir is empty,” Adatrow continues. Then, fill the reservoir with clean warm water and run the unit again to rinse out the vinegar solution. Clean your Waterpik with this vinegar solution every 1-3 months. The vinegar solution removes hard water mineral buildup in the Waterpik, kills bacteria, and breaks down oil and grease. If you prefer to clean your Waterpik without vinegar, Adatrow offers a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution or mouthwash as alternatives. “To create your disinfectant,” Adatrow instructs, “mix two parts of water with one part of your disinfectant.” To clean the internal parts of a handheld Waterpik, add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) white vinegar to a full reservoir of warm water. Point the handle and tip toward the sink run the unit until the reservoir is empty. [5] X Research source"

Allow the parts to air dry. [6] X Research source Leave the reservoir unattached until the next time you use your Waterpik."

Fill a container with a 2:1 ratio of water and white vinegar. Place the flosser handle in the container and allow it to soak for 5-7 minutes. Rinse the handle with warm water. [7] X Research source If you have a Radiance (WF-09) Waterpik model, do not soak its handle. The handle on this Waterpik contains a non-replaceable battery that could break if submerged in water."
