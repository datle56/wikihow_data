      "content": "Establish a comfortable height for your workstation. Try to use a desk or workstation where the main surface is 26.75–28.34 inches (67.9–72.0 cm) off the ground. Some desks allow you to adjust the height, but if not, you can adjust the height of your chair instead. [1] X Research source If you can’t fit your legs underneath your workstation, then it’s too low and doesn’t have enough space for you to move freely."

      "title": "Change the seat height so your elbows are bent at 90 degrees while seated.",
      "content": "Change the seat height so your elbows are bent at 90 degrees while seated. Start with the seat height just below your kneecap. Sit upright as close to your desk as is comfortable so your upper arms are parallel to your spine. Let your hands rest on the surface of the workstation or your computer keyboard. Raise the level of your chair so your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle. [2] X Research source Sit on the chair and feel under the seat of the chair for the height control level. This is usually a lever located on the left side, but it can vary between different chair models. [3] X Research source If your hands are higher than your elbows, then the seat is too low. Raise your body off the seat and press the lever to raise it higher. Let go of the lever to lock it in place. If the seat is too high, remain seated, press the lever to lower the seat, and let go when the desired height is reached. Physical therapist Mayami Oyanagi also says that your “wrists should remain neutral [and] not be in an extended or flexed position.” [4] X Expert Source Mayami Oyanagi Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 January 2021."

      "content": "Keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and your feet flat on the ground. While sitting down, check that your feet are flat on the floor and that your thighs are parallel with them. [5] X Research source If your knees are higher than your thighs, then raise your office chair as well as your workstation to the appropriate height. If your knees are lower than your thighs or if your feet don’t reach the ground, use an adjustable footrest to raise your feet higher. Oyanagi agrees that “your feet need to be supported or [they have] to be completely on the ground” so you aren’t on your tip toes.

      "content": "Check for a gap between your calves and the front of your office chair. Clench your fist and try to pass it between your office chair and the back of your calves behind your knees. Your fist should easily fit into the space. [7] X Trustworthy Source U.S. General Services Administration Independent U.S. government agency designed to support the basic functioning of the U.S. federal government. Go to source If it's tight and difficult to fit your fist in the space, bring the backrest forward so it’s not as deep. Most ergonomic office chairs have a lever below the seat you can turn to make the adjustment. If you can't adjust the chair's depth, use a lumbar support pillow . If there is too much space between your calves and the edge of the chair, adjust the backrest further back. Using the correct seat depth helps you avoid slumping or slouching while you work. Good lower back support will minimize the strain on your back and is a great precaution against low back injuries."

      "content": "Adjust the height of the backrest to fit into your lower back. While sitting properly on the chair with your feet down and your calves a fist-space away from the edge of the chair, move the backrest up or down so it fits into the shape of your lower back. That way, it will provide the greatest support when you lean back. [8] X Research source Position the backrest until you feel firm support on the lumbar curve of your lower back. Look for a knob on the back of the chair that allows you to move the backrest up and down. Since it is easier to lower the backrest than to raise it while sitting, start by raising it all the way up while standing. Then, sit in the chair and adjust the backrest down until it fits in the small of your back. Not all chairs will allow you to adjust the height of the backrest."

      "content": "Set the angle of the backrest so it supports your back. If your office chair lets you adjust the angle, move it to about a 15-degree angle when you’re sitting straight up. If the backrest is in the right position, you won’t have to lean back to feel it nor lean farther forward that you like to sit. [9] X Research source Look for a knob locking the backrest angle in place on the back of the chair. Unlock the backrest angle and lean forward or backward while looking at your monitor. Once you reach the angle that feels comfortable, lock the backrest into place."

Raise the armrests up until they barely touch your elbows when you’re resting your hands on the desktop. If they are too high then they will force your arms into an uncomfortable and awkward position. [10] X Trustworthy Source U.S. General Services Administration Independent U.S. government agency designed to support the basic functioning of the U.S. federal government. Go to source Resting your arms on the armrests while typing will inhibit normal arm movement and cause extra strain on your fingers and supporting structures. Most chairs have a knob or button to change the armrests while others require a screwdriver. Check the sides of your armrest or the chair’s manual to find out how to make the adjustment. Some chairs may not have adjustable armrests at all. If your armrests are too high and cannot be adjusted, then remove them from the chair so they don’t cause pain in your shoulders and fingers. Some armrests can also adjust so they’re closer together or wider apart. Move the armrests in to support your elbows when you’re typing, and slide them back out if you’re just resting."

[13] X Research source Look at the specs on the chair to see if they’d fit your height. If you are very tall or very short, you may need to order a custom-made chair. Also double-check the chair’s weight range. While most chairs support over 250 pounds (110 kg), others may have lower weight limits."
