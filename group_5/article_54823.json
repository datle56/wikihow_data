      "content": "Think about the material before you come to class. You usually know what your class is going to be about because your teacher assigned you some kind of material ahead of time. As you are getting to class, think about what you will be covering that day, mentally preparing yourself for the time ahead. This process will get you in the right frame of mind and help you absorb information better. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Go to class.",
      "content": "Go to class. If you're in high school, you really don't have the option not to show up, but in college, you're in charge of your own time. One of the easiest ways to earn good grades without studying much is to show up to your classes and listen to what your teacher has to say. That means not just showing up but being attentive as well. In addition, many professors will make attendance and participation a part of your grade. Therefore, just attending will contribute to you making better grades. If you don't show up enough, you lose those points."

      "title": "Sit in the front row.",
      "content": "Sit in the front row. It may be tempting to sit in the back row, out of sight and mind of your professor. However, you'll be better able to see what your professor is writing on the board at the front, and you'll be able to hear them better. You'll also be less tempted to let your mind wander."

    {
      "title": "Ask questions.",
      "content": "Ask questions. If you're confused about something, don't be afraid to ask a question. Your teacher will be happy to shed some light on what's confusing you, and other students will likely have the same question."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be interested.",
      "content": "Be interested. It may sound difficult to do, especially if the subject is something you don't like, such as math. However, start out by feigning interest, if you have to. Psych yourself up, saying how much you love math. Try to find parts of it that do interest you, even if it's a small part. Being interested in what you're learning helps you to take in information more effectively. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Always look for the main points.",
      "content": "Always look for the main points. Your teacher will likely clue you in to what's important by writing main ideas on the board or emphasizing it with her voice. She may even repeat the main ideas to make sure the class is understanding what's important. Constantly be asking yourself what the main ideas and main points are, so that you are using your time in class to think about and absorb the ideas."

    {
      "title": "Take good notes.",
      "content": "Take good notes. Taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your teacher says. In fact, that often means you aren't absorbing the information, just re-writing it on the page. You also won't be able to keep up, unless you are taking notes on a computer and can type very fast. Therefore, it's best to write down notes with a few words or short sentences that capture the main points. [3] X Research source For instance, if your teacher says, \"We're talking about verbs today. Verbs are the action of the sentence. There are two main types of verbs, being and action verbs.\" You could write: \"Verbs: action of sentence. 2 types: being, action.\" It's a good idea to use shorthand or abbreviations to make your writing faster, but be sure to be consistent so that you always know what you wrote. [4] X Research source Though you can capture more with a computer, studies have shown that taking notes by hand actually helps you learn more than taking notes on a computer. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Don't get distracted. It's tempting to stop being interested if the room is too hot or people are talking. Maybe the day is really nice outside, or you just don't feel like being there. Commit yourself to paying attention. Block out what's distracting you, and focus only on what the teacher is saying and the class discussion. [6] X Research source Everybody's mind wanders sometime. When you find yourself drifting away, bring your focus back to what your teacher is saying. If you absolutely cannot focus or you find yourself going to sleep, try going to the bathroom for a short break to splash water on your face, if your teacher will let you."

Actually take the time to work through the assignment. Your homework and reading is a way to reinforce what you're learning in class, and if you take the time to learn it effectively now, you won't have as much studying to do later."

      "content": "Read critically. Don't just skim through your textbook. Read each sentence thoroughly, taking in the information. If you have a hard time paying attention, try reading it aloud to yourself or a friend. Take some time to look at what the main ideas are. It may help you to take notes on the main ideas, just so you have a general overview. Plus, writing down will help reinforce the information."

Get up and walk around. Get a cup of tea. Do jumping jacks, or go talk to a friend for a few minutes. Just take a mental break, and you'll be more prepared to jump back in."

      "content": "Use a study guide or the syllabus to make a plan. If you don't have either one, you'll have to use your class notes or textbook to determine your plan. Basically, you need an overview of what you need to cover for the test. You can make an outline by using the main headings in your textbook or using the main concepts you covered before this exam. Once you have all of the concepts you need to cover, set aside a certain amount of time to cover each one, based on the amount of time you want to spend in total covering the exam. You don't need to give equal time to each concept. If you know one concept better than another, focus more time on the one you don't know. If one concept is more complex, it might need more time than other concepts."

Skim through the headings of the chapters you read in the time before this exam to ensure you're covering everything you need to do. However, don't try to re-read chapters, as that will take more time than you have to study for the test. [9] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed.

Discussing ideas engages you in the material, making it easier for you to absorb information. [11] X Research source For instance, if you're trying to study a book for a test, try using an online study guide to spark discussion with your friends. You can find discussion questions for most classic works of literature. For something like math, try having mini competitions. Take one problem, and see who can solve it the fastest. If someone is having trouble, walk through the problem with him or her to help her understand it. Whether you're doing the explaining or need the explanation, you'll be solidifying the information more quickly."

      "title": "Connect ideas.",
      "content": "Connect ideas. Most people try to learn by using rote memorization; that is, they read something over and over until it sticks. A more effective way to learn is to connect what you're learning now to something you already know. By pulling it in to your web of ideas, you make it stick more quickly. For instance, say you're trying to learn the circulatory system of an animal. You can compare the parts of the body to a train system, where the main train station is the heart, while the big train routes moving away from the station are the arteries and the ones moving to the station are the veins."

      "title": "Try flashcards.",
      "content": "Try flashcards. If you find networking ideas isn't working for you, try flashcards to help your rote memorization. Flash cards help you learn because they force you to repeat the concept over and over. Plus, they allow you to quiz yourself on the topic. Just write a word or something you need to learn on one side, and then write the definition or what's connected to that concept on the other side. Flashcards work best with study concepts that have two parts, such as words and definitions, events and dates, or the name of an equation and the equation. Another way flashcards can help is they allow you to study just what you don't know. Once you've definitely learned a concept or word, you can take it out of the set of cards, focusing your time on learning what you don't know."

[15] X Research source Once you've read through the question, decide on what you would answer before looking at the answer choices. That way, you won't be swayed by other answers before coming to a conclusion. If your answer is there, pick it, and move on. If isn't, reread the question to see if you read it wrong. [16] X Research source If you're having trouble deciding, eliminate the silly or ridiculous choices. Often, one or two of the answers will be obviously wrong. Put a line through those so you don't have to consider them anymore.
