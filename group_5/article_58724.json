      "content": "A healthy relationship depends on open and honest communication. Soulmates aren’t perfect, and they don’t necessarily go into a relationship knowing how to resolve conflict or say what’s on their mind. But in a healthy partnership, both parties are willing to learn how to communicate and grow into more honest, open, reliable communicators. Open communication involves actively listening to one another, without judgment. Give your soulmate your full attention when they want to speak.

For instance, saying “You aren’t listening to me” instead of “I don’t really feel heard” may come off accusatory."
