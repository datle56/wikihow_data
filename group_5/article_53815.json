      "title": "Make sure the fabric is no more than 50% synthetic.",
      "content": "Make sure the fabric is no more than 50% synthetic. Dylon dye will not be effective on 100% polyester items , but blends of natural fibers and polyester can be dyed. Dylon recommends not dyeing any fabric that is made with more than 50 percent synthetic fibers. [1] X Research source Common natural fibers include cotton, linen, viscose, and denim. Common synthetic fibers include Gore-Tex, lycra, nylon, polyester, and spandex."

      "title": "Pick a darker-colored dye to achieve your desired shade.",
      "content": "Pick a darker-colored dye to achieve your desired shade. Since synthetic fibers will reject dye, only the natural fibers will be there to pick up the dye. The less natural fiber, the lighter and more diluted the shade. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that your dyed item will be lighter than the color displayed on the packet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember that the fabric’s original color will affect the end result.",
      "content": "Remember that the fabric’s original color will affect the end result. For example, a yellow shirt dyed with blue dye will result in a green shade. Patterns may also be visible after you dye them. If you want your fabric to turn the color of your dye, make sure it’s white when you begin. [3] X Research source If your original item has bleach marks or stains, those areas may not be completely covered by the dye. If there’s bleach marks, you can try bleaching the entire item, but it will lose its original color."

      "title": "Use Dylon Pre-Dye to change fabric from one strong color to another.",
      "content": "Use Dylon Pre-Dye to change fabric from one strong color to another. Pre-dye helps lighten dark fabrics so it’s easier to change their color. Pour the contents of the packet into your washing machine, add the items, and run the longest and hottest cycle. Then add laundry detergent and wash the item as usual. [4] X Research source Dylon Pre-Dye is meant to be used in washing machines and not by hand. Run your washing machine for 1-2 empty cycles after using the pre-dye so it doesn’t affect your other clothes."

      "content": "Buy 1 machine dye pod for every 600 grams (21 oz) of fabric to be dyed. The items should be dry when you weigh them. If your clothes weigh more than 600 grams (21 oz), you should split them into two or more batches. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wet the fabric before putting it and the dye pod in the washing machine. The items should be clean and damp so that they can accept the dye. Place the damp clothes in your washing machine and put an unwrapped and opened Dylon machine dye pod on top.

      "content": "Use your washing machine’s regular wash cycle to dye your items. Set the machine to a full cycle with a water temperature of 40 °C (104 °F). Don’t use the economy or pre-wash options, because the water will not be the correct temperature or the cycle will be too long. [7] X Research source IF your washing machine doesn’t list exact temperatures, use the Warm cycle setting."

Once the cycle has finished, remove the items and run an empty cycle with laundry detergent to clean your machine. [9] X Research source If you don’t clean your washing machine, subsequent loads of laundry could become stained with excess dye."

Use cool or warm water during your cycle. Washing your dyed items separately will also protect your other clothing from being stained with excess dye. [11] X Research source You can iron your dyed items as you normally would."

      "content": "Wash your item thoroughly and leave it damp. The fabric needs to be clean so that it will accept the dye evenly. It needs to be wet for the dye to work. [12] X Research source Hand dyeing is best for small items like shorts, vests, or socks and for delicate items that you don’t want to put in the washing machine."

Fill a bowl or stainless steel sink with about 6 litres (6.3 US qt) of 40 °C (104 °F) water, stir in 250 grams (8.8 oz) of table salt, and then stir in the dye mixture. [13] X Research source Wear rubber gloves while mixing the dye since it could stain your skin. Some plastic and porcelain containers may get stained if you use dye in them."
