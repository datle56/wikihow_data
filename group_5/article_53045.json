      "content": "Acknowledge your emotions and don't be afraid to cry. It can be really hard to look at feelings of sadness honestly, but avoiding your feelings won't make them go away. Listen to sad music, cry, and be honest with yourself about how you feel. Rejection hurts no matter who it is, and when you've been rejected by a family member, those feelings can be magnified. Know that it's okay to admit that you're sad, and might make the road to happiness a lot easier down the line. [1] X Expert Source Cameron Gibson, R.C.C. Registered Clinical Counsellor & Men's Mental Health Expert Expert Interview. 20 February 2021. [2] X Research source Try not to linger on your feelings for too long, though.
