Use a hot glue gun to glue one end of the twine to the back of one corner of the frame (You can also use hot glue to initially fix sticks in batches together). Bring the twine diagonally across the front of the corner. Then bring it horizontally across the back of the intersection. Bring it diagonally across the front again -- this time it should fill in the other diagonal (so if the first time you went top right to bottom left, this time you'll go bottom right to top left). Wrap it across the back vertically this time. Again, wrap diagonally, and then horizontally, and then diagonally, and then vertically. At this point the front of the corner should show two wraps of the twine across each diagonal, so the twine should form a thick X. The back should have one wrap along each side of the intersection, so the twine in the back should form a thin square. Secure the end of the twine with hot glue. [10] X Research source Keep the sticks on each side flat and close together. Make sure the twine is tight throughout the knot so that the sides of the frame are secure. If you want to experiment with other looks, try any lash to tie the corners. Try out a square or diagonal lash, or experiment with one of your own. Repeat this for the other three corners. When finished, you should have a strong and secure frame."

Experiment with laying the tubes diagonally or perpendicular to each other, or even use them to create patterns. For example, add a small square of tubes rotated 45 degrees from the rest to create a diamond in the middle of your frame. Bend the tubes to create corners, or let them stick off the edge of the frame. Get creative -- the layout of the tubes will define the look and feel of your frame.
