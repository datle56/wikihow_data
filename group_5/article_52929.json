      "content": "Wash your hair before you cut it. Your hair will be easier to work with if it's clean and snarl-free. Get your hair wet under running water and use shampoo and conditioner, rinsing both out after you've worked them through your hair. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Detangle",
      "content": "Detangle your hair with a comb. Run the comb through your hair and work out any knots with the comb or with your fingers. Ridding your hair of tangles beforehand will result in a cleaner, more even cut. If your hair dries out while you comb it, spritz it with water until it's damp again. Use a detangling product or a natural remedy to tackle particularly stubborn snarls."

      "title": "Towel dry",
      "content": "Towel dry your hair. The best time to cut your hair is when it's damp, but not soaking wet. If your hair's still dripping, dry it off with a towel. Comb your hair again to get rid of any tangles made from drying it. [2] X Research source If you cut your hair while it's still wet, it may not lay the same way it does while it's dry."

      "content": "Find a comfortable place to cut your hair. Cutting your hair can take up to several hours, especially if you've never done it before. Choose a spot where you can sit down and work without worrying about making a mess. [3] X Research source The best place to cut hair is the bathroom, where you'll have access to running water and a mirror."

      "content": "Position yourself near a mirror. You’ll want to be able to see what you’re doing as much as possible. [4] X Research source A large-sized mirror on your bathroom wall or medicine cabinet will help you see what you’re cutting in front or on the sides. If possible, set up a second mirror so you can see the back of your head, either hanging from the wall opposite or as a hand mirror held by someone else."

      "title": "Section",
      "content": "Section your hair into parts. Run the comb back through your hair right about where your head curves, then comb the hair between the part and the ear down. Do this on both sides to section off both sides of your head. [5] X Research source If your hair is long enough, you can use clips to hold the top section away from your sides."

      "title": "Use clippers on a small guard setting to cut the back and sides.",
      "content": "Use clippers on a small guard setting to cut the back and sides. Clippers are the best for the back and sides for beginners or those who want a basic haircut. Set your clippers' guard, which controls how much hair you can cut, to 1 (3 mm or 1/8 inch) or 2 (6 mm or 1/4 inch) to make conservative cuts while you work. [6] X Research source The shortest setting for a clipper guard is 0, which is essentially shaving down to the skin."

      "title": "Cut one side at a time.",
      "content": "Cut one side at a time. Use a low clipper guard around the sides and, with the blade's edge, trim from the bottom of the sides to the top. Tilt the clipper blade at an angle as you work to create an even fade with the rest of your hair. Then, repeat this process on the other side of your head before moving to the back, making sure to transition between lengths at the same point on both sides. [7] X Research source To blend short hair on the sides with longer hair on the top of your head, pull your clippers further away from your head as you get towards the top of your head. [8] X Research source Going against your hair's grain will result in a cleaner cut. Some clippers come with ear tapers, which help you cut above and around your ears. Use these, if available, to make cleaner cuts around the ears."

[9] X Research source Use the same blade guard length that you used on the sides of your hair. Run the clippers from the bottom to the top of your head, just like you did with the sides. [10] X Research source You’ll start at the bottom and do your initial cuts up to the occipital bone, which is where your skull starts to curve. [11] X Research source Then, as you approach the top of your head, stopping about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the crown of your head, use scooping motions to pull the clippers away from your head. Scooping the clippers away from your head helps to blend your cuts evenly."

Trim your hair from the bottom to top with the shorter blade guard. Stop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) under where you cut with the longer blade. [12] X Research source Lift your hair with the clippers as you approach your temples and earlobes. [13] X Research source Work slowly while using clippers to ensure as even of a fade as possible."

You can buy styling scissors online or at most hair care stores.

      "content": "Trim the top in sections. Use your fingers or a comb to raise the hair from the top of your head. Work slowly and carefully in 1/4 in (about 6 mm) sections. These should be parallel to the front of your hairline. As you trim, pull a little of the previously cut section into the new section as a traveling guideline. Cuts to the hair on top of your head are more noticeable than cuts to the hair on the sides of your head. Always start with conservative cuts. Remember, you can always cut more, but you can't add back lost length. When you've finished with this area, you can check your guideline by holding up a section of hair that is perpendicular to your hairline. Your hair should be the same length across the entirety of this section. Be gentle on your head while cutting the crown, which is usually more tender than the rest of the head."

Comb your hair straight out and grab a horizontal section from about the same point on each side of your head. Check to see if these sections are the same length. If they are not, trim away any extra length and bumps, taking off small amounts at a time. Remember, it's always easier to cut a little and touch up more later."
