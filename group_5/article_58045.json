      "content": "Select a mower appropriate for your mowing needs. If you have a small urban lawn, less than a few hundred square feet, this is not the machine for you. For medium to large lawns, a 15 to 18 horsepower (now referred to as torque) mower with a 36–42 inch (91.4–106.7 cm) mowing path is as large as you need. For very large lawns, over an acre, you can go to a 22- 25 horsepower model that mows over 50 inches (127.0 cm) in each path."

      "content": "Look at the controls on the mower so you understand the purpose of each one and are familiar with its operation. Here are the main controls common to ZTR mowers: Ignition switch, for cranking your mower. Parking brake, usually has to be engaged to start the engine. Mower clutch, to engage the mowing blades. Deck height adjustment, to raise or lower the blade, depending on how high you want to cut your grass. Steering arms. These are the devices that replace your steering wheel to make your mower go forward, reverse, and turn. Check your machine before starting it. Here is a brief checklist to go over every time you use your machine. Check the fuel. Check the oil. Check the belts, pulleys, and blades to make sure they are free of debris and in good condition. Check the tires. This is critical with a ZTR mower, since the turning dynamics of this machine place a great deal of stress on the tires."

      "content": "Sit down in the seat when you have selected your mower, checked the items listed above, and are ready to begin. Before starting your engine, adjust the control arms so they are in a comfortable position. Usually these will tilt in and out (left and right, from the center line of the machine). Many ZTR mowers also have an option of adjusting the neutral position, for taller or shorter people, so your arms are in a comfortable position while you mow."

The arms will return to a neutral position when you release the pressure on them. Pushing them forward propels the mower forward, and pulling them back reverses the mower. Give yourself a few moments of practicing this before proceeding. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Slowly push the control handles forward, keeping them equally advanced so that the mower will begin to move in a straight path. If the mower turns left, you need to advance the left arm more to compensate; if it turns right, advance the right. The handle you push forward speeds the drive wheel on that side. For straight travel, you want the wheels to turn at the same speed."

You will find that sharp turns in close quarters can quite suddenly jam the mower deck against an obstacle, since it is traveling almost perpendicular to the center-line of the machine. You will also want to cut the widest path on each pass, so the mower's position as you travel needs to be in line with your previous cut."
