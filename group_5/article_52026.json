      "content": "Take the awning down if it’s removable. If your canvas awning is removable, taking it down might make it easier to clean. Once you’ve taken the awning down, lay it across a flat surface and spread it out as much as possible so you’re able to see any stains or dirty spots. [1] X Research source How you’ll remove the awning from its mount will depend on the specific type and brand of your awning. Therefore, it’s important that you follow the directions that came with your awning so that you can remove it properly. You may want to lay out an old sheet or tarp to protect both the awning and the surface you’re cleaning on. If your canvas awning isn’t removable, or you think it will be easier to clean it in its current location, you can use a ladder to reach the awning to clean it."

      "content": "Hose down the awning to remove surface dirt and debris. Turn on your garden hose and, using a medium level of water pressure, spray both the top and bottom of the awning. This will remove any surface dirt and debris, making it easier for you to spot stains on the canvas and get the awning clean. [3] X Research source If you’re using a pressure washer instead of a hose, make sure you put it on the lowest pressure setting to avoid weakening the fibers of the fabric or embedding dirt further into the canvas.

      "content": "Make a cleaning solution of dish soap, water, and Borax. In a large bucket, mix 4 cups (950 mL) of warm water, 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of dishwashing soap, and 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of Borax. Stir the solution with a soft-bristle brush until it’s completely combined and sudsy. [5] X Research source If you don’t have any Borax on hand, you can use the same amount of baking soda instead. Alternatively, you can use a bar of laundry soap as your cleaning agent. Both Purex Fels-Naptha Laundry Soap and The Laundress Wash and Stain are great options for laundry soap bars that are safe and effective for cleaning canvas awnings."

      "content": "Saturate a soft-bristle brush with laundry soap or your dish soap solution. First, stick the soft-bristle brush under the hose to get the bristles wet. If you’re using a bar of laundry soap, hold a bar of laundry soap in your hand and rub the bristles of the brush across the soap back and forth several times to get plenty of soap on the bristles. [6] X Research source If you’re using a dish soap solution, dip the bristles of the brush into the solution. You can also clean your awning with an extension pole that has an attachment for a squeegee with a T bar. [7] X Expert Source Ben Barlow Window Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 23 July 2021."

      "content": "Scrub the top and bottom of the awning with the soap-soaked brush. First, scrub the top of the canvas awning entirely in a circular motion to make the solution extra sudsy. [8] X Research source If there are any stains or bird droppings, you may need to spend a bit of extra time scrubbing these spots to get them removed. Then, flip the awning over and scrub the entire bottom. Make sure that you scrub the soap or solution into any crevices, creases, and stitching. If the canvas awning is large, you’ll likely need to rub the brush across the laundry soap or dip it in the dishwashing soap solution several times to re-lather it. Make sure that you remove all traces of bird droppings as you scrub with the brush, as they can be very damaging to the canvas fabric over time. [9] X Research source"

If you notice any mildew spots after scrubbing the canvas with either laundry soap or the dish soap solution, you can use a simple bleach solution to kill the mildew and get your awnings clean. To do this, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of bleach, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of dishwashing soap, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water together in a clean bucket and soak the awning in the solution for 15 minutes. [10] X Research source Avoid using chlorine bleach, as this can damage the canvas fabric. If your canvas awnings are colored, use color-safe bleach."

To keep your canvas awning clean, clean the entire awning with laundry soap or dishwashing soap solution and a hose at least once per year. Spot-clean as needed in between cleanings to help protect the fabric and prevent damage or fading. [14] X Research source"

Before putting your canvas awning in the washing machine, it’s important that you first check the care tag or instruction manual to make sure the awning is machine washable. While most natural canvas awnings that are removable can be put in the washing machine, some canvas awnings are made with part synthetic fabrics that aren’t machine washable. [15] X Research source If the awnings don’t have a care tag or washing instructions, check to see what fabrics were used to make the awning. If it’s 100% canvas, it’s likely machine washable."
