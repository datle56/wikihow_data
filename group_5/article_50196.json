In ocean ruins, you usually have to dig around to find the chest while avoiding the drowned that guard it. In shipwrecks, the map chest will be in a room with a door. Keep an eye on your oxygen bar so that you don't drown. Shipwrecks have a guaranteed treasure map while only 43.5% of ocean ruin chests will contain one."

      "content": "Dig for buried treasure. Travel around until you arrive at the red X on the map. Position yourself so that only a few pixels of the white arrow are visible below the x. Then, dig straight down until you find a chest. Inside, there will be many valuable items like TNT, gold, and diamonds, but you're here for the heart of the sea which is used to craft a conduit. If you're having trouble finding the X, remember that upward on the map is north while rightward is east. Press F3 to obtain the cardinal directions."

[1] X Research source As of the 1.16 Update, the fishing rod needs to be cast into an open body of water (5x4x5) to catch treasure items. Having the Luck of the Sea enchantment on your fishing rod helps the drop rate. Drowned have a small chance to spawn holding a nautilus shell in their hand which will drop if you kill them. Wandering traders can also sell nautilus shells for 5 emeralds each. [2] X Research source On average, they spawn every 10 Minecraft days."

If you want the radius of your conduit to be larger, you can expand it, but you'll need to gather extra blocks. Bring a few milk buckets in case you get inflicted with Mining Fatigue. Dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, prismarine, and sea lanterns all work. To help avoid the guardians, drink a potion of invisibility and take off some of your armor. Make sure you don't drown. Bring some doors or drink a potion of water breathing."
