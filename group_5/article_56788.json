      "content": "Avoid exposing your mobile phone to too much sun or rain. This is especially important for smartphones with LCD screens If the phone was immersed in water or used in heavy rain, wipe it dry as soon as possible. Should the phone have gotten seriously wet, it is advisable not to turn it on and not to charge it immediately. This avoids the electrical burn out of internal parts. If your phone has a user-removable battery, remove it. If the battery is not removable, visit a repair shop as soon as possible. If the mobile phone has sat idle for a long time, it may need special moisture treatment. In humid areas, the internal moisture of the mobile phone could cause harm to the parts. When using your mobile phone has been idle for a reasonable amount of time, it will have attained a certain internal temperature. This can cause the accumulated water to evaporate at ordinary times. To avoid harm to the body, don't touch the antenna."

      "content": "Some useful tips to prolong the service life of your mobile phone are: Keep your mobile phone and its accessories in a place where children can't reach. Keep your mobile phone dry. Rain, moisture, and liquids all contain minerals that can corrode sensitive electronic circuit boards. Do not use or store your mobile phone in dusty or dirty places, as this could undermine its circuitry or essential components Do not store your phone where it could overheat. High temperatures can shorten the life of electronic devices by damaging batteries or melting some of the plastic parts, causing deformation. Also, when the temperature rises high enough, the moisture will form inside of your phone, and this can damage electronic circuit boards."

If you know some daily maintenance methods, they will be very beneficial to your phone. Use a mobile phone holster. They can reduce the amount of wear done to the phone. Secondly, they can also reduce the harm to the phone when it gets wet. Of course, this does not mean the holster is flame-resistant after you use it. Be cautious to avoid damaging it."

      "title": "If your phone has damage, take care not to expose it to environments that will make things worse.",
      "content": "If your phone has damage, take care not to expose it to environments that will make things worse. For example, if your mobile phone has a crack or a hole, rainwater could easily get in it and cause internal damage such as erosion of the circuit board. Don't use mobile phones in the rain or the bathroom. Don't put your mobile phone in the cold air outlet, because condensation in the mobile phone will invisibly corrode the circuit board. The longer this goes on, the more severe the water erosion of the circuit board is. You may not notice anything initially, but if you keep going on, the phone could stop working. Pay attention to how you carry it. Everyone has different ways to carry mobile phones, but some methods can increase the chance of damage. For example, carrying a phone in the back pocket of your jeans can cause it to fall out when you walk or be damaged if you accidentally sit on it. Also, when people keep slim phones in their breast pocket, these can fall out easily if they bend over."

      "content": "Know \"first aid\" for your phone. Itâ€™s likely that at some point the mobile phone will come into contact with water, for example by rain or having drinks spilled on it. If this happens: Turn off the power immediately and then, if possible, remove the battery to avoid water corroding circuit boards. Water is an enemy of your phone - after coming into contact with it, your phone should be sent for repair as soon as possible. Do NOT use a hair dryer to dry the cell phone's internal moisture. This may cause more harm than good. Instead, place it in a bag of uncooked rice for a day."

      "content": "Occasionally, when plugged into a power supply and in standby mode, the phone will automatically put out. Many users have experienced this situation and there are several possible reasons for it: The power source you have plugged it into is too high and so the fuse has blown. This can be sent to a repair shop and fixed. The battery itself is aging. This can also be sent to a repair shop and fixed,or may need replacing. The battery has come into contact with pieces of metal with dirt, causing poor power contact and stopping it from charging. The problem is caused by oxidation of the contact terminals and as long as you use a glue stick to wipe clean, the situation will be improved. The battery is too loose. You can put paper between the battery and the mobile phone to stop it being too loose. Do not put paper between the terminals of the battery and the phone."
