The Pythagorean theorem [5] X Research source is a formula for finding the hypotenuse (longest side) of a right triangle: (side one) 2 + (side two) 2 = (hypotenuse) 2 , or a 2 + b 2 = c 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}} . Now that the square is divided in half, you can use this formula on one of the right triangles: The two shorter sides of the triangle are the sides of the square: each one has a length of s . The hypotenuse is the diagonal of the square, d . s 2 + s 2 = d 2 {\\displaystyle s^{2}+s^{2}=d^{2}}"

Solve for d if you know the side lengths and want to find the length of the diagonal: [7] X Research source 2 s 2 = d 2 {\\displaystyle 2s^{2}=d^{2}} 2 s 2 = d 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2s^{2}}}={\\sqrt {d^{2}}}} s 2 = d {\\displaystyle s{\\sqrt {2}}=d} For example, if a square has sides of 7 inches, its diagonal d = 7√2 inches, or about 9.9 inches. If you don't have a calculator, you can use 1.4 as an estimate for √2."

If you are given the diagonal and you know that the diagonal of a square is s 2 {\\displaystyle s{\\sqrt {2}}} , you can divide both sides by 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}} to get s = d 2 {\\displaystyle s={\\frac {d}{\\sqrt {2}}}} . [8] X Research source For example, a square with a diagonal of 10cm has sides with length 10 2 = 7.071 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {10}{\\sqrt {2}}}=7.071} cm. If you need to find both the side length and the area from the diagonal, you can use this formula first, then quickly square the answer to get the area: Area = s 2 = 7.071 2 = 50 {\\displaystyle =s^{2}=7.071^{2}=50} square centimeters. This is a bit less accurate, since 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}} is an irrational number that can lead to rounding errors."

      "content": "Interpret the area formula. The math checks out for the formula Area = d 2 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}}{2}}} , but is there a way to test this directly? Well, d 2 {\\displaystyle d^{2}} is the area of a second square with the diagonal as a side. Since the full formula is d 2 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}}{2}}} , you can reason that this second square has exactly twice the area of the original square. You can test this yourself: Draw a square on a piece of paper. Make sure all the sides are equal. Measure the diagonal. Draw a second square using that measurement as the length of the square. Trace a copy of your first square so you have two of them. Cut all three squares out. Cut apart the two smaller squares into any shapes so you can arrange them to fit inside the large square. They should fill the space perfectly, showing that the area of the larger square is exactly twice the area of the smaller square."
