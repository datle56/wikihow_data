      "title": "Come to a complete stop.",
      "content": "Come to a complete stop. When you are on a slope, you need to come to a complete stop using either the brake pedal or the handbrake. This holds true whether you’re facing up a slope or down a slope. [1] X Research source Some drivers prefer to use the handbrake, because it frees up their right foot to use on the gas pedal when they intend to start driving again."

    {
      "title": "Use hill-start assist, if available.",
      "content": "Use hill-start assist, if available. Many manual cars have hill start assist, which will help keep your car from rolling backward when you are stopped on a hill. It will also help when you try to start from a complete stop as well. If you have hill-start assist in your car, it will automatically work so you do not have to press any buttons. [2] X Research source Hill-start sensors in the car automatically detect when your vehicle is on an incline. The hill start assist maintains pressure on the brake pedal for a set period of time to help you while you’re moving your foot from the brakes to the gas pedal. Hill-start assist does not increase your traction, so if you are in inclement weather or the road is slippery, you may still start to roll backwards."

      "title": "Shift into first gear",
      "content": "Shift into first gear . When it is time for you to begin moving again, shift into first gear and step on the accelerator pedal. Do not release the handbrake yet. Continue pressing on the accelerator until the engine spins at about 3000 RPM."

      "title": "Lift the clutch to its biting point.",
      "content": "Lift the clutch to its biting point. At this point, you’ll feel the front of the car lift slightly since the clutch is taking on the weight of the car."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slowly release the handbrake.",
      "content": "Slowly release the handbrake. Gradually release the handbrake as you lift the clutch slightly. [3] X Research source As the handbrake disengages and releases, the car should begin to move forward."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slowly release the clutch, listening to the engine.",
      "content": "Slowly release the clutch, listening to the engine. When you hear the sounds of the engine start to fade, continue applying more and more throttle. Now, you’re able to start driving up the hill again without rolling backwards. Make sure to release the clutch until it is fully engaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the brake pedal, if no handbrake.",
      "content": "Hold the brake pedal, if no handbrake. If your handbrake doesn't work, use the heel of your right foot to hold down the brake pedal while you use your toes to work the accelerator. You will release the brake pedal instead of the handbrake as you’re releasing the clutch. If your handbrake doesn’t work, take your car to a mechanic and have it fixed. Relying on the transmission to hold the car causes wear and tear and can have adverse effects on your engine."

      "title": "Keep your foot on brake.",
      "content": "Keep your foot on brake. If you are waiting for a traffic light to change, continue keeping your foot on the brake to prevent your car from rolling. Holding the brake pedal down will ensure that you’re at a complete stop and prevent you from rolling backwards. [4] X Research source If you’re going to be stopped for a while, you can shift into neutral. Keep your foot on the brake pedal the entire time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shift into drive.",
      "content": "Shift into drive. If you have chosen to shift into neutral, you’ll now need to shift into drive to move the car forward. You will start to push down on the accelerator pedal as you smoothly release the brake. While you are moving your foot from the brake to the accelerator, you will need to move your foot quickly to prevent your car from rolling back. It is normal for the car to move back a few inches, but you need to be cognizant of any cars or people behind you while you’re transitioning."

    {
      "title": "Drive forward.",
      "content": "Drive forward. Preventing rolling back in an automatic transition is more straightforward than with a manual transmission. Now that you’re ready to start again from your complete stop, you’ll have to make the transition smoothly from the brake to the accelerator. Press down about half way on the accelerator, though you will need to step down less if there are other vehicles in front of you. Depending on how steep the hill is, you may need to step harder on the accelerator than you would on a flat road."

      "title": "Parallel park",
      "content": "Parallel park as you normally would. Your car is more likely to roll while you are parking on a hill than it would on a flat surface. [5] X Research source Since parallel parking on a slope can be more difficult than parking on a flat surface, you need to be very comfortable parallel parking and be confident in your skills."

    {
      "title": "Turn the wheels.",
      "content": "Turn the wheels. After you park on a slope facing uphill, turn the wheels away from the sidewalk or shoulder. This will rotate your tires, so if your gears disengage, or the emergency brake fails, the car will simply hit the curb instead of rolling down the hill. If you are facing downhill, turn the wheel to the right so the wheels are facing the curb or sidewalk."

      "title": "Use a wheel chock.",
      "content": "Use a wheel chock. When you are parking on a steep slope, you can use a wheel chock to stabilize your car and prevent it from rolling backward. A wheel chock is an object, usually a block of wood, that you place behind the back wheel of your vehicle. You can purchase wheel chocks online, at auto parts stores, or at major realtors. You can also make your own chocks using wood. If you are parked with the front of the car pointing downhill, place the chock under your front tire."

      "content": "Safely drive away. When you are ready to leave your parking spot and continue your drive, you will need to remove the wheel chock (if you used one) and disengage the emergency brake. [9] X Research source When you are pulling out of a parking space while on a hill, you will need to keep your foot on the brake until you are sure that is safe to pull out. Once you are able to pull out, you can transition your foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator. You will need to make this a smooth transition, otherwise you risk rolling backwards either into the curb or a vehicle parked behind you. Be sure to check your mirrors before you pull out of your parking space."
