      "content": "Install drawer dividers to organize your bras. Purchase adjustable acrylic dividers , instead of wooden ones, so they fit inside any drawer without snagging the fabric. Dividers keep your bras separate from the rest of your lingerie, plus prevent your bras from hooking onto each other. [1] X Research source If the inside of your drawer is dirty, spray it with an all-purpose cleaner , then wipe it down with a clean, dry cloth. Leave your drawer open so it can dry completely before storing your bras."

      "content": "Stack your molded bras, without folding them or inverting the cups. Put your first bra in the back of the drawer so it stands vertically, then set your second bra right in front of it so the cups nestle into each other. Make sure to line up each bra so only the bottom of the cup touches the drawer. If you stack your bras directly on top of each other, you won’t be able to see your whole collection. [2] X Research source Keep stacking your bras until you reach the front of the drawer, and repeat this process until you run out of bras. Do not fold your molded bras in half or fold one cup into the other—this can damage the underwire and cause the cups to become misshapen. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold your non-molded bras in half and then stack them. According to professional stylist Hannah Park, the best way to organize non-molded bras is to “lay [them] down flat and color coordinate them.” Clasp the strap in the back first, fold the bra in half, then tuck the straps inside the bra so they don’t get tangled. Alternatively, put all of your bra straps in an accessories bag . Non-molded bras are ones without any foam or padding, like bandeaus, bralettes, and sports bras."

      "title": "Sort your bras by color, material, size, or type.",
      "content": "Sort your bras by color, material, size, or type. If you have a large collection of bras, place similar ones next to each other so you can find them easily. You could keep all your neutral-colored bras in one row and all your printed bras in another row, for example, or arrange all your bras from lightest to darkest. [4] X Research source Organize your bras by fabric, placing mesh or lace ones in one row, and opaque ones in another row. Or, arrange them by type, separating your push-up bras, t-shirt bras, and bralettes. Alternatively, keep different bra sizes in order, from smallest to largest, or place the size you wear least toward the back of your drawer. If you don’t own that many bras, put your favorite or most-worn bras toward the front so you can grab them quickly."

      "content": "Multi-bra hanger Buy a pack of plain wooden hangers that do not have a horizontal bar at the bottom. Turn one hanger upside down and find the joint where the 2 pieces of wood come together. If there isn’t a hole, drill a small hole directly in the bottom center of each hanger, except for one. Twist a screw eye hook into each hole, then use it to hang each hanger onto each other. Add the hanger without a screw eye hook last to form a vertical chain. [5] X Research source Hang the top hanger in your closet or from a hook on the wall, making sure to leave enough space for the rest of the hangers below it. Close the backstrap of each bra, then slip the straps over the arms of the hanger, just like you would hang a normal shirt. If your bras slip off of the hanger, remove them, draw a squiggle of hot glue along the strap area, let the glue dry, then re-hang your bras."

Fold and organize your bras like you would if you were using dividers. You can buy fabric-covered boxes at craft stores, furniture stores, or any place that sells storage boxes. [6] X Research source If you can’t find fabric-covered boxes you like, purchase acrylic boxes and decorate them with ribbons, stickers, or decoupage."

Hang each bra from the shower curtain rings, making sure to hang them from both straps. Hanging bras by a single strap can ruin them by stretching out the elastic over time. [7] X Research source"

You can lay your bras in the center of the tension rod so the cups rest on either side, or add some S-shaped curtain hooks to hang them from the straps. [8] X Research source"
