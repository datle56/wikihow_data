      "content": "Choose the crosshair design that works best for you. For example, if you're missing a lot of shots and you're using a large design, try using a smaller dot design like the pros . You also want to use a crosshair that's bright and vibrant so it doesn't meld into the background. For smaller crosshairs, use these codes: 0;P;o;0.7;d;1;z;1;0b;0;1b;0 0;s;1;P;c;7;h;0;m;1;0l;3;0o;2;0a;1;0f;0;1b;0;S;c;4;o;1 0;s;1;P;c;5;h;0;0l;4;0o;0;0a;1;0f;0;1b;0;S;c;0"

      "title": "Not moving increases your aim accuracy.",
      "content": "Not moving increases your aim accuracy. Don't move around a lot when you're trying to shoot something. Unlike many single-player games that auto-lock onto targets so you can dance around, Valorant requires you to maintain your sights on an enemy. And that's easier to accomplish when you're standing still. [2] X Research source"

Make sure your game is adjusted to get you the best possible frame rate . Here is an example of the settings you can use: Material Quality: Low Texture Quality: Low Detail Quality: Low UI Quality: Low Vignette: Off VSync: None Anti-Aliasing: 1x Anisotropic Filtering: Off Improve Clarity: Off Experimental Sharpening: Off Bloom: Off Distortion: Off Cast Shadows: Off"

      "title": "Talk with your teammates.",
      "content": "Talk with your teammates. Instead of playing as a solo player against 5 other people, work with your team so you're functioning like a 5v5 group. Use the map to call out information about enemy players and locations. If you don't know the callouts for a specific map, practice makes perfect! You can die continuously while giving your team important intel on the other team, which helps even if you're not the one making the kill shots. Press the Z key to ping a location on the map, unless you've remapped it to a different key. You can see the name of the area you're in above the mini-compass and map in the top left corner of your screen."

      "content": "Don't spend all your money at once. At the beginning of each round, you can pay to get upgraded weapons. If you can afford it, go ahead and buy a Spectre/Stinger with a Full/Half Shield. But if you're handy with traps, bombs, etc, you can most likely manage without buying too much. If you're pretty good, start off with just a pistol, then you'll definitely have saved up enough for more at the shop if your team wins the round. This is when you should talk with your team, to see if you can complement each other or compensate for those who don't have funds for more expensive items."

      "content": "Equip your knife and jump-peek for intel. This is a very handy technique if you're sure the enemy team is behind that fence, but aren't sure how many there are, which weapons they have, and which operators are there. Approach from a 45-degree angle, then approach the wall or fence that you want to peek over/around. As soon as you get near the edge of the wall, jump and press W to move forward a little. Look left to gather as much information as you can, then press A and S to get back in cover."

      "content": "Aiming down the sights changes your viewpoint, so use it more so you're ready for the change. For example, if you're approaching a corner, aim down the sights and point it at head-level so you can accurately shoot any enemies that are waiting on the other side of the wall. If you're already aiming down the sight, you don't need to take an extra second or two to readjust. Also know that there are some weapons with fantastic hip-firing potential that don't need you to always aim down the sight."

      "content": "Each weapon is different, so learn them all to be better prepared. Not all the available weapons are superb choices in every situation. For example, the Vandal assault rifle has crazy recoil when you spray it to the last bullet. However, Phantom is a popular rifle since the recoil is different and more easily manageable. Use each weapon in the Practice Room to see how it shoots and recoils."

    {
      "title": "Control your gun's recoil.",
      "content": "Control your gun's recoil. A lot of players just spray their bullets, hoping one of them will land a kill shot. But that's not as effective as aiming and shooting 3 or 4 times. You're better off using the Vandal or Phantom in short bursts of fire anyway."

      "content": "For more advanced-level tips, try strafing instead of standing still. When you're moving, you're harder to hit accurately, so press the A and D keys to strafe left and right. You should also learn counter-strafing, which is a technique used when strafing and aiming down the sights that is the opposite movement of your enemy while you fire shots."

      "content": "Just like pro sportsmen warm up before games, so should you. You can go into Practice Mode and use \"Shooting Range\" to simply get in touch with the game controls again. Fill it with bots and turn on their strafe, so they act more like opposing players."

      "title": "Crouching can be good, but using it too much is a bad thing.",
      "content": "Crouching can be good, but using it too much is a bad thing. Crouch when you've been missing shots in a gunfight since the lower advantage point makes aiming easier. And it's sometimes good to crouch if you're re-peeking around a corner so your enemies won't immediately be able to get in a headshot since their weapons are most likely trained at head level. You don't want to crouch in every single fight you're in. It's likely that the other player isn't alone, and crouching makes you move slower. Couple those two together and you're not as mobile in a 1v2 situation."

      "content": "Learn from the best. Watching pro streamers like Shroud is the best way to see how these tips and tricks are used in the game. Make sure you note the patterns they use, like if they tend to go up ramps or around them, or how they get kills, like what weapon they favor and if they spray their gunfire. If you're part of a good team, stream your gameplay so others can watch and learn."

      "content": "Treat others like you want to be treated. You'll most likely be exposed to a wide variety of players including people who love to argue and play the blame game. If you're mouthy or annoying, others will most likely retaliate in ways that could get you banned or leave you with a bad reputation. If you're nice and pleasant to be teamed up with, you might make friends and get a permanent teammate!"

It also allows you to spot mistakes that you continuously make, so you can improve on them later. Use a third-party software to record your gameplay."

      "content": "Don't lose your Valorant mojo by not playing for a month. You won't get better by not playing the game. So if you want to improve, play often. Make sure you're taking the appropriate time for your other day-to-day activities, but also include a little time to play and practice with Valorant. Know when to take a break. If you're constantly losing and dying, it's time to refocus. After a bunch of defeats or deaths in a row, take some time off to regain your concentration."
