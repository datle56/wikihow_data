      "content": "It builds resentment. Being called names isn’t fun, and those hurt feelings don’t just go away after a fight is over. While you or your partner might say things you don’t mean during an argument, they still hurt to hear. Over time, enough name-calling can make you and your partner build resentment toward each other.

    {
      "title": "It prevents communication.",
      "content": "It prevents communication. When an argument devolves into name-calling, you and your partner aren’t talking about the issue at hand anymore. Instead, you’re focused on attacking each other or defending yourself. Communication is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and if that’s gone, the relationship may break down over time. [2] X Research source Try to think of an argument as you and your partner vs. the problem, not you vs. your partner. If you can both tackle issues together, your communication is much less likely to break down."

      "title": "It doesn’t help you fight fairly.",
      "content": "It doesn’t help you fight fairly. All couples argue from time to time—it’s just a fact of life. However, there is a way to fight fairly to reach a compromise together. When someone uses name-calling in an argument, it stands in the way of fighting fairly, meaning that neither you nor your partner can express your needs fully. [3] X Research source Think of “fair fights” as more of discussions rather than arguments. Someone is bringing up a problem, and now you need to work together to solve it. In fair fights, there are no winners or losers—both of you should feel content with the outcome of your discussion."

    {
      "title": "It shows a lack of respect.",
      "content": "It shows a lack of respect. Healthy relationships require not only love for your partner, but respect, too. When your partner calls you names, they’re telling you directly that they don’t respect you as a person. This is a sign that your relationship might not be healthy, and you and your partner need to make some changes. [4] X Research source Think about someone you really respect in your life, like your parent or your boss. Would you ever call them names? The same should be true for your partner."

      "title": "It’s a form of control.",
      "content": "It’s a form of control. Does your partner use name-calling to “win” an argument with you? You might notice that every time your partner feels like they aren’t in control of a disagreement, they’ll resort to name-calling to shut things down. This isn’t an accident—name-calling is a powerful way to hurt someone’s feelings enough so that they don’t want to continue the conversation anymore. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "It makes you feel belittled.",
      "content": "It makes you feel belittled. Getting called terrible names doesn’t make anyone feel good, especially if the person calling you them is your partner. When your partner calls you names, it can make you doubt your own self-worth. In healthy relationships, partners focus on building each other up, not tearing each other down.

      "content": "Calm down so you feel level-headed. Calling out your partner in the moment might lead to an even bigger fight. Instead, if your partner has just called you a name, give each other some time to calm down before you approach them again. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk about how the name-calling makes you feel. Focus on your feelings so your partner doesn’t feel like you’re blaming them. [8] X Research source Use “I” statements , and really express how getting called names during an argument is taking a toll on your mental health. If your partner understands where you’re coming from, they may be less likely to repeat their behavior in the future. “When you call me stupid or dumb, it makes me feel belittled.” “When you call me names, I feel really sad.” “I know you’re just expressing your anger, but getting called names makes me feel like you don’t love me.”"

      "title": "Suggest talking about their emotions instead of name-calling.",
      "content": "Suggest talking about their emotions instead of name-calling. Usually, people resort to name-calling when they want to express their anger but they don’t know how. Try telling your partner that instead of calling you names, they can focus on talking about their emotions and expressing themselves to you. That way, you can both understand each other a little better. [9] X Research source “I know that you’re calling me names because you’re upset. I’d really love it if you could talk to me about your feelings instead so that we could have a productive conversation.” “When you feel like you want to call me names, maybe you could pause and gather your thoughts first. Then, we could regroup and come back to talk about why you’re upset.” If you’re having trouble talking through this with your partner on your own, consider having a couple’s counselor facilitate the conversation."

      "content": "Leave the relationship if you feel unsafe. There’s a big difference between a slip of the tongue and manipulation through repeated name-calling. Verbal abuse can also sometimes lead to physical abuse, which can put you in danger. If you’ve talked to your partner and nothing has changed, make a plan to leave the relationship safely.

      "content": "Take a break to calm down. When you feel like you want to call your partner a bad name, ask for a break and walk away. Take 5 or 10 minutes to do some deep breathing exercises , and really think about what you want to say next. [11] X Research source “I can feel myself getting worked up.
