      "content": "Use fans and open windows to get air flowing in your kitchen. Because warmed chile peppers release irritating fumes, it is important that you are working in an area that has lots of airflow. You want your result to be tasty dried chile peppers, not a home filled with painful chile fumes. [2] X Research source Use ceiling fans, portable fans, and open windows. Be cautious when working around children and pets. Always use gloves when handling ghost peppers, and be very careful touching other parts of your body (especially sensitive areas like your eyes and face)."

      "content": "Get rid of any spoiled peppers. When you are preparing to dry the ghost peppers, it is important that you start with a group of pure, firm peppers. Look out for rotten peppers or peppers that have mushy or discolored spots. Use your nose to sort out any peppers that smell rotten. It is important to cull out any spoiled peppers because they will only continue to spoil as they dry."

      "content": "Cut the peppers in half and lay them on a cookie sheet. Peppers cut into smaller pieces will dry out faster and more evenly. [3] X Research source Arrange the peppers so that there is plenty of space in between each one. You want every part of the pepper to be exposed to the heat, giving the whole chile a chance to sweat out moisture. You can remove the seeds if you like, but it is not completely necessary. Many seeds will fall out during the drying process."

      "content": "Cook the peppers in an oven set to 120–140 °F (49–60 °C). Drying peppers in the oven can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. You’ll want to flip them roughly every hour so that both sides have a chance to dry in the heat. Keep your oven door open slightly so that the moisture they release can escape. [4] X Research source Remember that you are trying to dry the peppers, not cook them. If they develop brown or black spots, you can try to turn the temperature down slightly or flip them every thirty minutes rather than every hour."

      "content": "Set up a food dehydrator in a well-ventilated space. Whenever you are heating ghost peppers (even in a dehydrator), it is important that there is plenty of air flowing in your home. The warmed ghost peppers will release some of their spice into the air and can be irritating to your eyes and throat. Use ceiling fans, portable fans, and open windows. Be cautious when working around children and pets. Always use gloves when handling ghost peppers and be very careful when touching other parts of your body, especially your eyes and face."

Remove small peppers as they finish drying. Especially large pieces may take longer than 12 hours. [6] X Research source Be patient and give them the time that they need. You will be rewarded in the end."

Attaching sticks to the ends of the garland will make your garland look more interesting (you will, after all, be looking at it for a few weeks), and it will also help you to hang it."

Enjoy your beautiful ghost pepper garland as time and air do all the work for you. Depending on your climate, it could take longer than four weeks for the peppers to dry in this way. Humid air creates problems for air-dried ghost peppers. If you happen to be in a humid season, you may want to hang your garland in a room that has a dehumidifier running."
