      "content": "Swallow air like you would swallow a drink. Suck in a big mouthful of air, almost as if you’re breathing in through your mouth—but instead of breathing in the air (via your windpipe), make an intentional effort to swallow it. Think of it like gulping down a drink, but the beverage is air. Medically speaking, this is known as aerophagia, the natural process of swallowing air through eating, drinking chewing gum, and other common activities.

      "content": "Try the knee-to-chest yoga pose. Find a comfortable surface to lie face-up on. While breathing out, lift your legs and bring your knees to your chest, holding your shins in place with your arms. Keep breathing as you maintain this pose for a few seconds. Then, breathe out and lower your legs so they’re flat on the floor again. [2] X Research source Yoga enthusiasts agree that this pose naturally helps your body to pass wind."

      "content": "Perform a seated forward bend. Sit on a flat, comfortable surface with your back straight and your legs stretched out in front of you with your feet pointed up. Then, lean forward, stretching and extending your arms so your hands wrap around the balls of your feet. Try to stay in this position for at least 1 minute. [3] X Research source If you can’t wrap your hands around your feet, simply extend them as far forward as is comfortable for you. According to some, this position can help to naturally produce farts."

      "content": "Squat to induce a fart. Stand up straight with your feet planted around shoulder-width apart; then, use your hips to squat , pushing your bum back and bending your knees. Try to keep your back angled in the same way as your lower legs, squatting until your thighs are about parallel with the ground. [4] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Studies show that using a tool (like a stepstool) to help you “squat” while on the toilet can make it easier to poop. [5] X Research source By this logic, regular squats may make it easier to fart on demand."

      "content": "Eat plenty of fart-inducing foods. While eating certain foods won’t enable you to fart instantly, they will provide your body with fuel so that you can more easily fart on-demand later. Try snacking on some of these foods to really amp up the gas in your body: Fiber-rich foods: Beans, cruciferous veggies (Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, etc.), artichokes, apples, pears, whole-wheat grains, onions, etc. Dairy products Fried foods Soda, hard candy, and gum [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Lie on your back so your butt can “inhale.” Lie face up on a comfortable surface and pull/reposition your legs up so they’re closer to your head and shoulders. This motion encourages your rectum to “inhale” air, which you may now feel building up around your gut. Once you feel enough air build up down there, fart as you normally would. Note: This strategy is probably easiest to execute without a lot of clothes on, so it might not be the most efficient or easiest way to generate a fart in front of your friends."

      "content": "Take OTC medication that prevents gas build-up before eating. If you plan on eating a gas-inducing food (like beans) that could potentially create gas pain further down the line, take the recommended dosage of alpha-galactosidase (often advertised in pharmacies as BeanAssist or Beano ). If you’re lactose intolerant, taking lactase supplements (like Digest Dairy Plus or Lactaid ) may also be a big help.

While this remedy isn’t medically backed, some people find that activated charcoal tablets (like CharcoCaps ) help with gas-related symptoms. Talk to your doctor before using these supplements, though, as activated charcoal can interfere with your body’s ability to process certain types of medicine.
