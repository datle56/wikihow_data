      "title": "Find the area the Taurus Demon is in.",
      "content": "Find the area the Taurus Demon is in. The Taurus Demon is most likely only the second boss you will face, and as such, he is hard to miss if you follow the path through Undeadsberg. Once you have lit the bonfire in Undeadberg, follow the bridge past the fire bombing hollows, up the large stairs and through the city until you come to the large tower towards the end. On the second floor there will be a fog wall; the Taurus Demon will be through the door, but beware â€“ you cannot return until you defeat the boss, so only enter if you are prepared."

      "content": "Prepare to face the Taurus Demon. Whichever method you choose to fight the demon with, you'll want to have leveled up your Endurance and Dexterity stats a fair bit, as you'll be doing a good amount of rolling and running during your battle. Otherwise, you'll also want to stock up on firebombs (about 20 of them to be safe), which can be bought from the merchant under the two spear Hollows in Undeadsberg, not far from the bonfire there."

      "content": "Clear out the Hollow marksmen on the guard tower behind you. Fighting the Taurus Demon with them shooting at you can be difficult, and two of the methods you can use to fight him need you to implement the guard tower, so killing the Hollows is easiest. Climb up the ladder and dispatch them both."

If you've timed it correctly, and the Taurus Demon is in the correct spot, the inertia from his club will propel him off the edge of the bridge and kill him instantly. This method is fairly hard and difficult to do. If you are unwilling to die, do not try this method. However, despite its difficulty, the method has both an element of humour worth viewing it and will reduce the fight with the boss to a quick melee."
