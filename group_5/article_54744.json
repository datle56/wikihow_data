      "content": "Heat up white vinegar and water in the microwave for 4 minutes. White vinegar is great for neutralizing odors and leaving your microwave sparkling clean. Just pour 1 cup (237 mL) of water and 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of white vinegar into a microwave-safe bowl and heat it for 4 minutes. Then, let the mixture sit inside the microwave for 5 to 15 minutes to give the steam time to freshen up your appliance. [1] X Expert Source Raymond Chiu House Cleaning Professional [v161113_b03] 8 May 2020. After you let the mixture sit, carefully take it out of the microwave and wipe out the inside with a damp rag or paper towel. If the inside of your microwave still smells vinegary, wipe it down with a mixture of dish soap and water. Watch the vinegar mixture as it heats, as it might take more or less than 4 minutes for it to boil. For super smelly microwaves, leave the vinegar solution in your microwave overnight without heating it up. Warning : Do not heat metal items in your microwave. The heat can start a fire or cause other damage to your appliance. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Microwave lemon juice for 4 minutes if you don’t want to use vinegar. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice from each side into 1 cup (237 mL) of water in a microwave-safe bowl. Then, heat the solution for 4 minutes, or until it starts to boil. Keep the door closed for 5 minutes to let the mixture’s steam spread throughout the smelly microwave. [3] X Research source For extra deodorizing power, cut the squeezed lemon into 4 or 8 pieces and insert them into the lemon water when you microwave it. Feel free to use a lime, orange, or another citrus if you prefer their scent. Just use 4 to 6 tsp (20-30 mL) of juice, which is about how much 1 lemon contains. If your microwave is still smelly, repeat the heating process or leave the lemon juice in your microwave overnight."

Leave a gap between the top of the berries and the plastic wrap. This helps keep the berries smelling fresh and prevents the plastic wrap from melting."
