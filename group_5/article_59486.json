      "title": "Remain calm, professional, and positive.",
      "content": "Remain calm, professional, and positive. You want to be able to leave your job on the best terms possible given your situation. Your future employment may depend on your ability to stay calm in the present. There may be friendships and/or professional connections between your current company's employees and potential employers. Plus, your current company may be contacted as a reference. Therefore, you must do your best to remain calm and stay professional by doing the following: Listen to what your employer has to say. It may be tough to keep quiet but in order to understand the situation, you must listen. Do not argue. No matter the circumstances, the decision has been made by your employer. As a courtesy to you they are giving you an option to either resign or stay and wait to be fired. Arguments and pleas will not change their minds. Do not cause a scene up until you leave for good. The meeting can go very differently if you act out and the employer rescinds your option to resign. If you pose any threat or you are unprofessional, you will be asked to leave and escorted out the building by security. If this happens there will be negative implications such as bad references, bad impressions, possible ineligibility for unemployment or company benefits and possible legal issues."

      "title": "Understand the full reasons you are being asked to resign.",
      "content": "Understand the full reasons you are being asked to resign. Most likely you already understand the circumstances surrounding your choice to resign because you have been spoken to already, have a feeling something is going on or know you have done something undesirable. However, if you do not fully understand, you must ask questions. Knowing the exact reasons for asking you to resign will help you make your decision about whether to stay or wait to be fired. For example, if you are being asked to leave because your position is being eliminated, then resigning will leave you without unemployment benefits and it may be best to wait to be fired. If you are asked to leave because you have engaged in prohibited acts defined by the company, it may be best to resign because of possible negative implications and ineligibility for unemployment."

The employer may not take any chances and open themselves up to any risk by letting a possible disgruntled employee stay on the premises.
