But be careful—a couple of playful punches can easily turn into a spirited wrestling match. [2] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. On second thought, maybe you don't want to be too careful. It's also okay to get a little boisterous. He can get rowdy and doesn't care about making a scene, so if you want to run over and tackle him out of the blue, he'll probably be into that. If you tease him, expect him to tease you back. You two will likely feed off each other's energy, so this is a battle that may never end. Not that you want it to!"

      "content": "An active Aries enjoys the thrill of the chase. [3] X Research source If you throw yourself at him, he's likely to get bored pretty quickly and move on. Fortunately, Gemini ladies tend to be pretty spirited and unpredictable, so it's unlikely that you'll settle down with him super fast. You like a good romantic chase too, so give him a little flirty tease and then flutter off to play with someone else. For example, if the two of you are at a party, you might dance with him for a song or two, then head off to hang out with someone else. If he asks if you want to go somewhere quieter with him, you might just give him your number instead and tell him to text you sometime."

      "content": "Aries guys are usually most attracted to ladylike women. Wearing a graceful dress in a soft, flowing fabric with heels is a great way to catch his eye. If you're the typical Gemini, you probably have a closet overflowing with different looks and styles, so you're sure to find something light and alluring that will pull that Ram in. Even if you're going with a simple look, such as jeans and a T-shirt, add a little feminine flair with an arm full of bracelets or a sparkling necklace. Pay attention to the little details as well. While an Aries guy might not necessarily notice a fresh manicure, he will appreciate how it pulls your whole look together."

He likes doing active and adventurous things too, so if a night out dancing isn't your style, maybe you could go on a bike ride or rock climbing together. If there's a hot local brewery or distillery nearby, chances are he'll like hitting them up for a tour (and some free samples at the end)."
