      "title": "Walking around on eggshells can make you stressed.",
      "content": "Walking around on eggshells can make you stressed. Narcissists manipulate others into believing you’re not worthy or good enough for their affection. If your father’s a narcissist, there’s a strong possibility that you’ve carried anxiety and a melancholy mood into adulthood. Perhaps you’re constantly on edge or struggle to feel happy. Unfortunately, these are common side effects of being raised by a narcissist.

Believe it or not, getting your thoughts on the page can make a huge difference. Plus, it can help you unravel and understand the emotional turmoil you’ve been through."

      "title": "Trusting people likely doesn’t come easily to you.",
      "content": "Trusting people likely doesn’t come easily to you. Because of your upbringing, it may be difficult for you to form lasting relationships. Perhaps you could only hang out with friends or romantic partners your father approved of when you were a kid, and the constant need for his gratification has trickled into your adult life. He likely didn’t support you emotionally, so it may be hard for you to reciprocate other people’s feelings and make personal connections. [2] X Research source How to cope: Don’t let your father’s fear of your independence stop you from making friends and finding love . Participate in clubs or organizations in your community, reach out to a colleague with similar interests, or join a chatroom with like-minded people."

      "title": "You’ve probably grown accustomed to hiding your feelings.",
      "content": "You’ve probably grown accustomed to hiding your feelings. Your father’s emotional abuse, manipulation, and lack of empathy may have subconsciously taught you to bury your feelings. [3] X Research source Maybe he’d lash out when you showed an “unpleasant” emotion or said, “It’s all in your head” when you relayed how you felt. Either way, sharing your emotions now may come with feelings of doubt and guilt, as you fear others will respond similarly. [4] X Research source How to cope: Know that it’s okay to put your walls down every once in a while—not everybody is out to get you. Start expressing your emotions slowly. For instance, tell a friend when you feel anxious in a store, and then move up to sharing how a recent breakup made you feel."

      "title": "You likely never had boundaries growing up, so they’re harder to make now.",
      "content": "You likely never had boundaries growing up, so they’re harder to make now. Narcissistic individuals expect their agenda to be the only agenda. Your father probably pushed aside your wants and needs to meet his. [5] X Research source Because of this, you may struggle to set healthy boundaries as an adult. Never saying “no” as a child can make it harder to say now. [6] X Research source How to cope: Practice setting boundaries one step at a time. Start by learning to say “no” to friends or work opportunities if your schedule is packed. Then, work your way up to only calling a toxic family member of friend once a month. Think of setting boundaries as any other healthy habit—the more you do it, the more routine it’ll be. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Your father’s harsh words have likely led you to doubt yourself. You may have never truly felt loved or valued with a narcissist raising you. Your father’s need for perfection and effort to crush your confidence to remain superior can continue to haunt you years later. [8] X Research source Perhaps you instinctually compare yourself to others or doubt your abilities. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source How to cope: Never let a narcissist determine your worth. You are an exceptional human being. Your father’s lack of empathy and respect doesn’t define you. Be proud of who you are , what you’ve done, and what you can do. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "If your father’s a narcissist, you probably talk negatively to yourself.",
      "content": "If your father’s a narcissist, you probably talk negatively to yourself. Growing up, you likely grew accustomed to backlash and consistent criticism. No matter what you did, nothing seemed good enough for him. Perhaps he guilt-tripped, shamed, or blamed you with statements like, “It’s your fault I’m not happy” or “I’ve done everything for you, and you’re ungrateful.” [11] X Research source This gaslighting behavior can lead you to be critical to yourself without even realizing it. How to cope: Overcome self-criticism by talking to yourself like you would any other friend. When something negative pops into your mind, ask yourself, “Would I tell this to my best friend?” If not, don’t say it to yourself! Instead, replace the negative thought with something positive.

      "content": "After being deemed unworthy, you probably strive to be perfect. You’re likely used to being held to high standards. Perhaps your father never batted an eye at your accomplishments or treated you like you were invisible until your wins made him look good (i.e., bragging to colleagues or friends about your accomplishments, even though he’s never expressed the same admiration to you). These are common narcissistic tendencies, and while they don’t excuse his behavior, they may describe your constant need to “be better.” [13] X Research source How to cope: Manage perfectionism by acknowledging what you’re scared of. If it’s your father’s high standards, ask yourself why. Then, shift your mindset to focus the attention back on you. Why do you want to achieve a goal or complete a task? This can help you identify your fears and reinvigorate your motivation.

      "content": "Being belittled can leave you with the constant worry of being alone. Your father may have always dropped the ball, and you likely still fear the dread of being forgotten or pushed aside to this day. Perhaps he even emotionally manipulated you with statements like, “If you don’t become an engineer, I’ll cut off my support.” [15] X Research source Because of this, you may struggle with abandonment issues or fear dating because you don’t want to be rejected. How to cope: Try deep breathing exercises or mediating when fear starts to overwhelm you. If the fear continues, talk to a therapist or counselor, as they’ll be able to help you find the root of the problem and safely overcome it.
