      "content": "Realize that this is a job, not a lifestyle. You must be motivated and driven as with any occupation. Take it seriously, it's a job, not a night out or an opportunity to show off. Go in on time and make sure you behave professionally and in line with the rules of the club. You will also need to know the law and be familiar with following local, state, or federal laws as the apply in your location. Some clubs require a background check and fingerprints as well as ID and a social security or national insurance number. Be prepared to provide these. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Assess your fitness level. Are you in reasonably good physical shape? You should be healthy, and while clubs are generally looking for someone slim and toned, there is room for all types of body shapes. A lot of girls worry about not having the right shaped body parts, there is no set size or shape for an exotic dancer. If you are a beginner, do yoga and stretching exercises to make your body flexible and dance well. Ensure your body is strong. A dancer should have a fit and flexible body."

      "title": "Get supplies.",
      "content": "Get supplies. You should have heels, 4-inch at minimum. Ask the other dancers or the club owner what they like performers to wear. Many dancers start off with platform heeled shoes to aid stability. Remember, stiletto heel shoes make your legs look thinner, so they might be a better bet when picking out shoes. Not all exotic dancers want the focus to be on their legs. Wear footwear you feel is appropriate. You'll also need a g-string or thong made of sturdy material, probably. The exact details of what you may or may not be allowed to wear will vary depending on where you are working. Online shopping might provide better materials than those at a local boutique. The laws vary, so make sure you check. Make sure you are waxed from the neck down; shaving will NOT do, especially if you have darker hair. Specialist exotic dance venues and those in Europe may have different preferences regarding body hair. No everyone wants to see stubble, and waxing will eliminate razor bumps in the bikini area. If you cannot stand waxing or are in between waxes, you can use make up to help cover anything. You'll want to learn to apply makeup well."

      "title": "Go for an audition.",
      "content": "Go for an audition. You can call the club and ask to set up an appointment to audition or simply stroll into the club of your choice (check the Strip Club List online for clubs in your area), and off you go. Make sure you are of age to dance erotically in your district. Some clubs have audition nights or amateur nights where you can go and try out. It is always best to call the club before and find out if this is their way. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a \"stage name\" for yourself.",
      "content": "Get a \"stage name\" for yourself. this will be your alter-ego for when you are at work. The most commonly used \"stage names\" are: Precious, Diamond, Barbie, Ferrari, etc. Instead of using one of the more common names listed, try being unique and think outside the box. Be creative with your \"stage name\". Come up with a name that is unlike all the rest. possibly one that no one else might possibly be using."

      "title": "Know that prostitution, or \"extras\", have no place in a club.",
      "content": "Know that prostitution, or \"extras\", have no place in a club. Moral judgments aside, it makes it harder for dancers to make money when this happens. Also you will be fired if the club finds out. Prostitution is a highly punishable crime in many areas and many clubs will have undercover cops. Make sure that you understand that even words can get you arrested even if you have no intentions of doing anything for extra money. YOU ARE AN ENTERTAINER, not a hooker. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Be mentally strong. Society can be very anti-sex worker, so because you are working in this field, it requires mental resilience. Customers will insult you, you may lose friends and family... but that reflects more on them than it does on you. Make sure you feel good about what you are doing and see it as a positive thing, this will allow you to stand strong against others."

      "title": "Learn from others.",
      "content": "Learn from others. When you start working, make sure you learn from the other girls and respect the way they work. Do not become overly friendly with them just to make more money, as they will see right through you! Expect that you will not do so well at first, but don't get disheartened. Learn one thing and get up and do it again but better!"
