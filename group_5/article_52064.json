      "content": "Clean your marble daily with water and dish soap. Fill a spray bottle with warm water and add in about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of a mild, non-abrasive dish soap. Just spray an even layer of the soapy water onto the surface, and gently rub it in with a soft microfiber cloth . If your cloth gets dirty with dust or dirt, be sure to rinse it off before wiping with it again. [1] X Research source If you’re washing a marble floor , then use a larger microfiber mop to spread the soapy water over the surface. Soapy water is usually strong enough to eat through soot if you’re cleaning a marble fireplace. Avoid using any acidic cleaners, such as lemon juice or vinegar, since they can leave marks on the marble’s surface."

      "content": "Rinse the soapy water off with a damp cloth. Wet a new non-abrasive cloth with clean water and wipe it over the surface. Lift up as much of the soapy residue as you can so it doesn’t dry onto the marble surface and make it look dull. For a marble floor, use a clean mop head or thoroughly wring out the old head before using it to rinse."

      "content": "Swap out dish soap for commercial marble cleaner once a week. Spray an even layer of your marble cleaner directly onto the surface. Use a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel to rub the cleaner into your marble. Use the cleaner at least once a week to help the marble retain its shine and to prevent anything on the surface from leaving a stain. [4] X Research source Always follow the directions on the cleaner’s packaging since they may vary. Avoid using other household cleaners like bleach or mineral spirits since they could further damage your marble."

      "content": "Treat organic stains with 12% hydrogen peroxide and ammonia . To clean marble countertops with coffee, tea, or food stains, wet the surface of the stain with your hydrogen peroxide used for hair bleaching and add in a couple of drops of ammonia. Gently work the solution into the stain with a microfiber cloth until you see it start to lift up. Try to clean up the stain as soon as they happen since they haven’t set in and will be easier to clean up. Ammonia is safe to mix with hydrogen peroxide but avoid using it with bleach or any other cleaners since it could create toxic fumes."

      "content": "Remove oil stains with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda paste. If your stain is from grease, cooking oil, or cosmetics, then mix together equal amounts of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda until they form a thick paste. Apply the paste over the oil stain and let it dry out overnight. The next day, use a plastic putty knife to scrape the dried paste off the marble to remove the stain. [5] X Research source The baking soda and peroxide will help draw the stain out from the stone and lighten the section of marble. Test the baking soda and peroxide mixture on a discreet area of the marble first to make sure it doesn’t leave any marks or damage."

[6] X Research source Apply the poultice to the rust stain so it’s completely covered, and let it dry out overnight. The next day, just use a putty knife or clean towel to break apart the poultice. If you can still see a rust stain, you can try applying another poultice to your marble. If the stain persists, then it may be permanent on the surface."

Sprinkle a bit of the marble polishing powder onto the surface with your etch marks. Wet the corner of a soft microfiber and rub the powder into the stone in a circular motion. Keep rubbing the powder in until the etch mark disappears and the marble shines. [7] X Research source"

Use a damp microfiber cloth to rub the compound into the marble using circular movements. Once the marble has a shiny, smooth appearance, wipe the rest of the powder off of the surface. [8] X Research source You can also use a rotary buffer to apply the polishing powder more quickly on larger surfaces, like a large tabletop or marble floor."

      "content": "Buff surface scratches out with 0000 steel wool . Keep the steel wool dry so you don’t damage your countertops. Lightly rub the steel wool over the surface with gentle pressure so the smaller scratches disappear. Lift up the steel wool and check the surface periodically to check that the scratches are gone so you don’t put in more work than you need to. Some marble manufacturers don’t recommend using steel wool since it’s abrasive and could affect the surface of your marble. Try testing the steel wool in a hidden area of the marble before using it on a scratch."
