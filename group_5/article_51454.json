      "content": "By default, there is no way to call your horse in Skyrim. Unlike other games with horses and riding mechanics, there is no keystroke or button press that will call your horse to your side. However, there are a few workarounds you can do to get your horse to your side easily: Fast travel to any location. When you fast travel, your horse will automatically appear at your side, no matter how short or far the distance is that you fast travel. Note that fast traveling does progress time in the game as if you'd walked there. [1] X Research source Go to your stable, if you have the Hearthfire DLC . [2] X Research source If you have Hearthfire, your homestead will be equipped with a stable. After you have a stable you can purchase a horse for 1,000 gold that will reappear at the stable when you travel to the homestead. [3] X Research source Get Arvak from the Dawnguard DLC . By completing the quest \"Find Arvak's Skull\" in the Soul Cairn you will learn the spell Summon Arvak. [4] X Research source You can then use this spell to summon the ghost horse Arvak anywhere in Skyrim. Arvak will appear for 60 seconds, but as long as you're mounted on him he will not disappear."

Bethesda allows Skyrim to be modded, though you should always do so at your own risk and only download and install mods that you trust. If you don't already have a Nexus Mods account, sign up for one now. Otherwise, log in if you're not already logged in. If you're on console, you won't be able to install this mod directly. You can search the list of mods available on console to see if there is a console mod that allows you to call your horse."
