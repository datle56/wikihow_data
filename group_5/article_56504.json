      "content": "Ask your mother, older sister, older relative, or any trusted female friend what she thinks about it. If she thinks you should buy a new cup bra, ask her to take you shopping. You probably don't need a fancy bra like from Victoria's Secret for your first bra; perhaps try Aerie, or even Macy's or discount stores like TJMaxx and Kohl's."

      "title": "Get a fitting.",
      "content": "Get a fitting. If you go to a Macy's or Aerie, find a salesperson and ask her to measure you. She'll tell you your bra size--it will be a number followed by a letter, such as 28A, 32B, 34D, 32C, etc. Pick out some different brands and styles of this size."

      "title": "Go into the dressing room and try the bras on.",
      "content": "Go into the dressing room and try the bras on. If your breasts do not fill out the bra, and there's a gap between the cup of the bra and the top of your chest, it's too big. If all the bras are too big, find a smaller cup size. The smallest is AAA. If that size is too big for you, you can stick with a training bra for now!"

    {
      "title": "Try on a bunch of different bras.",
      "content": "Try on a bunch of different bras. Move around in them. Wiggle--do your breasts feel supported? Try on a shirt on top of the bra--does it look smooth and natural? Once you find some bras you like--congratulations! Finding a good bra is not always so easy!"
