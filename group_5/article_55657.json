      "content": "Believe it or not, your emoji keyboard is a pretty powerful arsenal. Just a few emojis can turn up the heat, and lead the conversation in a whole new direction.

      "content": "Feel free to be as subtle or obvious as you’d like. Text message flirting comes with pros and cons—but testing the waters with a playful message is definitely one of the perks. Play it safe with a simple, flirty message, or take the plunge and let them know how you’re really feeling. [6] X Research source “Ready to have some fun?” or “Want to have this conversation in person?” might be some playful ways to hint at something more. “Our first kiss is going to be amazing!” could be a riskier but still effective way to let them know how you’re feeling."

      "content": "Explain how excited you are to meet up. You don’t have to explicitly ask for a kiss.

[7] X Research source You could say something like, “So excited to hang out with you tonight. It’s going to be a great time!” Be extra obvious by tossing a wink emoji at the end of your text."

      "content": "A cheesy story or suggestion can get the ball rolling. You might explain that you had a great dream about them, and would love to recreate it in real life. Or, you could take the more casual route and invite them over for some “Netflix and chill.” [9] X Research source For instance, you might say, “Hey cutie! Couldn’t stop dreaming about you last night. Once I woke up, I wanted to make it a reality.” You could also say, “Up for some Netflix and chill? Maybe we could skip over the Netflix part.”"

[11] X Research source You could say, “I’m trying to sleep, but I can’t stop thinking about you!” or “My to-do list is jam-packed today, but I wanted to text you first.” If you guys met in person and made a real connection, feel free to talk about it.
