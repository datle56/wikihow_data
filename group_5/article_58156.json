Use fine sandpaper and go over the cabinet to remove any loose paint or rust. Sanding will help the new paint to stick better. [1] X Research source If the cabinet drawer lock is sticking and not opening, you may have to pick it open. See How to Pick a Filing Cabinet Lock for help. Put something under the cabinet to protect the ground, such as a newspaper or a drop cloth. Be aware of anything that is outside that might get stuck in the paint."
