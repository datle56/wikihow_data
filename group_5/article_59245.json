      "content": "Determine the direction of the stainless steel’s grain. All stainless steel products have small parallel lines running across their surfaces; these lines are the steel’s grain. Look closely at the steel to see whether the grain runs horizontally from side to side or vertically up and down. When you clean and polish stainless steel, you rub back and forth in the same direction as the grain. [1] X Research source Going against the metal’s grain or rubbing in circles can worsen the scratches. Clean your stainless steel appliances and cookware as soon as you notice they’re dirty. Giving them a regular wipe-down helps prevent buildup that can lead to discoloration and even scratches."

Removing dirt and grime before you buff out the stainless steel’s scratches prevents any additional damage and gives you a smooth surface to work on. Just wipe the steel down in the direction of its grain with a soft sponge or microfiber cloth and warm soapy water. Or, spray it with a stainless steel cleaner. [2] X Research source Check your stainless steel’s user manual to see if it has a protective clear coat on it. The following scratch-removal tips work for stainless steel that isn’t coated. If your stainless steel has a protective coat, your best bet for repairing scratches is to polish it with a stainless steel polisher . [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the powdered cleaners into a paste with water. If you’re using a powdered cleaner like baking soda or Bar Keepers Friend, turn it into a paste before you apply it on the steel’s scratches. Just mix 1 tablespoon (14 g) of either powder with a few drops of water in a bowl. Stir the ingredients together to combine them, adding a few more drops of water as needed until you have a smooth paste. [5] X Research source If you add too much water, just add a little sprinkle of powder. You’re going for a paste with the consistency of toothpaste. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the cleaner or paste into the scratch in the direction of the grain.",
      "content": "Rub the cleaner or paste into the scratch in the direction of the grain. Spoon about a quarter of the paste onto a clean microfiber cloth . If you’re using a liquid cleaner, pour or spray a few drops of it onto a cloth. Then, use gentle, straight strokes to rub either cleaner into the scratch, working in the same direction as the stainless steel’s grain. [7] X Research source Toothpaste : If you’re using toothpaste, squeeze a dollop of non-gel whitening toothpaste on a microfiber cloth and rub it into the scratch. Because the compound isn't abrasive, it’s okay to rub back and forth over the scratch. Do not rub in circles though, as this can damage the surface further."
