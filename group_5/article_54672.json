      "title": "Rinse off the collard greens with cool running water.",
      "content": "Rinse off the collard greens with cool running water. Wash off both sides of each leaf, checking for dirt and insects as you go. Use your fingers to rub away any obvious patches of dirt. Once you’ve finished cleaning the leaves, set them aside on a dry paper towel or cutting board. [1] X Research source You can also place the collard greens in a colander to rinse them. However, make sure that both sides of the leaves get cleaned off if you do this."

      "title": "Cut off any excess stems from the leaves.",
      "content": "Cut off any excess stems from the leaves. Use a knife to trim down the collard greens until only the leaves remain. At this point, feel free to chop the greens into smaller pieces. You don’t need to finely chop them; instead, cut them in half, if you see necessary.

      "title": "Fill a large pot with water and set it to boil.",
      "content": "Fill a large pot with water and set it to boil. Pour enough water into a cooking pot to submerge all of your collard greens completely. Turn the stovetop to the highest heat possible to help the water boil more quickly. Wait for lots of steam and bubbles to be present in the water before you continue. [4] X Research source Boiling water is necessary to remove the raw surface layer from the leaves."

    {
      "title": "Boil the collard greens for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Boil the collard greens for 3 minutes. Dump the rinsed greens into the pot, making sure that all of the leaves are completely submerged. Use a wooden spoon or set of tongs to push down any floating leaves, if necessary. To keep your water temperature hot, place the lid on the pot while letting the collard greens soak for 3 minutes. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source The process of boiling leafy greens is also known as blanching."

      "title": "Chill the boiled leaves in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Chill the boiled leaves in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes. Fill a large bowl with cold water and several ice cubes. Use a pair of tongs to move your greens from the pot into the ice water. Soak the greens for 3 minutes to stop the cooking process and cool the leaves. [6] X Research source If you’re preparing a lot of collard greens at once, feel free to cool the leaves off in batches."

    {
      "title": "Drain out any excess water from the greens.",
      "content": "Drain out any excess water from the greens. Move the wet leaves into a colander, then hold the container over the sink. Wait for the extra water to drip out, or gently wiggle the colander to force out any remaining droplets. Once the collard greens are no longer dripping wet, set the colander aside. [7] X Research source If the greens are wet when they go in the freezer, then the extra water droplets on the leaves will also freeze. While it’s okay for the leaves to be slightly damp, you’re welcome to blot them dry with a paper towel, as well."

      "title": "Seal the leaves in freezer-safe plastic bags.",
      "content": "Seal the leaves in freezer-safe plastic bags. Stack the greens or leaf pieces into a large, freezer-safe plastic bag. Tightly package the greens to avoid trapping any excess air into the bag. Try and leave about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of space at the top so you can comfortably seal the bag off.

      "content": "Freeze the collard greens and use them within 10-12 months. Label the bag with the current date, so you can keep track of how old the greens are. To have the freshest and tastiest greens possible, try to eat them within 1 year of freezing! [9] X Research source If you didn’t blanch your greens, try to use them sooner rather than later."
