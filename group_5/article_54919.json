      "title": "Buy individual packs.",
      "content": "Buy individual packs. Individual packs of cards have a random assortment of card varieties, and typically include a few rare cards. Every booster pack is guaranteed 1 rare card, but may also include more. This includes particularly rare cards, such as holofoil, and “star” rare. The rares you get from booster packs are completely random. You may have to open many, many booster packs to find the one particular rare you want. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase promo tins.",
      "content": "Purchase promo tins. Promo tins typically come with a few booster packs, as well as a selection of specific rare cards. This can be a great way of achieving a particular rare (along with a few random ones), assuming it’s a rare that you want. [2] X Research source New Pokémon tins are regularly released as new sets of cards come out. Older tins are not always kept in stock however, so make sure you take advantage of tin releases."

      "title": "Purchase booster boxes.",
      "content": "Purchase booster boxes. A booster box contains 36 booster packs, though it does not come with a guaranteed ultra rare, like the tins. Buying a box is the most efficient way of obtaining a large amount of cards, and many retailers will offer a small discount for purchasing a box. Note that you will at least receive 36 rare cards by purchasing a box, and usually more than that. However, like buying individual packs, there is no guarantee of receiving a specific card that you desire."

      "title": "Buy from your local card shop.",
      "content": "Buy from your local card shop. Independent game and card shops will buy and sell “used” Pokémon cards. This is the perfect way to peruse a library of cards and purchase just the individual cards that you want. [3] X Research source Particularly rare cards will be quite expensive due to their high demand. Trade in a few cards that you don’t want to offset the high price. Check back every week or so – players will always be trading in cards they no longer need."

    {
      "title": "Buy from online retailers.",
      "content": "Buy from online retailers. There are a variety of online shops that will sell individual cards – sometimes even fresh from the pack. If you don’t have a local shop and have the means to do so, find a reputable website and try building your collection. Make sure you’re purchasing from a respectable company . If you are buying cards from an individual seller, such as through eBay, check their reviews and make sure you are purchasing exactly what you want. Online card shops may charge a premium for certain cards, particularly if they open new packs to acquire them. Think of it as a convenience fee, as not everyone is necessarily willing to sell off cards they don’t want."

      "title": "Look for cards at yard sales.",
      "content": "Look for cards at yard sales. Yard sales are a great place to find loads of cards. It's not uncommon for someone to get rid of their entire collection this way, whether it's someone who lost interest in the game, or a parent getting rid of a child’s old things. Pawn shops are another great place to find a large number of cards. Some people sell their collection to a pawn shop just to get them out of the way. You can find some hidden gems this way, and usually for cheap!"

      "title": "Trade with other players.",
      "content": "Trade with other players. Not every player will want the same cards for their deck. Try finding someone who has a card you need (and they don’t want), and see if you can reach a trade agreement. It doesn't have to be card for card. Sometimes trading a few cards for a single rare card is worth the trade. Game lobbies and shops are great places to meet other players, which can open up your trading opportunities. Check online to see what rare cards are available, or for resources that can help you design a deck."

      "title": "Put some cards on the line.",
      "content": "Put some cards on the line. Challenge your friends to a friendly game and wager one another’s cards! This adds an element of competition to card trading, and can be a good way of amassing additional cards that you can use for further trading. Make sure you don’t mind parting with the cards you put on the line. You don’t want to wager cards that are important to any of your decks. Keep things friendly! Such bets can get heated, even among friends, so make sure you are on good terms and agreeable with the person you are challenging."

      "title": "Play in local tournaments.",
      "content": "Play in local tournaments. The prizes for winning local tournaments includes a large number of cards. This can range from the latest tin, to a box or two of the latest card set. If you’re a particularly good player, this can be a great way of getting the game to “pay for itself.” [4] X Research source National tournaments tend to award actual money, rather than cards. Take care when entering tournaments. The price of a winning deck can be quite steep, and the skill and dedication required are immense!"
