      "content": "Mix 3 parts rubbing alcohol and 1-part ink in a spray bottle. Pour 3 parts 70% or more rubbing alcohol and 1-part acrylic ink in the color of your choice in a clean spray bottle. The acrylic ink can be bought at most craft stores. Gently shake the bottle to mix the ink and alcohol together. [1] X Research source You can also mix another color in another bottle if you plan to dye the braids more than one color. Use less water if you want a more vibrant color."

      "title": "Lay the braids flat on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Lay the braids flat on a flat surface. Put newspaper, plastic, or an old towel on a flat surface to protect the surface from the ink. Lay the braids out completely flat. None of the braids should be bent up or the dye job could come out uneven. [2] X Research source Put on gloves before you begin to dye the braids."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the braids with the ink mixture.",
      "content": "Spray the braids with the ink mixture. Once the mixture has been created, begin to spray the braids. If you want to dye all of the braids, thoroughly saturate them all the way through. If you only want to dye the ends, spray only the bottom of the braids. Flip the braids over and repeat on the back when you’ve sprayed the front of the braids. [3] X Research source If you want to add color to natural hair, then dye your hair first. It may not be safe to put the acrylic ink on your natural hair otherwise."

    {
      "title": "Let hair sit for twelve to twenty-four hours.",
      "content": "Let hair sit for twelve to twenty-four hours. Be sure that you’ve sprayed enough ink onto the braids before allowing them to dry. Every part of the hair that you want dyed should be saturated with color. Dye the braids before attaching them to your head and keep them on the flat surface to dry for the next twelve to twenty-four hours. The color of the braids will be more saturated the longer you allow them to sit. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the braids with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the braids with cold water. After drying the braids, rinse them under cold water. This will remove any excess ink. Then, hang them or lay them out flat to air dry. The drying process usually takes 3 to 4 hours, though it may be longer. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix water and ink in plastic bowls.",
      "content": "Mix water and ink in plastic bowls. Pour about one cup (236 mL) of water into a large plastic bowl. If you want a more saturated color, use less water. Then, pour a full 1-ounce bottle (29.6 mL) of ink into the bowl. You can add another half bottle of ink for a darker color. Use a wooden spoon to mix the water and ink. Repeat the process with another bowl and color of ink for the second color. You can mix inks to create your own color."

      "title": "Fold the braids in half.",
      "content": "Fold the braids in half. Secure the braid with a rubber band when you fold the braids in half. Folding the braids in half will allow each end to be one color and the middle of the hair to be another color. If you want the color to turn out differently, fold the braids at another place rather than in half."

      "title": "Dip one end of the braids in a plastic bowl.",
      "content": "Dip one end of the braids in a plastic bowl. This should be either the middle or the ends of the hair. Think where you’d like each color to be on the braids before dipping them. After you’ve dipped the braids in, leave out the end of hair you don’t want dyed. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes."

      "title": "Dip the other end of the braids in another bowl.",
      "content": "Dip the other end of the braids in another bowl. After 15 minutes, remove the braids from the first color. Let the braids drip dry for a moment and then put the other end of the braids in the other plastic bowl. Do not let the side of the braid that has already been colored interact with the second color. Let the braids sit for 15 minutes and then remove from the bowl. If you want some overlap in color, insert a little bit of the first color into the dye."

If you’re wanting a big change in color, make an appointment with a hair stylist if possible. It’s okay if you do not have the funds to go to a professional. Just take every precaution possible during the dyeing process. [6] X Research source If you decide to dye your own hair and mess it up, you can always call a professional to fix it. However, keep in mind that color correction services are typically more expensive than having your hair professionally dyed."

      "content": "Wait for the color to take. The instructions that came with your dye will indicate how long you should leave the dye on for. If you do not see a recommended amount of dye, check your progress after 15 minutes. Leave the color on for another 10 to 15 minutes if the color doesn’t look as vibrant as desired. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that the shade of your hair will affect how vibrant the color looks.
