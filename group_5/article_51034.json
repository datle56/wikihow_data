The best place to work is outside. If you can't work outside, open up a window or turn on a fan, and cover your work area with newspaper, a plastic tablecloth, or some old towels to prevent stains. [1] X Research source Bleach often has strong fumes which can cause headaches if you don't have enough fresh air."
