      "content": "Begin to count the sheep. Once you have a herd of sheep in the field, start to count each one, beginning from “1”. You may want to picture the sheep jumping over the fence in the field and count each sheep as it jumps, or you may simply count the sheep at random. There is debate that this method of counting sheep encourages sleep, as it forces you to use your brain to count the sheep and keep track of them as they jump over the fence. Simply counting the sheep in the field may be a more effective way to help you fall asleep. [1] X Research source"

If you can't seem to get to sleep by counting sheep, you may want to try doing a meditation exercise that uses deep breathing as you lay on your back in bed. This can help to calm and relax you into a deep sleep. Start by inhaling and exhaling deeply through your nose, breathing from your diaphragm, which is just under your ribs. As you inhale, think about relaxing all your muscles, from head to toe. As you exhale, imagine you are sinking deeper into your bed. Continue to do this, breathing deeply in and out. You may also want to imagine a calm, relaxing scene like a falling waterfall or a tropical beach to help calm your mind and body for rest."

      "content": "Consider taking sleeping pills. Sleeping pills can help you to fall sleep if counting sheep does not work and if you are struggling to get a good night's sleep. However, sleeping pills should only be a temporary solution to insomnia and restless sleep. Sleeping pills can often make your sleep issues work in the long term. You should only use sleeping pills for short term situations, such as to recover from jet lag or from a medical procedure. You should avoid using sleeping pills on a regular basis, as you may end up dependent on sleeping pills to get to sleep every night."

      "title": "Turn off all electronics.",
      "content": "Turn off all electronics. To prepare your body and brain for bed , you should switch off all electronics such as your phone, your computer, or your television. The light that emits from the screens on these electronics can stimulate your brain and reduce your brain’s ability to produce melatonin, a substance that helps you to sleep. You should also avoid bringing any electronics into your bed with you, as it may be more difficult to shut them off or block them out when you are trying to sleep. Rather than go on your phone or your computer when you are lying in bed, choose to do a relaxing activity that does not involve electronics. For example, reading a good book, writing in your journal, or talking quietly to your partner."

      "content": "Make your bedroom cool, quiet, and comfy. Create a comfortable atmosphere to encourage sleep by ensuring your bedroom is not too hot and not near any loud noises. Use heavy curtains or shades to block out the light from your windows and cover any electronics in your room with a blanket so the light does not create a glow in your room. You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes and block out the light. Layer your bed with blankets and sheets so you can shed layers as you get hot at night and so your body does not overheat."

      "content": "Set your alarm. Make sure you set any alarms before you get into bed so you do not have to get up once you are settled. You should try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every night so your body gets used to your sleep schedule and you are not overly tired during the day. If your sleep schedule is not consistent, you can fix your sleep schedule by noting if you are overly tired in the morning or if you oversleep and making small adjustments to your sleep schedule over a period of time. You will need to give your internal clock time to get used to your new sleep schedule, but as long as you commit to going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day and night, your sleep schedule should gradually become more regular."

      "content": "Find a comfortable sleep position. Some people like to sleep on their backs or stomachs and some people prefer sleeping on their left or right side. If you have a tendency to snore, you should avoid sleeping on your back or your stomach, as this can restrict your airways and lead to snoring. However, you should choose a sleep position that you find comfortable and natural, as this will likely allow you to get the best sleep. If your natural sleep position is on your back, you should use pillows to raise your head and ensure you have a comfortable, supportive mattress. If you are pregnant , you should sleep on your left side with a body pillow and several other pillows to make sure your sleep position is healthy for your child and comfortable for you."
