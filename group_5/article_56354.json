      "content": "Avoid routine. Simply put, an Aries man will lose interest the moment his relationship with you becomes too routine or burdensome. If you sense yourself falling into a routine with him, mix things up to prevent him from getting bored. Realistically speaking, there is no way that every day you spend with him can be completely unlike any other. If you see each other on a daily basis, though, you should try to do something new with him at least once or twice a week to throw off any routine you've developed."

      "content": "Move fast. If your relationship is still in an early stage, you need to keep the momentum going. The Aries man is not a fan of taking things slow. Get ready to make him fall fast or not at all. Of course, you also need to be honest with yourself about how ready you are to advance the relationship. He might be ready to take you to bed, but if you don't feel likewise, don't let his eagerness push you into something you don't want. If, however, you are ready to move forward, do so confidently and without hesitation."

      "title": "Surprise him.",
      "content": "Surprise him. Even though the Aries man will usually take the lead, he will enjoy a relationship with a woman who can keep him on his toes, as well. When he least expects it, surprise him with something new and exciting. If he gets a buzz of energy from being with you, he will want to be with you for as long as possible. One weekend, you could suggest trying something like bungee-jumping or rock climbing , especially if your Aries sweetheart has demonstrated an interest in similar activities in the past. You do not need to drag him there blindfolded, but simply suggesting the idea can be a nice enough surprise."

      "title": "Give the gift of experience.",
      "content": "Give the gift of experience. When you want to give your Aries guy a great gift, take him out on an adventure instead of buying him something tangible. He is far more likely to appreciate the excitement of adventure more than some dull trinket. Front-row seats to watch his favorite sports team or a long weekend camping trip will usually make a better present than something like a new CD."

      "title": "Let him do his own thing.",
      "content": "Let him do his own thing. An Aries man needs to feel free and independent, so he might not always invite you to take part in his latest and greatest adventure. [2] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. Try not to hold him back, though. A clingy woman is a turn-off for most Aries men.

An Aries man is not likely to beat around the bush and drop hints that things are over; if he loses interest, he will be honest about it. As such, you needn't worry that his sudden interest in hanging out with friends is a subtle indication that things are over between you."

      "title": "Be easygoing.",
      "content": "Be easygoing. Many Aries men have a tendency to be extremely bossy and do not appreciate being told what to do.

      "content": "Resist the temptation to fence him in. Unfortunately, many Aries men have wandering eyes. They might flirt with other women they meet regardless of whether or not the two of you are an official item. This might tempt you to keep him home or latch onto him when you head out, but doing so is more likely to drive him away than keep him looking in your direction. If his eyes do start to roam, skip the direct confrontation and focus on making him look back in your direction, instead. Try making eyes at another guy and letting your Aries man catch you doing so. His competitive nature will kick in and he will invest his energy back into wooing you."

      "content": "Challenge him to win your attention. If an Aries man feels smothered by your attention, he may lose interest. On the other hand, if you challenge him to hold your attention instead of worrying about keeping his, he will probably respond to the challenge more than adequately. It is important, however, to let him ultimately win once he accepts the challenge. Act disinterested at first, but once he starts trying to get your focus back on him, let him know that his efforts are working."

Athletic activities are a good way to bond with him, especially if those activities involve some level of challenge. Engage in a one-on-one race, game of basketball, or similarly competitive game. Keep in mind that Aries men hate routine, so your physical activities should not adhere to a strict schedule. In other words, a daily jog after work might not be the best thing to hold his attention.

      "content": "Engage in the occasional debate. Even though your Aries man needs to be right, he needs to be given the opportunity to prove how right he is in order to feel fully satisfied. You can and should challenge him on occasion, but keep in mind that you also need to let him win more than lose. Of course, if you feel strongly enough about something, you don't need to let him have his way or walk all over you.

      "content": "Never put him down. The ego of an average Aries man needs tender loving care. If you have a habit of embarrassing or correcting him in public, you are probably causing a good deal of damage to his sense of self-importance and causing his feelings for you to wane as a result. Making fun of his junior high photos is a definite no-no, and laughing about a mistake he made with his buddies or families will almost always start a huge fight and lead to seriously hurt feelings. In spite of how assertive the Aries male can be, he's actually rather sensitive and easily hurt."

      "content": "Coax him with loving words and gestures. It is true that most Aries guys are impatient and independent, but in order to make the relationship last for a long time, you need to encourage him to grow emotionally. The best way to do so is with obvious, tangible gestures of affection. Deep down, he fears rejection, and continual reassurance of your acceptance will go a long way. Don't be afraid of coming on too strong. A frequent “I love you” or “I can't wait to see you” text is perfectly acceptable, as long as he hasn't told you to back off or stop. Likewise, letting him know that he's been on your mind all day will be a major compliment and will usually go over quite well."
