      "content": "Soak up the excess oil with a paper towel. Blot as much oil as you can so the countertop is easier to clean. Try to do this as soon as possible, so the oil doesn’t have as much time to stick and stain the counter. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir a small scoop of baking soda with a spoonful of water until a paste forms.",
      "content": "Stir a small scoop of baking soda with a spoonful of water until a paste forms. Spoon your desired amount of baking soda into a small bowl, this mix in a small spoonful of water until a paste forms. You don’t need to use an exact amount of either ingredient—just make enough paste to completely coat the oil stain on your counter. [2] X Research source For instance, if the stain is about the size of a grape, you may only need 1 tbsp (14.4 g) or so of baking soda, along with 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of water. A larger spill may need ¼ cup (45 g) of baking soda and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water. Experiment with different ratios until you get a paste! You probably won’t need a lot of water for this."

      "title": "Spoon the paste over the entire stain.",
      "content": "Spoon the paste over the entire stain. Spread a thick layer of baking soda over the oil. Do your best to cover the entire stain, so the cleaner can be as effective as possible. Feel free to make more paste if you don’t have enough at first! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Tape a large section of plastic wrap over the paste.",
      "content": "Tape a large section of plastic wrap over the paste. Rip off a section of plastic wrap that’s large enough to cover all of the baking soda. Take a few strips of masking tape and secure them along the sides of the wrap to hold it in place. [4] X Research source If you don’t have plastic wrap, any kind of wax or parchment paper can work in a pinch."

      "title": "Let the baking soda sit for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the baking soda sit for 24 hours. Give the paste a day to soak into the oil stain, then remove the plastic wrap from the countertop. If you want to be extra safe, let the paste sit for several days. [5] X Research source If the stain is really bad, you may want to leave the paste in place for up to 3 days."

      "title": "Rinse off the baking soda paste with cool water and a clean cloth.",
      "content": "Rinse off the baking soda paste with cool water and a clean cloth. Soak a soft cloth in water and wipe off the paste. At this point, double-check to make sure that the oil stain is completely gone. [6] X Research source If the stain is still visible, make a new batch of baking soda paste and wrap it up with plastic wrap for 2-3 days."

      "title": "Dry off the counter with a towel.",
      "content": "Dry off the counter with a towel. Use a microfiber cloth or soft towel to wipe away any water or baking soda leftover on the counter. Once your counters are dry and clean, you can get back to business in your kitchen! [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean up spills as soon as they occur.",
      "content": "Clean up spills as soon as they occur. Don’t be discouraged if you accidentally spill something on your granite countertop. Instead, use a paper towel or soft cloth to wipe up the stain as quickly as possible. If you don’t take care of a spill right away, it may be harder to clean up later. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak a soft sponge with water and dish soap.",
      "content": "Soak a soft sponge with water and dish soap. Fill your sink or a small bowl with warm water. Mix in a pea-sized amount of dish soap into the water until you see suds. At this point, dip a soft sponge into the soapy water to get started. [9] X Research source A microfiber cloth can also work well for this. Be sure to wring out the sponge or cloth before you start cleaning. Soapy water is a great all-purpose cleaner for granite."

Depending on the size of your countertops, this may take several minutes to do. [10] X Research source Stuck-on food may require a little extra elbow grease to clean off."

Once you’ve dried off the surface, double-check that there’s no leftover moisture on the granite, which could result in streaks later on.
