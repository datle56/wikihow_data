      "content": "“Mixed signals” describes someone's inconsistent romantic behavior. In dating, “mixed signals” are when someone’s words and actions make it hard to tell what they want from a relationship. They’re hot and they’re cold. They make plans, then bail last minute. They tell you they’re in it for the long term, but shy away from any sort of commitment. Ultimately, they make you confused about the nature and even status of the relationship. [1] X Research source Mixed signals can happen at pretty much any stage of a relationship, whether it’s been just 1 date, or even after the relationship ends. “Mixed signals” can also be a more general term; it doesn’t just apply to relationships. You might get mixed signals from your job, family, or even friends."

      "title": "They’re not sure about their own intentions, or fear commitment.",
      "content": "They’re not sure about their own intentions, or fear commitment. Sometimes, people send mixed signals because they’re still figuring out what they want from romance. Maybe one moment they think they want something serious, and that’s what they tell you, but the next they get cold feet and start backing away. If someone doesn’t have a goal or future in mind, or is afraid of making those plans, they’re more likely to be inconsistent as they figure out what they want. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Example: They say they want kids, but then act annoyed or off-put whenever they interact with someone else’s kids. How to interpret this: They may be unsure of their own feelings, or feel pressure from outside sources to have a family. They probably have a little more thinking to do before they start a family."

      "title": "They’re hoping you make the first move.",
      "content": "They’re hoping you make the first move. Mixed signals can also be a case of shyness, or even submissiveness, especially at the start of a relationship. Being a little inconsistent or unpredictable can be a way of goading another person into making a move , being more forthright, or taking charge in the dynamic, so that they don’t have to do it themselves. Example: They keep suggesting a coffee date, but never propose a time and place, or even decline concrete plans. How to interpret this: They're probably interested in you, and hope that you’ll be more aggressive in your romantic pursuit. Try scheduling a date. If they don't follow through or blow you off, your time might be better spent connecting with someone else."

    {
      "title": "They’re trying to catch your attention.",
      "content": "They’re trying to catch your attention. It’s not the most sound dating advice, but it is classic: play hard to get to keep you on your toes and interested. Some people send mixed signals on purpose as a way to entice you and keep you curious, hoping that you’ll stay invested. But this kind of thing can’t last forever, and becomes pretty tiring for the person being led on. [3] X Research source Example: They usually act warm and friendly toward you, but occasionally their mood becomes chilly. How to interpret this: They may be hoping you’ll work harder to overcome their stonewalling after you’ve gotten a taste of their good side. Address the issue directly with them by letting them know that you aren't a fan of hot and cold behavior."

      "title": "They have personal issues, or even a personality disorder.",
      "content": "They have personal issues, or even a personality disorder. Poor communication can sometimes be caused by bad experiences in past relationships, or personal struggles like insecurity or anxiety. [4] X Research source Or, someone may suffer from any number of personality disorders that make clear communication a struggle, like borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder. Example: They cancel plans after you’re a little slow to reply, thinking that your delay means you're not interested. How to interpret this: They may be making assumptions based on their past relationships, and need a little reassurance from you. Be direct and let them know how you feel and what you want."

      "title": "They’re doing it unintentionally, or it’s a misunderstanding.",
      "content": "They’re doing it unintentionally, or it’s a misunderstanding. Sometimes, mixed signals are truly just a case of crossed wires. They might say something harmless or even positive that makes sense to them, but their meaning doesn’t totally come across, and it gets interpreted as something negative. That’s why it’s best to communicate clearly and honestly, whenever possible, and avoid playing the mixed signals game. [5] X Research source Example: They bail on two plans in a row without much explanation, and leave you feeling like they’re not interested. How to interpret this: They may be taking care of private matters that keep getting in the way. Ask them directly if they're interested and ready to commit to plans. If they continue to blow you off, it's probably a sign to back off and find someone who will invest their time and attention in a relationship with you."

The next moment, they give you the cold shoulder, and you’re left wondering what you did to make them shun you. Or, their friendly words don’t match their closed-off body language.

This is also sometimes called “breadcrumbing.” They drop little hints and bits of information that suggest they’re all-in, or that they’re committed, but never actually show meaningful commitment. [8] X Research source They may not know exactly what they want, and are only saying what they think you want to hear. Or, they may just be keeping their options open, at your expense. Breadcrumbing can often lead to a “ situationship ”—a romantic relationship that’s only vaguely defined.

But when something else grabs their attention, or it’s time to do some of the harder things in a relationship (like supporting each other emotionally), they act like being together is some huge burden. It can sometimes feel like they’re only in it to have fun, but when the time comes to put their money where their mouth is, they vanish. [10] X Research source"

Clinical psychologist Sarah Schewitz says that good communication involves “sharing how you feel, not bottling things up,” and “understanding your partner’s perspective.” When you lay it all on the table, you show your partner that it’s okay to be open and honest with their own feelings and desires. For example, say, “I’ve been having trouble figuring out how you feel about our relationship, and here’s why. I really value you and want us to be happy, so can we talk about this?” In gentle language, explain your concerns, and how you envision your communication improving."

That doesn’t mean you’re not being hurt, but it’s good to keep this in mind when you discuss communication with them. Avoid placing blame, and remember that a successful relationship requires collaboration and teamwork. When discussing the topic, use “I” statements, and focus on the facts and how they made you feel. For example, say, “When plans get canceled last-minute so frequently, I feel like my time isn’t being valued.”"

Clinical psychologist Sarah Schewitz suggests that sometimes, couples therapy is needed to work through baggage from a past relationship, so that it’s not brought into the current relationship. Consider talking to a professional together, which can help both of you learn more about your needs, communication styles, and how to navigate them."

      "content": "Consider moving on altogether. If, after a fair and honest talk, the mixed signals keep coming, it might be best to reconsider your relationship with them. A healthy relationship can’t work without open communication, and if they can’t communicate openly, it could be time to find someone who will. Always prioritize your mental health and emotional needs, and don’t be afraid to bail if the other person doesn’t have your best interest in mind. Of course, you may need to stay patient in certain situations, like if their mixed signals are caused by anxiety, low self-esteem, or personality disorders. Dating coach Candice Mostisser encourages being frank with your feelings and intentions, saying, “If they’re into it, they’re into it. If not, at least you can move on sooner rather than later.”"

[19] X Research source People send mixed signals when they're struggling with an internal conflict. It's a sign that your relationship could benefit from open, honest communication. Have a conversation with the person and calmly let them know that they're sending you mixed signals. Give some examples and let them know how it makes you feel. Actively listen to their response so you can judge whether or not they're interested in you or just making excuses, and decide whether or not to pursue the relationship from there."
