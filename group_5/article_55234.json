  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Pretend you’re not feeling well.",
      "content": "Pretend you’re not feeling well. On the day of the party, text your friend saying that you think you’re getting sick. You could say that you ate something bad and are developing food poisoning symptoms, or that you’re coming down with a nasty cold. If you regularly get migraines or another type of physical ailment, these also make good excuses. Your friend will likely have sympathy for you as you deal with this “illness,” so they’re less likely to be offended that you can’t make it. Additionally, nobody wants someone throwing up or coughing uncontrollably at their party, so the host will likely think your absence is for the best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say your pet or someone you live with is sick.",
      "content": "Say your pet or someone you live with is sick. Tell the host that your pet, roommate, or family member has come down with an illness, and you need to stay home to take care of them. The host will likely show concern and sympathy for the situation. Plus, if you say that a roommate or family member has something contagious, the host will probably agree that it’s best you stay home to avoid spreading it to anyone else at the party."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say there’s been a family emergency.",
      "content": "Say there’s been a family emergency. Unforeseen circumstances can always come up, so the host will likely be understanding about this. And, since family emergencies can be sensitive subjects, they probably won’t press you for details if you say you aren’t comfortable sharing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell the host an unexpected work commitment came up.",
      "content": "Tell the host an unexpected work commitment came up. Say that your boss just gave you a last minute project that needs to get done ASAP. Or, say that a coworker got sick and can’t make their shift, and they begged you to cover it for them. Most people understand that it’s hard to get out of work commitments, so the host probably won’t give you a hard time about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you have a different commitment on the day of the party.",
      "content": "Say you have a different commitment on the day of the party. You could say that you already RSVP’d yes to someone else’s party, that someone is visiting you from out of town on that day, or that you have an important appointment scheduled during the time of the party. When the day of the party arrives, just make sure to keep up with the ruse that you’re attending this other event (i.e., don’t make any social media posts revealing that you aren’t where you said you would be). Also, if you say you have plans with another friend, make sure this friend is someone the host doesn’t know, so they won’t find out this isn’t true."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say that you’re trying to save money and you can’t afford it.",
      "content": "Say that you’re trying to save money and you can’t afford it. Maybe you’re supposed to celebrate a friend’s birthday at a bar or restaurant, which would require you to buy food, drinks, and Uber rides. Or, maybe you have children, and you would need to pay for a babysitter if you attended the party. If any of these circumstances apply, just tell the host that you’re in a tough spot financially, and you’re going to have to opt out of the party to save money."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say you’re having car troubles.",
      "content": "Say you’re having car troubles. If you’re declining the invite a few days in advance, tell the host that your car broke down and will be in the shop for a few days, so you have no way to get to the party. If you’re trying to get out of the party at the last minute, tell them that you got a flat tire or got into a fender bender on the way to the party, so you can’t make it."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you’re a kid or a teenager, blame your parents.",
      "content": "If you’re a kid or a teenager, blame your parents. Tell your friends that your parents are making you stay home to babysit a sibling, or forcing you to have a family dinner at your house that night. Another iron-clad excuse is that you're grounded; everyone will understand that there's no way you can come to a party."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend you have too much homework to do.",
      "content": "Pretend you have too much homework to do. If you’re a student, tell your friend that you really wish you could attend the party, but you’re way behind on studying or assignments. Your friend will likely understand that school and grades come first! If you go with this excuse, just make sure you don’t make any posts on social media showing that you’re out doing something else, instead of staying home to study."
    },
    {
      "title": "RSVP “no” as soon as possible.",
      "content": "RSVP “no” as soon as possible. When you want to decline an invitation , “the number one rule is to respond immediately,” explains Claytor. [1] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. Don't put off telling the host that you can’t make it—they may build up an expectation of your attendance and feel more disappointed when you end up canceling at the last minute. It’s more polite and considerate to let your host know you won’t be attending as early as possible. This also gives the host a chance to adjust their plans to accommodate your absence. They may want to order a bit less food for the party, or invite someone else in your stead, so it’s helpful for them to know that you aren’t coming in advance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Deliver the news in person or over the phone.",
      "content": "Deliver the news in person or over the phone. If the party is very important to the host (a birthday party, anniversary party, or baby shower, for example), Claytor explains that it’s best to decline in person or over the phone, rather than via text or email. [2] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. The conversation will feel more personal and sincere, and you’ll be better able to explain why you can’t attend."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strike the right tone.",
      "content": "Strike the right tone. People react to disappointing news in different ways, so there’s no single right way to go about declining the invite. Depending on the personality of the person you’re breaking the news to, you’ll want to have a different attitude and tone. For example: If you think the person will be offended or sad, be as apologetic as possible. If you think the person will try to pressure or guilt you into attending, be firm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a clear reason for missing the party.",
      "content": "Give a clear reason for missing the party. If you just tell the host that you don’t “feel” like it, you’re more likely to hurt their feelings. Giving a more specific reason is usually the best way to go (unless your specific reason is that you just don’t like the host). Some examples why you don’t want to attend a party might include: [3] X Research source You have a previous engagement at that time. Someone you would like to avoid will be attending the party. You have too much work or studying to catch up on. You generally don’t feel comfortable in crowded, hectic party environments. You’re feeling burnt out lately, and you need to recharge your social battery. You’re going through something personal (mental health issues, family drama, etc) and you just don’t feel up to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't over-explain yourself.",
      "content": "Don't over-explain yourself. When you talk for too long about why you can't attend a party, you give the host more time to try to convince you that you should attend. Plus, “you’re not obligated to give an in-depth explanation,” Claytor explains. [4] X Expert Source Tami Claytor Etiquette Coach Expert Interview. 16 February 2022. Let the host know the basic reason you won’t be coming, then move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer to help with the party beforehand.",
      "content": "Offer to help with the party beforehand. Even if you can't attend the party yourself, you can still help make it a success by offering to lend a hand with the planning and preparation. This will demonstrate to the host that you value their friendship, and that you would attend the party if you could."
    },
    {
      "title": "Promise to make it up to them.",
      "content": "Promise to make it up to them. If you have to miss an event, make plans to catch up with the host when you have more time. [5] X Research source Try to plan a different activity as close to the party as possible, so you can show an interest in what you missed. This will show the host that you care about them, even though you couldn’t make it to their event. If you declined the invite because crowded parties aren’t your scene, “ask them if they’d like to do a different activity in the future that may be more in alliance with something you enjoy,” suggests Dr. Berasi. “This way, you’re honoring your needs and also letting them know you value them.” [6] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021."

      "title": "If you’re already at the party, you can easily make an early exit.",
      "content": "If you’re already at the party, you can easily make an early exit. If you want to make an appearance for a few minutes, but you don’t feel up to staying the whole time, here are a few good excuses you can use: Say you have to be up early the next morning, so you can only stay for a little bit. Say your babysitter or pet sitter was only available until a certain time, so you’ll need to go home early to relieve them. Say that you’re suddenly feeling sick (you ate something that disagreed with you, you drank too much alcohol, you got a migraine out of the blue, etc). If you still live with your parents, say that they enforce a strict curfew, or that they just called you and said you need to come home right now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your lie simple.",
      "content": "Keep your lie simple. Lie as little as possible, without elaboration. An elaborate story about why you can’t attend a party will seem suspicious, and will also be more difficult to keep track of if someone asks you about it later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up your lie ahead of time.",
      "content": "Set up your lie ahead of time. If the party is a few days away and you know you don’t want to attend, do some groundwork ahead of time to deflect suspicion. [7] X Research source For example, try reaching out to the host a day or two before the party to let them know that you think you’re coming down with an illness. This establishes that you aren’t feeling well, so your excuse seems even more believable on the night of the party."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep track of your lie.",
      "content": "Keep track of your lie. Even if the lie is just a little white lie, you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings by getting caught. Keep track of exactly what you tell people and who you tell it to, so that you don’t end up telling conflicting stories."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain the appearance of your lie.",
      "content": "Maintain the appearance of your lie. For example, if you tell the host you’re feeling sick or you’re staying home to study, don’t make any posts on social media revealing that you’re actually out doing something else. This is sure to alert the host to your lie, and it will probably hurt their feelings, too. If you are doing something else with other friends on the night of the party, ask them not to post any photos or videos of you while you’re there."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t be too hard on yourself for lying to get out of going to the party.",
      "content": "Don’t be too hard on yourself for lying to get out of going to the party. Studies show that lying is a regular part of daily life even for people we’d otherwise consider moral, upstanding individuals. [8] X Research source When people lie to ease social tensions, rather than to serve their own purposes, a white lie might be a better option than the truth. Plus, research shows that people usually overestimate the negative consequences of turning down an invitation. [9] X Research source In other words, the host will most likely understand, and chances are it won’t have lasting negative effects on your relationship. Social burnout is a real thing, and we all need a break from events sometimes.
