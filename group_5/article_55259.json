      "title": "Understand how this method works.",
      "content": "Understand how this method works. Gold rings require only one resource—a gold ingot—and there is an entry-level spell that you can use to turn iron ore, which is the cheapest and most widely available ore, into gold ore. This makes gold rings the easiest, quickest, and cheapest item to craft in large batches while leveling efficiently. [1] X Research source By crafting numerous gold rings, your character's Smithing will level quickly. You can sell the gold rings for significantly more than you spent on the iron ore to make them, meaning that you turn a profit ."

      "content": "Obtain the Transmute Mineral Ore spell. You can find the Transmute Mineral Ore spell tome on a table next to a bed in the Halted Stream Camp, which is northwest of the Whitewatch Tower (or roughly north of Whiterun). [2] X Research source To learn the Transmute Mineral Ore spell, simply find its book in the \"Books\" section of the inventory and select it."

    {
      "title": "Make sure that you have enough Magicka.",
      "content": "Make sure that you have enough Magicka. Most characters start out with 100 Magicka, while the cost of transmuting ore without any buffs or magic-altering equipment is 88 Magicka. This means that you'll be able to transmute, but only barely; if possible, find clothing that raises your Magicka (or reduces alteration spell costs), or select Magicka as the attribute to improve when leveling up."

      "title": "Travel to the Whiterun blacksmith.",
      "content": "Travel to the Whiterun blacksmith. Whiterun is the first large city to which you travel. When you arrive at Whiterun, you'll spawn just inside of the city gates; the blacksmith's place is the first building on the right. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Buy iron ore.",
      "content": "Buy iron ore. There are a couple of places in Whiterun from which you can buy iron ore: [4] X Research source Warmaiden's - The shop into which the blacksmith shop is built. Speaking with Ulfberth War-Bear in the shop will allow you to purchase items. Adrianne - Often found outside working the furnace, Adrianne holds different (albeit smaller) stock than Ulfberth. Belethor's General Goods - Found to the right of the main staircase in the courtyard with the well. Belethor runs a general store that typically stocks a few pieces of ore."

      "title": "Turn all of the iron ore into gold ore.",
      "content": "Turn all of the iron ore into gold ore. Equip the Transmute Mineral Ore spell, use it once to turn a piece of iron ore into silver ore, and then use it once more to turn the silver ore into gold ore. Repeat until you have no more iron or silver ore. [5] X Research source As mentioned above, you may have to \"wait\" between transmutations before you can cast again."

      "content": "Create gold rings. Once you have your gold ingots, all that's left to do is create the rings themselves. Open the forge, select JEWELRY , find the Gold ring option, and select it until it's greyed out. Each gold ingot creates two gold rings."

      "title": "Sell your rings to Belethor.",
      "content": "Sell your rings to Belethor. Once you've exhausted your gold ingots, you can sell the rings for a profit. Warmaiden's won't buy non-combatant apparel from you, but Belethor will. If your rings' value exceeds Belethor's budget, buy some items (e.g., more ore) to balance out the cost."

From this point, you can repeat the whole cycle: buy as much iron (and silver, and gold) ore as possible, transmute everything to gold ore, smelt gold ingots, and use the ingots to craft rings.
