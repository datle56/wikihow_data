      "content": "Lift up part of the gel nail. Wait until the nails are already chipped. Find a loose spot and lift up part of the gel nail with your fingernail or a pair of tweezers. Waiting around a week or two before trying to peel off the gel nails will reduce the damage done to your natural nails, since the gel will have had time to loosen and chip off."

      "content": "Pour water over the lifted edge and push the gel polish off. Put your finger under lukewarm running water. Using your free hand, place a finger underneath the lifted gel nail and gently push it off your natural nail. Be patient and go slow so you won’t damage the natural nail underneath."

      "content": "Use olive oil or cuticle oil if the nail won’t come off with water. If you are finding it difficult to peel the nail off under running water, try using olive oil or cuticle oil instead. Cover the gel nail and the fingernail you are using to push the gel nail off with oil. Then, slide your nail under the gel nail and gently push it off. Apply more oil as needed. You can also use an orangewood stick instead of your fingernail to gently push the gel nail off."

      "title": "Buff off any remaining gel residue with a nail file.",
      "content": "Buff off any remaining gel residue with a nail file. Even after you have pushed off the gel nail, there may be some gel left on your fingernail. Dry the nail and use a nail file to buff it off with gentle back and forth movements. Be sure to only buff off the gel residue and not your natural nail. Most nail files have a coarse side and a smooth side. The coarse side is best for shaping your nails. This side will look and feel a lot bumpier. For buffing the surface of the nail, use the smoother side of the file."

Continually move the file around your nail so you never feel a burning sensation. Move slowly and be patient: it will take some time to file down all the gel nail polish. Wipe away any dust that gathers on the nail as you file.

But once you have soaked your nails, it will be easier to remove them with whatever acetone-free method you choose. If you choose to file off the gel nails after soaking, be sure that your nails are totally dry before you start. This will make the filing much easier."
