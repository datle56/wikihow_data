Place one hand on the person's chin, tilt up their head slightly, and pinch their nose closed. Then, make a seal around their mouth with your mouth, breathe in and blow the breath into their mouth. You should see their chest rise as you deliver the rescue breath and then fall as you remove your mouth from their mouth. [4] X Research source Deliver one breath every five seconds."

There are usually two – one at each end of the syringe. A syringe is not a needle, it's a plastic device that holds the needle – or in this case, what the Narcan screws onto. You can find Narcan through the getnaloxonenow.org website."

[7] X Research source If they are not breathing or are breathing fewer than 8 times per minute, give them a few rescue breaths before administering Narcan.

Automatic injection devices (Evzio) are sometimes available. These have voice guidance that can direct you or another on how to use the device. Use it once then throw it away. This is the BEST OPTION if you do not have medical training. You will probably not be able to administer Narcan to yourself if you are overdosing.
