It can be totally frustrating and confusing when gaslighters try to say, “I didn’t say/do that” or “That’s not what happened,” in order to get away with bad behavior. [2] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. They might even try to change the rules or expectations on you after something has already happened. For example, if your parent says you can stay out until 10 o’clock, and you come home on time, a gaslighter might claim they expected you to be home by 9 o’clock. [3] X Research source If you feel like it's safe to confront the gaslighter, respond by saying, “No. I know what happened. This is what happened…” If you don't want to argue with the gaslighter say, \"I'm not getting pulled into this,\" and walk away. If you can't walk away, ignore the gaslighter as much as possible. [4] X Research source Even when a gaslighter tries to make you apologize or feel bad through their lies, stay strong. Don’t apologize or make self-deprecating comments. Your experience and the truth matter!"

      "content": "If you feel safe doing so, defend yourself by setting clear boundaries. When someone pushes past one of your emotional boundaries with mean language, you might feel really hurt, angry, or upset. Listen to your body’s response and acknowledge that you’re allowed to feel that way. Then, respond by telling the gaslighter how you feel, and let them know you don’t want to talk to them if they’re going to treat you that way. [5] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 December 2020. If they ignore your emotional boundaries, try to leave the room or situation. [6] X Research source Say, “I’d prefer if you spoke to me in a more polite way.” Respond to a gaslighter’s hurtful claims or tone by saying something like, “It’s hard for me to communicate with you when you call me names like ‘stupid.’” Respond to an accusation like “You’re too emotional” or “Well, if you hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have punished you” by saying, “I understand why you might feel that way, but I feel a different way, so I think the situation is unfair.” [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

If you live at home and are still in school, join more clubs or participate in afterschool programs to reduce the time you have to spend at home. If you live far away, set a rule for how often to communicate with your parents. If you feel like it’s safe to bring up these boundaries in a conversation, communicate your boundaries to your parents. [8] X Research source “I’d prefer if you just came to my apartment for dinner instead of staying for the weekend.” “Every day, I’m going to go over to a friend’s house to study. I’ll be back after dinner.” “I’ll call you every Saturday, but I won’t take your calls throughout the workweek.”"

You’re an incredible person who has so much to offer, but when you’re dealing with a gaslighter, it can be hard to remember that.

When you have proof that shows a gaslighter’s lies versus the real situation, you can affirm what you know to be true. Furthermore, if the abuse escalates, you can present the evidence to the authorities. [15] X Research source You can record audio or video on your phone to catch a gaslighter being verbally abusive or lying. If you have a trusted friend or know a mental health professional, call them and keep them on the phone when you’re arguing with a gaslighting parent so you have a witness. Be very careful about storing the evidence where a gaslighter can find it. Upload digital recordings, photos, and videos to the cloud so that you have a backup."

It can feel really tough to let go of a connection with someone, but it’s an important step towards embracing a new life full of positive relationships. Gaslighters are often people with borderline or narcissistic personality disorders who might never recognize, genuinely apologize, or feel remorse for the way they treat you. You deserve more than that! When you choose to move on instead of waiting for an apology, you open the door to pursuing meaningful, constructive connections with other people in your life.

[18] X Research source “I’m happy to come home for two days over the holidays, but I’d prefer not to visit during the year.” “I’m only comfortable with talking to you when someone else, like Mom or my sister is around.” If your gaslighting parent tries to communicate to you through family friends or relatives, say, “I’d like to keep that relationship private. I’d prefer not to talk about my mom/dad/parents.” Join a support group for gaslighting or survivors of narcissistic abuse."

When you go to family therapy, you’ll all talk to the therapist together in order to identify your family’s conflicts and problem-solve. If you’re struggling to feel heard at home, a therapist can help make sure you get to voice your perspective. However, keep in mind that it’s very tough to get gaslighters to go to therapy and they’ll often refuse to admit they’re causing problems. To find a therapist, ask your primary care doctor for a referral or find one online. You can also ask a local church, mental health organization, or employee assistance program for a referral."
