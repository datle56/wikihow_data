If your partner is around, ask them to let you have just a few minutes to gather your thoughts before you two talk again. When you’re alone, you can work on calming yourself down and thinking about what you’d like to say next. [1] X Research source This is a great technique to use during arguments or big fights. Giving yourself and your partner a moment away from each other lets you both gather your thoughts without emotions clouding them."

If your initial reaction is extreme anger, take a brief pause before saying anything out loud. [4] X Research source If you’re talking with your partner and they ask why you aren’t saying anything, let them know that you’re thinking about what you’re going to say next.

Go to source Generalizing: Saying that your partner ALWAYS does something, or NEVER does something. (“You NEVER take out the trash” or “You ALWAYS cut me off when I’m speaking”). Blaming: Your first reaction is to externalize blame when something goes wrong. You may blame your partner for things that happen to you instead of taking responsibility. (If you leave your phone on a bus, you blame your partner for distracting you). Mind reading: Assuming that your partner is purposefully hurting you, ignoring you, or upsetting you. (If your partner doesn’t do the dishes, you assume that they are avoiding them as a way to get back at you). Looking for the final straw: Actively looking for things to be upset about or only focusing on negative things. Often, this occurs one small thing at a time, until you reach the “final straw” and explode."

Then, ask yourself: [9] X Research source ”Is my perception an accurate and valid approach to the situation?” ”Is there something I can do about this?” ”Is this ruining the rest of my day?

However, you should actually try to work with your partner to find a resolution that satisfies both of you. In the end, you should both feel like you’ve “won.” [10] X Research source You can help this along by using “I” statements.

When an argument is resolved, try not to bring it up again in any further disagreements. [14] X Research source Some situations are so tough that they take a long time to forgive. If you aren’t sure that you can forgive your partner, it may be time to seek couple’s counseling."
