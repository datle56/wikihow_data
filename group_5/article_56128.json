      "content": "Visit a bathroom showroom to pick out your new faucet. If you’re replacing an existing faucet, choose the same style of faucet already in place to make installation easiest. If not, remove the old parts and take them to your local hardware store to accurately match the new components. Many shower components come in pre-packaged sets, so you’ll have everything you need. There are 3 styles of shower faucets available: [1] X Research source Single-handled shower faucets have a tee connection to both hot and cold water supplies and control water temperature and water flow with just 1 handle. Double-handled shower faucets have 1 control for hot water and 1 control for cold water. Three-handled shower faucets work the same as the double-handled faucets but have an additional handle for the bathtub. In this application, the third handle controls the strength of the water flow and determines whether the water goes to the tub or the shower."

Locate the shut-off valve for the appropriate bathroom and turn the water off. Most homes have shut-offs for individual bathrooms and one for the kitchen, so you should not need to shut off the water supply for the whole house. Once you have shut off the water supply, open the shower faucet valves to release any remaining water from the pipes to ensure the water is off. [3] X Research source If you are on a city water system, the shut-off valve should be located at the water meter near the curb of your home or in your apartment building’s basement. [4] X Research source If your home is on a private well, locate your water pressure tank in the basement or utility areas closest to where the water piping enters the building. Newer tanks are usually blue, while older tanks may be any color. [5] X Research source Typically, the shut-off valve is on the main outlet pipe near the tank. To close this valve at either source, turn it clockwise until closed. This will immediately stop water flow to the house."

      "content": "Remove the handles with a screwdriver. Use a flat-headed screwdriver to pry up the small caps on each handle that control the water’s flow and temperature. These caps are usually marked with a “C” or “H” for cold or hot water. Under the cap will be a screw to release the handles. [6] X Research source Remove the retaining screws then remove the handles by pulling them off the valve stems. If the screws are rusted, it may take a little extra effort to loosen the screws. If necessary, use penetrating oil to help break through the rust. If your handles have no visible screws, try twisting the handle off by going counterclockwise. After a few rotations, you’ll see the handle will be looser. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the spout counterclockwise. The spout is the faucet part that delivers water to the tub. [8] X Research source To remove the old spout, twist counterclockwise gently and pull towards you simultaneously. There may be a small screw that will require removal before you can take it off. You may find that pliers or a pipe wrench are helpful when removing old fixtures. [9] X Expert Source Patrick Johns Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2022. On some faucets, the diverter handle will have an arrow on it. Use a flathead screwdriver, a butter knife, or something similar to pry the cap from the handle to reveal the retaining screw. Before removing the retaining screw, you'll need to open the valve completely by turning the handle counterclockwise. This keeps the valve from turning while removing the screw."

      "title": "Firmly grasp the flange and twist counterclockwise.",
      "content": "Firmly grasp the flange and twist counterclockwise. Chrome threaded flanges are about three inches long on most two-handle and three-handle faucets. As you twist the flange counterclockwise to remove it, you may see a white nylon threaded sleeve that may not come off. If this happens, simply grasp the sleeve with your hand or a pair of pliers and turn it counterclockwise to remove it. Single-handled faucets have a large round plate that is attached either with caulking or with screws. After removing the handle, remove the plate by removing the screws or by cutting the caulking with a utility knife. Then, pull the plate from the wall. Flanges offer a reliable, durable way to connect pipe systems, valves, and other plumbing components without welding. [10] X Research source"

You can use an adjustable wrench or adjustable pliers to remove them. [11] X Research source Turn them counterclockwise until they come loose. Once removed, use a damp cloth or an old toothbrush to remove debris from the threads of the water inlet pipes."

      "content": "Mark where the new heads will go and make cuts if necessary. If you're installing a brand new faucet, you need to measure and mark the spots where you will install the new shower faucet and shower head. Drill holes using tile drill bits of the appropriate size of your shower components, and remove enough of the wall to access the pipe for proper installation. Shower faucets are typically installed at 45 to 48 inches (114.3 to 121.9 cm) with a shower head height of 72 to 78 inches (1.83 to 1.98 m). After making cuts, Clean the shower walls with a water and bleach mixture or white vinegar water. Do not mix bleach and vinegar, as it can release a noxious gas. Do not allow water to drip behind the wall. If it does, dry thoroughly before installing the new fixtures."

[12] X Research source Each valve must be opened when installed to allow it to sit on the pipe components. Be sure to identify the diverter valve and set it aside to install it last. Installing a new faucet will be nearly the same as when you disassembled it. The only difference is you’ll perform the steps in reverse. Valves are arguably the most important part of your faucet system. They are designed to control water flow and temperature. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Tape the new valves with plumber’s tape.",
      "content": "Tape the new valves with plumber’s tape. Peel the end of your plumber’s tape back a couple of inches. With the new valve in one hand, hold the threaded base pointing to your other hand. Place the loose end of the plumber’s tape over the threads and secure it with your thumb, then wrap tightly around the threads clockwise for three complete wraps. Pull tightly against the threads until the tape breaks. Roll the loose end over the taped threads. Done correctly, the tape will contour to the threads. [14] X Research source Repeat this process for all the new valve components. Taping the valves creates a tighter seal, ensuring the faucet won't leak."

[15] X Research source There should be some resistance after that because of the plumber’s tape. If the valve does not sit in the threaded pipe within the first turn or two, start again. Do not force an improperly seated valve. It will strip the threads and cause a serious leak. Repeat this step for all valves. Completely tighten the valves with adjustable pliers or an adjustable wrench. Do not over-tighten, or you’ll risk damaging the valve or the water pipes."

This will help clear out any debris or sediment that may have built up. Use plumber’s tape around the threaded neck of the shower pipe to create a tight seal. Then, follow the instructions on your new showerhead’s packaging for installation. [22] X Research source Generally, you’ll re-screw the new showerhead in place with your hands or an adjustable wrench. Be careful not to over-tighten. Once snug, you can run the water again and check for leaks!"
