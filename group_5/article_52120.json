Some options for unclogging include using a bent wire hanger to fish out any blockages, or flushing out the drain with 4 cups (1 L) of boiling water.

      "title": "Avoid laying metal on the surface of your sink.",
      "content": "Avoid laying metal on the surface of your sink. One of the toughest stains to get out of a sink, especially porcelain bathroom sinks, are rust stains. To prevent these kinds of stains from tarnishing your sink’s surface, avoid laying any tools or other objects made out of metal on your sink. Because of the presence of moisture in your bathroom, metal will quickly rust and leave an unappealing reddish-brown stain. To remove rust stains, mix 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and rub the solution onto the stain with a clean cloth or paper towel. Rinse and wipe the area with a damp paper towel once the stain is gone. [13] X Research source If the rust stain won't come out with baking soda, you may need to use an abrasive cleaner like Comet cleaning powder . However, make sure whatever product you use is safe on the material your sink is made of."
