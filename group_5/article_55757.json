Since you want the most reliable and accurate information, set aside an extra hour or two to find the perfect sources to cite in your writing. [4] X Research source Researching is an ongoing process, so you may need to continue doing it even after you start writing. It’s tough to say how much time researching takes since it depends on how well you know the topic and how detailed of information you need."

      "content": "Editing & rewriting While you should always give yourself time to proofread when you finish, editing and rewriting sentences while you’re creating your first draft eats up a lot of time. Since you’re changing sentences as you’re writing them, your total word count will keep fluctuating and you may not make as much progress.

Your typing speed slows down to around 5 wpm when you’re finding sources or if you hunt and peck keys individually, so it may increase your total writing time.

For outlining an essay , define the main point you’re trying to convey and organize the points you’re making so they logically flow into each other. When you’re outlining a story , organize the events in the plot so they reach a climax near the end. [9] X Research source If you already have all the points you want to hit on outlined, it saves you time since it’s a lot easier to fill in the information without wondering what’s coming next."

Set a timeline for the day split into multiple writing sessions where you can just focus on your work. Once you reach your word count goal, it’s okay to stop but don’t be afraid to keep writing if inspiration strikes. [10] X Research source Example: Make a goal to finish 250 words in 30 minutes before taking a short break. Reward yourself when you reach your writing goal by taking a walk, having a small treat, or playing a video game so you stay motivated."

When it’s time to write, set your phone to Do Not Disturb and let others know that you’re focusing on your writing so they don’t interrupt you. Turn off your other electronics and clear your workspace as well to get rid of other distractions. Try to write uninterrupted for about 15–20 minutes at a time so you make good progress.

It’s okay if your writing isn’t perfect in the first draft as long as you get across the main idea you’re trying to convey. Once you complete the entire draft, take a short break before coming back to proofread and make changes.
