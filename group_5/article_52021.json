      "content": "Give the spot an initial go-over. Using a warm, wet cloth, take a few passes at the spot to get the worst of the mess out of the way. Because of the way carpet and fabric upholstery are made, much of the droppings will collect and harden at the top of the fibers, making the bulk of it easier to wipe away. Use pinching, pulling motions with the wet cloth to coax the droppings out of the carpet or upholstery. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray on some upholstery care or carpet cleaner. Depending on exactly what type of surface you’re cleaning and what materials it’s made of, you’ll want to purchase some special cleaner that is guaranteed to work safely on that surface. Most standard carpet cleaners or all-purpose household cleaners will be mild enough to work on any kind of carpet, and foaming upholstery cleaners can be found at any supermarket or drugstore. Spray enough cleaner onto the spot to cover what’s left of it. [2] X Research source If you do not have any specialized carpet cleaner on hand, you also have the option of mixing up a gentle solution consisting of mild laundry detergent, vinegar and warm water."

      "title": "Let the cleaner start to work on the spot.",
      "content": "Let the cleaner start to work on the spot. Give the cleaner two or three minutes to sit on the spot. The chemical compounds in the cleaner will begin to eat away the hardened stain, making it easy to wipe away later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe away the remaining mess.",
      "content": "Wipe away the remaining mess. Use a damp washcloth to go over the spot once again. The stain-fighting power of the cleaner combined with the force of scrubbing by hand should be enough to take the spot out of your carpet or upholstery. If any traces are left after scrubbing, spray a little more cleaner on the spot, let it sit, then make a second attempt. Scrub forcefully to ensure that you get as much of the dried-on mess out of the deeper layers of the carpet as you can. Always wash any washcloth or towel that comes into contact with bird poop right away."

    {
      "title": "Wet the spot with warm water.",
      "content": "Wet the spot with warm water. If the droppings are in an accessible place, wet them with warm water before you begin cleaning. Pour the water directly over the spot, or soak a washcloth and use it to cover the spot. The warmth and moisture of the water will begin softening the stain, loosening its hold on hard, porous surfaces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the spot sit for a few minutes.",
      "content": "Let the spot sit for a few minutes. Give the warm water ample time to begin softening the stain. Bird droppings dry in a thick paste, and it may be much harder to clean them away if they’re still partially dry. Make sure you’ve wet the entire spot. Once the water has softened the droppings, they will begin to look fresh again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a hose to clean the mess.",
      "content": "Use a hose to clean the mess. Take a garden hose and hold it a few feet away from the spot. Turn it on at full flow and aim it directly at the bird droppings. The constant stream of water should finish the job that wetting the spot started. Go over the stain it’s completely gone. If your hose comes with a head that allows you to adjust the stream, set it to the high-pressure, single stream flow to blast away bird messes. If your hose doesn't have an adjustable head, you can place your thumb halfway over the nozzle to partially block the water flow and produce a higher pressure stream manually."

    {
      "title": "Use a brush to knock out stubborn traces.",
      "content": "Use a brush to knock out stubborn traces. If traces of the droppings remain after you’ve washed the spot with a hose, take a small, stiff-bristled scrubbing brush (a household broom will also work) and scour the area, re-wetting as needed. The bristles will dig into the crevices in the brick, concrete or roofing tile and scrape away the remaining bird poop. Be sure to clean the brush off after use; bird feces is filled with bacteria."

    {
      "title": "Place a warm, wet cloth over the stain.",
      "content": "Place a warm, wet cloth over the stain. Wet a washcloth with hot or warm water and lay it over the afflicted area. A wet cloth is preferable to directly applying warm water to hardwood or car paint because the cloth traps heat and moisture, rather than simply running off or possibly causing water damage. Leave the spot to soak in the moisture from the cloth."

    {
      "title": "Treat the spot with a specialty cleaner.",
      "content": "Treat the spot with a specialty cleaner. Once the bird droppings have softened, treat the spot directly with a wood or car cleaner. If the smooth surface you’re cleaning is vinyl or something similar, an all-purpose cleaner should be fine, or you might even have success with the warm washcloth alone. Spray or blot just enough cleaner onto the spot to cover it; avoid getting excess cleaner on unaffected areas of hardwood or paint. [3] X Research source A wash-and-wax cleaner should do the trick on cars. Wash-and-wax solutions are formulated to clean dirt, oil and grime off of cars and leave the topcoat of paint with a freshly-waxed shine. [4] X Research source Purchasing special cleaning products is recommended for treating temperamental surfaces, but assuming you don't feel like dropping a lot of money, you can also go the homemade route. A gentle, natural wood polish can be whipped up out of hot water, olive oil and lemon juice, while dish soap diluted with warm water makes a basic but effective solution for cleaning car exteriors.

      "title": "Leave the cleaner on for only a few moments.",
      "content": "Leave the cleaner on for only a few moments. Hardwood and car paint are surfaces that are easily damaged, so only leave the cleaner on the spot for a few moments to give it time to set up. Otherwise, the cleaner made bleed through the spot and stain your hardwood floor, or eat into your top coat of paint. There’s no need for the cleaner to sit for a long period of time on the spot because hard, smooth surfaces are non-porous, and therefore the cleaner won’t have to soak into the material in order to clean it."

      "title": "Use a soft towel to gently scrub out the spot.",
      "content": "Use a soft towel to gently scrub out the spot. Take another clean, damp towel and wipe away as much of the bird droppings as you can. Broad, gentle strokes will work best here. Try not to scrub in a back-and-forth motion or apply too much pressure, as this may weaken the surface’s finish. After all remnants of the spot are removed, dry the area by dabbing it with a dry towel. Microfiber towels are extremely soft and their fibers let them lock in the dirt and water that they soak up, making them ideal for most gentle cleaning jobs. Take special care to dry hardwood floors quickly, as allowing moisture to sit on wood can cause it to warp and splinter."

      "content": "Mix some gentle laundry detergent in warm water. Pour a small amount of liquid laundry detergent into a container of warm water and allow it to spread throughout the water. This will create a cleaning solution you can use to spot-treat the area directly. A little goes a long way: about one part detergent to five parts water is more than enough. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the stain away. Using a scrubber brush or disposable dish sponge, scrub the area thoroughly to wipe out the stain. Keep the stain wet and sudsy by dipping the brush or sponge into the laundry solution as needed. Continue until the spot is completely gone. [7] X Research source If you’re cleaning a delicate garment, use gentle, sweeping circular motions to ease the spot out, or use the soft side of the sponge. If you use a sponge, throw it away after you’re finished. Yuck!"
