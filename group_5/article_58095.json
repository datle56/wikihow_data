      "content": "Get yourself together. Repeat to yourself as much as it takes that eventually everything will turn out for the better. Remember that it is not a real, physical factor that instigates your anger, fear and panic. There is nothing coming up that threatens you; rather, it's all inside of you and your job is to get rid of it in order to feel in harmony again. [1] X Research source Once you convince yourself you're safe, you will start feeling in control and capable of dealing with all sorts of negative emotions. Take a head-on approach to your negative feelings. Rather than regarding them as inevitable and natural, seek ways to change them into helpful attitudes, ones that will support you rather than cause you to feel powerless and helpless. Be fully aware that negative emotions keep you connected to the loss, while a positive attitude allows you to let go of the person while still acknowledging that you once had a relationship with this person without causing you to feel upset.

      "title": "Do not spend time thinking about what your jealousy is \"actually\" about.",
      "content": "Do not spend time thinking about what your jealousy is \"actually\" about. Focusing on the negative emotions will put you in a vulnerable position. You can easily confuse the anger and fear as meaning that you're still in love with your ex and that you need to get them back. Obsessing over their new flame - who they are, what they do, how they can be eliminated - is even worse and more dangerous. Thoughts about them will not help you realize what you don't like about yourself and what you need to change. Such thoughts will only trap you in more fear, self-doubt, pain, and jealousy and will prevent you from moving on. [4] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018. Bear in mind that dissecting the nitty gritty of what could or should have been is living in the past by letting nostalgia trap you into a past period of life. Although often stated, the apt adage \"It is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all\" is as equally often overlooked; yet, it is far healthier to appreciate that you once loved this person but that now it is time to move on. It is possible to cherish the experience for what it was without letting it drag you back all the time. [5] X Research source And if you really can't stop wondering, at its most basic, jealousy is about wanting something you feel you don't have. The only lesson for you to take away from this is to answer for yourself what it is that's missing inside of you and to remedy it by concentrating more on personal growth (see steps below). Think of it this way – even if you did get X person back, would this deep gnawing gap inside be filled? No – because no person can fill an internal dissatisfaction; only you have that power."

      "content": "Get a buffer, at least in the beginning. If you're extremely lucky, you will rarely or never see your ex and their new boy-/girlfriend again. However, if you cannot avoid bumping into them, make sure you're not alone whenever you know you can't avoid the awkward encounter. Having a buffer, an accomplice, will make you feel more secure. Friends and colleagues will also distract you and prevent you from obsessing over the happy couple. Listen to your friends and family. It is possible that they have a sound perspective of the situation as it has developed and can provide you with solid advice for coping with it. Don't automatically assume that they'll say anything just to make you feel better; look for the gems of truth. [7] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018."

When the inevitable meet-up happens and you're by yourself, be both nice and reserved. [8] X Research source It is essential to be polite , but no one expects from you to treat them as your best buddies. Trying that would look both awkward and insincere and would only stress you more. Have quick exit excuses already planned, such as: \"It's great to see you Bob/Jane. I'm sorry I can't stay and chat, I've got a hair appointment I'm already late for.\"; or \"Great to see you Bob/Jane! Wish I could talk but I've got to collect my boss from the airport and the traffic's bad.\"; or, simply: \"Hi Bob/Jane. It's good to see you looking so well. I'll see you around!\" You don't need to offer an explanation unless you want to, but try your best not to give away your feelings through facial expressions or by brushing them off rudely."

Finding something to keep you occupied constantly will take up all your time, ensuring that at the end of the day you'll be too tired and proud of your accomplishments to even think about negative stuff. On the other hand, this will guarantee you the admiration and jealousy (!) of the others and once again convince you how amazing you are. This can be a great opportunity to let your creative side blossom and to improve professional self if you treat it as a time of personal growth and allow yourself the necessary opportunities.
