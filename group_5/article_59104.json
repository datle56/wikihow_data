      "content": "Reset your Nest (optional). This is most likely something you want to do when you're reselling or relocating your Nest thermostat, but you can skip this step if you're not selling or relocating it. The steps for this vary depending on which model of Nest thermostat you have. For the original Nest thermostat, go to Settings > Factory Reset and confirm. For the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Nest Thermostat E, go to Settings > Reset > All Settings . [1] X Research source Warning : Factory resetting your Nest will delete all current settings and remove it from the app. If you want to use it again, you'll need to add it back to your Google Home account and set the settings again just like the first time you installed it."

      "title": "Turn off the power.",
      "content": "Turn off the power. Many HVAC systems inside the house also have a switch for the system that you can flick to turn off. If you don't, go to your circuit breaker/electric panel and turn off the power for the HVAC system. Warning : Turn off the power to avoid short circuits or shocks. The live wire that gives power to your Nest system could shock you or damage your Nest as you remove it."

      "content": "Pull the cover off. The Nest's cover can be removed by pulling it, as it's just held to the base by four plastic clips. Once you remove the cover, you'll see a few wires and some screws. If you're going to put the Nest right back in the same spot, it's a good idea to take pictures so you know which wires go where."

      "title": "Unscrew the base and unplug the wires.",
      "content": "Unscrew the base and unplug the wires. You can use any Philips head screwdriver or the one that came with the Nest when you bought it to unscrew the two screws holding the base to the wall. To remove the wires, press down on the lever next to the connection and pull out the wire. Once you have everything removed, you can also pull off the remaining back plate to expose the thermostat hole in your wall with wires. To replace the Nest thermostat, screw it into the holes and plug in the wires, then push the Nest cover back on."
