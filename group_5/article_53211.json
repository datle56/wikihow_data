The most reliable sign of appendicitis is pain that starts out dull in and around your belly button and, after a few hours, shifts over to the right side and becomes more intense. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The \"classic\" appendicitis pain is located two-thirds of the way between your belly button and your hip bone (this spot is called McBurney's Point). [4] X Research source Kumar, P., &amp; Clark, M. (2009). Kumar &amp; Clark's Clinical Medicine 7th Edition. Philadelphia: Elsevier Limited. If you have appendicitis and try to lie on the right side of your body, you will feel the pain more strongly. You may also feel pain when you stand or move. Some people experience pain when they stand because they have an overly stretched round ligament (something that can occur during pregnancy). However, that sort of pain goes away within a few moments. Appendix pain, on the other hand, does not go away, so this is how you can distinguish them. Severe pain on one side of your abdomen can also be a sign of ectopic pregnancy—but only when combined with other symptoms like vaginal bleeding, shoulder pain, and lightheadedness. If you’re experiencing these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. Reader Poll: We asked 276 wikiHow readers and 58% of them agreed that they would immediately seek emergency medical care if they suspected an ectopic pregnancy. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Be aware that you may feel pain higher up in your body if you are in your third trimester. Those who are 28 weeks pregnant and up will feel pain right under the lowest rib on their right side. This is because as your child and your womb grow, your appendix gets moved. Instead of it being located between your belly button and right hip (in McBurney's Point) it will move up your abdomen so that it is pushed right below the right side of your ribcage."

      "content": "Pay attention if the pain you feel is followed by vomiting and nausea. As you most likely know, vomiting and pregnancy go hand-in-hand. However, if you have appendicitis, you will feel pain first and then you will vomit (or the nausea and vomiting will be worsened as compared to what they were previously). [5] X Research source D.C. Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 7th edition. Jaypee publishers. India Also, if you are later along in your pregnancy (after the initial vomiting stage has passed), nausea and vomiting are much more likely to indicate something else going on like appendicitis."

However, it is really the combination of fever, pain, and vomiting that should concern you. If you experience all three of these symptoms at once, you should go see your doctor.

      "content": "Monitor any paleness, sweating, or lack of appetite that you experience. Both sweating and paleness can be brought on by the nausea and fever you have when your appendix becomes inflamed. You will also lose your appetite - this happens to anyone experiencing appendicitis, regardless of whether they are pregnant or not."

Most people see a physician in the emergency room when they are worried about appendicitis, so the wait shouldn't be too long. The reason refraining from eating and drinking is important is that an empty stomach is required for certain procedures done by doctors. Also, it is easier on your digestive tract and reduces the chance of your appendix bursting if you do in fact have appendicitis."

There are a variety of tests doctors perform in order to determine the cause of abdominal pain to figure out whether or not it is appendicitis. These include pressing around your abdomen to elicit painful areas, as well as tapping and testing for \"rebound tenderness\" (pain after they release the pressure of their hand). [9] X Research source D.C. Dutta’s Textbook of Obstetrics, 7th edition. Jaypee publishers. India The tests may seem redundant and time-consuming, but know that these can be very helpful to your doctor in figuring out exactly what is going on."

Your doctor will hold on to your right knee and ankle and then bend your hip and knee while rotating your leg inwards and outwards. Pay attention to any pain you feel in your lower right quadrant of your abdomen - tell your doctor if you feel pain in that area because it could mean that there’s an irritation of the obturator muscle happening, which is a sign of appendicitis.
