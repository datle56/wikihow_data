It also determines how long it will take you to finish your project. You will find a yarn's weight printed on the package; they range from 0 - Lace to 6 - Super Bulky. [2] X Research source Here are some recommended yarns to use for a baby blanket. 1- Super Fine or Fingering: good for light, lacy blankets 2 - Fine or Sport Weight: good for light yet cuddly blankets 3 - Light Worsted or DK (Double Knit): good for warmer, yet still light blankets 4 - Worsted Weight: slightly heavier, but very easy to work with"
