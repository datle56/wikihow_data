      "content": "Work on changing your mindset. Often, the best way to get started overcoming any fear is to try to change how you think about that thing. For instance, thinking, \"Needles are the worst,\" or \"I'm terrified of needles,\" only reemphasizes that fact for you. Instead, say things like, \"A needle might hurt a bit, but it protects my health.\""

      "title": "Write down situations that make you afraid.",
      "content": "Write down situations that make you afraid. For some people, even seeing a picture of a needle can make them shudder. Write down the situations that make you quiver when it comes to needles, such as seeing a picture of one, watching an injection on television, watching someone else get pricked, and getting an injection yourself. Some other situations you might consider include handling needles, hearing someone talk about an injection, or just touching a needle. Rank these in order from the situation you're the least fearful into the situation you're the most fearful in."

      "content": "Start small. Begin with the situation you're the least fearful of. For instance, if pictures of needles bother you the least, try looking up some on the internet. Let your anxiety build up to its peak. Don't stop looking until you feel your anxiety easing up, as it will eventually do. After you're done, give yourself a chance to relax."

      "content": "Work up the levels. Once you've worked through one situation, move on to the next. For instance, maybe your next level is seeing someone getting injected with a needle on television. Try watching videos on the internet or a medical show. Practice the same technique of letting your anxiety rise and naturally fall on its own. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Breathe through it.",
      "content": "Breathe through it. One way to cope with anxiety is to learn breathing techniques you can use while having blood drawn or getting an injection. Try closing your eyes, and breathing in through your nose. Take a deep slow breath, and hold it for four counts. Breathe out slowly through your mouth. Repeat four more times. Use this technique several times a day, so you get used to doing it. Then, when you are faced with a needle, you can use it to calm yourself down."

      "content": "Practice visualization. Meditation can help calm you down, and using visualization to meditate can help distract you. To use visualization, you first need to pick a place that makes you feel happy. It should be a stress-free place, such as a park, a beach, or your favorite room in your house. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Close your eyes and imagine yourself in that place. Use all of your senses. What do you see? What do you smell? What can you feel? What can you hear? What can you taste? Build your world with intricate detail. For instance, if you are imagining the beach, think about the sight of the blue waves, the smell of the ocean air, and the feel of the hot sand beneath your feet and the warmth of the sun on your shoulders. Taste the salt in the air, and hear the sounds of the waves crashing on the shore. The better you can picture the place, the better you'll distract yourself."

If that's the case with you, you can use a technique called applied tension, which helps increase your blood pressure. Increasing your blood pressure decreases your chances of fainting.

Start by tensing all the muscles in your arms, legs, and upper body. Hold that pose for about 15 seconds. You should start to feel your face get warm. When you do, release your muscles.

      "content": "Discuss your fear with the phlebotomist, nurse, or doctor. Don't hold your fear inside. Instead, talk it out with the person drawing your blood or giving you an injection. It helps them to know because they can try to distract you and make you feel as comfortable as possible. Tell them if you have a specific want, such as if you want warning so you can look away before they bring the needle out. Asking them to count to three before sticking you can also help."
