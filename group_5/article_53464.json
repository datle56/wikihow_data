Keep a bunch of bobby pins handy, and your hair tie around your wrist. Try to use a hair tie that matches your hair color. You can find them in black, dark brown, and light brown/beige. If you have red hair, use either a dark brown or purple hair tie, depending on how colored/dark your hair is."

Then, pull your hair half-way through the hair tie, and let go."
