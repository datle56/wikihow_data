      "content": "Capricorn Midheavens may prioritize work over their personal lives.

Set aside time in your schedule and reserve it specifically for your friends, family, partner, or anyone you want to maintain a relationship with.

As a Capricorn Midheaven (and, as previously discussed, Cancer IC), you still need security and stability in your personal life—so try to put more effort into sustaining those relationships."

Capricorn Midheavens expect a lot from themselves and the people around them when it comes to work, but that can make them seem a bit chilly or unfriendly.

It’s okay to be determined and ambitious, but remember that the end doesn’t always justify the means. Practice treating your coworkers with compassion and empathizing with them so you can get a sense of how they’re feeling."
