      "content": "Sign up for a motorcycle safety course. Look online to find a course near you so you can learn the basics of operating and controlling a motorcycle. These classes typically offer a classroom safety portion and a hands-on riding portion. If you’re uncomfortable with riding a motorcycle, a course is a great place to start. Some classes will have motorcycles that you can ride if you do not have one of your own. Check for licensing classes if you need a motorcycle license in your area. These classes tend to run a few more days than a non-licensing class, but you’ll receive the proper permit's once you’re finished. Motorcycle laws vary depending on where you live. Consult with your local department of motor vehicles to determine the prerequisites for obtaining a license. In the United States, most places require you to be 15 or 16 in order to get a permit. Otherwise, you must be under the supervision of a licensed instructor."

      "content": "Take the written exam and vision test if required. Schedule a test time that works best for you. The written test will cover basic concepts and rules of the road while the vision test will determine if you can safely drive without a prescription. You need to pass this written exam first before you take the on-cycle test. [1] X Research source Written and on-cycle exams are required in order to get your license. Questions on the written exam include safety information, riding techniques, and how to operate your bike. Get familiar with how your motorcycle works and what your area’s laws are for riding a motorcycle. Read through a copy of your location’s motorcycle handbook to familiarize yourself with safety tips, laws, and regulations. [2] X Research source Go to your department of motor vehicle’s website to find online practice tests for the written exam."

      "content": "Pass the on-cycle exam to get your license. Schedule the test appointment at your department of motor vehicles. The tester will observe you as you ride your motorcycle, making sure you follow the rules of the road. Follow all of the safety precautions you’ve learned prior as you complete the test. Once you pass the exam, you can pay the registration fee for your licensing. [3] X Research source The on-cycle exam will include identifying where the controls are for your bike, as well as riding slowly in a circle and serpentine pattern. Make sure to practice these techniques on your own before you take the test. [4] X Research source During the test, be aware of your surroundings and always travel below the speed limit. Depending on your location, this can be done at the department of motor vehicles or with a certified third-party tester. In the United States, you need to hold an instruction permit for 12 months if you are under 16 in order to get your license."

      "content": "Purchase a helmet. Head injuries are the main cause of serious or fatal accidents for cyclists, and helmets can greatly reduce the risk of harm. Find a full-coverage helmet that has a visor that doesn’t limit your vision so you can stay aware of your surroundings. Make sure the chinstrap fit's tightly around your head so the helmet stays secure. [7] X Research source Look for a Department of Transportation (DOT) or European Commission (ECE) sticker or label to see if the helmet meets the legal requirements for safe riding. Do not wear helmets with tinted visors when visibility is low or while riding at night. Helmets usually have ventilation systems so your head will stay cool in hot weather. Not all locations require you to wear a helmet when you ride. Check with your local laws to find out."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the clutch and shifter. Most motorcycles are manual transmissions and need to be shifted up or down as you accelerate and decelerate. Look for the clutch above the left handlebar. It will look similar to the handle that controls your brakes. Find the shifter in front of your left foot and control it with the up and down lever. [13] X Research source Keep your bike in neutral with your kickstand down when you aren’t using it. Neutral is usually found in between the first and second gear. Many motorcycles work with a “1 down, 5 up” shift pattern. From lowest to highest, the gears usually go first, neutral, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth."

Ensure your bike is in neutral before starting the engine. Hold the clutch in before hitting the start button, which is usually below the red switch and is marked with a lightning bolt. Let the engine turn over so that it is warmed up and properly running when you ride your bike. [15] X Research source Always look on the gauge indicator on your motorcycle’s dashboard to ensure that it’s in neutral. If not, adjust the gear shift lever while holding the clutch to the neutral position. Holding the clutch in while starting your motorcycle prevents it the bike from moving forward if you aren’t in neutral. If you have a kick start bike, the starting mechanism is found behind your right foot. Press down on it firmly to turn over the engine."

Use them whenever you ride on populated roads so other drivers can see you. [16] X Research source If your bike doesn't have turn signals, you'll need to use hand signals. Stick your left hand straight out so it's parallel to the ground, palm facing down, to indicate a left turn. Bend your left elbow so your forearm is at a 90-degree to your bicep (which should be parallel to the ground) and close your fist to indicate a right turn. Begin signaling 100 feet (30 m) before you make the turn and return both hands to the handlebars when executing the turn. [17] X Research source"

Hold the clutch down and shift to first gear by pushing the shifter down with your left foot. Your bike will start to move on it's own without activating the throttle as you slowly release the clutch. Practice keeping your balance as it moves forward at a slow speed. Keep your hand on the brake in case you start losing control. [18] X Research source Practice on an isolated section of road or in a parking lot that has little traffic so you don’t have to worry about other motorists. If you let go of the clutch too fast, you may kill the engine. If this happens, shift back into neutral and start your engine again. Practice “power walking” by walking it forward while slowly releasing the clutch to accelerate. Work your way up until you’re comfortable keeping your feet on the pegs while your bike is moving."

When you feel comfortable going faster, turn the throttle slightly towards your body as you release the clutch to accelerate. Once you go over 5 mph (8.0 km/h), ease off of the throttle, squeeze your clutch in, and pull your shifter up past neutral into second gear. Once you’ve shifted your motorcycle, let go of the clutch and accelerate again. [19] X Research source As you increase your speed, you need to shift into higher gears. As you decrease speed, downshift to a lower gear. Make sure to let off your throttle when you squeeze your clutch as you shift. Once you switch into second gear, you don’t have to shift down to first gear until you come to a complete stop."

Slow down as you approach your turn by releasing the throttle. To make a left turn, pull the left handlebar closer to you and push the right handlebar forward. For a right turn, pull the right handlebar close to you and push the left one forward. [20] X Research source For faster turns, practice countersteering . As you make your turn, lean slightly in the direction you wish to go while pushing the handlebar away from you to stay balanced. If you make too sharp of a turn, it will cause you to crash."
