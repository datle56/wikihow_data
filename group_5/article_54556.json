      "content": "Spirits are present. Don’t worry, you aren’t in any danger! Flickering light bulbs are common signs that a spirit is hanging around nearby, but they wouldn’t be letting you know they were present if they didn’t come in peace. Other signs a ghost is visiting you include inexplicable changes in room temperature, strange sounds, clocks stopping, or strange visions. [1] X Research source Psychics believe that spirits have the ability to manipulate anything electrical, so you may also notice flickering on your TV."

      "title": "Angels are trying to provide you with guidance.",
      "content": "Angels are trying to provide you with guidance. If you want to contact your guardian angel , flickering lights may represent the opportunity you need. Much like a halo flickering above an angel’s head, a flickering lightbulb could be a sign that an angel is paying attention to you. They may be reaching out to remind you that they’re there, or signaling that whatever you’re doing at the moment is blessed. For example, if you’re thinking about an old friend and the lights flicker, it could be an angel’s way of telling you that you should reach out to them."

      "content": "You’re going through a personal transformation. Perhaps it’s your powerful aura causing the lights to flicker. If you’re in the midst of a major life change or you’re working hard to cultivate the positive forces in your life, the flickering could be a sign that your efforts are paying off. [2] X Research source If you’ve been working hard to chase a goal, the flickering might be a reflection of your work effort."

      "title": "The universe is trying to tell you something.",
      "content": "The universe is trying to tell you something. Have you recently entered a new relationship? Are you looking for a new job? If you’re in the middle of a new journey, the flickering could be a sign you’re on the right path. Alternatively, if the flickering lights fill you with dread or fear, it might be the universe’s way of warning you When it comes to messages from the universe, how you feel is everything. If the lights intrigue you, spark curiosity, or find you in a moment of joy, you’re on the right path!"

      "title": "A higher power is bringing you a message.",
      "content": "A higher power is bringing you a message. If you’re a religious person, the flickering lights may be a sign that your higher power is reaching out to you. Perhaps this is your prayer being answered, or maybe this is an invitation to pray right now. Regardless, a flickering light could be the sign you’re looking for. If you’re going through a hard time, this may be God’s way of reminding you that they’re looking out for you."

      "title": "A portal is actively open nearby.",
      "content": "A portal is actively open nearby. In many Neopagan, Wiccan, and Hermetic traditions, the flicker of a light is a sign that a channel to another plane is open. This is especially likely if you notice that the flickering light is coming from candles alone or if you were just performing some kind of magick or ritual. [3] X Research source If you didn’t intend to open a portal or you want to close it, reverse your ritual. If there wasn’t a ritual, you’ve got nothing to worry about—it’s not your channel to close."

      "title": "Energy is being transferred.",
      "content": "Energy is being transferred. Flickering lights may also be a side effect of something changing in the world around you. It could be something small, like someone nearby sending good energy to someone else, or something big, like a symptom of a rising Saturn or the dawn of a new age in Pisces. If you’re sitting in a room with someone who is giving you a harsh vibe, the lights may flicker off of their energy. On the opposite end of things, if you and your romantic partner are having a wonderful night, the lights could flicker off of all that love."

      "title": "Note your thoughts and emotions when the flicker occurs.",
      "content": "Note your thoughts and emotions when the flicker occurs. The most important piece of information you need is already deep within you. Your emotional state at the time of the flickering is pointing you in the right direction. Whatever your interior truth is telling you directly corresponds with the body of the intended “message.” For example, if the flickering scares you, it’s probably worth taking a moment to meditate, calm yourself, and focus on whatever core issue is bothering you. At the same time, if the flickering finds you in a moment of peace and serenity, it’s a sign you’re right where you need to be—either literally or spiritually. Don’t worry that your space is haunted or anything like that—a real haunting isn’t usually that straightforward. Still, we’ve got you covered if you want help cleansing your space ."

      "title": "Stay open-minded and wait for the meaning to come to you.",
      "content": "Stay open-minded and wait for the meaning to come to you. If you aren’t sure how you feel when the flickering occurs or you’re conflicted about how you feel, don’t worry. Just give yourself time and keep your spirit open to any potential meanings that may come to you in time. If something big or unique happens in the next few days and it resonates with you, perhaps this was what you were looking for!"

      "title": "If the lights constantly flicker, it could be a bad or old wiring.",
      "content": "If the lights constantly flicker, it could be a bad or old wiring. Flickering lights are relatively common in older homes and buildings where the electrical panel and fuses haven’t been updated. In a newer structure, reach out to an electrician for professional help to fix the problem , since flickering is usually a symptom of a bad wiring job. [4] X Research source Other potential causes include: Bulbs that aren’t the right voltage or are incompatible with the fixture. A bulb nearing its natural end of life. Power surges, overloaded circuits, and dying fuses. Living in an area with a strained, old, or damaged electrical grid."
