      "content": "Make sure you're not muted or deafened. The first thing to check when Discord isn't picking up your mic is to make sure that you aren't muted or deafened. Simply look at the microphone (mute) or headphone (deafen) icons in Discord to see if they're active. [1] X Research source You could have also gotten server muted or server deafened. If so, that can only be removed by a moderator or admin of the server you're in."

      "content": "Make sure you have the correct permissions to voice chat. If you notice that only one server (or even just one voice channel) is giving you trouble with your microphone, it could be because you don't have the correct permissions for that channel. If you are able to edit permissions, right-click (or Ctrl-click on Mac, or long press on mobile) the channel and go to Edit Channel > Permissions , then make sure your role has voice permissions. If you can't edit the permissions for the server or channel, you'll need to ask an admin if they can adjust the permissions for you."

      "content": "Restart your phone or computer. Sometimes various processes can stop working properly, and the only way to fix it is to restart your computer. Restarting your computer will refresh caches and registry files, and it may fix whatever bug or glitch is making it so your microphone doesn't work in Discord."

      "content": "Check if your microphone is working with another app or program. Try using the voice recorder/voice notes app or program on your device to see if your microphone is still working. If you try recording something but your device isn't picking up any sound, the issue likely is with your mic."

      "content": "Make sure Discord is using the right microphone. To get to your voice settings, click the cogwheel icon on desktop/the web or your profile picture on the app, then select Voice & Video or just Voice . In this menu, check your input device: Find Input Device and make sure the microphone you want to use is selected. If your microphone isn't selected, select it from the dropdown. A common issue is that when you plug in certain controllers (like a PS5 DualSense controller), all of your microphone inputs will switch to the controller."

In this menu, check your input sensitivity settings: Find Input Sensitivity and toggle off \"Automatically determine input sensitivity\". Then use the slider to adjust the ratio of green and yellow on the bar. The highlighted portion of this bar should always go into the green section when you're talking into your mic to ensure that everything you say is getting picked up. If you don't want to turn off automatic input sensitivity, you can instead try toggling off Advanced Voice Activity further down in the Voice & Video settings menu."

In this menu, check your input device: Noise Suppression: If you're having issues with your microphone not picking up your voice, turn off noise suppression.

If you have a microphone where you can manually adjust the gain (such as a Blue Yeti), make sure your gain isn't turned down too low. If your gain is too low, your microphone may have a hard time picking up your voice. Also make sure your polar pattern is set to cardioid, if you have a cardioid microphone (like the Blue Yeti). The cardioid polar pattern icon looks like an upside-down, rounded heart."

      "content": "Make sure your mic is set up in the correct position for its polar pattern. This only really applies if you've got a cardioid microphone. If you do, make sure you're talking into the front of the microphone. The mic shouldn't be angled towards you so you're talking into the top. Cardioid microphones pick up sound best when you're speaking into the front of them. Using a cardioid mic incorrectly could be contributing to why Discord isn't picking up your voice."

If your microphone has a USB plug, you can also try unplugging it from the port and plugging in something else, like a flash drive. If the flash drive appears in your devices and you can use it, then the issue isn't your USB port. If your microphone jack stops working, try a USB sound card. This device plugs into a USB port and has a headphone and microphone jacks so you can use your headphones/microphone via a USB port. If you're running out of usable USB ports on your computer, try a USB hub. You just need one working USB port on your computer to plug the hub in, and then you can plug all of your USB devices into the hub to use them on your computer."
