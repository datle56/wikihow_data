      "content": "Pay with cash in exact change at unmanned toll booths. Follow the signs to go to the toll lane that accepts cash. You can’t pay with bills in unmanned toll booths, so you have to be ready to pay with entirely coins. Make sure you have plenty of dimes and nickels on hand as well as quarters, because tolls aren’t always in 25 cent increments. Put your coins into the coin collection basket, and wait for the light to turn green. Tolls typically cost between $1- $6. The coin machine won’t accept damaged or foreign coins."
