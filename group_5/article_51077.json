      "content": "The blue chakra (or throat chakra) is associated with communication. There are 7 chakras in the body, each associated with a different color and function. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The blue chakra governs the thyroid gland and is connected to self-expression and creativity. The blue chakra is represented by the element air, emphasizing this chakra’s association with communication and creative expression: air traditionally symbolizes intellect, movement, and abstract thinking and feeling. The color blue carries special significance in different cultures: In Hinduism, the blue chakra is known as “Vishuddha”—Sanskrit for “purification”—and symbolizes nature, bravery, determination, and stability. In the Middle East, the color blue is associated with safety and protection. In Latin American cultures, it symbolizes hope and health. In Ireland, blue stands for sadness and purification. In Judaism, it represents holiness and divinity."

      "title": "The blue chakra helps you express yourself.",
      "content": "The blue chakra helps you express yourself. The blue chakra deals with both verbal and nonverbal communication. It helps you clearly and bravely articulate thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. The blue chakra aids in creativity, especially writing and speech. This chakra also helps maintain a balance between your head (intellect) and your heart (feelings): when the blue chakra is out of balance, you may lean overly rational and logical or overly emotional and reckless."

      "title": "You can communicate your thoughts and feelings confidently.",
      "content": "You can communicate your thoughts and feelings confidently. When your blue chakra is balanced and healthy, you have little to no problem saying what you mean. Even in instances where it’s easier to stay silent or to hide how you feel, when your blue chakra is open, you find it difficult to not speak the truth and be fully, unapologetically yourself."

      "title": "You listen well to others.",
      "content": "You listen well to others. Communication isn’t just about expressing yourself—it’s also about being able to actively listen to others. When your blue chakra is open, you can listen to others speak without being distracted or rushing to interrupt. You may even become more aware of the body language of people around you. For instance, if a friend is having a bad day, you may be more likely to notice their nonverbal cues when your blue chakra is balanced. A blocked throat chakra may cause some people to become shy and stay silent—but it makes others a nervous chatterbox! So if you find you’re speaking less than before, it doesn’t necessarily mean your chakra is out of balance."

      "content": "You’re in touch with your creative side. Everyone is creative. But while you might not think of yourself as an artist ordinarily, when your blue chakra is open, you’re more in tune with your self-expressive side. You might channel your creativity through writing, art, or music, or your confidence and curiosity may allow you to approach problems more innovatively and open-mindedly."

      "content": "Recite positive affirmations. Chanting or reciting positive mantras aloud to yourself is another way to engage your voice while also instilling more confidence in yourself and undoing negative thinking patterns you might be stuck in. “Self-talk is the one of the things that you have the most control over,” says Kari Samuels. “Every time you have a negative thought about yourself, you can replace that with something affirmative like, ‘I know I can make these changes. I know that I am capable. I know…that I can do this.’” Try reciting, “I speak the truth,” “The truth liberates me,” or “I am not afraid to be myself.” Or come up with your own mantra!"

      "content": "Meditate. Regular meditation is a great way to bring your blue chakra back into balance. Even just a few minutes a day of meditation can help you feel more calm, focused, and confident. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For a beginner-friendly meditation, try focused breathing: take a deep breath and close your eyes, then focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Do this for a few minutes. [3] X Research source For a more structured meditation, try a body scan meditation. Lie on your back with arms and legs at your sides. Focus your attention on each part of your body, in order, from head to toe. Be aware of any thoughts, feelings, or sensations that come to you as you focus on the different parts of your body. Do your best not to let your mind wander, but if it does, simply redirect your focus back to your body: “It's not like you get rid of the thoughts,” Samuels says, “but you let them go. You're not attaching to them and you're focusing on being present instead.” If instilling a daily meditation practice sounds overwhelming, Samuels points out, “[Meditation] is a practice that you can do throughout the day…. You can do it while you're…waiting in the grocery line. You can do it all day every day without even a formal meditation practice.”"

      "content": "Do neck exercises. Since the blue chakra is located in your throat, neck exercises may help bring it into balance—especially if you’re experiencing neck pain due to your chakra being blocked. Be safe performing these exercises if you’re already experiencing neck pain, and stop immediately if these exercises cause your pain to worsen. If your pain is severe, see a doctor.
