If your friend responds within the next 24 hours, a Snapstreak will be created and you will see a ðŸ”¥ emoji to the right of their name in the contacts list. Repeat these steps once a day to increase the length of your Snapstreak. A number will eventually appear next to the ðŸ”¥ emoji which represents the number of days your Snapstreak has been going on. Both you and your friend have to send a Snap to each other once a day to continue the streak. If you or your friend skips a day, a âŒ› icon will appear next to their name, indicating that your Snapstreak is at risk. If you or your friend donâ€™t respond the following day, your Snapstreak will end and you will have to start over."
