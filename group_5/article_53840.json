      "content": "Chicory is an herbaceous plant that grows wild or can be cultivated. In the wild, it's a leafy plant with a tall scraggly stem that sends out small pale blue flowers. At the store or market, chicory includes a number of plants that you're probably familiar with: [1] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Curly endive or frisée Belgian endive Radicchio Escarole"

      "content": "Forage for chicory or shop for it during the winter months. If you're foraging or harvesting chicory, don't forget to dig up the root since you can cook it along with the leaves. If you're buying chicory from the market, look for crisp leaves that are tightly packed. Avoid chicory that has signs of insect damage like holes from where insects ate the leaves. [2] X Research source Sometimes, you can find it for sale in warmer months, but chicory thrives during the winter."

      "content": "Wash and slice the roots. Scrub them with a vegetable brush under running water until the roots are clean and place them on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim the ends and slice the roots into pieces that are less than 1 in (2.5 cm) in size. [3] X Research source You can use store bought chicory roots or forage for them, although chicory roots grow deep in compacted soil, so this can be a workout. Brewing chicory root coffee is a good way to help you reduce coffee consumption."

Chicory powder is most commonly used to make coffee; to brew chicory coffee, just substitute the chicory powder for coffee grounds and use your preferred coffee brewing method. If you don't enjoy the taste of pure chicory, brew equal parts ground chicory and regular ground coffee. [6] X Research source Add a spoonful of chicory powder to smoothies or granola bars if you want extra fiber. Not only is chicory root caffeine-free, but it contains prebiotics that helps keep your gut bacteria healthy.

      "content": "Add chicory leaves to any salad for a slightly bitter flavor. Under the bitterness, you'll taste a slightly sweet note, so it makes any salad a lot more interesting to eat! Choose firm green leaves and wash and dry them thoroughly. Then, tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. [8] X Research source Use any type of chicory—radicchio adds a little crunch, frisée looks beautiful in a mixed salad, and escarole looks like lettuce but adds a slightly peppery taste. Make a garden salad with chicory to go with fish or roast chicken—the salad really complements these dishes. Start by adding a small amount, since the bitterness might be too much for some tastes."
