Many people in the West gain an understanding of Japanese culture – including dogeza – by watching movies or anime. [1] X Research source The word “dogeza” means prostrating on the ground."

[6] X Research source Dogeza is only necessary for grievous offenses, so apologize and ask for forgiveness more than once, or you may not seem sorry enough for your behavior. An appropriate apology in Japanese might be moushi wake gozaimasen which translates to “there is no excuse.” [7] X Research source It’s also a good idea to have an anguished expression to communicate your contrition nonverbally. Keep your eyes cast downward, and do not make eye contact with the injured party. This can be interpreted as challenging or disrespectful and make you seem less sincere. Pause when your head is bowed low before your forehead touches the ground to repeat your apology."
