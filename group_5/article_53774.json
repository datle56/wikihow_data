      "content": "It’s likely because the sheets twisted up in the dryer. It’s pretty common for folks to pull their sheets off of their bed, roll them up, and toss them into the washing machine. The agitation process can also cause the sheets to twist and bunch up. If you move them to your dryer while they’re balled up, your sheets can bunch up even further and form deep creases and wrinkles that can be tricky to remove. [1] X Research source Sometimes, washing and drying your sheets with other clothing items can also cause them to bunch and twist up."

      "content": "Dry your sheets without overloading your machine. It can be tempting to try to wash all of your sheets at once to get them done, but it’s a bad idea. Overstuffing your dryer can cause your sheets to dry unevenly, and can lead to deep creases and wrinkles. Instead, fill up your machine about halfway to three-quarters full full so your sheets have room to move around, which can help prevent wrinkles. [2] X Research source Try to wash only sheets as well. Adding socks, shorts, shirts, and other types of clothing can cause your sheets to bunch up in the washing machine and dryer."

      "content": "Unfurl your sheets before you dry them on a low to medium heat setting. When you’re moving your sheets from the washer to the dryer, take a moment to gently fluff them out. Remove any twists and open up any bunched-up sections. Then, place your sheets into your dryer and let them fully dry on a low to medium heat setting. It’ll gently and evenly dry them, which can help prevent wrinkles. [3] X Research source Taking the time to fluff out your sheets before you dry them is probably the best way to prevent wrinkles."

      "content": "Remove the sheets while they’re still warm and lay them flat on your bed. Don’t leave your sheets to cool and settle in the dryer or they could form deep creases. Instead, pull them out as soon as they’re finished drying and while they’re still nice and warm. Either immediately put them on your bed or lay them flat if you plan to fold and store them. [4] X Research source You can also take the sheets out of the dryer while they’re still slightly damp and lay them flat on your bed so they finish drying without wrinkles forming."

      "content": "Stretch them out and hang them on a clothesline until they’re dry. A drying rack is too small to dry your sheets evenly and without any wrinkles, but a good old-fashioned clothesline will do the trick! Fluff out the sheets, stretch them out along the line, and clip them on each end and in the center so they’re fully supported. Wait until they’re fully dry before you take them down. Then you can put them on your bed or fold and store them. [5] X Research source Your sheets may dry faster if you hang them up in a sunny and breezy location."

      "content": "Choose sheets that are specially designed to be wrinkle-free. There’s a reason hotel sheets always look so crisp and perfect—they’re made with material that is made to resist wrinkles. If you’re looking for sheets that won’t wrinkle up when you wash and dry them, go with ones that are labeled as wrinkle-free or wrinkle-resistant. [6] X Research source Check the packaging or the product description to see if they’re designed to be wrinkle-free. “Wrinkle-free” or “wrinkle-resistant” sheets can sometimes be less comfortable than other sheets and may be treated with a resin that can sometimes cause skin rashes.

      "content": "Spritz the sheets with water and pull them tight over the bed. If your sheets are still a little wrinkly, or if they’re already on your bed and you want to remove pesky wrinkles, no problem! Take a spray bottle full of clean water and gently spray the surface of the sheet. Then, while they’re still just slightly damp, pull them super tight over your mattress. The tension on the material will naturally release and get rid of any wrinkles. [8] X Research source You don’t need to saturate the sheets. Just a gentle misting will help loosen the fibers."

While ironing your sheets can degrade and wear down the material, if you want your sheets to have that pristine, crisp look, iron just the top 12 inches (30 cm) of the sheet. The sheet will look pressed and rest will be hidden beneath your covers. [9] X Research source"
