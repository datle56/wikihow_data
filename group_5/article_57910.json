      "content": "Netflix doesn’t offer student discounts, but there are other ways to save. If you’re a student wondering if you can get a sweet discount on a Netflix subscription, unfortunately, there aren't any straightforward discounts available. Both Netflix and Disney+ have stopped offering student discounts on subscriptions, and Netflix no longer offers a free trial period, either. However, if you’re dead-set on getting a Netflix subscription, there are a couple of ways to do it and still save some money. Check out the tips below! There are also other streaming services that do offer student discounts—so if you don’t mind missing out on Netflix original content, you could sign up for a different service instead."

      "content": "Ask a parent or friend if you can have a profile on their account. If someone close to you (a parent or good friend) already has an account and doesn’t mind sharing, the easiest way to use Netflix as a student is to simply make a profile on their account. However, Netflix puts limits on account sharing; you’ll only be able to do it if you use the same internet connection. [1] X Research source According to Netflix’s website, Netflix accounts are meant to be shared by people in one household. So, you can use your parent’s account if you live with them, or a friend’s if you live in the same dorm."

      "content": "Subscribe to Netflix with other students and split the cost. If you’re living in a dorm with other students who want to stream Netflix too, you could all chip in some money and make profiles on a Netflix account shared between each of you! Keep in mind that each subscription tier has a limit on the number devices you can stream from at the same time, though. [2] X Research source For example, if you share a premium account with other students, you can stream Netflix from up to 4 devices at once. If you share a standard account, that limit drops to 2 devices at once. That still means if you and 3 other students get a premium subscription, you can pay about $5.75/month for it instead of $22.99 (assuming you split the cost evenly 4 ways)."

      "content": "Get a Netflix subscription for a limited time. If there’s something specific you want to watch on Netflix and you don’t mind canceling your subscription after finishing it, you could always just pay full price on a subscription for a short time. While it’s not a discount, you at least wouldn’t have to keep paying a monthly fee this way! For example, you could subscribe to Netflix for a month and try to watch all the content exclusive to Netflix that you want, then cancel before your subscription renews the next month. Alternatively, some credit cards also let you earn rewards or points on streaming services. If you want to start building your credit score (or you’ve already started), you could look into a card with streaming benefits."

Both standard subscriptions let you stream and download content on up to 2 devices at 1080p resolution, while a premium subscription lets you stream on 4 devices, download content on 6, and stream at 4K resolution.

Students can enjoy this deal for up to 4 years, which includes a 6-month free trial, after which the subscription costs $69/year (half the normal price). [4] X Research source Pros : You get a lengthy trial period, access to Prime originals, and other deals including a free Grubhub trial. Cons : You’ll need a .edu email to get this discount, and it can take a few days for Amazon to verify your email. This discount will also end on your graduation date (or after 4 years, whichever comes first)."

On the other hand, if you’re a Spotify user, you can sign up for Spotify’s student discount instead and get Hulu bundled for free! Spotify’s current discount includes 1 month free, then charges $5.99/month after that. [5] X Research source Pros : Both options last for as long as you’re a college student, and with the bundle, you can get Spotify for half the normal price. You can also access Hulu’s original shows and movies. Cons : Both options are for an ad-supported subscription to Hulu only—so you’ll have to get an account with ads. You also can’t get this discount with Hulu’s Live TV."

[6] X Research source Pros : You’ll get Paramount+ original content, plus live CBS TV and on-demand content. It’s also cheaper than some other streaming platforms. Cons : Paramount+’s catalog of content is more limited than Netflix or Hulu, and you have to watch with ads on the student plan."
