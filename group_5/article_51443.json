The mobile homes need to be comparable in terms of size, age, general condition, and the amount of land. You are unlikely to find an exact match, but you don’t need an exact match. Find mobile homes around the same age as yours and about the same size. Sales also need to be recent. The market was different four years ago than it is today. Your comparison properties should be located within half a mile of your property if you live in the city, a mile of your property if you live in the suburbs, or 5 miles of your property if you live in a rural location."
