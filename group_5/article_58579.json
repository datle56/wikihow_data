      "content": "Draw up a realistic monthly budget based on your income. Start by calculating how much you'll need for monthly essentials like rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, groceries, medical expenses, phone, transportation, and so on. Then, calculate how much you spend monthly on non-essentials like entertainment and new clothes. Add those numbers together and compare them to your monthly income. Can you easily cover those costs with your current income? [1] X Research source When you're setting your budget, look over your bank and credit card statements for the past year or so. Take a good look at your spending habits, then look for areas where you can make small changes. Remember, most people don't overspend their budgets by hundreds or thousands of dollars—they usually overspend by $5 here and $10 there. [2] X Expert Source Stacy Chretien, CFP® Certified Financial Planner Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. If your monthly income isn’t sufficient, you may need to get a second job or find a new job that pays more. In general, your monthly income should be about 3 times the cost of your monthly rent. [3] X Research source If your monthly income covers expenses but you don't have any money leftover, you won't be ready for an unexpected expense or emergency. If possible, reduce some of your non-essential expenses. Don’t forget to factor in expenses that are automatically debited each month. For example, streaming services (like Netflix and Hulu), Amazon Prime membership, gym membership, Spotify, and so on. If your budget is looking tight, you may need to cancel some of these."

      "content": "Work out a ballpark figure for moving expenses. Moving can be an expensive process and the amount of money you need for the first month will probably be significantly higher than your budgeted monthly average. Research everything ahead of time so you can start saving money for those expenses. [4] X Research source For example, you may need to get a rental truck to transport your stuff, hire movers, or pay for a storage unit to hold your belongings for you."

      "content": "Set aside money for rent, security deposits, and utility setup. Many landlords expect a security deposit or ask for the first and last months' rent upfront, so you'll need to be prepared for that. If you have a pet, you may need to pay the landlord a pet deposit. [5] X Research source In addition, you may also have to pay things like utilities setup, HOA fees, and other expenses. [6] X Expert Source Stacy Chretien, CFP® Certified Financial Planner Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. Since you haven't moved out yet, you won't know exactly how much to save for utilities, rent, and deposits. Check out apartments to get an idea of rent and deposit costs and use that number. Estimate high to err on the side of caution. For utilities, you might ask your parents what they pay or call the utility company for an estimate. If you're planning to buy a house, save up enough money to make a significant down payment and cover at least the first month of a mortgage payment. Typically, you need a down payment of at least 3% of your target home price. Some lenders require 5% or more.

      "content": "Establish your credit so you can be financially independent. Before you live on your own, make sure that you not only have established credit, but that your credit score is good. To establish credit, you might want to consider getting a credit card. Research different types, and pick one that is best for you. Pay your credit card bill on time each and every month to establish good credit. [8] X Research source Landlords will check your credit history when reviewing your rental application. If your credit is bad, or if you have no credit at all, they may not rent to you. To build more credit, you can ask your parents to put your name on one of the household bills. For example, if your name is on the cable account, that can help to establish your credit. This is especially important if you're planning to buy a house. Lenders will check your credit history before deciding if they want to work with you."

      "content": "Start saving money to build a financial cushion for yourself. What will you do if your car breaks down? What’s your plan if your boss cuts your hours at work? Unfortunately, these things happen, so it's important to have emergency funds set aside. When you are first setting out on your own, your goal should be to have at least $500-$1,500 set aside in case of emergency. [9] X Research source The recommended amount for most emergency funds is enough to cover 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses, but you can start small and work toward that. Keep adding to your emergency fund even after you move out. For example, choose an amount that you can afford to set aside every month, like $20, and add it to your list of fixed expenses. That way, you're putting a little aside every month in case of emergencies. [10] X Research source If you don’t already have a savings account, consider opening one so you have a place to put the emergency funds. You’re less likely to spend this money on other things if you keep it separate from your checking account."

      "content": "Find a place to live that’s within your price range. Start by considering a location: do you want to live near work or school? Next, choose what sort of home works for you. Are you an apartment person or do you prefer to rent or buy a house? Once you narrow down a few options, schedule an appointment with the landlord to view the space. If you're having a hard time finding a place that you can afford, consider living with a roommate. Splitting costs can save you a lot of money. Keep in mind that you'll need to learn to compromise with a roommate and split up the chores and other responsibilities fairly. Don't forget to factor in safety concerns. You can always scout locations at night and on the weekends to see what kind of activity goes on in the area. If things feel sketchy near a potential place, keep looking. [11] X Research source"

Don’t sign a lease agreement until you view the space, confirm it has the amenities you want, and report any damages, like cracks or leaks, to the landlord. Tell the landlord you want the pre-existing damages noted in your lease agreement so you won’t be responsible for them later. Open all of the cabinets and closets and check for rodents and rodent damage.

Confirm the length of your lease with your landlord and make sure it's clearly written on the lease agreement before you sign the papers. If you’re able to choose your move-in date, consider moving in at the first of the month. If that’s not an option and you have to move in mid-month, see if you can negotiate a pro-rated rent price so you don’t have to pay a full month’s rent. [13] X Research source Pro-rated rent means that you only pay for the amount of time you're actually there. For example, if your monthly rent is $1,000 and you move in mid-month, pro-rated rent would be $500 because you're only there for 2 weeks of that month. Do not hand over any rent or security deposit money until you sign the lease. Once your payment clears, the landlord will hand over the keys. Keep in mind that there’s no law requiring landlords to give pro-rates, but most will honor this, especially if you ask about it specifically.
