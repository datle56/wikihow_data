      "content": "At auction Another popular place to find legit movie props is a reputable auction house or online auction site.

      "content": "Brick-and-mortar stores or movie prop warehouses Physical shops for used movie props aren’t as common as online stores or auction houses, but you still have a chance to discover some cool finds (especially if you live near a film industry town with prop warehouses like Los Angeles, Atlanta, or London). Search “movie prop warehouses near [city]” to see options available near you; these locations refresh their inventories often For example, if you’re near LA, you might have luck finding props at places like the Warner Bros. Property Department or the Universal Studios Property Department . [1] X Research source Keep in mind that studios may not have all items available for sale, and some are rental-only. There are also a handful of straight-up prop shops (especially near industry towns), like It’s a Wrap Hollywood in California. These are even rarer than actual studio warehouses and may not have the same guarantee of authenticity, though."

      "content": "A Certificate of Authenticity (COA) is best, but there are other ways to tell. It’s true that a COA can be faked, but if it’s presented by a reputable seller, prop house, or auction house, then chances are it’s legitimate. Check to make sure the certificate includes a description of the prop, its provenance (a record of its ownership and/or creation), and information about the scene it appeared in. Other ways to feel confident your prop is genuine include: [2] X Research source Buying it from a reputable, legitimate seller or auction house. Looking for signs of use, markings, or product materials that match what you see on screen and that look similar to other props from the movie or TV show. Asking people who work in the field (prop makers, production workers from the movie or TV show, etc.) if the prop looks well made or similar to other props from the same film."

      "content": "Many studios have their own prop warehouses and prop builders. Major film studios have large warehouses where they have props, costumes, set pieces, and other items on hand to use in their movies. If they need a prop they don’t already have on hand, they’ll ask their own prop designers and builders (sometimes with the help of external specialists) to create new props. This is common when a prop is really hard to find somewhere else or requires special customization for the movie. [3] X Research source There are also entire prop businesses that specialize in making, selling, or renting props to studios. Some are fairly general, while others focus on specific niches (like medical supplies props, plant and landscaping props, or even dollar bills from businesses like Prop Money ). Sometimes, studios will contact private owners or museums to see if they’re willing to lend or rent a specific artifact or item. When practical, some studios try to use the “real thing” instead of a prop (for example, purchasing disposable coffee cups from a café instead of making prop cups)."

      "title": "Most custom-built props are stored in warehouses or sent out for display.",
      "content": "Most custom-built props are stored in warehouses or sent out for display. In the past, it wasn’t uncommon for custom props to be reused in later films or TV shows, but today, they’re more likely to be retired or archived in a warehouse to prevent reuse (some directors will even pay to have them destroyed or disposed of so they aren’t used again). Popular props may also be sent to museums, charities, theme parks, and restaurants to be displayed as an attraction or exhibit for the public to enjoy. [4] X Research source Cast and crew members are sometimes allowed to keep 1 or 2 props, but most of the time, they have to return them all (especially if it was a rented artifact). Some actors try to sneak away with a prop or two, but they often have to return them if they get caught."
