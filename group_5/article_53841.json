      "content": "Enjoy a croissant warm or at room temperature but always fresh-baked. It’s just as tasty to eat a croissant toasted or at room temperature. Heat a croissant up in the oven or a toaster oven at home, or eat them at room temperature on-the-go. Put a croissant in the oven or toaster oven at 350 degrees F (175 C) for 5 minutes to heat it up."

      "content": "Peel off the top center part of the croissant and eat it first. Hold down the two ends of the croissant with the thumb and index fingers of one hand. Tear off the middle top layer with your other hand and enjoy the crunchiest part of the croissant. [2] X Research source Try to do this on a plate if you can to catch crumbs."

Think of it like a hot dog bun and leave it connected on one side so that it can hold all the fruit and whipped cream easily."
