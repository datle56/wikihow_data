      "content": "Poke holes in the potato with a fork. Poke 4 to 5 holes on each side of the potato using a fork. These holes will allow steam to escape while the potato cooks, preventing the potato from exploding in the microwave. Once the potato is thoroughly poked, place it on a microwave-safe plate or dish.

      "title": "Microwave the potato",
      "content": "Microwave the potato for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Microwave the potato on full power for at least 3 minutes. Stop the microwave and remove the potato to check its doneness. A single potato typically takes around 5 minutes on each side to cook, but it’s better to err on the side of caution to avoid overcooking it. Once 1 side is cooked, flip it over and microwave it for another 3 to 5 minutes. [3] X Research source If you’re cooking a potato that isn’t a Russet, alter the cooking time accordingly (less for a baking smaller potatoes and more for larger potatoes). For instance, a large sweet potato may take 7 minutes, while a baby red potato may take 2 minutes."

      "content": "Squeeze the potato to see if it’s fully cooked. Using an oven mitt or kitchen towel, gently squeeze the sides of the potato. If the potato is tender enough to give under the pressure and for the skin to break and open up, it’s done. If the potato is still firm, place it back in the microwave and check it again after another minute of cooking."

Sprinkle them with a seasoning of your choice, such as salt and pepper, ranch dressing powder, oregano, or garlic powder. Toss the pieces until they’re fully coated. When you’re done tossing, arrange the potatoes on the plates as before—flat and not overlapping."

      "content": "Poke the potatoes with a fork to see when they're done. Starting at 5 minutes, check the potato pieces to see if they're fully cooked by piercing them with a fork. If you can pierce through the potato effortlessly, they’re done. If the pieces are hard and difficult to pierce, place them back in the microwave and continue cooking, checking for doneness in 1-minute intervals. Once the potatoes are fully cooked, serve them as a side dish or top them with your favorite baked potato toppings (such as cheese, sour cream, and chives)."

Do not peel or pierce the potato. Russet or Idaho potatoes make the best fluffy mashed potatoes because of their high starch content. [7] X Research source Yukon gold potatoes are another great option, especially if you’re craving a more buttery texture."

Microwave on high for 5 minutes. Remove, uncover, and check the potato to see if it's fully cooked. If not, continue microwaving for another minute and check again. The potato is fully cooked if it gives under your finger when you squeeze it or if a fork easily pierces it. To speed up the process, cut the potato into quarters or small cubes before microwaving it. [8] X Research source"
