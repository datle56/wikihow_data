Facebook can be a great way to get information to another person quickly, but it isn’t always the most appropriate option, depending on the circumstances. In general, if you receive the invitation in a form other than Facebook (paper invitation in the mail, email invitation, etc.), the host probably gave you RSVP instructions with the invite and you should follow those. [7] X Research source Responding via Facebook may not be the right option for more formal events – like weddings – that usually send out paper invitations."

For more casual events, this is a great way to get the information to the host. [8] X Research source Make sure that you also RSVP on the actual event if the host made a Facebook event for the occasion. Reader Poll: We asked 190 wikiHow readers how they preferred to respond to an informal dinner invitation, and only 4% of them said an in-person conversation. [Take Poll] So, if you want to avoid any awkward in-person conversations when RSVPing to casual events, you aren't alone. Just be sure that you're following any specific instructions for responding."

If the person hosting the event made a post on their Facebook wall about an event, it may be appropriate to leave a comment about whether or not you can make it as a comment on the post. You may also want to make your own post on the host’s Facebook page. Try saying something like, “Hi, Sally! I can’t wait to see you at the party on Saturday!” This is usually only appropriate for more casual events (like a family dinner or movie night at a friend’s place). Again, if the host made an actual Facebook event in addition to the post, you should be sure to indicate whether you’re coming or not on the event itself as well."
