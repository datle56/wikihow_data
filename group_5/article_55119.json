From an anatomical perspective, a person’s nipples are filled with hundreds of different nerve endings. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Getting a nipple piercing essentially involves a piercer sticking a needle through those nerve endings, which will definitely hurt to some degree. However, every person has a different pain tolerance, so there’s no universal answer to how much nipple piercings will hurt. Some people experience little pain at all, while others find nipple piercings to be more painful than other types of piercings. It really depends on the person!"

      "content": "Expect to pay upwards of $50 for a nipple piercing. At the end of the day, the individual price points come down to the studio you visit. However, it’s important to note that most studios charge a separate piercing and jewelry fee—so, when you’re browsing their website, add both of these fees together to get an idea of your final cost. If you plan on getting both nipples pierced at the same time, multiply the studio's combined piercing and jewelry fee by 2. Studios will likely offer jewelry at different price points. So, if you want to shell out for something fancy, you totally can, but there will likely be a budget-friendly option as well."

If you absolutely have to touch the piercing, remember to wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap first or wear gloves. [21] X Research source Avoid twisting or turning the jewelry in the piercing for the first couple of months, except when cleaning. Twisting the jewelry aggravates the piercing and slows down healing. Be careful when playing sports or during any physical activity, as the jewelry may be torn from the piercing if knocked against too roughly. Cover the piercing with a waterproof wound sealant bandage if you plan on going swimming. Do not remove the ring or barbell from the piercing until it has fully healed."

[22] X Research source Keep in mind that some people may take up to a year to fully heal. Additionally, it’s possible that your nipple will reject the piercing. If your nipple keeps getting infected or has a red streak, it’s likely rejecting the piercing. See your piercer or a doctor in this case."

Bars are a common jewelry style used for a variety of different piercings, including nipples—they’re essentially a thin, straight piece of metal that’s secured with metal balls on each end. Rings, on the other hand, are circular pieces of jewelry that go through the nipple. [23] X Research source Gauge is the measurement used by professional piercers when discussing the width of a piercing. The larger the gauge, the more narrow the jewelry is—for instance, a 20-gauge piece of jewelry would only be .81 mm wide, while a 6-gauge piece would be 4.12 mm. For body piercings beneath the neck area, professional piercers advise going no larger than 14-gauge. [24] X Research source"

Steel that’s considered ASTM F-148 or ISO-5822-1 complaint makes the cut, as well as titanium labeled ASTM 5136 or ISO 5832-3 compliant. Certain types of gold (typically 14-karat or higher), a nickel-free platinum alloy, PTFE, and a few other materials also make the cut.

While it’s generally not a great idea to remove nipple jewelry (in case the piercing closes up), it’s actually a safety hazard to nurse with it in, as your little one could potentially choke on the jewelry if it accidentally comes off. Whenever you remove or replace your jewelry, take extra care to wash your hands and clean your jewelry diligently to prevent infection.
