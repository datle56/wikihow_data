      "content": "“NTY” means “no thank you” over text, social media, and online chats. It’s a polite way of refusing an offer you’re not interested in. If someone is trying to sell you something or won’t stop messaging you, use “NTY” to quickly shut them down and end the conversation. Since it’s an informal acronym, it’s best for casual conversations outside of the workplace. [1] X Research source The acronym can be written in all lowercase (“nty”) or uppercase (“NTY”), but some people may think it’s a typo for “nyt” (as in “good night”) or “NYT” (as in the “New York Times”). Depending on the context of the conversation, “NTY” can come off as genuine or dismissive. Ending it with a period (“NTY.”) is usually considered passive aggressive, while adding a smiley emoji at the end is more warm and friendly."
