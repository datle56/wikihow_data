      "title": "Trick your brain into thinking you’ll just do it later.",
      "content": "Trick your brain into thinking you’ll just do it later. Sometimes, it helps to delay something you really shouldn’t be doing. After 10 minutes, tell yourself to put it off for another 5 minutes. Eventually, you’ll lose track of time, and you won’t have texted your crush at all. [1] X Research source While you wait, try to do something else. This technique doesn’t work quite as well if you’re just sitting and staring at the clock."

      "title": "If it can stay out of sight, it can stay out of mind.",
      "content": "If it can stay out of sight, it can stay out of mind. Place your phone in your room and close the door behind you. If you can’t reach your phone, then you can’t text your crush! [2] X Research source Alternatively, you could put your phone in a drawer or even put it on airplane mode. This technique works best if you walk away from your phone to go do something else."

      "title": "Replace the urge to text your crush with a different conversation.",
      "content": "Replace the urge to text your crush with a different conversation. Hit up your friend and chat about your day or what you had for lunch. They can help distract you and keep your mind off your love interest. [3] X Research source If you want to, you could clue your friend in on your struggle. They might be able to help you resist your urge!"

      "title": "Your friends can help distract you from your crush.",
      "content": "Your friends can help distract you from your crush. If you can, call up a friend and invite them over or go to someone’s house. Tell them that you’re trying not to text your crush, and ask them to keep you occupied so you stop thinking about it. [4] X Research source If all your friends are busy, try hanging out with your family instead."

    {
      "title": "Take a bubble bath or listen to soothing music.",
      "content": "Take a bubble bath or listen to soothing music. Spend some time chilling out and relaxing on your own to take your mind off your crush. As you chill, leave your phone in the other room so you aren’t tempted to grab it and send off a quick text. [5] X Research source You could also try putting on a face mask, reading a good book, or painting your nails."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can’t send a text if your hands are full!",
      "content": "You can’t send a text if your hands are full! Head to the kitchen and bake something, do a little digging in the garden, or try finger painting. The more you keep your hands busy and occupied, the less tempted you’ll be to grab for your phone. [6] X Research source You could also try making slime, making jewelry, or doing a collage."

      "title": "If it’s late at night, texting them now might be a little strange.",
      "content": "If it’s late at night, texting them now might be a little strange. Try to save your texts for normal hours (like when you’d both be awake). Texting your crush late at night can insinuate that you’re only interested in hooking up, so it’s best to save your message for the day time. [7] X Research source Plus, if your crush is already sleeping, they might not be too happy to get woken up by your text."

    {
      "title": "If you don’t actually have anything to say, don’t text them.",
      "content": "If you don’t actually have anything to say, don’t text them. While it might be fun to text your crush a simple “hey,” it usually doesn’t lead to a very interesting conversation. Save your correspondence for when you have a fun story to share or you want to ask your crush to hang out. [8] X Research source Try to imagine what your crush would reply. If it’s not something super interesting, it can probably wait until you two see each other."
