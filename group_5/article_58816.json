      "content": "Be extreme. Eminem’s delivery is intense and extreme. Don’t be afraid to talk about taboo subjects or take unpopular stances on certain things.

      "title": "Tell a story in your rhymes.",
      "content": "Tell a story in your rhymes. Instead of just rapping about random events in your life, think about ways to tell a story in your song. One of Eminem’s calling cards is telling an entire story in a song. Instead of having disconnected lyrics, try to write lyrics that are cohesive and that tell a whole story. For example, in the song \"Stan,\" Eminem tells the story of an obsessed fan and the tragic consequences of his actions. You can write about a significant event in your life."

      "title": "Include metaphors and current events in your rhymes.",
      "content": "Include metaphors and current events in your rhymes. On top of his story-telling technique, Eminem is also known for metaphors and wordplay. Speak on current events and let people know where you stand on sensitive issues. Think of different ways to describe things and try to link different parts of society together. [3] X Research source For example, in the song \"Nail in the Coffin\" Eminem raps \"‘Cause you'll be all over the street, like 50 Cent\" which refers to the then popularity of rapper 50 Cent and how he was widely distributed, while creating wordplay because pocket change can often be found on the street. You can create metaphors about school and how it's like a prison or violence and how it's like a war."

      "title": "Write your lyrics down.",
      "content": "Write your lyrics down. Eminem writes down his lyrics and the thoughts that he has.

Keep a notepad or smartphone with you so that you can write down lyrics as you think of them. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Edit your rhymes.",

      "title": "Give words a different pronunciation to rhyme them.",
      "content": "Give words a different pronunciation to rhyme them. Many times Eminem’s lines don’t rhyme but they sound like they do. This is commonly referred to as “bending words” and can be used to rhyme two words that sound similar but don’t rhyme. Adjust the pronunciation of certain vowels so that the words sound the same. [7] X Research source For example, in “Lose Yourself” Eminem rhymes “arms are heavy” with “mom’s spaghetti.” “Arms” and “mom’s” don’t rhyme, but can sound similar if you enunciate the o and m at the end of “mom’s” to sound like the r and m in “arms.” In “Lose Yourself”, Eminem uses bending words to create the lines “oh there goes Rabbit/ he choked he’s so mad but he/no he won’t have it he.” In this rhyme, “oh” sounds like “choked” and “no,” “goes” sounds like “so” and “won’t,” and Rabbit sounds like “mad” and “have.”"

      "title": "Write multisyllabic rhymes.",
      "content": "Write multisyllabic rhymes. Words like “duck” and “truck” are single syllable rhymes. Eminem employs a more advanced rhyming scheme in the majority of his songs known as multisyllabic rhyming. This means that multiple parts of each word or multiple syllables within a word rhyme. When writing down your rhymes, break down larger words into parts and try to rhyme each corresponding part with another word. The song \"Infinite\" is a great example of multisyllabic rhyming when Eminem says, \"Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction/To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action/A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction.\" [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Record yourself and listen to the playback. After you’ve written some verses, you can try to rap them out loud. Record yourself with an audio recorder and listen to the recording. Pay attention to your flow and see if the rhymes sound good. Take notice of places where you stumble or parts of the lyrics that don’t sound good. Concentrate on the areas where you’re weak."

      "title": "Start small.",
      "content": "Start small. If you don’t have any experience rapping, it’s best to start off with simple verses and simple rhymes. Don’t try to do complex or multi-syllable rhymes when you’re first starting off. Instead, use the simplest verses you can think of and keep practicing them until you master them.
