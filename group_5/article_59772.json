Instagram has not released a feature that lets users know which specific users are snooping (yet). If you're curious about who's looking at your profile, you can upgrade to a professional account to see the number of profile visits . This is only the number of hits your profile has, not individual users. There may be third-party apps that claim you can see who viewed your profile. However, these apps may lock you out of your account or get your account permanently banned . Be wary of any third-party apps that involve entering your login information. While users can’t see who looked at their profile, they can still see who viewed their Stories ."
