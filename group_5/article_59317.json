      "content": "Tighten the ball locking and center column knobs. You won’t be able to unscrew the tripod head if any parts are loose. Start by turning the ball locking knob on the head clockwise to lock the head in place. Then turn the center column knob, underneath the head, clockwise as well until it stops. Double check to make sure the tripod head isn’t moving. [1] X Research source If your tripod or head have any more moving parts, lock them as well. Any loose parts might make it harder to remove the head."

      "content": "Hold the tripod by its center column with one hand. Use your non-dominant hand. Grab the tripod center column and hold it firmly. [2] X Research source Some tripods don’t have a center column. If yours doesn’t, then grab it by one of the legs and hold it tightly."

      "title": "Turn the tripod head counterclockwise to loosen it.",
      "content": "Turn the tripod head counterclockwise to loosen it. With your other hand, grab the tripod head. Turn it counterclockwise to unscrew it. You may need to apply some pressure to get it started, since most people don’t replace the heads very often. [3] X Research source If the tripod head doesn’t seem to be loosening, then some of the locking knobs might not be tight enough. Try double checking those and making sure they’re all locked in place."

      "content": "Pull the old head off when it unscrews. After just a few turns, the tripod head should pop off of the main body. Lift it off and put it aside. [4] X Research source Hold on to the head as you’re unscrewing it. If it comes loose unexpectedly, you could drop it and break it."

In this case, follow the instructions provided to assemble the head correctly before you install it. [5] X Research source Commonly, the camera mount isn’t installed on new heads. Simply loosen the knob next to the camera platform and slide the mount into position. Then tighten the knob to lock it in place."

      "content": "Tighten the pan knob on the new head. Just like with removing the old head, all the parts on the new head need to be locked or it won’t screw on properly. Turn the pan knob clockwise until it stops to lock the head in place. [7] X Research source If there are any other adjustment knobs on the new head, tighten them as well."

Hold the new head straight up and line the hole on the bottom up with this mounting screw. [8] X Research source Make sure you keep the new head pointed directly up so it doesn’t screw on crooked. Less commonly, some tripod heads have a screw coming out that goes into a slot on the tripod. In this case, you would insert the screw and tighten the tripod knob to lock the head in place.

[10] X Research source Check under the head to make sure there's no space between the head and tripod mount. The 2 parts should fit snugly together. If there's any space, unscrew the head and reattach it."

The head should not unscrew or loosen while you move it around. Check to make sure it stays snug. [11] X Research source If you have any problems, unscrew the head and try again. Make sure it stays completely upright as you're screwing it into position. If it's crooked, then it won't attach properly."
