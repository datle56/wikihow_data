      "content": "Ocean monuments are rare, pyramid-like structures that can be found in large ocean biomes. Some ocean monuments have one or two rooms with around 30 sponges attached to the ceiling and walls. This is the easier way to gain sponges. Sponges in the sponge rooms can be harvested with a hoe . You can use explorer maps to find ocean monuments, though they are not guaranteed to show one. Explorer maps can be purchased from apprentice-level cartographers in villages, or found in underwater shipwrecks or underwater ruins. You can also find an ocean monument by feeding raw cod or raw salmon to dolphins to get them to lead you to a shipwreck, buried treasure, or ocean monument. If they don't lead you to an underwater monument, you can feed them again to get them to lead you to a different location. [1] X Research source When exploring an ocean monument, it is recommended that you bring potions of water breathing , as well as potions of night vision and regeneration ."

      "content": "Ocean monuments are protected by Guardians. An Elder Guardian resides in the highest room. You can gain a sponge by slaying the Elder Guardian. The Elder Guardian is a tough mob to kill, so it is recommended you bring a strong sword or a trident to fight the Elder Guardian. You will gain one sponge from killing the Elder Guardian. This is the harder way to gain sponges."

      "content": "Dry sponges can be used to absorb blocks of water. Placing a dry sponge within blocks of water will absorb surrounding blocks of water up to 7 blocks in all directions. A single block and hold up to 65 blocks of water. A wet sponge has a slightly greenish tint to it. [2] X Research source Drying a wet sponge: When you harvest sponges from an ocean monument, they will be wet. To dry a sponge, place it in a furnace with some fuel . Once a dry sponge has been used to absorb water, it will become wet again. A wet sponge can be dried and reused. You can also place a sponge in a furnace with a bucket in place of the fuel. This will fill the bucket with water."
