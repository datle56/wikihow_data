Scan the instructions to your computer for permanent easy retrieval. Reread these whenever needed to remind you. Follow the instructions for disassembling and reassembling the shakers."

      "content": "Fill the right shaker with the right seasoning. This may seem basic but it's actually subject to considerable controversy and depends on your preferences: Some say that salt needs the container with less holes but larger ones, because it's the bigger grain to get through the holes. Others prefer the salt to have more holes but smaller because it allows for more of the seasoning to flavor the dish. Some say that pepper needs to container with larger and more holes because it's a bigger grain that is harder to shake through. The answer probably falls into a gray area––it depends on the size of the grains (really finely ground or chunkier), family/restaurant preference and the tradition you've been raised with. Complicating the answer is the fact that there seem to be different standards in different countries. Go with the flow that works best for you!"

      "content": "Ask a stronger person to open it. In some cases, there is nothing for it but brute force. Get someone who has a strong grip to place their fingers and thumb around the edges of the stopper and to pull really hard a few times. Eventually the stopper will begin to loosen and can be pulled out."

      "content": "Try softening the stopper by washing the shaker in warm water. This will only work if you're happy to let existing contents get washed away. Also, the container needs to be washable, so it's not ideal for untreated wooden shakers. Let the shaker soak for 10 minutes or so in warm water. See if it will ease out while in the water still. If not, proceed to the next step. Remove from the water and let dry or hand dry with a soft tea towel. Try removing the stopper again; hopefully the warmer water has softened it a little."
