Wring out the excess water and hang them up outside or in a ventilated area to air dry. Fresh air can help get rid of any formaldehyde smell left over in your clothes.

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of white vinegar into the washing machine. White vinegar is a natural deodorizer and can even help to brighten your clothes. Stocker says that, for strong odors, add 1 cup (240 mL) vinegar in place of the detergent in the wash cycle and add another 1 cup (240 mL) directly into the washing machine for the rinse cycle. Alternatively (or additionally), add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) lemon juice to help break down the scent molecules trapped in the fabric. [6] X Research source To combat any residual vinegar odor, Stocker recommends adding “several drops of essential oil such as lavender or tea tree. Tea tree is a natural anti-germicide and antifungal, and lavender has a beautiful scent!”"

Stocker says that you cannot mix detergent and vinegar together—“If you are using detergent, only use the vinegar in the rinse cycle after the detergent is out. You’ll get oily clothes otherwise.” Avoid using chlorine bleach with the vinegar—when the two mix together, they create toxic chlorine gas. [8] X Research source"
