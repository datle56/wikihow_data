If the original creator has a private account and invites a public account, the joint post will be shared publicly. All this appears in a pop-up window when a private account invites other collaborators. [1] X Research source"

Finally, tap the x next to that collaborator's username and they can no longer collaborate on that post. If you're not the original creator of the post, you can't delete it. However, you can remove yourself from it. Simply navigate to the post, tap the three-dot icon, and tap Stop sharing to remove yourself from someone else's collab."
