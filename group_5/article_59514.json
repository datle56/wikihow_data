      "content": "Assess how much restraint is needed. Keep in mind that the least amount of restraint you can use, while also effectively restraining the cat, is generally the best way to avoid severely upsetting the cat. For instance, if you can simply pick your cat up and move it away from a bad situation, you should do that."

      "title": "Scruff the cat.",
      "content": "Scruff the cat. For quick painless procedures, such as giving a pill or drops in the ear, the cat’s scruff can be used to restrain the cat. As long as you do not attempt to lift the cat by the scruff, it is a perfectly acceptable means of restraint. This technique should only be used when the cat is resting its body on a flat surface such as a table, floor, or counter. The loose skin on the back of the neck can be gripped in one hand to restrain the cat. [1] X Research source Using your dominant hand, grasp the loose skin (the scruff) in a firm grip as the cat is facing away from you. This gives you a secure grip on the cat and it is thought that this may have a slight calming effect on a cat as long as it isn’t too upset. While holding the scruff, you can also grab the rear legs with your other hand to lay the cat on its side. Place your hand around the lower rear legs and place your index finger between the legs and gently stretch the cat out. The front feet will often grab onto the edge of what the cat is sitting on, keeping the cat still. Never lift a cat up by the scruff. You can injure the cat this way as it cannot hold a full grown cat’s body weight."

      "content": "Put a harness on the cat. A harness can be used to keep a firm grip on the cat even when it is trying to get away from you. Basically, a properly fitted harness will give you a good handle on the cat when light restraint is needed. A harness is more preferable than a collar, as a collar can hurt the neck or strangle a cat. You can even make an effective harness for your cat out of a leash. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Gather necessary equipment.",
      "content": "Gather necessary equipment. To safely restrain a cat there is some equipment that you will need. These include: A muzzle: There are specific muzzles made for cats which are different from muzzles used on dogs. Generally they are a “full face” type muzzle which keep the cat’s from seeing while the straps Velcro in place behind the ears. A towel: Thick bath-sized towels can be used to keep cats tightly bound so their feet cannot claw at you."

      "title": "Place a muzzle on the cat.",
      "content": "Place a muzzle on the cat. Cat muzzles are designed to keep a cat quiet by limiting its vision so it cannot find its target. These are slipped on over the nose and face with a strap, usually with a Velcro closure but sometimes with a plastic snap, that is fitted snugly behind the ear. A cat can still try to bite through this muzzle and, unless it is restrained, it can still use its feet and claws. These are only meant to be used for a few minutes to accomplish procedures, such as nail trims or a quick grooming, that only take less than 10 minutes to do. Of course, if you need to access the mouth (giving a pill or checking the teeth), look at the eyes, or place eye medication in the eyes, a muzzle is not an appropriate device. Also if the cat has breathing problems or a lung or nose condition do not use a muzzle. On “squished face” cats (like Persians) it is probably best NOT to use a muzzle as they can have breathing difficulties. If the cat has any problems breathing (rapid breathing), asthma, or becomes greatly distressed (yowling, struggling madly) remove the muzzle immediately, watching that it doesn’t bite you."

      "title": "Use a towel to restrain the cat.",
      "content": "Use a towel to restrain the cat. Place the bath sized towel, unfolded, on a table or counter-top. Put the cat in the center of the towel, with the length of its body parallel to the shorter dimension of the towel. Pull one end the towel up over the cat until it reaches the other side of its body, while applying moderately firm pressure to the towel so it’s snug. Then fold over the other side, essentially making a kitty burrito out of the cat. [3] X Research source Small Animal Care and Management. Dean Warren. Cengage Learning. 2015 [4] X Research source Make sure the sides are pulled up snuggly to keep the cat from being able to pull its legs out of the towel. If necessary, hold the cat in place using the scruff technique using your non-dominant hand to hold the cat still. Remember a cat can still use its teeth when in this position. Placing a hand behind the cat’s head can keep the head steady so you can keep your hands away from its mouth. You can combine a muzzle with the use of a thick towel as a good, complete way to control a cat."

      "content": "Restrain a cat more rapidly in an emergency situation. At times you may need to immediately pick up a cat, such as when it’s angry or hurt. Take a thick bath-sized towel or a folded blanket and toss it over the cat. Quickly grab the cat while it is covered with the material from the sides and place it into a carrier. [5] X Research source In this case you need to be very safe as an angry or hurt cat may bite you."
