How about dinner this Friday?” You could also keep it playful and say, “I hope you’re this charming and funny in person!” He may respond with something like, “Why don’t we find out? Wanna grab a coffee Sunday afternoon?” If he’s a little hesitant or doesn’t seem enthusiastic about meeting you, try keeping it lighthearted by saying, “Who knows, maybe one day we’ll actually get to meet face-to-face if the universe wants it.”"

He may play along with you, and while it started as a joke, it could easily end up as a real date! [4] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “I don’t know what to do. I really want to see this new movie on Friday night, but I don’t know any guys that I’ve been messaging on an almost daily basis who might be interested in going with me. Do you know anybody?” You could also try, “I seem to be all out of dates for this weekend. I wish there was someone who could help me out.”"

[7] X Research source You could try, “I’ve got nothing going on this weekend, what about you?” He may say something like, “Me either! Wanna go see a movie?” or he could say, “I’ve got this boring work party, any chance you want to come and make it more interesting?” If he doesn’t seem interested in getting together, you can easily deflect and keep the conversation going with something like, “No problem if not, we can always try again in the future!”"

You can still enjoy messaging him back and forth and seeing where things go. If you have great chemistry and he starts to really like you, he may feel comfortable just asking you out. [9] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with taking your time and letting your relationship develop organically as you get to know each other online. Try not to come on too strong by sending a ton of messages in a row or by getting upset if he takes a while to get back to you. It could make you look desperate or drive him away. If he doesn’t seem to be making any moves, you may want to consider dropping some hints here and there that you’d like to go out with him."

Play it cool and calm whenever you’re messaging each other back and forth. Don’t make a big deal about it if he takes a while to respond to your messages or if he doesn’t pick up on any of your hints that you want him to ask you out. It could actually make him want to chase after you even more.

Do you want to come?” You could also try, “One of my favorite bands is playing a show Friday night. You wanna go with me?” Reader Poll: We asked 2388 wikiHow readers about which first date they’d like to go on the most, and only 8% said going rock climbing .
