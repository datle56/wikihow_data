      "content": "Scrambled eggs are a tried and true breakfast staple. Light and fluffy, these eggs are made by beating raw egg whites and yolks together then cooking in a pan gently over low heat. Some recipes add milk, cheese, or seasonings like salt and pepper to the eggs, and adding hot sauce or ketchup is a great way to spice up this easy dish. [1] X Research source The texture of scrambled eggs can vary depending on temperature and cooking time. Eggs cooked at a lower temperature for longer tend to be more moist, whereas eggs cooked at a higher heat for less time can shrink and become more dry. [2] X Research source Scrambled eggs go great with a side of toast and bacon, on a cheesy breakfast sandwich, or even in a breakfast taco. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Order hard boiled eggs for a reliable favorite.",
      "content": "Order hard boiled eggs for a reliable favorite. Protein-packed hard boiled eggs are boiled in salted water for about 10 minutes, then peeled from the shell and served. Both the egg whites and the yolk are set with this style, and they are commonly served on their own with a little butter, salt, and pepper. [4] X Research source Hard boiled eggs can also be added to salads or sandwiches or serve as the base for an egg salad."

      "title": "Ask for soft boiled if you prefer runny yolks.",
      "content": "Ask for soft boiled if you prefer runny yolks. These eggs are boiled for a shorter amount of time so that the egg whites are set, but the yolks are still runny. Since these eggs are harder to peel, they are often served in a small egg cup with the shell still on. To eat, lightly tap on the top of the egg with a knife or the side of a spoon, making a crack in the shell. [5] X Research source You can then take the top of the egg off, creating a thumb-sized opening in the egg for you to dip your toast or a fork into to eat the egg from the inside.

      "title": "Opt for the jammy yolk in medium boiled eggs.",
      "content": "Opt for the jammy yolk in medium boiled eggs. These eggs are boiled for about 7 minutes so that the egg white is completely set and the yolk is mostly set. The result is a jammy center to the egg that makes it possible to peel the shell of the egg while still having a little run to the yolk. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with fried eggs, sunny-side-up, for runny yolks.",
      "content": "Go with fried eggs, sunny-side-up, for runny yolks. This easy method of frying eggs doesn’t require any flipping or scrambling. Eggs are simply cracked gently into a hot, buttered pan and cooked until the yolk is set and the bottom of the whites are slightly browned. [8] X Research source While sunny-side-up eggs are great on their own or with a piece of toast or an English muffin, they also make great additions to a variety of dishes. Skillet meals like shakshuka feature perfectly cooked sunny-side-up eggs. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "For less of a mess, try fried eggs, over easy.",
      "content": "For less of a mess, try fried eggs, over easy. Like sunny-side-up eggs, fried eggs cooked over easy have runny yolks while the whites are cooked through. These eggs are gently flipped once so that both sides are briefly cooked while leaving the yolk intact. [10] X Research source Season your over easy eggs with salt and pepper or add a dash of hot sauce. These eggs are great on their own or on an open-faced sandwich."

      "content": "Order fried eggs, over hard, if you don’t like a runny yolk. Like over easy eggs, over hard eggs are flipped so that both sides cook but are cooked for longer, allowing the white and yolk to set evenly. If you’re not a fan of a runny yolk, try getting your fried eggs over hard. [11] X Research source Since these eggs are less messy, they go well in breakfast sandwiches of all kinds."

      "content": "Over medium fried eggs are a great in between option. These eggs are exactly what they sound like: fried eggs that are cooked for longer than over easy eggs but for shorter than over hard ones. The result is a yolk that’s not fully set but more jammy. [12] X Research source These eggs are great on their own or they can add a little more moisture to a breakfast sandwich without getting too messy."

[13] X Research source Shirred eggs can be seasoned with salt and pepper, and you can add toppings like cheese or breadcrumbs to add some extra texture and flavor.

From there, you can add any combination of ingredients to create a flavorful meal. The omelet is then folded over the fillings, creating a half moon shape.

      "content": "Poached eggs are cooked in water, not fat, for a healthy dish. Poached eggs are made by bringing a poaching liquid, typically water or a flavored broth, to a strong simmer, swirling the liquid, and cracking the egg in. The result is a runny yolk, encased in soft egg whites. [17] X Research source While some enjoy poached eggs on their own or with a piece of toast, they also pair well with smoked salmon, ham, beans, sauteed spinach, and mushrooms. Poached eggs are also great additions to open faced sandwiches, salads, and noodle and rice dishes."
