Step into a well-light room with a mirror, and take note of where the highlights and shadows fall naturally on your face. These are the areas that you will be applying the highlighter and contour to. If your skin tone is dark enough, then the highlighter may give you enough contrast so that you don't need the contour."

      "content": "Apply cheek contour to the hollows of your cheeks to slim them down. Use a medium-sized brush to apply the contour powder into the hollows of your cheeks, below the highlighter, leaving a slim gap. There should be a small gap at the round of the cheek where blending occurs. Focus on the area closest to your ear; the contour should be very thin and light the closer it gets to your mouth. [1] X Research source If you have very prominent cheekbones or sunken cheeks, then you might not need to contour this area. Don't worry about blending everything in just yet. You'll do that at the end. Suck your cheeks in if you have troubles finding the hollows. Apply the powder contour after you've applied the rest of your makeup. [2] X Research source"

Use the shadows that fall naturally upon your face as a guide. Blend the shadow along your hairline towards the middle of your forehead. [3] X Research source If you have a small forehead, you may not have much shadow at the top of your forehead, which is fine. You are working with your natural features, after all! For a more masculine look, make the shadows at the temples more angled and prominent."

Use a thin brush to apply a thin line of contour to either side of your nose bridge, next to the highlighter, leaving a slim gap for blending. Blend the shadow away from the highlighter and towards your face. [5] X Research source Do not apply contour to your entire nose, or it will end up too intense. It is better to apply just a thin line, then blend it out. Do not blend the contour over your nostrils. Instead, sweep it down and under the tip of your nose."

      "content": "Blend the contoured areas until no harsh lines remain. Start by running a large, clean brush along the edges where highlighter meets contour. Next, blend the shadows away from the highlighted edges, as needed. For example, if you applied contour to the hollows of your cheeks, blend it downward. Use large brushes for large areas, such as your forehead, and small brushes for small areas, such as your nose. [6] X Research source For small areas, such as the fulcrum, simply run a clean brush along that area to soften it up."

Another way to determine your skin undertone is to see how easily you suntan or burn. If you tan easily, you likely have warm skin; if you burn easily, you probably have cool skin. [7] X Research source If your skin has a pink or red base, you likely have a cooler skin tone. If you have a yellow base, you likely have a warmer skin tone. A lot of people are somewhere in between.

In this case, buy the one that matches your undertone. If the kits are not labeled, purchase a yellow-tinted kit if you have warm skin, or a pinkish kit if you have cool skin. Gold and bronze shades are good for warm skin. Nutty or woodsy hues like mahogany and walnut are better for cool skin. Many contour kits work well for both warm and cool. You should also think about if your skin is light, medium, or dark. Using a palette that is too dark looks fake."

This means that you can use just about any pressed powder, such as foundation or blush, as long as it works with your undertone and tone. [10] X Research source Eyeshadow tends to be more intense in color than other powders, so it's harder to work with. If you do use eyeshadow, choose matte for your shadows and either matte or shimmery for your highlights. Do not buy loose powder. Use pressed powder; it is easier to apply."
