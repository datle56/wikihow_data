      "content": "“OOMF” means “one of my followers” or “one of my friends.” “Oomf” is a way to call out or drop hints to one of your followers online without naming or mentioning them specifically. It can be used flirtatiously or passive aggressively and is most common on Twitter and TikTok, although it means the same thing on any social media platform. [1] X Research source The acronym first appeared as a hashtag in 2010 and was immediately popular. [2] X Research source “oomf’s selfies are looking real fine today 😍” “I’m gonna block oomf if they post one more photo of their cat!” Use “OOMF” with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or as a hashtag (“#oomf”)."

      "content": "“OOMF” likely just means “one of my friends” over text. Since your texts aren’t posted publicly and you can’t have text followers, assume “oomf” refers to someone’s real life friend. It could still mean “followers” if the person you’re texting with is talking about their Twitter or TikTok following specifically, though. Them: “Where are you?” You: “I’m at oomf’s house.” You: “oomf told me it’s supposed to rain later” Them: “Noooo!!”"

      "content": "Try “oomfie” or “croomf” to put an affectionate spin on “OOMF.” “Oomfie” is a flirty way to say “oomf” and usually refers to someone you really like or have a crush on. Similarly, “croomf” (“crush” + “oomf”) means a follower or friend you’re infatuated with. [3] X Research source “I hope oomfie likes my vacation photos 🥺” “If I am somebody’s croomf, let me know!”"

      "content": "Use “proomf” to talk about followers who can view your private account. “Proomf” comes from the words “private” and “oomf” put together. You get to decide who your “proomfs” are since you’ll get a notification asking you to accept or decline their follow request . A “proomf” has a better chance of figuring out you’re talking about them than a regular “oomf.” [4] X Research source “I tweet my silly little jokes for you, proomfs” “I’m about to remove proomf if they keep retweeting cat videos!”"

Get flirty online and talk about “oomf” playfully to get your followers blushing and wondering “are they talking about me?” If you want your online crush to get the message, drop a detail about something they posted or what they look like and wait for them to slide into your DMs! Use the gender neutral “they” pronoun to keep things extra vague, or use “he” or “she” to be more specific. [5] X Research source “oomf is looking mighty cute in their blue hat selfie today 😘” “oomf keeps tweeting about how no one wants to date him but I’m right here! hello!!”"

Use “oomf” to talk about someone’s tweet, TikTok video, or other post if you don’t know them well enough to comment on, retweet , or share their content. “oomf posted about ice cream today and now I have a craving!” “ugh, oomf tweeted that my favorite singer is coming to town the ONE weekend I’m gone traveling! 😭”"

      "content": "Be shady or passive aggressive towards a follower with “OOMF.” If someone is irritating you online but you don’t want to engage them directly, broadcast your distaste or threaten to block them with a vague “oomf” tweet. This is similar to “subtweeting,” or tweeting about someone that’s bothering you online or in real life (like a roommate, coworker, or in-law) without naming them. [6] X Research source “oomf just sent me a GROSS pic of themselves 🤮 Consider this your warning. You’re blocked next time!” “Maybe I could afford an impromptu vacay like oomf if my parents paid for it like theirs did 🙄” If your follower gets the message, they can’t rebuff you publicly without everyone finding out they were the “oomf.”"

      "content": "“OOMF” might be a misspelling of the word “oomph.” “Oomph” sounds the same as “OOMF” when you say it out loud, but it means a specific flair or style someone has that puts their look or work over the edge. If you use “oomph” in a tweet, your followers probably won’t think you’re referring to one of your followers. [7] X Research source “I love how she dresses, her looks just have this oomph factor!” “I could read your writing all day, it’s just OOMPH so good”"

      "content": "“OOMF” could be an onomatopoeia for a sound someone makes. Onomatopoeia is a rhetorical effect that uses a word to mimic a non-language sound (like “cuckoo” or “sizzle”). Someone might let out an “oomf” or “oof” noise if they bump into something accidentally or notice someone or something they find attractive. “I saw Mark at the mall and OOMF he looked good!” “I wasn’t paying attention and ran into the railing like oomf!”"
