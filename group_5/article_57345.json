      "content": "Scatter fresh flower petals over the bed to make it look magical. Do this yourself or call the concierge and ask if they have a “rose petal turndown service,” a fun extra that involves covering your hotel’s bed with fresh rose petals. If they do offer this, see if their rose petals come in different colors or if they can spell out a special message, like “Happy Anniversary.” Check out other unique forms of turndown services, too. Some hotels offer cute spins on them, like leaving books or souvenirs on your bed. If you'd like to really wow your partner, put a surprise gift on the decorated bed when they're not looking."

      "content": "Draw the curtains and turn off the lamps to set the mood. Whether you’ve arrived in the daytime or the evening, curtains block out bright, natural or artificial light from outside. Once you’ve shut them, switch on a lamp or two. That way, you’ll create a much more calming atmosphere in your hotel room.

      "content": "Give the hotel room a charming glow with some candles. Pull out candles with your favorite colors and scents. Put these down in places that won't be a fire hazard. To be extra cautious, you can use LED candles instead. Try candles that create nostalgia. For example, cinnamon might remind you of a special Christmas holiday you shared or coconut might remind you of you honeymoon in an exotic, island destination. Group candles of various heights together for an elegant touch. Play around with color, too. For instance, a combination of gold, blue, and ivory candles might feel right for the space."

      "content": "Put some champagne on ice for a real sense of celebration. Bring your bubbly chilled or order champagne from the hotel bar or room service. If you can, choose your favorite brand or one that has special significance to you and your SO. For example, maybe you bought it during a vacation. For a fun effect, open it in front of your partner and watch the cork pop off. Champagne pairs well with fresh strawberries. Serve your partner champagne with these at West, heart shaped fruit for full romance points. [2] X Research source Use caution when you open the bottle—make sure it isn’t pointed toward your or your SO’s face. Hold the bottle of champagne at an angle when you pour it, that way, it’ll bubble and fizz more. For a dash of color, add fresh frozen fruit, like raspberries, into your glasses. Sparkling grape juice is a great non-alcoholic alternative to champagne."
