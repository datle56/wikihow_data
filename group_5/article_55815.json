Unlike sending a “Hey,” text, using slang alternatives is a way to catch the other person’s attention. However, if you get a “hwy” text with an awkward placement such as the middle of the text, consider if the abbreviation is being used to convey, “why?” Because of the placement of the keys on a keyboard, “hwy” is a common typo for why. Avoid typos by taking a moment to think about what you want to say. Before hitting send, reread your text to catch any glaring errors."
