      "content": "Fry the chopped mushrooms and shallots in oil until they’re soft. Grease a skillet with 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of vegetable oil and set your stovetop to high heat. Toss 1 finely chopped shallot and 2 US tbsp (or around 15.5 g) of chopped mushrooms into the pan. Shift these around a bit with a spatula as you fry them so they don't burn or stick. [1] X Research source It should only take a few minutes for everything to brown. If you're using an electric stove, high heat will cause everything to burn (since it's direct contact). In this case, medium to medium-high heat is better."

Give the filling a few minutes to cool down before mixing it with the other ingredients. [2] X Research source"

Then, add 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of Dijon mustard and 2 tbsp (15 g) of regular breadcrumbs. Keep kneading and folding the ingredients together until they're well-mixed and the texture is consistent.

      "content": "Mold the filling into 2 sausage-shaped rolls that are 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. Divide the mincemeat filling into 2 even piles. Using your hands, roll the meat mixture into a sausage shape. Make these sausages about the same height as the strip steak, so your “olive” isn’t overstuffed. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the filling “sausages” on top of the beef steaks. Arrange each sausage along the left or right side of your strip steak. These strip steaks will form the “olive,” while the filling will form the “pit.” [6] X Research source Get steaks that are about 0.4 in (1 cm) thick. If your steak is too thick, pound it with a meat hammer or rolling pin ahead of time to flatten it out. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie both ends of the beef olives with string to secure them. Pinch both ends of the rolled-up beef olive so the meat and filling don’t unravel. Then, cut 2 small sections of kitchen string and tie them around both ends of the beef olive. This keeps the meat from coming apart while it cooks. [9] X Research source Use butcher's or kitchen twine for this—it's usually sold on the meat or kitchen section in the grocery store. It's a common, inexpensive product. Use toothpicks in addition to the string if you want to make everything extra secure. [10] X Research source"

Transfer any leftover beef olives and gravy to an airtight container. When enjoying your beef olives again, reheat the dish until it’s at least 165 °F (74 °C)."
