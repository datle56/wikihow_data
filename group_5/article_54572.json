Ask him things like: “What’s your favorite non-work thing to do?” “If you could only live in one place for the rest of your life, where would you live?” “What are you most proud about in your career so far?”"

      "content": "Capricorn men love talking to intelligent people about deep subjects. They’re smart guys that don’t care much for small talk or superficial subjects, so bring up practical things like work and money or deep topics like literature and philosophy. Check your news app before you flirt—your knowledge about current events, politics, and the economy will impress him too. [1] X Research source Enjoy yourself while you’re chatting about serious topics—he’ll notice if you’re into the conversation (and fall for you if you are). Capricorn men are very proper at first. Avoid bringing up controversial topics or making NSFW comments until you get to know him better. A stimulating conversation is a big turn on for a Cap man. When you can charm him intellectually first, he’ll be more open to physical flirtation later."

      "content": "Capricorn men aren’t the best texters. If it doesn’t revolve around needing his assistance, listening to what he has to say, or appealing to his sense of humor, you may get ghosted. Keep your messages short and your conversations efficient—stick to practical things like making plans, asking relevant questions, or offering him something beneficial to his career or interests. If you want to have a full text conversation, message him first. He’s unsure of himself when he’s flirting and will probably hesitate to reach out. Dirty talk and sexting aren't most Capricorn guys’ jam. Send him a radiant selfie or a pic of you wearing a cute outfit instead. His interest will be piqued when you leave a little something to the imagination. Respond to him promptly and reliably when he texts you. Capricorns love protocol and consistency, and he’ll reach out to you more when he knows what to expect."

      "content": "A Capricorn man goes wild for a polished look with a little mystery. Something form-fitting that accentuates your body is more attractive to him than showing a lot of skin. Make sure your clothes are always wrinkle-free and presentable, too—he’ll be into someone that looks sharp whether they’re out for cocktails or strutting into the board room for an important meeting. [2] X Research source Simple patterns and dark, neutral colors satisfy his preference for simplicity. Think classic colors like navy blue, black, brown, olive green, or charcoal gray. Simple accessories, like classic gold or silver jewelry, are appealing to a Capricorn man. Statement pieces or anything “loud” might be too eccentric. Play up your dark facial features—thick eyelashes, full brows, and a smokey eye are particularly alluring to him."

      "content": "A Capricorn man is cautious and won’t rush into intimacy. Innuendos, dirty jokes, and suggestive touches might scare him off if you lay them on too soon. Instead, focus on classic flirting moves—lots of eye contact and fluttering eyelashes, giggling at his jokes, and smiling work wonders on this old-school guy. Simple touches to his hand or leg while you’re talking are direct enough to get his attention without being intrusive.

      "content": "A Capricorn guy takes forever to decide whether to make a move or not. If your flirty eye contact and giggling aren't prodding him enough, make the first move by just telling him how you feel. He’ll appreciate how you cut to the chase—playing hard-to-get or making him guess how you feel will only push him away. Try: “Hey, I really enjoy spending time with you and would love to get to know you better.” “I like you as more than a friend. Let’s grab a coffee sometime.” “I’m just gonna come right out and say it—I really like you.”"

      "title": "If a Capricorn man feels rushed or hunted, he’ll start to distance himself.",
      "content": "If a Capricorn man feels rushed or hunted, he’ll start to distance himself. He takes his time evaluating people and doesn’t want to be pressured into a commitment. Get a few flirty interactions under your belt before you let him know how you feel to show him you have more than just a passing crush. Once your feelings are out there, give him time to process his reaction and respond. Don’t flirt with or pursue him too hard too soon. He might mistrust your familiarity and think you’re trying to manipulate him or get something out of him. Capricorn is not generally a “mushy” sign and they’re practical about the people they love. Getting too emotional too soon will make him think you’re not a compatible, practical match."

      "title": "Capricorn guys are independent and want control of their circumstances.",
      "content": "Capricorn guys are independent and want control of their circumstances. They need alone time to organize their thoughts and feelings and enjoy their personal space. At first, text him sparingly and aim to make plans once or twice a week. You might want to see him more, but he’s a distant, proper sign that sees spending too much time together early on as immature. As he warms up to you, he’ll want to spend more time with you. Any effort on his part to make plans or see you is a huge sign that your flirtatious efforts are paying off."

      "content": "As a practical earth sign, a Capricorn man doesn’t see the point of lying. He expects his partner to be truthful, and probably won’t ever forget about a lie. Show him you’re trustworthy and dependable from the beginning by being open about what’s on your mind and not hiding anything from him. Capricorn men are cautious and slow to trust. They’ll feel very betrayed if they find out you’ve withheld something from them or weren’t honest with them. They hate playing mind games and always prefer straightforward, direct communication.
