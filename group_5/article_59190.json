      "title": "Contact your lender.",
      "content": "Contact your lender. Removing a name from a joint mortgage is not a typical request, so it is best that you contact your lender in person or by telephone rather than by email. [1] X Research source Since your lender holds the mortgage to the home, the lender wants to be able to hold both borrowers responsible if payments are not made. Therefore, a lender may be reluctant to remove one borrower's name from the loan. While this process, commonly referred to as an assumption or a novation, is not common, some lenders do allow it with respect to certain types of mortgage loans. For instance, FHA and VA loans commonly have provisions that allow assumptions."

    {
      "title": "Provide your lender with your personal financial information.",
      "content": "Provide your lender with your personal financial information. This financial documentation must show that you have the ability to be responsible for the mortgage loan. For instance, you should provide your lender with your recent income tax returns, pay stubs, and bank statements. You have to prove to the bank that you have the money to make the mortgage payments every month on your own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your credit report.",
      "content": "Use your credit report. Your credit report is a good source of proof of your ability to make the mortgage payments. Your lender always considers a person’s credit history in evaluating his or her eligibility for a loan. Credit history also can affect other factors about your mortgage loan, such as the interest rate. This information will help the bank decide if you are eligible for a mortgage loan on your own.

      "title": "Provide your lender with your divorce decree, if applicable.",
      "content": "Provide your lender with your divorce decree, if applicable. People often want to remove the name of an ex-spouse from a joint mortgage loan, pursuant to their divorce decree. If this is the case, some lenders will require proof of a properly executed divorce decree in order to process the assumption."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure that your mortgage loan qualifies for an assumption.",
      "content": "Ensure that your mortgage loan qualifies for an assumption. While assumptions used to be more widespread, they are now are commonly limited to certain types of mortgage loans, including FHA loans, USDA loans, VA loans, and adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans that are still in their adjustable period. If your loan does not qualify for an assumption due to the nature of the loan, or there is no provision for assumption in the mortgage contract, you may not be eligible to remove a co-borrower's name from this process. [3] X Research source If your mortgage contract does not permit an assumption, there is nothing that you can do to change it. You signed the contract and are bound by its terms."

      "title": "Sign a mortgage novation or assumption with your lender.",
      "content": "Sign a mortgage novation or assumption with your lender. A novation or assumption simply substitutes one mortgage contract for another. The new contract removes the co-borrower from the mortgage loan altogether. You will sign the new mortgage contract. The co-borrower also normally must sign the appropriate documents in order to remove his or her name from the loan."

      "title": "Sign a new deed.",
      "content": "Sign a new deed. Once you have signed the new mortgage contract, there is another important step to take. You need to legally remove the co-borrower's name from the deed to the property. [4] X Research source By executing a quitclaim deed, you and the co-borrower can transfer the property to you alone. You may wish to contact an attorney so that your deed contains all of the required information. Depending on your state’s laws, you may need to take the new deed to various government offices for recording."

      "content": "Recruit a co-signer for your mortgage loan. If you don’t qualify for a mortgage loan on your own, you could find another person who qualifies for the loan and who is willing to co-sign it. Taking this step might convince the lender to allow you to take on the mortgage loan without your current co-borrower. Your co-signer should have a strong credit history and sufficient income to qualify for the loan. [5] X Research source"

If the lender agrees to it, this method will get the current co-borrower off the hook and allow you to take out another joint mortgage loan, except with a different person. It is important to remember, however, that circumstances may always change in the future. If you later want to remove the new co-signer from the joint mortgage loan, you will end up in the same situation that you are now. Likewise, if you fail to make the mortgage payments as agreed, your co-signer will be held responsible for the payments."

      "content": "Evaluate your financial situation. While this may be somewhat of an extreme option, filing for bankruptcy and receiving a bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code can remove your name from a mortgage loan. This may be a helpful option, for instance, if you have a lot of debt and are struggling financially. If all other alternatives fail and you are otherwise eligible for bankruptcy, you should be able to discharge your liability for the mortgage loan that you hold jointly with another person."

He or she can determine whether you are entitled to relief through the bankruptcy process. He or she also can advise you whether bankruptcy is likely to relieve you of the joint mortgage debt. This way, you can decide if bankruptcy is the best option for you."

If you are worried about your co-borrower's ability to assume total responsibility for the property, you should discuss the potential consequences of this option before filing for bankruptcy."

      "content": "Contact a realtor about selling the property. If neither you nor your co-borrower are interested in living in or otherwise utilizing the property, you may consider selling the property. Selling the property would solve the problem altogether. If you wish to remain living on the property, however, then selling it is clearly not an option."

      "content": "Determine the current value of the property. Your realtor can research the values of properties that are comparable to your property. These property values, as well as current market conditions, can give you a fairly good idea as to the value of the property. You also can pay to have an appraisal done on the property. However, appraisals can be expensive and are likely to give you roughly the same information as the realtor’s analysis."

If the estimated value of your property is equal to or more than the balance on your mortgage loan, you could sell it and pay off the mortgage loan. However, if you owe more than the property is worth, then you will not be able to pay off the mortgage loan. The only exception is if the mortgage lender agrees to a short sale, or a sale of the property for an amount that is less than what is owed on the mortgage loan."

Both you and your co-borrower will execute a deed within the course of the sale that transfers all ownership of the property to the buyer. The mortgage loan will be paid off. If you receive an offer that is less than the amount of the mortgage loan, however, you will need to contact your lender to see if they will agree to a short sale."
