[1] X Research source A “high-functioning” person with ASPD might have acceptable social skills or fit in well with others. [2] X Research source Someone with “high-functioning” ASPD may also be skilled at manipulating or charming other people, which can help “mask” their symptoms. [3] X Research source A person with “low-functioning” ASPD might not hide their behaviors and attitudes, which might make it more difficult for them to maintain relationships or hold down a job. The term “sociopath” tends to no longer be used in psychology because it has negative connotations. [4] X Research source ASPD is a rare condition—it’s estimated to affect only 0.6% to 3.6% of adults, and is 3 times more common among men than women. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "ASPD can be managed and treated through therapy. ASPD is one of the most difficult personality disorders to treat because most people with this condition don’t often seek treatment on their own. Some evidence shows that a person’s behavior might improve over time with therapy. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source However, other forms of treatment (like medications) are limited. If you think you might have high-functioning ASPD, psychotherapy or other forms of therapy might help you manage your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help people with ASPD change the way they think and behave. Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) might help people with ASPD think about how their thoughts affect their behavior. Research also suggests that democratic therapeutic community-led programs (DTCs) may improve aggression in people with personality disorders. [14] X Research source However, evidence that DTCs help people with ASPD is limited. [15] X Research source However, Dr. Georgoulis says that people with ASPD are generally “very resistant to treatment because you can't remove somebody's personality from who they are.”"
