Foods can stick to a non-stick pan if the pan isn't thoroughly coated in oil or butter. Without a layer of grease, the pan becomes dry, making it easier for food to stick. [22] X Research source How do you prevent this? Make sure the pan is coated in oil before and during cooking, keep an eye on the heat, and stir or move the food regularly. [23] X Research source"

Make clean-up that much simpler by choosing a pan that’s dishwasher-safe. This way, you can pop the pan in the dishwasher after cooking. If a pan is dishwasher-safe, it’ll be labeled as such on the packaging or cleaning instructions. Keep in mind that dishwasher detergents can be very abrasive to non-stick pans, even if they are dishwasher-safe, and may damage the non-stick surface. [30] X Research source"
