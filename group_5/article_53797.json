      "content": "You owe it to your girlfriend to let her down face-to-face. Plus, breaking up over the phone or via text could cause her to blow up on you even more, leading to more problems in the long-run. Try to meet up with her and have a chat together so that she doesn’t feel unnecessarily slighted. [1] X Research source If you two are long distance, try to wait until you meet up in-person. If you can’t wait, video chat is the next best option."

      "title": "Tell her why you’re breaking up, but do it in a constructive way.",
      "content": "Tell her why you’re breaking up, but do it in a constructive way. Sure, it might feel good in the moment to tell your girlfriend exactly why you’re dumping her, but it will only make it tougher for her to move on. Instead, be honest about why you want to do this, but phrase it in a kind, loving way. [2] X Research source Instead of, “You’re way too clingy, and I can’t handle it,” try something like, “I feel like our love languages are mismatched, and we might be happier with other people.” Instead of, “You texted me 20 times in an hour last week, which was way, way too much,” try, “I can’t dedicate as much time to this relationship as you deserve.” Reader Poll: We asked 1931 wikiHow readers why they want to break up with their partner, and only 9% of them said their partner cheated on them. [Take Poll] Remember, you shouldn’t wait for your partner to do something horrible to break up with them. You’re allowed to end the relationship if you no longer want to be in it, no matter your reason."

      "title": "Focus on how you feel to make it sound like a you problem.",
      "content": "Focus on how you feel to make it sound like a you problem. It can be hard for your girlfriend to hear about how clingy or needy she’s been in the relationship. Instead, use “I” statements to make it sound like you feel bad that you can’t match her energy. For instance: [3] X Research source “I don’t know if I can give you all the attention you deserve, and I feel bad about that.” “We have different communication styles, and I feel like we are mismatched.”"

      "content": "Don’t give your girlfriend any wiggle room. Unfortunately, you’re probably going to have to be very straightforward about this, and you can’t back down once you say it. Be prepared for your girlfriend to push back a little, but remain firm. Try something like: [4] X Research source “I think it would be best if we broke things off.” “I still care about you very much, but I don’t want to be in a relationship with you anymore.”"

      "title": "Tell her that she’s going to be happier with someone else, too.",
      "content": "Tell her that she’s going to be happier with someone else, too. If she’s clingy, she’s probably going to be much happier with someone who can match her energy. Try to express that to her, and let her know that you’ll both be better off in the long run. [5] X Research source “I know this hurts now, but I think we’ll both be happier with other people.” “I’m not the best partner for you anyway, and you deserve someone who is.” Remind her that this break-up is best for both of you, and will help you both get closer to the person who is actually right for you.

      "content": "Give your girlfriend a chance to speak so she feels heard. She might be upset, angry, or even defensive. Let her talk uninterrupted, and hear what she has to say. However, don’t back down from your desire to break up—if you do, you’ll only make things harder on yourself. [7] X Research source Remember, you only have to break up with her once. If you can push through it this time, you’ll never have to do this again."

Right now, it’s important to put your own feelings first. You’ll be much happier if you stick with your decision to break up, even if it feels hard to do right now. [8] X Research source If your girlfriend starts to yell or gets abusive toward you, you’re under no obligation to stick around."

      "content": "Moving out will give you a clean break so you can start moving on . If you two share a home, gather as much as you can and head to a friend or family member’s place. Make arrangements to take your name off the lease and utilities, too. Cut all your connections that lead back to your ex as soon as possible to avoid dragging the breakup out any longer. [9] X Research source If your names are both on the lease, talk to your landlord about taking yours off before you move out."

Hopefully, if she can’t contact you, she’ll stop trying to reach out. [10] X Research source You might also want to set your social media pages to private. That way, she can’t just make a new account and look at your page."

If it gets to be too much, consider blocking her number, at least for now. Don’t respond to any messages she sends, since that will just give her the chance to convince you to get back together with her. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "She may reach out to your pals to see how you’re doing. Gathering intel on you isn’t good for your ex’s psyche, and it’s not great for yours, either. After you two break up, warn your friends not to respond to any messages she sends, especially if she’s asking about you. [12] X Research source Tell your friends by saying something like, “Hey, so Kristie and I broke up. If she reaches out to you guys, will you just block her number? I don’t want her to harass you for information about me.”"
