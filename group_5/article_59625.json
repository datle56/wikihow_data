After the minute has passed and the TV is still unplugged, press and hold the Power button on your TV for another 30 seconds. This should be the physical button on the TV, not on the remote or your phone . After you've done those steps, plug the TV back in and turn it on. This may not work if you rushed through the steps to power cycle your TV."

Streaming services like Disney+ prevent their streaming content like movies and TV shows from being copied by displaying a black screen when there's another screen involved. In order to get around this, use alternatives to screen sharing from your laptop, computer, phone, or tablet to your TV. Instead, add Disney+ or similar streamers to your TV and watch your shows that way."

      "content": "Screens that aren't OLED-only have a backlight that can fail. These lights make it so everything on your screen is visible, so if they are out, the screen will be black but you'll still be able to hear what's on the TV. Check if these are the problem by shining a flashlight over the screen. If you see dimly-lit pictures that aren't from your flashlight, then you can easily isolate the issue to your backlights. If you can't tell if your flashlight is illuminating the TV, turn up the volume and see if the pictures on the screen move depending on the sounds you hear. You should only replace these LED strips if you're confident in your abilities to disassemble and reassemble your TV. Fixing anything yourself may void the warranty, so check that before you attempt to replace the LED strips or other hardware."

Other hardware, like the T-CON board, the power control board, or other major parts can be faulty. Most people shouldn't attempt to DIY this. If your TV is out of warranty, your best bet is to take it to a 3rd-party service center.
