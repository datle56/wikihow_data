[2] X Research source If you want to connect to a hidden network, press “Wi-Fi Settings” at the bottom of the list, then type in the name of the network. Wi-Fi networks need to have WPA, WPA2, or no security for the Tesla to be able to connect.

      "content": "Consider getting Tesla Premium Connectivity. Teslas have an optional connectivity package for $9.99 a month. It gives you a few extra features, like “Sentry Mode” (where you can remotely view cameras in your car) and live traffic updates, as well as 24/7 Wi-Fi. It basically turns your car into a smartphone. [6] X Research source Subscribe to Tesla Premium Connectivity by selecting your car in the Tesla app, then click “Upgrades” and “Software Upgrades.” Click “Subscribe” at the top of your screen, then “Add” next to Premium Connectivity. You’ll be taken to a checkout screen where you can put in your payment information. [7] X Research source Model Ys, Model 3 Standard Ranges, Standard Range Pluses, or Rear-Wheel Drives from before June 30th, 2018 aren’t eligible for Premium Connectivity. [8] X Research source While you can’t get the premium features, using a mobile hotspot will also allow you to have internet on the go."

      "content": "Poor connection If you’re getting a weak signal in your car, it may be because the router is too far away. The easiest way to fix this is by either physically moving the router or parking your car closer. [9] X Research source The Wi-Fi antenna is in the right side mirror, so get that part of your car as close as you can. You can also get a Wi-Fi extender to boost your router’s signal. If your connectivity doesn’t improve, you may need to replace your router . Get one that accepts 2.4GHz frequencies if you have a pre-2018 model X or S."

[11] X Research source It can sometimes take up to 4 minutes for Wi-Fi to reconnect after a reboot. Wi-Fi can also go out if your car is in reverse or drive.

Click on the Wi-Fi symbol then your network, and click “Forget.” Reconnect the network as you would normally. You may also need to change your UDP timeout.
