      "title": "Understand what contributes to a bounty.",
      "content": "Understand what contributes to a bounty. Committing a crime, no matter how small, in front of at least one person or domestic animal will add a bounty price to your head. If a guard in the hold in which you committed the crime(s) catches you, they will attempt to detain you, at which point you'll be prompted to give in, attempt to talk your way out of it, or resist arrest. Resisting arrest is inadvisable due to the sheer volume of guards which will attack you, leading to a high death count (and, by extension, a higher bounty)."

      "content": "Kill any witnesses if possible. If you've only just incurred a bounty, you may be able to kill any witnesses (including animals, bandits, and town folk) who witnessed the crime. If you've left the Hold in which you obtained the bounty, you can't kill the witnesses to prevent the bounty. Beware of causing too much of a scene. If you kill a human witness in front of another person, you can potentially create a snowball effect where your bounty increases as you rack up a body count."
