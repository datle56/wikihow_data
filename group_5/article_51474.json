The powerful active ingredients in salicylic acid and retinol are great for brightening your skin and reducing fine lines and acne. That makes them a holy grail combination, but they can dry out or irritate your skin when used together. To reduce potential irritation while reaping both of their benefits, dermatologists recommend using salicylic acid and retinol separately at different times on the same day.

These serums have drying and photo-sensitive side effects which a moisturizer and SPF help counteract. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use salicylic acid and retinol twice a week to start and build up to daily use. If one or both of these products are new to your skincare routine, start by using salicylic acid and retinol only once or twice a week. This gets your skin used to these serums and helps to mitigate any dryness or irritation. Then, slowly build up to using your serums every other day. [3] X Research source Before applying either serum to your face, do a patch test . Just dab on a small amount of each serum to the inside of your elbow and watch for any reactions like redness, itchiness, or swelling. It’s normal to experience slight dryness, redness, or irritation when starting to use either product. These symptoms typically go away as your skin gets acclimated to them. Skin purging is a common side effect when using either salicylic acid or retinol for the first time. You might have more acne breakouts for a couple weeks to a month before your skin gets better.

Just wash your face and let it dry before applying your cream, gel, or serum to any problem areas on your face. Then, apply your moisturizer and SPF and you’re ready to head out the door. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source To prevent any drying and irritation, most doctors recommend applying salicylic acid only to the areas you want to treat, rather than all over your face. Opt for a salicylic face wash if you don’t want to use a gel, cream, or serum. Like with a serum or gel, don’t pair it with retinol. Use the salicylic acid cleanser in the morning and wash your face with a gentle cleanser in the evening. If you don’t want to apply salicylic acid in the morning, use it on one night and retinol on the next, alternating between them. If you find that your skin gets sensitive from using salicylic acid and retinol every other night, give yourself a rest day on the 3rd day where you use neither serum. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Retinol is a form of Vitamin A that promotes faster cell turnover. Your skin naturally replaces old skin cells with new, fresh ones. When you apply retinol, the cycling process happens faster and more new cells are produced. This in turn increases your skin’s collagen production, which is responsible for keeping your skin plump, elastic, and smooth. Over-the-counter retinols are typically found in concentrations ranging from 0.05% to 1% at the highest. [14] X Research source There are a lot of over-the-counter retinols, so it can be overwhelming to choose one . Look for reputable brands and select a product that has retinol as an active ingredient. Because retinol can be pretty drying and irritating, start with a product that has a low concentration. Retinoids are a stronger form of retinol that are only available in prescription products like tretinoin and tazarotene. They have a higher concentration of active ingredients than retinols.

      "content": "Retinol reduces fine lines, acne scars, and unclogs pores. One of the reasons that retinol is such a juggernaut in the skincare business is because it can reduce the look of wrinkles and fine lines. Its ability to stimulate collagen production adds fullness and firmness back to your face. Retinol also encourages new skin cells to form, which reduces the look of acne scars, sun spots, and other areas of pigmentation. It’s also a great exfoliant that clears your pores to treat and prevent acne. Retinol is also great for smoothing skin texture and evening your skin tone. This gives your complexion a healthier, brighter appearance."
