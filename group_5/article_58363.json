      "content": "Round up four players. Kent is a game that can be played with multiple players. It is also played in pairs. Typically, there are four players (two teams), but you can play the game with up to 12 players (six teams). [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use one deck of regular playing cards.",
      "content": "Use one deck of regular playing cards. If you are playing with four to eight players, use one deck of cards. If there are more than eight players, then use two decks. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide into teams.",
      "content": "Divide into teams. You can either pick teams randomly by drawing cards, or you can have the players choose who they want to team up with. To pick teams at random, have four players draw a card from the deck at a time. The players who draw the same colored card (either black or red) will be on the same team. [3] X Research source Repeat this until everyone has a team."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather with your teammate in a private area.",
      "content": "Gather with your teammate in a private area. Once everyone is in a team, each team will need to come up with a secret signal privately. Go in another room, retreat to a corner, go outside, or go behind a large object to discuss your team's signal. Just make sure the other teams do not hear you and your partner. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Come up with a secret signal.",
      "content": "Come up with a secret signal. The signal is used to indicate when one of the team members has four of a kind. The signal can be a gesture, body movement, or hand signal. However, verbal signals are not allowed. [5] X Research source Fanning your cards out wider than usual, holding your cards in your left or right hand, looking at your watch, adjusting your glasses, winking three times, or laying your cards face down are all examples of signals that you and your teammate can use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use multiple signals.",
      "content": "Use multiple signals. You and your teammate are allowed to have multiple signals. You can even have fake signals to confuse the other teams. However, you cannot have signals that indicate the status of your cards if you do not have four of a kind. This is considered “table talk” and it is cheating. [6] X Research source This is an optional strategy, but it is a great way to throw the other teams off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sit across from your teammate.",
      "content": "Sit across from your teammate. Once the teams come back together after discussing their signals, have everyone sit in a circle. Teammates need to sit across from each other. They are not allowed to sit next to each other. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a dealer.",
      "content": "Pick a dealer. You can either pick a dealer at random, or have someone volunteer. To pick a dealer at random, have everyone draw a card from the deck. Have the person who draws the highest (or lowest) card be the dealer. [8] X Research source If there is a tie between two players, then have them pick another card from the deck. The person with the highest (or lowest) card wins."

    {
      "title": "Discard one or more cards.",
      "content": "Discard one or more cards. Since you cannot have more than four cards in your hand at one time, you need to discard as soon as you grab a card from the board. If you happen to grab two cards, then you need to discard two cards. [15] X Research source This continues until no one wants any cards from the board."

The dealer selects four more cards from the top of the deck and places them face down again to make a new board. They countdown and flip the cards over again.

[19] X Research source If your teammate does not have four of a kind, then your team loses and does not get a letter.
