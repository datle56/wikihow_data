You can also check for a padlock icon displayed somewhere in your web browser. This indicates that the website has an SSL certificate and that the connection is encrypted. Make sure all websites you visit and download from are secure. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Be careful what you click on. Don't click links or download attachments that were sent to you by people you don't know and trust. Before clicking a link, hover over it and check the URL. Make sure it goes to the website it says it goes to. Also, check the spelling of the link to make sure it's not a spoof link designed to look official. If you receive a message claiming to be from an official institution, such as a bank, asking you to click a link and sign in, don't follow the link. Sign in on their official website or contact the company directly. If a link has a file that contains a \".exe\" extension at the end of it, do not click on it. Scan all files with an antivirus scanner before opening them."

      "content": "Some free software may contain malicious code. Avoid downloading free software from sources that you don't know and trust. Especially if the software isn't normally free or seems too good to be true. Free software downloads may intentionally or unintentionally contain malicious code. Scan any files and programs you download with an antivirus scanner before opening them. Check ratings and reviews for any program you download it. Lots of negative reviews could be an indication of malware or malicious code. Make sure you read the install prompts during the installation process of any software you install. [3] X Research source If you have to download free software, read the terms and conditions carefully. Try to stick with open-source software that has its source code publically available so that it can be scanned by malicious code by experts."

      "content": "Change your passwords once every few months. Also, make sure you are using strong passwords as well as using a different password for each account. This will go a long way to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. You can manage your passwords using a password manager. If you suspect your device is infected with malicious code, change your passwords immediately. Cybersecurity expert and computer repair specialist Michael Thompson-Brown says \"People use, and reuse the same username and password combination over and over again. They use it for four different things, which is extremely risky. For example, if you use that same password/username at some little site, and they get hacked, [the hacker now has] that pairing. If you've used that same username/password combination for your email, you're in a lot of trouble.\" Michael Thompson-Brown goes on to say \"Use a password manager you know, and use better passwords. A better password is a longer password, not necessarily more complex. Adding numbers and symbols doesn't necessarily help. The total number of characters is the most important thing.\""
