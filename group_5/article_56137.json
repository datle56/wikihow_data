      "content": "The original torque converter can be removed by positioning yourself in front of the bellhousing. Hold on to the converter by its sides, primarily at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Gently pull it back towards you and slowly rotate in a rocking motion by moving your hands up and down a few inches as if you were turning a steering wheel."

      "content": "Whether the torque converter you are using is new or used, it is always best to fill it with at least a quart of new fluid before installing. Place the torque converter face down on a flat surface so that the input splines are facing up. The fluid will go in very slowly. Pour in as much as you can without the fluid running over. Once the fluid drains down, pour in more and repeat the process until you have at least a quart in the torque converter."

      "content": "The torque converter will slide onto the input shaft three times, each time seating further into the bellhousing followed by a \"clunk.\" [1] X Research source First, hold the torque converter horizontally and face down (bolt holes facing towards the ground) so that the fluid will not drain back out. When ready to insert on the input shaft, turn the converter vertically with the bolt holes facing towards you. Hold the torque converter by its sides at 3 and 9 o'clock and slide onto the input shaft while slowly rotating it back and forth, as in Step 2, until you hear the first “clunk.” Continue to gently push on the torque converter and slowly rotate it back and forth. After a few seconds of this, it will slide back further and you will hear a second “clunk.” The torque converter is not properly seated yet and this is where the mistake of improperly installing it happens. Continue gently pushing on the torque converter while slowly rotating it until you hear a third and final “clunk.” It is now properly seated. If you continue to push and rotate, you will hear a scraping noise coming from behind the torque converter. This is normal and one way to tell it is installed properly."
