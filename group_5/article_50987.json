The simplest method to make one of these is to drill 2 crossing holes through a piece of wood. By cutting the wood at 90 degrees through the centers of the holes, you will end up with 2 pieces of wood with crossing grooves. You could make the grooves by hand if you're confident in your abilities of cutting precise grooves. A third option would be to use some sort of saw to make the grooves. For example a bandsaw or table saw."

The rod is secured between 2 hardwood blocks with grooves according cut in them according to the grooves. The diameter of the rod dictates the diameter of the spiral. An alternative method would be to use a threaded rod with a slit and some nuts. The nuts would be turned onto the rod and fastened in the vice. The rod could be turned by turning 2 nuts onto the rod and tightening them against each other, after that the rod could be turned with vice grips, pliers or with a suitable wrench. A lathe with a metal or wood cylinder in it could also be used in place of the rod. The wire could be wound onto the cylinder by turning the lathe by hand or at very low RPM. Optionally, the wire could be guided through a stack of 2 pieces of wood to straighten the wire."
