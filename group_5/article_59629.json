      "content": "Check and clean the pump filter. If your Samsung washer has an accessible pump filter , you can find it on the front of your washing machine. It looks like a small, rectangular door near the bottom of your washer's front. Press on the cover to open the filter, then locate the rubber hose inside of the opening to empty the pump filter. Remove the cap from this hose and drain the water into a container big enough to hold it all. Remove the pump filter with a counter-clockwise motion, and clean it with a toothbrush or other soft-bristled brush before reinserting it into your washer. Reattach the washer's drain hose before attempting to use your washer again."

Start by removing all the clothes from your washer and double-checking for small items. Press and hold the Temp. and Delay End buttons simultaneously for three seconds until \"Cb\" appears on the display. You may need to complete this step while the washer is on, or start with the washer off and then press the Power button while still holding down Temp. and Delay End (depending on your model). Press Start/Pause to begin calibration. Your tub will rotate back and forth for one to three minutes while calibrating. Once the calibration is complete, the washer will turn off and is now ready for use. [2] X Research source"
