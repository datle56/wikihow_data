      "content": "You’ll need 1 oz (28 g) of cannabis for every 2 cups (470 mL) of alcohol. Most jars come in either 16 fl oz (470 mL) or 32 fl oz (950 mL), which is 2 to 4 c (470 to 950 mL). Grind your cannabis in an herb grinder until it’s in a fine powder. If you’ve ground cannabis to smoke before, it should look exactly the same. [1] X Research source You can use any strain or type of marijuana that you’d like to! A THC marijuana tincture will make you feel a traditional body and head high, like when you smoke marijuana. A CBD marijuana tincture typically doesn’t contain THC, so it won’t get you high, but it can help with relaxation or pain management. Try not to use any sort of electrical grinder, like a blender or coffee grinder. Electric grinders can pulverize your marijuana, resulting in a bad tasting tincture."

      "content": "This will dehydrate your marijuana and release its essential oils. Preheat your oven, then slide the baking tray in and set a timer for 1 hour. When the timer beeps, take the tray out and let your marijuana cool down as you ready your other ingredients. [3] X Research source Use a thermometer to check the exact temperature of your oven before you start. Temperatures over 250 °F (121 °C) will dry out your marijuana too much, leading to a bad taste."

      "content": "For every ounce of marijuana you use, add 2 cups (470 mL) of alcohol. Grab a jar that has a tight-fitting lid so you can store your tincture for a few weeks. Most marijuana tinctures use food-grade ethanol, since it’s extremely high-proof. Add your alcohol to the jar, leaving a little bit of room at the top for the marijuana, then set it aside. Only pure, unaltered ethanol is considered food-grade alcohol. You might also see it called food grade ethanol, non-denatured alcohol, grain alcohol, 190 proof grain, food grade EtOH, or Anhydrous Ethanol."

      "title": "Dump the dried marijuana into the jar.",
      "content": "Dump the dried marijuana into the jar. Put the lid on tightly, then give it a quick shake. Store your tincture in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks so the alcohol can absorb the oil from the marijuana. The longer you leave your tincture to soak, the better—more time means the alcohol will absorb more of the marijuana. [4] X Research source A kitchen pantry or cabinet is the perfect spot to store a tincture."

      "title": "Agitate the marijuana to help the alcohol soak it up.",
      "content": "Agitate the marijuana to help the alcohol soak it up. Every day, grab your tincture and shake it a few times to speed up the process. If you forget for a day, that’s okay—just do it as soon as you remember! The more you shake it up, the more chance the alcohol will have to absorb the marijuana. [5] X Research source Some people even recommend shaking it 2 to 3 times per day. If you have time, it wouldn’t hurt to shake it more than once."

      "title": "Grab a bowl to capture the liquid tincture in.",
      "content": "Grab a bowl to capture the liquid tincture in. Have one person hold the filter, then slowly pour your tincture over it, going slowly so you don’t spill. Keep pouring until you’ve filtered out all the marijuana and you’re just left with liquid. You can throw away the marijuana, as it doesn’t have any oil left in it anymore."

      "title": "Transfer your tincture to a sealed bottle to store it.",
      "content": "Transfer your tincture to a sealed bottle to store it. Most people use a small bottle with an eye dropper attachment for convenience, but you can put it into any sealed container that you have available. Tinctures don’t need to be refrigerated, so you can keep yours in a kitchen cabinet or pantry. If you store your tincture properly, it will practically last forever. Since it’s mostly alcohol, there’s no real reason it would go bad or expire."

      "title": "When it comes to dosage recommendations, less is more.",
      "content": "When it comes to dosage recommendations, less is more. If you’re new to marijuana or you’ve never taken a tincture before, start with a little bit, and don’t go overboard. Keep track of how much you’re taking at one time, and slowly increase your dosage by 1 mL until you find the right amount for you. If you are using an eye dropper, 1 drop is roughly equal to 0.05 mL. You’ll need about 20 drops to get to 1 mL of tincture. Keep in mind that THC tincture will get you high just like if you smoked or ate an edible. On the other hand, CBD tincture will not get you “high” in the typical sense, but it will make you feel more relaxed."

      "content": "This is the fastest way to get marijuana in your bloodstream. Place the dropper directly under your tongue and hold it there for a few seconds to allow it into your bloodstream. You should feel the effects of the marijuana in only a couple of minutes. This is a great method to use if you’re using marijuana for pain relief. The faster it can get into your bloodstream, the faster your pain will go away."

      "title": "Some people prefer to ingest their tinctures in food or drinks.",
      "content": "Some people prefer to ingest their tinctures in food or drinks. Since tinctures are almost tasteless, you can add them to almost anything, including coffee, tea, and pasta sauce. Then, consume your food or drink to ingest the marijuana. You’ll start to feel the effects after 10 to 15 minutes, since marijuana enters your bloodstream slower through your stomach. [6] X Research source Some experts warn that taking marijuana tincture with food will cause you to absorb more cannabinoids, which can lead to a more intense high. Start slow, and work your way up to a comfortable dose rather than going overboard."
