Work the rag down into the scratch, wiping it in small circles and applying pressure, to make sure it’s clean. [2] X Research source Cleaning any dirt or grease off of the countertop is important because the wax or filler won't bond well to the counter if it isn't clean."

      "content": "Use a disinfectant if the countertop is especially dirty. If your countertop hasn’t been cleaned recently or shows spots of dirt, spray it with a household disinfecting spray and wipe the entire counter with a clean rag. Wipe down the spot with the scratch a couple times to make sure the crevice is definitely clean. [3] X Research source Avoid using harsh cleaning products that have acid in them on your laminate, as well as abrasive cleaning tools like steel wool."

      "content": "Dip a soft, cotton cloth in furniture wax. Cover your fingers with the cotton cloth and swipe it across the wax to get a small amount on the tip of your cloth-covered fingers. Gather enough wax to cover the entire end of the cloth that's on top of your fingers. [6] X Research source A cotton T-shirt works as well. You can also use car wax instead of furniture wax."

Rub the cloth over the scratch using circular motions and applying slight pressure. Apply another layer of wax to the scratch, if needed.

      "content": "Use circular motions to apply a light layer of wax to the rest of the counter. The wax will have a slight sheen to it, making it important to apply a thin layer to the rest of the laminate so it all looks cohesive. Dip your cloth in the wax again and gently rub it onto the countertop using circular motions until the entire counter is covered in a thin layer. [8] X Research source The layer of wax will also help protect the laminate from additional scratches."

      "content": "Buff the laminate after waiting a couple minutes for the wax to set. After you’ve let the wax sit for a few minutes, use a different clean cotton cloth to remove excess wax and buff the surface. Use even, circular motions going along the entire countertop, applying slight pressure to ensure the laminate has a level coating. [9] X Research source Read the instructions on your container of wax to see if the countertop needs to sit for additional time before you place things on it. Wait roughly 20 minutes for the wax to dry and set on the countertop. The purpose of buffing the countertop after you've applied the wax is to cover the countertop with a very thin layer of wax while the scratch is filled in with a thicker layer of wax."
