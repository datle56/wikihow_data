      "title": "Ask your child what they know about God and Jesus.",
      "content": "Ask your child what they know about God and Jesus. Even toddlers may already have an idea of who God and Jesus are. You might say something like, “What do you know about God?” or “Tell me about Jesus.” Listen closely to your child’s response to discover how they’re understanding Christ. For example, many children know of Jesus as the baby in the manager at Christmas, but may not understand that Christmas is Jesus’ birthday. While participating in festive activities, talk about Jesus to teach your child the reason for the season. When your child asks you questions, answer them honestly and ask a question in return. This will help them put faith in their own words. For instance, if your child asks, “Where does God live?” you might reply with something like, “God lives in heaven up in the sky, so He can watch over you every day. What do you think God does in heaven?” [9] X Research source Invite your child to ask you questions too. Creating an environment where they can question things and have meaningful conversations will strengthen their faith. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Tailor the language you use to be kid friendly. Connect what you’re saying with things the child does, cares about, and knows. Rather than going into lengthy religious explanations, keep your language and terminology simple yet engaging. This doesn’t mean you need to lie to your child but talk with words they understand in an upbeat, joyful tone. In other words, tell stories of Christ in the language you use with them every day. For instance, share the story of Adam and Eve in stages with a friendly attitude: [11] X Research source Stage 1: “God created the heavens and earth. He made a beautiful garden called the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve to live there. They could do whatever they wanted except eat the fruit from a forbidden tree.” Stage 2: “One day, Eve was tempted by an evil snake. The snake tricked Eve into eating the fruit and disobeying God. The fruit was delicious—the best thing Eve had ever tasted! So, she ran to Adam and asked him to eat the fruit too.” Stage 3: “Adam and Eve felt guilty because they broke God’s only rule. As a punishment, God asked them to leave the garden and never return.” Stage 4: “God has given you the power to know what’s right and wrong, just like Adam and Eve, but you must obey His rules.”"

[13] X Research source Ask your child what they’ve heard about God and Jesus. Keep your language simple when discussing religion with them. Explain to your child that there are many religions and depictions of God. Express the importance to respect other beliefs even if they don’t believe them.
