      "content": "Some bonsai trees are poisonous, but others are not. Since bonsai is a style of growing smaller versions of a plant, there are many potential species a tree could be. A wide variety of bonsai plants have developed toxic sap, leaves, or berries to protect themselves from animals. These dangerous plants can all potentially be lethal depending on how much your cat ingests, but there are still some non-toxic species you’re able to grow that are safe for your feline friend to chew on. Avoid toxic bonsai trees altogether since you can never guarantee that your cat won’t chew on them. If you suspect your cat has been eaten parts of a bonsai tree, look for any torn leaves, broken branches, or teeth marks on the trunk. Common signs of poisoning are sluggishness, unsteadiness, heavy breathing, drooling, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures. Contact your vet immediately if you notice your cat has any of these symptoms. [1] X Research source Take note of the name of the plant your cat bit or take a photo. If you can, quickly determine how much your cat consumed before leaving for the vet (all of this information will help with their vet care)."
