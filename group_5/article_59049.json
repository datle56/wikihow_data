      "title": "Open the cold tap on your sink or bathtub.",
      "content": "Open the cold tap on your sink or bathtub. If you can, try to wash your undies out with cold water as soon as you see that they’re stained with blood. Turn on the water so it’s running at a steady stream. You want the flow to be strong enough to break up the stain, but not so high that it’s blasting, since you don’t want to splash water everywhere. [1] X Research source Use the coldest water you can get from your tap. Hot water can cause the blood to set into the fabric."

    {
      "title": "Hold the crotch of your underwear under the cold water.",
      "content": "Hold the crotch of your underwear under the cold water. Turn the underwear so the stained crotch is facing upward, then place it so the stream of cold water hits directly on the stain. Rinse away as much of the blood as you can. If you like, you can use your fingers or a cloth to gently blot away the stain as you rinse. [2] X Research source You may be surprised how much of the stain disappears with just a little water!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a drop of soap and work it into the fabric.",
      "content": "Add a drop of soap and work it into the fabric. Water is unlikely to remove the stain entirely, so for even more cleaning power, drop a little mild soap onto the stain. Work the soap into a lather directly on the fabric, making sure to cover the entire stain. [3] X Research source You can use whatever soap you have on hand—hand soap, liquid laundry detergent, or a solid laundry bar are all good options. Try rubbing your garment gently for at least 30 seconds. [4] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the underwear completely.",
      "content": "Rinse the underwear completely. After you’ve covered the stain with soap, rinse away the suds with more cold water. Keep rinsing until the water runs completely clear and there are no more soapy bubbles on the fabric. Then, examine the underwear to see if the stain is gone. [5] X Research source If the stain is still present, wash the underwear with soap and water one more time. If the blood isn't completely gone after that, you may need to try a different approach."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the underwear in a towel to remove any excess water.",
      "content": "Wrap the underwear in a towel to remove any excess water. Take the underwear out of the water and gently squeeze the fabric so the excess water drips out. Then, place your underwear on a thick towel and roll the towel up tightly. Pat and squeeze the towel for 2-3 minutes to get as much of the water out of the underwear as possible. Don't wring the underwear out, as this might stretch them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang the underwear",
      "content": "Hang the underwear to dry. If you have a clothesline, use clothespins to clip the underwear up to dry. However, even if you don’t have a designated place to air-dry clothes, you can still hang your underwear to dry. Drape them over your shower rod, towel rack, or even a doorknob, for instance. Just make sure you leave them somewhere with good ventilation so they’ll dry thoroughly. For instance, if you hang the underwear to dry in your bathroom, leave the door open so air can circulate. If you want to dry your underwear quickly, try hanging them in front of a fan. Avoid putting the underwear in the dryer unless you're sure the stain is totally gone. The heat will cause the blood to set into the fabric, and it will be much more difficult to remove. In addition, it’s best to air dry underwear because the heat from the dryer can damage the elastic."

      "title": "Fill a small bowl with hydrogen peroxide.",
      "content": "Fill a small bowl with hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a common household antiseptic, but it’s also very effective as a stain remover. If you have white or very light-colored underwear that have a bloodstain, pour about 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of hydrogen peroxide into a small bowl. That way, you’ll be able to use as much as you need, but you won’t have to worry about getting blood on or in the peroxide container. [6] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide will bleach your fabric, so do not use it on dark or brightly-colored underwear. This is most effective on fresh stains, but may be effective on set-in stains as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip the corner of a cloth or sponge in the bowl.",
      "content": "Dip the corner of a cloth or sponge in the bowl. Take a washcloth, sponge, or even a stack of paper towels, and dip the corner in the hydrogen peroxide bowl. By doing this, the peroxide will be concentrated in one area on the cloth, so you will be able to apply it to the stain more precisely. Make sure the cloth or sponge you use is something that’s okay to get stained, since it may absorb some of the blood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dab the stain from the outside in.",
      "content": "Dab the stain from the outside in. Press the saturated end of the cloth directly onto the blood stain. Blot the stain with the cloth, working from the outside edges in toward the center. Add more hydrogen peroxide to the cloth as you need it—you want to soak the stain completely. You can even add more to the bowl if you need to. [7] X Research source Move to a clean section of the cloth whenever the blood transfers to the section you’re using."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with cold water and repeat until the stain is gone.",
      "content": "Rinse with cold water and repeat until the stain is gone. After you’ve blotted away most of the stain, rinse your underwear out thoroughly under cold running water, then examine the fabric. If there are any areas that are still stained, continue blotting them until all of the blood is gone. [8] X Research source If the stain was older and set-in, there may be some light staining that doesn’t come up. In that case, try an enzymatic cleaner to try to remove the last of the blood. Once the stain is gone, air-dry your underwear or place them in the dryer."

      "title": "Mix salt with just a little cold water to create a scrub.",
      "content": "Mix salt with just a little cold water to create a scrub. The exact amount of salt you’ll need will depend on the size and severity of the stain, but about 1/4 cup (75 g) is a good starting point. Add about 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of cold water, or just enough for the salt to clump together, and stir it together. [9] X Research source Since the salt won’t discolor your underwear, this approach is good for dark or brightly-colored fabrics. A salt scrub will be most effective if the blood is fresh, but it can also be helpful for set-in stains. You can mix the scrub in a bowl, or you could just pour the salt onto your underwear and add water."

    {
      "title": "Coat the stain with the salt mixture.",
      "content": "Coat the stain with the salt mixture. Spread the salt scrub generously over the stain on your underwear. The salt will help draw the blood out of the fabric, so try to cover the entire stain. If the stain is set in, try letting the salt sit on the fabric for about 5 minutes before you scrub the underwear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub the stain with a cloth, an old toothbrush, or your fingers.",
      "content": "Scrub the stain with a cloth, an old toothbrush, or your fingers. Once the stain is thoroughly coated, rub the salt into the stain to help break it up. Try to work in a methodical direction, like from one end of the stain to the other or from the outside in. That way, you won’t miss any areas as you’re cleaning. For instance, you might work from the top of the stain to the bottom, from the left to the right, or all the around the perimeter toward the inside of the stain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse away the salt with cool water when you’re finished.",
      "content": "Rinse away the salt with cool water when you’re finished. After you’ve removed as much of the stain as you can, hold the underwear under cool running water. Use your fingers to rub away any salt that’s left, then examine the underwear to see if the stain is gone. [10] X Research source Hot water will cause any remaining blood to set deeply into the fabric, where it will be difficult or impossible to remove. If the stain is gone, hang your underwear up to dry or put them in the dryer. If the stain is still there, try using a different approach to clean them."

    {
      "title": "Spray the stain with an enzyme cleaner to remove stubborn set-in stains.",
      "content": "Spray the stain with an enzyme cleaner to remove stubborn set-in stains. If you don’t clean the stain right away or you wash it in hot water, blood can absorb deep into a fabric’s fibers, creating a set-in stain that’s difficult to get out. If that happens, try spraying the underwear with an enzymatic cleaner, which is designed to break down the enzymes in biological stains, like blood. Let it sit according to the label’s directions, then wash your underwear in cold water. [11] X Research source You can typically find enzymatic cleaners at major retailers that sell cleaning supplies, but if there isn’t one available near you, you can order them online. Oxygenated bleach may also help remove set-in stains. If you don’t have these products available, you might be able to remove the stain with items you already have at home, like baking soda, lemons, or meat tenderizer."

    {
      "title": "Coat stains in a paste made from baking soda for gentle cleaning.",
      "content": "Coat stains in a paste made from baking soda for gentle cleaning. Mix about 1/4 cup (45 g) of baking soda with 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of water at a time until it forms a thick paste. Then, spread that paste over the crotch of your underwear so it completely covers the stain. Leave the baking soda in place for at least 30 minutes, but for the best results, let it sit overnight. Afterward, wash and dry your underwear as usual. [12] X Research source You can also make a paste from unseasoned meat tenderizer or crushed aspirin or ibuprofen tablets."

    {
      "title": "Bleach light underwear with lemon juice.",
      "content": "Bleach light underwear with lemon juice. Cut a lemon in half, then rub the cut side of the lemon over the bloodstain on your underwear. Continue doing this for about 3-5 minutes or until you see that the stain is gone, then wash your underwear in cool or cold water and hang them to dry. [13] X Research source Do not use this on brightly-colored or dark underwear, as the lemon juice will stain them."
