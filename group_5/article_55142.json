As of 2022, the US government requires all new truck drivers to finish Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) before testing for and receiving their CDL. This training needs to be completed with a certified training organization—in other words, you need to attend a special CDL school.

Like a regular learner’s permit, you’ll need to pass a factual test to get your Commercial Learner’s Permit (CLP) at your local DMV. Unlike a regular learner’s permit, however, you’ll need to receive a physical from the DOT (Department of Transportation), get a DOT medical card, and get your driving history thoroughly inspected. Some states may require extra paperwork before they issue you your CLP. [2] X Research source You don’t need to attend a special school to get your CLP."

Important note: You need to have your CLP for at least 2 weeks before you can take the skills test."
