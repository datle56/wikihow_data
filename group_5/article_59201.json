Before making any further attempts to remove your shower head, evaluate the fixture to determine why it is stuck: Search for signs of rust—is there an orange or copper colored ring around the shower head’s connection to the shower arm? Search for signs of mineral build-up—is there a white ring around the shower head’s attachment to the shower arm?
