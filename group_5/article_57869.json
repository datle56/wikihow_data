[1] X Research source These matrices can be multiplied because the first matrix, Matrix A, has 3 columns, while the second matrix, Matrix B, has 3 rows."

The matrix that represents the product of Matrix A and Matrix B will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. You can draw blank boxes to indicate the number of rows and columns in this matrix. [2] X Research source Matrix A has 2 rows, so the matrix product will have 2 rows. Matrix B has 2 columns, so the matrix product will have 2 columns. The matrix product will have 2 rows and 2 columns."

      "content": "Find the first dot product. To find a dot product, you need to multiply the first element in the first row by the first element of the first column, the second element of the first row by the second element of the first column, and the third element in the first row by the third element in the first column. Then, add their products to find the dot product. [3] X Research source Let's say you've decided to solve for the element in the 2 nd row and 2 nd column (bottom right) of the matrix product first. Here's how you do it: [4] X Research source 6 x -5 = -30 1 x 0 = 0 -2 x 2 = -4 -30 + 0 + (-4) = -34 The dot product is -34 and it belongs on the bottom right of the matrix product. When you multiply matrices, the dot product will go in the position of the row of the first Matrix and the column of the second matrix. [5] X Research source For example, when you found the dot product of the bottom row of Matrix A and the right column of Matrix B, the answer, -34, went in the bottom row and right column of the matrix product."

To find this term, you simply have to multiply the elements on the bottom row of the first matrix with the elements in the first column of the second matrix and then add them up. Use the same method you used to multiply the first row and column -- find the dot product again. [6] X Research source 6 x 4 = 24 1 x (-3) = -3 (-2) x 1 = -2 24 + (-3) + (-2) = 19 The dot product is -19 and it belongs on the bottom left of the matrix product."

To find the term on the top left of the matrix product, start by finding the dot product of the top row of Matrix A and the left column of Matrix B. [7] X Research source Here's how you do it: 2 x 4 = 8 3 x (-3) = -9 (-1) x 1 = -1 8 + (-9) + (-1) = -2 The dot product is -2 and it belongs on the top left of the matrix product. To find the term on the top right of the matrix product, just find the dot product of the top row of Matrix A and the right column of Matrix B. Here's how you do it: 2 x (-5) = -10 3 x 0 = 0 (-1) x 2 = -2 -10 + 0 + (-2) = -12 The dot product is -12 and it belongs on the top right of the matrix product."
