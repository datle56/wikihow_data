      "content": "Select a mountain bike front disc brakes and wide handlebars. If you don't own a bike already, search online or in your local area to find a second-hand bike at a good price. Luckily, you can use just about any bike you have on hand, though certain features will yield the best results: [1] X Research source Choose a bike with wheels that are 26\", 20\", or 16\" as these are the most common off-the-shelf wheel sizes. The smaller the wheels are usually found on folding bikes and will accelerate more quickly, be bumpier, and be less efficient at cruising speed. Mountain bikes are most commonly converted to electric bikes, though you could use a different type as long as it has a strong frame and standard bottom bracket. Don’t use a bike with a carbon fiber frame or forks, as these aren’t strong enough to support the extra weight or handle the extra torque. [2] X Research source Wider handlebars are best as they give you plenty of room for all your accessories and lights. Front disc brakes will make it easier for you to stop on steep hills."

      "title": "Pick up an electric bicycle conversion kit.",
      "content": "Pick up an electric bicycle conversion kit. If you’ve never built an electric bicycle before, a conversion kit will make the process much simpler. These bolt-on kits contain a throttle, speed controller, and a wheel with a hub motor. Some also come with gauges, displays, and brake levers, though these are not strictly necessary. [3] X Research source Ensure the kit comes with a wheel that is the same size as the existing wheels on your bike! It’s much easier to replace the front wheel than the back, due to the position of the gears, so opt for a kit in which the hub motor is on the front wheel. In most cases, the battery doesn’t come with the conversion kit. For ease of installation, though, it’s best to purchase the battery and the conversion kit from the same manufacturer."

      "content": "Choose a 36- or 48-volt battery with a capacity of 10Ah or 20Ah. Choose a battery designed for use on an electric bicycle, as it will come with a charger and be much easier to install. Make sure the voltage and capacity of the battery you choose are compatible with the conversion kit you purchased. The higher the voltage of your bike's battery, the more powerful your bike will be. When building an electric bike, choose a 36- or 48-volt battery to allow for speed and comfort. [4] X Research source The capacity of the battery defines how long it'll last. If you’ll be taking short trips, a 10Ah will suit you well, while a 20Ah battery will provide you with extra capacity for slightly longer journeys. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the wheel you need to replace. Begin by opening the rim or cantilever brake using the lever (if applicable). If the bike has disc brakes, remove the retaining or cotter pin or the clips or springs that hold the pads in place. Pull the pads out with needle-nose pliers and set them aside. [6] X Research source To remove the front wheel, turn the bike over so it’s sitting on the seat and handlebars, then flip the quick-release lever over to the “open” position. Then, simply lift the front wheel off of the bike. [7] X Research source To remove the back wheel, crouch behind the bike. Hold the frame with your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to pull the derailer backward. Then lift the bike frame up and off of the rear wheel with your non-dominant hand and unhook the chain with your dominant hand. [8] X Research source"

Be sure to adjust the chain so it fits properly if you’re replacing the back wheel. If the bike has rim or cantilever brakes, simply close them over the new wheel using the lever. If the bike has disc brakes, put the pads back in place and secure them using the clips, springs, or cotter or retaining pin. [10] X Research source Adjust the brakes as needed, either by aligning the calipers (for mechanical brakes) or pumping the brake lever (for hydraulic brakes)."

Use the provided bolts to secure the speed controller to the frame of the bike above the chain. Then, attach the throttle to the handlebars so it’s easy to reach. [11] X Research source If you have any other accessories, attach them as well. Secure the speed sensor to the back wheel and connect any displays and gauges to the handlebars with the included hardware. [12] X Research source"

This is the ideal placement since it keeps the center of gravity low. Use the included hardware to attach the battery to the frame as indicated by the instructions that came with the battery. [14] X Research source Alternatively, you could place the battery in a box or basket on the front or back of the bike, particularly if it is too large to fit well on the frame (such as if it’s more than 60 volts)."
