Then, ask questions about what they said to get more information and show that you're interested.

If your partner says no, stop doing anything physical immediately. Being in a relationship with them doesn't give you a right to their body. In fact, Richer notes that one of the easiest ways to tell if your partner doesn't respect you is that \"they don't listen to your no, that when you tell them no, they keep pushing for whatever it is that they're trying to get instead of respecting what you need.\" [20] X Expert Source Laura Richer Licensed Mental Health Counselor Expert Interview. 24 September 2021.
