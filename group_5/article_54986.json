      "content": "HIIT HIIT, or high-intensity interval training, refers to an exercise routine alternating short bursts of intense anaerobic exercise with brief recovery periods. The exercises in a HIIT workout vary, but they often include jump-roping, sprinting, planking , burpees , or squats . They’re quick, effective, and free (since you usually don’t need any equipment), and you can often do them in a small space, like your living room. If you're struggling with extra tummy fat after giving birth, don't jump right into intensive workouts, especially ones that engage your abdominal muscles (like crunches or planks), until a couple of months have passed—your body has just been through a lot, and it needs time to rest and heal. You can take HIIT classes in your area, or you can do HIIT training at home for free: YouTube includes a number of effective HIIT workouts of varying lengths and experience levels, so you can find one that works for you and pause if you need to. If you’re strapped for time, HIIT is one of your best bets: its high intensity means that the workout usually only lasts between 10-30 minutes, but you still get the benefits of a longer workout. In fact, studies indicate HIIT workouts burn 25-30% more calories than other workouts do.

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Plus, they’re easy to do basically anywhere, since they don’t take up much space and they don’t require any equipment. To do a squat, stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower your upper body by bending your hips and knees, until your thighs are parallel to the ground (if you can’t do this on the first go, don’t try to force it!). Pause for a beat and then rise again. Repeat this action 10 to 20 times."

[3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The hundred is just one example of a Pilates exercise that won’t only engage your core, but your entire body, meaning it won’t just help you tone those belly muscles, it’ll target muscles all over your body. To do the hundred , just lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor, with your arms outstretched at your sides. Then, holding your legs together, extend your legs and raise them up, so that your feet are a few feet off the ground. Lift your upper back and chest to engage your abs. [4] X Research source With your knees, upper back, and chest lifted the whole time, repeatedly raise your arms—keeping them straight, fingers outstretched—about an inch up off the floor. [5] X Research source Pump your arms up and down about a hundred times before relaxing your body and hugging your knees for a few seconds. Repeat this 2 or 3 times if you can."

This is another popular Pilates move that can help you tone your belly while giving you a great full-body workout that’ll help you shed pounds.

To do a jackknife crunch , lie flat on your back with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle and your arms fully extended above your head. [7] X Research source Engage your abdominal muscles as you lift your legs—straightening them as you lift—and your arms—keeping them straight. [8] X Research source Try to touch your knees with both hands (but don’t force it if your body doesn’t want to move that way, especially at first). Lower your arms and legs to about an inch above the floor, and repeat this movement about 20 times, then rest."

They’re a great way to tone your abdominal muscles and tighten the skin on your lower belly, while also strengthening the rest of your body. And the best part is push-ups are easily modified to suit your skill level—for instance, by dropping your knees to lessen the amount of weight you’re lifting or doing inclined push-ups against a wall or countertop.

NEAT doesn’t have to mean walking 3 hours to your office each day—it might mean bussing halfway and walking the remainder of the trip, or driving the whole way but taking the stairs to your floor instead of the elevator. A quick 15-minute walk is a great way to begin your day, take a break in the afternoon, or help your stomach digest after dinner. A 15-minute walk might not feel like a lot, but multiple little walks add up! To engage your ab muscles more while walking, try marching."

While drastically reducing your calories might give you quick results, it’s not really a sustainable or healthy method for losing weight, so it’s important to enter a consistent, manageable calorie deficit you can keep up over time—even if it means you don’t shed those pounds as fast as you’d like. Aim for about 500 fewer calories per day than you usually consume. The average person needs about 2000 calories to maintain their weight, so in order to lose weight, try to get about 1500 calories a day. If you’re a woman, be sure not to go lower than 1200, and if you’re a man, don’t get fewer than 1500. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try food tracker apps like My Fitness Pal or LifeSum to record roughly how many calories you’re getting every day. Food tracker apps can be useful for some people, but they may be triggering to those who struggle with disordered eating. If you feel that tracking your calorie count isn’t helpful, avoid the apps, and just try to be aware of what you’re eating throughout the day."

While cutting calories can help you slim down, if you’re not eating enough protein , you may struggle to lose “skinny fat” —in other words, you might be slender, but lack muscle tone. Try to eat a minimum of about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) every day, and ensure about 35% of your daily caloric intake comes from protein. [13] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For example, if you weighed 140 pounds, you’d multiply 140 by .36 and get 50.4 grams of protein. In kg, you’d multiply 63.5 kg by .8 and get 50.8. If you want to skip the math, input your info into the USDA's DRI (dietary reference intake) app to calculate calculate exactly how much protein you need based on your body type.

Note that you can reach your daily recommended amount of water with other beverages—not just plain water. Go for unsweetened tea, coffee, sparkling water—even the occasional sugary drink or alcoholic beverage (just try not to overdo it!). Often, what feels like hunger is really dehydration, so the next time you feel like grabbing a snack, drink a glass of water first; if you’re still hungry after, grab a snack."

Mindful eating asks us to focus on the experience of eating, including our bodily sensations while we eat and our thoughts and feelings about food, without judgment. [15] X Research source “Dieting” can feel like a major chore, but the goal of mindful eating is to enjoy eating, and to better understand how to nourish your body. Counting calories can help you lose weight, but only focusing on calorie content can distance you from the experience of eating your food.
