      "title": "You need to have a master’s or doctoral degree in psychology.",
      "content": "You need to have a master’s or doctoral degree in psychology. Your first step to become a psychologist in Canada is to earn a bachelor’s degree in psychology from a university. Then, obtain a master’s degree such as a Master of Arts (M.A.) or a Master of Science (M.S.) which will prepare you for entry into a doctoral program. At the doctoral level, you can earn a Ph.D. in clinical or experimental psychology, or a Psy.D., both of which will prepare you for professional practice as a clinical psychologist. [1] X Research source Most provinces in Canada require you to have a doctoral degree in order to be a licensed clinical psychologist, but some may allow you to work as a psychologist with just a master’s degree, such as Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Newfoundland. Some bachelor’s degree programs may allow you to go straight into a Ph.D. program without having to earn a master’s degree. Check out the school’s website to see if they have a program that allows you to do it."

Check out the medical board’s website for the province where you plan to practice to see what their requirements are so you can prepare for them.

You won’t have to worry about things like payroll and billing—that’s all handled by the facility. Starting your own practice means you can carve a niche for yourself and set your own hours. But you’ll also need to pay your staff, handle overhead costs, and market your business to find more clients."

It pays well. Many clinical psychologists earn a six-figure salary. [9] X Research source Keep in mind you’ll likely have a fair amount of student loans to pay off at first. But once you’re debt-free, you can earn a pretty penny as a practicing clinical psychologist."
