      "content": "Pour your raw rice into a fine-mesh strainer and rinse with cool running water. Stir the rice gently with your hand until the water runs mostly clear (the starch in the rice means the water won’t be perfectly clear, but that’s normal). After rinsing the rice , shake the strainer gently to remove any excess water. [1] X Research source Or, to save dishes, rinse your rice in the dish you’ll microwave it in. Just add water, swish it around with your hand, and pour the water out to rinse. Repeat 2-3 times. Feel free to use basmati, jasmine, or even sushi rice."

      "content": "Pour your rinsed rice into a microwave-safe dish or bowl and add 1.5 cups (355 mL) of water, as well as a pinch of salt (optional) and/or 1 tsp (5 mL) of oil or butter (optional) for extra flavor (no stirring necessary). Rice expands as it cooks, so choose a larger dish that can hold at least 8 cups (1.9 L) to hold your rice and prevent bubbly overflow. [2] X Research source Tip: For more flavor, use chicken or vegetable broth instead of plain water. Try a 50/50 mix of broth and water to avoid an overly starchy taste. [3] X Research source For brown rice: Add 3 cups (710 mL) of water or broth for 1 cup of uncooked brown rice. [4] X Research source Look for the words “microwave safe” or a symbol with wavy lines to tell if your dish is microwavable . Most ceramic, glass, and china dishes can be microwaved, as well as brands like Anchor Hocking, Duralex, Pyrex, Corningware, and Visions."

[5] X Research source Place a plate underneath your dish to catch any bubbly overflow that may creep over the edge of your dish. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove your dish from the microwave with oven mitts or a towel (it will be hot!). Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap, a lid, or a plate, then microwave it again for about 4 more minutes on High. [7] X Research source For brown rice: Reduce the power to 50% or Medium, cover the dish, and microwave the brown rice for about 20 more minutes. [8] X Research source Do not stir the rice in between microwave sessions."

      "content": "Remove the dish and set it on a heat-resistant surface for 5-6 minutes to let the rice absorb all the remaining moisture in the dish. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork or rice paddle . Take a test bite—if the rice is not quite done, cover and microwave in 1-minute intervals on High until tender. [9] X Research source Once the rice is done, serve right away and enjoy!"

      "content": "If you didn’t add salt, oil, or butter beforehand, never fear! While the rice is still hot, stir in salt and pepper (to taste) and a spoonful of butter or oil for a basic, tasty dish. Or, try some of these delicious ideas: If you're making rice as a side for something else, borrow spices from that dish and mix it into the rice. This will add flavor to the rice and help it pair well with whatever you're cooking. [10] X Research source For example, if you're making salmon, add some salmon marinade to the rice after cooking it. Add any shredded cheese you like while the rice is still hot and stir to melt and mix it in. [11] X Research source Roast some garlic in the oven while you’re making your rice. Mash and stir the garlic into the rice once it’s soft and tender. Add ¼ to ½ cup (13 to 27 g) of chopped herbs for a quick and easy seasoning. Try parsley, scallions, basil, or cilantro (or any herb you like). [12] X Research source Sautée ½ of a chopped onion in 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil and heat up some frozen peas in the same pan. Stir the veggies into the rice and add a pinch of salt or a splash of soy sauce for a tasty dish."
