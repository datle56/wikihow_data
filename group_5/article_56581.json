You may skip stages, never experience other stages, and you can find yourself stuck in stages. But you may experience some or all stages in waves repeatedly. These stages are: [1] X Research source Denial and isolation: This stage involves denying the reality of the situation. It is a natural response to overwhelming pain caused by grief. Anger: This stage emerges once the denied pain starts to surface. Anger can be aimed at inanimate objects, strangers, family or friends. You may feel angry at the person who died or left, and then you may feel guilty for feeling angry. Bargaining: In this stage, you may feel like you need to regain control from feeling helpless. You might worry about how you should have been a better person, or you should have gotten help sooner, and so on. Depression: This stage brings sadness and regret that comes with the realization that the loved one is truly gone. You may feel overwhelming sadness, crying, and so on. Acceptance: This stage may be characterized by reaching a state of calm and withdrawal. Some people may never reach this stage of grief."

It gets better.” Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers who’ve been through a breakup, and 74% of them agreed the best way to move on is by giving yourself time to grieve. [Take Poll]"

When a wave of negative emotion hits, give yourself a moment (literally maybe just a single minute) to feel what you feel. Then, choose to move your thoughts on to something more positive. For the record, it’s okay to laugh when grieving. Your emotions are merely recalibrating. Believe it or not, your emotions are doing exactly what they should be doing. That said, sometimes the recalibration process hits a snag and we may find ourselves dealing with depression, which is a serious matter."

      "content": "Evaluate your love with an honest lens. Once you get over the initial grief of losing this person, it is a good time for a truthful look at your former relationship. Start by recognizing what existed. If you have lost the loved one because of death and are trying to move forward with your life, you may discover that you have idealized your relationship with your loved one, overlooking the times that weren’t so great in favor of the times that were. You are not dishonoring your loved one by recalling these less than ideal times. You are, instead, remembering the real and true person. If love existed between you, then part of what made the love so special was all of the in-between moments, and the ways you were able to work through differences. Don’t place this person unnecessarily on a pedestal in death. Holding him up so high can keep you from holding him close in your heart and moving forward, which is not what he wanted for you. If, your loss was relational rather than from someone passing, the same applies. Your relationship was not perfect. If it had been, you wouldn’t be trying to move on. Even if they were the one to cut things off, it still reveals some frailty to the relationship, and that is okay."

Once you have recognized these toxic elements, you can appreciate the chance to “detoxify” a bit. This will give you a chance to work on avoiding those pitfalls in other relationships.

But it is important to avoid vilifying the other person, even if he treated you poorly. Too much dwelling on the past can be harmful. [3] X Research source Assigning negative connotations or dwelling on particularly darker moments can strengthen emotional ties to the thoughts of that person, making them hard to let go. In fact, your love can turn to resentment. This doesn’t free the person from your heart. It only frees him from your kindness.

These supports generally come with natural boundaries you have already established. You tend to avoid deeply personal conversation, and keep things fun and on the surface.

So let’s dial back the intensity and reframe this in a comfortable way. Instead of diving into the dating scene, dive into the possibility of new friendships . Friendships can take on so many wonderful forms. Some friends are more like family. Sometimes friends move past friendship and become romantic partners. Sometimes friends simply remain friends.

Feelings have a way of jumbling up, making them difficult to articulate.

However, you don’t want to be the one carrying old baggage into a new relationship, whether the relationship is friendship or romantic. Think about whether you are free from thoughts about this former love. If you still think of him even a couple of times a day, then you could still find yourself in a rebound relationship. Even rebound friendships can be a problem because you are experiencing a temporary gap in your emotional needs and may be gravitating to someone who fills that need.

While avoidance is okay in the beginning, eventually you’ll want to challenge yourself to heal completely. Consider revisiting old venues with a trusted friend. Then you can start to create new memories and associations. Start with where you are comfortable, and slowly begin to rewrite your own memories and stories. Those places can still be special. When that one song comes on the radio, do you still think of that person? If so, it may be too early to move on. You may need to reclaim that memory by tying it to new experiences. Try sharing the song with your friends and ask them to help you give it new meaning. Make it funny. Remember, humor heals. If you love the view from a certain restaurant, then meet a few of your best friends there. Laugh, enjoy yourself and start connecting that place to joy again.
