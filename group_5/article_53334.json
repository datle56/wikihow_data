      "title": "Obtain an FDA-approved sharps disposal container.",
      "content": "Obtain an FDA-approved sharps disposal container. Before using a needle outside of a healthcare facility, purchase an FDA-approved personal use a sharps disposal container online, at your local pharmacy, or from a medical supply establishment. [2] X Research source In some cases, your doctor may supply you with a sharps disposal container along with the needles needed to self-administer your medication. In some places, you aren't legally required to use an approved sharps disposal container. In those cases, you can legally use a sturdy plastic container with a screw-on lid, such as an empty laundry detergent bottle. [3] X Research source However, this is generally not recommended because of the injury and health risks it poses to garbage haulers and facility workers. FDA-approved sharps disposal containers generally cost less than $10 USD."

      "title": "Place the sharps container nearby.",
      "content": "Place the sharps container nearby. When you’re using a needle to administer medication, make sure that you place the sharps disposal container next to you or very close by. This will reduce the risk of injuring yourself or someone else by walking around with the exposed used needle, and will eliminate the need for you to set the needle down or store it anywhere else. Needles are generally very thin and small and, therefore, can easily be lost. Positioning the sharps disposal container next to you will make it easier for you to dispose of the needle properly and minimize the risks to yourself and others.

      "title": "Place the needle in the container immediately after use.",
      "content": "Place the needle in the container immediately after use. First, open the top of the sharps disposal container so the disposal chute is exposed. Then, immediately after using the needle according to your doctor’s instructions, place the needle carefully in the disposal chute with the sharp end facing down. Once the needle is fully inside the container, close the lid. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Make sure that the lid is closed properly and securely before moving the container."

      "title": "Use a sturdy plastic jug if an FDA-approved container is unavailable.",
      "content": "Use a sturdy plastic jug if an FDA-approved container is unavailable. If you don’t have an FDA-approved sharps disposal container, you can still throw away your used needles in another sturdy plastic container, such as a bleach or laundry detergent bottle. Make sure the container has a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid and can stand upright when in use. The container itself should be leak-proof and puncture-resistant as well. [6] X Research source Once the container is about 3/4 full, dispose of it according to your community guidelines as you would with an official FDA-approved container."

      "title": "Cut the needle off the syringe with needle clippers to cut down on waste.",
      "content": "Cut the needle off the syringe with needle clippers to cut down on waste. Place the needle portion of a small syringe, such as an insulin syringe, inside the clipper. Then, press down on the clippers to cut the needle off. You can then throw the rest of the syringe away in the trash. [7] X Research source The needle will be stored within the clipper until you dispose of it in a sharps container. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source The syringe is the part that holds the medication, while the needle is the pointy end used to pierce your skin or veins. While syringes can legally and safely be disposed of in the trash, they cannot be placed in the recycling even if the materials are recyclable. [9] X Research source While you’ll still need a sharps disposal container after using needle cutters, they will cut down on the amount of waste you put into the container. As a result, you’ll be able to use the container for longer and reduce the number of containers you’ll need to dispose of and purchase each year."

Needle grinding devices enable you to destroy your used needles at home by grinding up the needle until it no longer poses a health and safety risk. Once the needle is destroyed, you can dispose of the remaining syringe and needle particles in the trash. [10] X Research source The way in which you operate a needle grinder varies depending on the type of grinder you purchase. Therefore, make sure that you read the instructions carefully before using the grinder. Ground needles can be disposed of in the trash, but they cannot be placed in the recycling bin.

While expensive to purchase, needle melting devices are effective at safely melting used needles to reduce health and safety risks. Once the needle is placed in the device and melted, it can safely be thrown away in the trash along with the remaining syringe. [12] X Research source The instructions for using a needle melting device vary, so make sure that you follow the instructions for your specific device. Melted needle metal can be thrown away in the trash. It cannot be recycled. [13] X Research source Personal needle melting devices generally cost about $200 USD."

[16] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source While many sharps disposal containers have a clear bucket and red top, some have a red body and clear top.
