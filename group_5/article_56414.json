      "content": "Collect materials and tools for making the scarf. To knit a scarf on a loom, a few special materials and tools are needed: [1] X Research source A rectangular loom. 24 peg loom or larger - only the first 24 pegs (top and bottom combined) of any loom will be used. Place the loom on a table or other sturdy surface. This makes weaving a scarf with a loom easier. Yarn. Use a super bulky yarn or two strands of medium worsted weight yarn held together. Loom tool. This is a hook that comes with the loom. If you do not have a loom tool, use a crochet hook instead. Scissors. Tapestry or yarn needle."

      "content": "Wrap the yarn around the first peg of the lower row. The lower row is the row closest to you. Enter the loom through the middle, between the two rows of pegs. Wrap the yarn around the inside of the first peg on the lower row of the loom. Bring the yarn clockwise around the outside of the peg and back in towards the center. The yarn should form an upside-down cursive letter “e” around the peg. Wrap the peg tightly to maintain tension. This keeps the finished scarf looking neat."

This moves the loops down on the pegs and creates room to loop the yarn around each of the pegs again. [7] X Research source There should be some resistance when pressing down on the yarn. This indicates good tension, which will result in a neat looking finished scarf. If the yarn feels loose or has already slid to the peg bottom on its own, then the pegs are not wrapped tightly enough. In this case, you may need to start over."

Insert loom tool through the bottom loop on the last peg in lower row. Bring the loop up and over the other loop on the peg to knit it. [10] X Research source After knitting the first loop on the lower row, repeat for the bottom loop on the upper row. Return to the lower row going back and forth to knit the loops until the end of the row. When finished working the first round of loops off the loom, only one stitch is on each of the pegs."

Measure the knitted material to determine where the scarf will end. Four rows creates 1” (2.5 cm) of knit material. For a scarf five feet long or 60” (152 cm), knit about 240 rows on the loom."
