      "content": "Put it down on a solid surface away from edges, liquids and foods, and curious kids and pets. The placement of the phone is one key way to ensure that it won't get knocked onto the floor from a height or end up dropping it into something on the surface that it shouldn't be put in, such as food or drink."

      "content": "If you're distracted and trying to do two things at once, there is a greater chance that you'll drop the phone to keep doing the other task. For example, driving while talking on the phone (illegal in many places) reduces your attention span greatly, and makes it easier for you to drop the phone to hold the steering wheel or pay attention to the road. You might even be unfortunate enough to drop the phone into your cup of coffee..."

      "title": "Never take or place calls in the bathroom.",
      "content": "Never take or place calls in the bathroom. Not only is it a sign of disrespect to the caller on the end to be doing your business on a call, but you could drop the phone into the toilet. Just gross. Same goes for taking a bath, just don't bathe and phone."

      "content": "A non-slip cover helps you keep hold of your phone, even in temperature extremes. Moreover, should the phone be dropped accidentally, the cover serves as a form of protection for the phone."

      "title": "Whether it goes back into a pocket, bag, or somewhere else, do this without fail each time.",
      "content": "Whether it goes back into a pocket, bag, or somewhere else, do this without fail each time. Don't hold onto it or put it in a different place than its usual storage spot. In this way, you'll be less likely to drop it and more likely to rely on muscle memory to slip it back into its safe holding place."

      "title": "Consider people or animals pulling or bumping against the phone while charging in your home or office.",
      "content": "Consider people or animals pulling or bumping against the phone while charging in your home or office. Place the recharging device well away from areas where people walk by, away from piles of paper and away from curious kids and pets. Also be sure to keep the cord tucked away tidily, so that it can't be pulled or tripped over, potentially dragging your phone down."
