      "content": "Put your hair into a high ponytail on top of the forehead. Brush out your hair or your friend’s hair to get rid of any knots or tangles. Then, with your head flipped over, brush your hair into a high ponytail near the front of your forehead. Secure your ponytail with a hair tie to keep the hair in place as you cut. [1] X Research source Putting your hair up into a high ponytail is an easy way to cut layers, especially if you aren’t a professional. By directing all of your hair forward, you can cut it once to create different lengths throughout your hair. If the hair is too short to put into a single ponytail, put it into a half-up ponytail, taking all the hair from your ears upward."

      "content": "Snip about 2 to 4 in (5.1 to 10.2 cm) off with hair cutting scissors . Pull your hair forward over the forehead, and keep it there while you cut. The first chunk of hair you take off will dictate how much length you keep. If you’d like to keep the hair long, cut only about 2 in (5.1 cm) off of the end. If you want to lose some length, go for 4 in (10 cm). [2] X Research source If you only put half of the hair up, your first cut will dictate how short your layers are."

      "title": "Thin the hair out by point cutting upward.",
      "content": "Thin the hair out by point cutting upward. After your initial cut, you’ll notice that your hair looks a little blunt. To add some texture, grab your hair cutting scissors and point them upward into the hair, opening and closing the scissors to snip small amounts of hair off. This will add some texture and take some weight out of the layers. [3] X Research source If you have thinning shears , use those instead. Hold the thinning shears straight across and cut your hair in a straight line. The thinning shears will only take off bits and pieces of hair, so your cut won’t look blunt or choppy."

      "title": "Let your hair down and part it down the middle.",
      "content": "Let your hair down and part it down the middle. Now you have the base layers of your wolf cut! Take your hair out of the ponytail and part it down the middle. You’ll notice that the underneath part of the hair is the longest, while the sections up near the ears are the shortest. [4] X Research source If your hair isn’t quite short enough for your liking, simply put it back in the ponytail and cut some more off. It’s better to take too little than to take too much—you can always cut more, but you can’t glue it back on!"

      "content": "Section a small triangle of hair above your forehead. Place a comb on top of your forehead, and find the spot directly above your forehead where your head starts to curve. Gather the hair from your forehead back to where the head starts to curve to create a small triangle. Use the arch of your eyebrows as a guide for the edges of the triangle. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Direct the left side of the bangs to the right, then cut them diagonally. Grab the hair on the left side of your face, then pinch it in between 2 fingers and direct it to the right side. Hold your cutting scissors at a diagonal pointing down from your ear, and trim a small amount of hair off. This will create layers to frame your face. [6] X Research source Start by taking 1 in (2.5 cm) of hair off at first, then see how you feel. It’s better to take hair off in small sections so you don’t accidentally go too short."

Do the same thing with the other side of your bangs: grab the hair on the right side of your face, direct it toward the left side, and cut the ends at a diagonal pointing down from your ear. Try to make both sides relatively even with each other. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim your bangs as needed. Shake your hair out and make sure it parts in the middle. Take a look at the bangs: are they as short as you’d like them to be? If not, use your scissors to trim them up, keeping them at a diagonal so they frame the face. [8] X Research source If you’re working with curly or wavy hair, remember that it will shrink slightly when it dries. Keep that in mind as you cut so you don’t accidentally cut too much off. Cutting curtain bangs completes the look of the wolf cut. Once you have the layers all over, you can refine them and trim them up near your face for a little more volume and shine."

Then, let it air dry or use a diffuser attachment for your hair dryer to dry it quickly. [9] X Research source Wolf cuts aren’t supposed to look sleek and shiny—the messier it looks, the better! If you want to style your curtain bangs into waves, you can make two pin curls, one on each side. Use a diffuser to dry your bangs, and once they are dry, remove the bobby pins."
