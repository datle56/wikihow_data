Then, thread the right lace upwards through the eyelet above and diagonal to it. [7] X Research source This is the final lacing step, meaning that the very top eyelet is unlaced. This gives your shoes a loose and comfortable fit. For a looser fit , stop lacing when you reach the top 3 eyelets. Then, pull the left and right lace up through the third eyelet from the top, leaving the top 2 eyelets unlaced. For a tighter fit , push the laces down through the second eyelet from the top. Then, pull the laces up through the last eyelet at the top."

Put on your shoe and gently pull up on the laces and on the sides of the shoe to loosen the laces to your liking.
