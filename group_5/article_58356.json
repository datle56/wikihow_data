Have the rest of the students put their heads down on their desks and stick one of their thumbs up. Have the students at their desks close their eyes and tell them that no peeking is allowed. [1] X Research source If you have students who tend to disrupt class or have trouble focusing, choose them to be the pickers first. They’re more likely to get involved in the game if they feel like they’re your “helpers”. You can also have the students at the desk put a closed fist on their desk without sticking their thumb up. Heads Up 7 Up works best if you have at least 14 people playing, but you can adjust if you have fewer people. Just make sure there are at least twice as many players as there are pickers."

      "content": "Have each picker choose a student by tapping their hand. Once all the students have their eyes closed, the pickers walk around the classroom and each tap the thumb of a student with their head down. When a student gets their thumb tapped, that student puts their thumb down signaling that they have already been picked. Children can only be picked once in a round. If the students have their thumbs down to begin with, they will put their thumb up when they are picked. When you’re a picker, try to move silently around the room so no other student recognizes your voice or the sound of you walking by. If you have your head down, try to listen really carefully as the pickers walk past you. If someone taps your thumb, try to remember how the person sounded or how their hand felt."

      "content": "Let the students who were picked take turns guessing who picked them. Have any student who got picked stand up at their desk and let them each take 1 guess. If a student guesses who picked them correctly, that student becomes a picker in the next round and the other person sits down. If the student guesses incorrectly, then the child who picked them remains a picker in the next round. Trying to decide who picked them is good for a student’s reasoning skills. They can analyze all the pickers to see which one looks “guilty.” If you’re a picker, don’t give away who you chose until all the students have made their guesses. Try to keep a straight face so people don’t suspect you. If you’re trying to figure out who picked you, take a moment to remember any details, like the sound of their shoes as they walked by, before making your guess."

That child will be “it” and be the only picker for the round. Make sure the child who is “it” does not talk after you have chosen them. You don’t want them to give away their identity to the rest of the class.

Keep selecting students until someone gets the answer right. Suspense will build as students are ruled out from being \"it\" by process of elimination. Be ready to calm your students down if they get overexcited. Make the game more fun for the kids by giving a prize to the child that guesses correctly. Let the winner choose one item from a bag filled with assorted candy or small items like pencils and erasers."

If the child spells the word correctly, then they get to be a picker for the next round and whoever picked them sits down. If they spell the word incorrectly, the picker remains the same. Be sure to use words that are appropriate for your students’ level of education. Make sure to use the same word until one of the students gets it right so all the other students can hear it spelled correctly. Write the word on the board or projector after the students have spelled it to give your students a chance to review. Have all the students spell the word in unison after it is used to help the entire class practice."

Instead of just blurting out a name, have children ask, “Was it Anne?” Then Anne can reply, “Yes, it was me.” [4] X Research source Have your students write their guesses on the board to practice their written grammar. Writing down their guesses can help your students learn how to write in complete sentences, when to use a question mark, and how to capitalize words."

If the student gets the answer right, they get to be a picker for the next round. Either way, make sure to review the answer clearly to everyone in the class. [5] X Research source Use questions with the appropriate difficulty level. You don’t want your kids to be bored with a bunch of easy questions, but you also don’t want them to be discouraged by questions that are too difficult. Repeat the rule that corresponds to each question after it is used. For example: For the question, “What is nine times five?” the answer would be 45. Say, “Remember that whenever a number is multiplied by five, the answer ends in five or zero.”"

The game might run smoother if you write your questions on pieces of paper and place them in a hat. Let your students choose a question from the hat to answer when they are picked."
