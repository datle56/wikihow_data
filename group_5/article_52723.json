For example, if you want all emails from your favorite online store to be filtered into one label, you might enter the email address for the mailing list into the \"From\" field, or put the store's name in the \"Has the words\" field. If you want to create a label for all of your emails that have attachments, you can check the \"Has attachment\" box. If you want to create a label for an event or for certain conversations that have the same subject line, you can enter it into the \"Subject\" field."
