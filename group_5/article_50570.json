      "title": "Admit your mistake",
      "content": "Admit your mistake and feel remorseful for your actions. Take a deep breath and acknowledge that you did something wrong. Take responsibility for your actions and feel truly sorry for what you did. While it can be hard to admit your mistakes, confessing your sins and acknowledging how they affect you, Allah, and other people can help you feel better and be hopeful for Allah's mercy. [1] X Research source Acknowledge that you are responsible for your choices and that your actions can have either positive or negative consequences in Allah’s eyes. Even if your mistake seems minor to you and did not harm anyone else, acknowledge it and ask Allah to forgive you. This helps you learn from it and use it to improve yourself. Understand that Allah is the Most Merciful and wants to forgive you. While the Qur'an warns that punishment awaits those who disobey Him and do not live their lives in the way that He has commanded in the Qur'an and through Prophet Muhammad (salla Allahu alayhi wa-sallam), he will forgive you if you sincerely repent and try to be better. Allah does not expect you to be perfect. What he does want from you is to seek His forgiveness and strive to improve yourself. This comes from religious education, recognizing your mistakes, and learning from them. Sins create a veil over the heart, which can separate you from Allah and potentially lead to more sins. Asking for forgiveness helps undo this separation and purify your heart. Devote some time each day to learn more about Islam. Familiarize yourself with Allah's rules setting out right from wrong (halal and haram), as well as how Allah requires His servants to behave. Study the rules of behavior in the Shariah for guidance on what is considered right and wrong."

      "title": "Pray to Allah with sincerity and the intention to be better.",
      "content": "Pray to Allah with sincerity and the intention to be better. There’s no single right way to ask for Allah’s forgiveness. All Allah asks is that you put your heart into your prayer so He knows you’re sincere and feel remorseful. So, be open and vulnerable with Allah, take your time with your prayer, and truly feel your words. [2] X Research source Sincerity means regretting what you did in your heart and feeling sorrow for disobeying Allah. Crying is a sign of sincerity as well as fear of Allah's punishment. Only ask for forgiveness because you want it and acknowledge that you did something wrong. Don’t ask for it just because other people are pressurizing you to. Praying for forgiveness is part of most Muslims’ daily worship. This can help ensure that you’re always reflecting on your actions and seeking to improve yourself."

      "content": "Promise to avoid making the mistake again . Allah knows that you are human and that you will make mistakes. He doesn’t need you to promise that you’ll never sin again, just that you intend to avoid the behavior in the future. When you pray, be sincere in your intention to obey Allah, be a better person, and learn from your mistake. [3] X Research source For example, if you lied to your brother, reflect on why this was wrong. Then, commit to not doing it again. If it’s helpful for you, take clear practical steps to avoid repeating your mistake or sin, for example by lowering the gaze or fasting."

      "content": "Ask for forgiveness from anyone who was affected by your mistake. Take some time to reflect on whether your actions hurt other people, and if so, who those people were and what harm you caused them. Then, sincerely apologize to them by acknowledging how you hurt them and asking for their forgiveness. [4] X Research source If you damaged a person’s property or reputation, promise to remedy their loss and change your behavior. For example, if you stole from them, give the item back."

      "content": "Believe in Allah’s ability to forgive you. Remember that Allah is infinitely merciful and loving. If you are hopeful that Allah will forgive you and you believe in His mercy, He will forgive you. Thank Allah for His forgiveness and trust that He will be merciful. Remember what the Qur’an says of Allah’s forgiveness : “Seek your Lord’s forgiveness, for He is truly Most Forgiving.” [71:10] [5] X Research source “Indeed Allah loves those who repent and purify themselves.“ [Surah Al Baqarah, 2:222] \"Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.\" [2:37] [6] X Research source “He said, ‘I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’\" [12:98] [7] X Research source Focusing on the Afterlife helps some Muslims avoid sinning. For instance, develop a comprehensive daily schedule of study and worship (ibadah). Contemplate the bounties of Jannah (Heaven) and the punishments of Jahannam (Hellfire)."

      "content": "Perform Salah . Perform the 5 Salah at their appointed times each day. Before each prayer, set your intention to sincerely revere Allah. Try to perform additional Sunnah (recommended) and Nafl (voluntary) rakats every day, too. These can help show Allah your desire for forgiveness. [8] X Research source Salaat is the key to developing a close connection with Allah and is prioritized above all else within the daily schedule of every Muslim. If you are a male, try to perform Salah at a mosque. The calm and devoted environment might help you. Remain mindful of the Day of Judgment, which is when Allah judges your actions and determines your fate in the Afterlife. The Qur'an says that Salah is the first thing examined, so make sure you are consistent with your prayers."

Focus on your feelings of remorse, your intention to do better, and your hope in Allah’s mercy. [9] X Research source Allah says in the Quran, “And perform Salaat, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salah].” (Hud 11:114). Menstruating women can pray for forgiveness."

      "title": "Recite duas",
      "content": "Recite duas to seek forgiveness. Duas are prayers of supplication. You can also recite duas as a way to ask Allah for forgiveness. Some duas for forgiveness include: [10] X Research source Astaghfirullah : “I seek forgiveness from Allah the Most Mighty.” Say it at least 100 times, which is in line with Prophet Muhammed’s (peace be upon him) practices. Many Muslims recite \"Astaghfirullah al Azeem\" thousands of times as part of their self-healing process after sinning, like for missing Fajr. Qur’an 7:23 : \"They said, ‘Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.’\" [11] X Research source Sayyidul Istighfar : “O Allah, you’re my Lord, none has the suitable to be worshipped besides You. You created me and I’m Your servant and I abide to Your covenant and promise as finest I can. I take refuge in You from the evil of which I dedicated. I acknowledge Your favour upon me and I acknowledge my sin. So forgive me, for verily none can forgive sin besides You.” Astaghfar , the Fifth Kalima : “I seek forgiveness from Allah, my Lord, from every sin I committed knowingly or unknowingly, secretly or openly, and I turn towards Him from the sin that I know and from the sin that I do not know. Certainly You are the knower of the hidden things and the Concealer (of) the mistakes and the Forgiver of the sins. And there is no power and no strength except from Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.” Subhan Allah Wa Bihamdihi : Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever says, 'Subhan Allah Wa Bihamdihi,' 100 times a day, will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 6405] [12] X Research source"

For instance, say: Al-Ghaffaar (The Oft-Forgiving), Al-Ghafoor (The All-Forgiving), Al-Rahman/Al-Rahim (The Most Merciful and Compassionate), Al-’Afuww (He Who Pardons), and Al-Tawwab (The Acceptor of Repentance).

      "content": "Continue to ask Allah for forgiveness day and night. You may find it helpful to keep asking Allah for forgiveness for the mistake you made, depending on its seriousness and the progress you’re making on righting the sin. For some people, seeking forgiveness can be a slow process of improving themselves. Don’t feel that you need to keep repenting for the same mistake. Overly repenting can sometimes turn into self-loathing, which isn’t healthy or helpful to your relationship with Allah. Remember that Allah is infinitely merciful, as He forgives sins both big and small, and that making mistakes is human nature; it doesn’t make you a bad person. [14] X Research source The Prophet (S.A.W.S) said: “Allah, the Exalted, will continue to stretch out His Hand in the night so that the sinners of the day may repent, and continue to stretch His Hand in the daytime so that the sinners of the night may repent, until the sun rises from the west (the start of Day of Judgment)”. [Sahih Muslim]. [15] X Research source Asking for forgiveness after performing Tahajjud (the night prayer) is a good time to repent, as this is when Allah is in His lowest Heaven. Familiarize yourself with the punishments that Allah has prepared in Jahannam (Hellfire) for those that disobey Him in the Qur'an and authentic ahadith. These can be helpful to motivate you to avoid mistakes and be a better Muslim."

As Allah says, “Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds.” [11:114] [16] X Research source Even the smallest of good deeds help wipe away your mistake, like smiling at a stranger, keeping in touch with your family, helping your neighbors, or volunteering in your community. [17] X Research source For example, help your neighbor carry in a heavy piece of furniture, give a ride to a coworker whose car is in the shop, or buy a meal for someone in need. Acts of worship are also considered good deeds, like reading the Qur'an , making the recommended adhkar after each salaat, and seeking opportunities for dhikr each day. These actions help you connect with Allah and can keep you away from sin. Voluntary fasting can help you appreciate Allah's gifts, build the resolve to live a good life in obedience to Allah, and develop the self-control to resist temptation. If you are able, fast every Monday and Thursday. Try to at least fast on the white days of each month (the 13th, 14th, and 15th)."

      "content": "Do little things to help you when seeking forgiveness. Small moments of mindfulness during prayer, surrounding yourself with good people, and even dressing more modestly might affect how Allah receives your request for forgiveness. Look for minor things you can do to bolster your faith. For instance: Say \"Ameen.\" The Prophet (salla Allahu alayhi wa-sallam) said, “When the Imaam says ‘Ameen,’ say ‘Ameen,’ because he who coincides with the angels when saying Ameen will get all his previous sins forgiven.” (Al-Bukhaari & Muslim). Send blessings upon Prophet Muhammad (salla Allahu alayhi wa-sallam) as many times as you can every day. Attend weekly Islamic study circles with other people mindful of Allah. Surround yourself with good influences and people who inspire you to be better. Stay away from people who don’t make you feel good or who distract you from your faith. Follow the Islamic dress code. This can help you remember Allah and obey the code of conduct set out in the Shariah."
