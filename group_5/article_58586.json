You'll want to pass on the best possible traits for the next bell pepper crop, so only select the plants that are growing well and are in good health. [1] X Research source Signs of a healthy plant include good growth; ability to cope with hot, cold, wet and cool climates; well-formed fruits; uniform growth; supple branches; thick walls on the fruits; good flavor."

The bell pepper is ripe when it has changed from green to red or yellow or from light yellow to dark yellow or orange. The seeds will appear a golden yellow color; if they are still white, then they're not ready for preserving. [3] X Research source If the fruit has dried on the stalk, the seeds can be harvested from this too."

There is a simple test using water that will enable you to remove the seeds that probably won't germinate: Place all of the seeds into a small container filled with water. The seeds that won't germinate (non-viable) will float to the top. The seeds left at the bottom will likely germinate. Pour the non-viable seeds off, carefully keeping the viable ones at the base of the container."
