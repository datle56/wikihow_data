      "content": "If you’re single, cherish your platonic and familial relationships. Our society often prioritizes romantic bonds over other relationships, but these non-romantic connections are just as important as romantic ones. Spend time with friends—maybe even consider reaching out to a friend you’ve lost contact with. They’d probably be glad to hear from you! Don’t discount the most important relationship of all: the one you have with yourself. Take yourself out on dates and spend time reflecting on your own to really get to know yourself and learn to enjoy your own company."

      "content": "Don’t be afraid to take chances in your professional life. Good things come to those who break out of their comfort zone. Maybe this means applying for a new job with better pay—or worse pay, but better long-term opportunities. Maybe it means stepping away from your current field entirely to pursue something that aligns better with your values and passions—even if it means starting over from scratch, it’s worth it if it gives you a shot at long-term joy and fulfillment."

      "title": "Stay positive.",
      "content": "Stay positive. When life is out of alignment, the temptation to shrink into despair can be strong. Do your best to resist it! See every obstacle as an opportunity for growth, and trust that your angels have your back through every challenge. Practice reframing negative thoughts to be more optimistic. Start every morning by reciting positive mantras to yourself in the mirror—for instance, “I am strong enough to overcome any obstacle,” or “I’m worthy of achieving my goals.” When you catch yourself falling into negative thought patterns (it happens to the best of us!), try to be aware of it, and challenge those thoughts."

      "content": "Practice being thankful. It sounds like a cliché, but it works: practicing gratitude can help you actually be more thankful for what you have and what you’ve achieved, and it can boost your spirits in a mighty way. Consider keeping a gratitude journal and listing at least 10 things every day that you’re grateful for. Or maybe just pick one thing and write meditatively on that thing for a few minutes a day."

Your angels and the universe itself are here to help—but you need to make the movements yourself! You’ll likely need to take risks to promote growth and accomplish your goals. What is one change you can make this year, this week, today, to further your dreams?"
