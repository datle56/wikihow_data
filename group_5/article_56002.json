Muslims recite this phrase after a time of hardship to remind themselves that Allah will not test them any more than they can bear. It’s also a phrase recited after someone dies. [1] X Research source “Inna” means “indeed” or “surely,” “li-llahi” is “we belong to Allah,” “wa” means “and,” ilayhi is “towards him,” and raaji'oon or raji’un means “will return.” Arabic translation: إِنَّا لِلَّٰهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُون Urdu translation: بے شک ہم اللہ کیلئے ہیں اور ہمیں اسی کی طرف لوٹنا ہے۔ Tamil translation: நாம் அல்லாஹ்வுக்கே உரியவர்கள், அவனிடமே திரும்புவோம்"

The phrase “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un” comes from the holy Quran, which says to recite this line after someone dies or is affected by something disastrous. [2] X Research source “We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure—who say, when struck by a disaster, “Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will all return.” They are the ones who will receive Allah’s blessings and mercy. And it is they who are rightly guided.” (2:155-157) [3] X Research source"

Umm Salamah reported: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying, ‘When a person suffers from a calamity and utters: 'Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un. Allahumma ujurni fi musibati, wakhluf li khairan minha’, then Allah surely compensates him with reward and better substitute.’” (Book 6, Hadith 921) [6] X Research source This hadith is in the Book of Visiting the Sick, and the phrase is typically uttered in front of a sick or dying person and their family. [7] X Research source In English, this phrase says, “We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. O Allah! Compensate me in my affliction, recompense my loss and give me something better in exchange for it.”"

The Quran says that those who say “inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un” after experiencing fear, famine, or loss of property or crops will get Allah’s compassion and protection in response. It’s a reminder to stay patient, and that Allah won’t throw anything at you that He doesn’t think you can handle. [8] X Research source “Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilayhi Rajioon, I heard your house was destroyed by the flood. Is there any way I can help?” “I lost my job and my rent is due next week, inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon.”"

I’m sorry for your loss.” You: “Thank you.” Them: “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un, this war has been happening for too long.” You: “Thank you, I know this must be difficult for you, too.

When a Muslim dies, they can’t perform good acts to increase their chances of being rewarded with Jannah in the hereafter. Repeating this hadith shows your love and patience for those who have returned to Allah, and reminds others that they can still commit good acts for them. [12] X Research source “Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), beneficial knowledge, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him.” (Book 12, Hadith 8) [13] X Research source"
