      "content": "Plant the seeds during spring or fall. When you choose to plant your seeds depends on what you plan to use the oats for. If you're growing oats for food, plant them in the spring so you have a summer harvest. If you're growing oats for ground cover, plant your seeds in the early spring for green manure or in the fall if you’re hoping to get a winter-killed ground cover. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Till a plot in a sunny area with well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Till a plot in a sunny area with well-draining soil. If you only have a small garden plot, it’s still possible to grow oats. Remove all weeds from the area, and use a tiller or cultivator to till the soil and prepare it for planting . Oats prefer full sun and flourish in soil that has a pH between 4.5 and 6, so it helps to test the soil with a commercial pH probe or pH test strip before tilling. [2] X Research source Raise the soil’s pH by adding limestone to it, or lower the pH by adding a fertilizer that contains ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or urea. [3] X Research source Oats have a difficult time growing if they’re in a weed-infested area, so use a weeding tool (like a Cape Cod Weeder ) to loosen the soil around weeds and then pull them out of the ground one by one. When tilling, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions and push the tiller in parallel lines across the entire area you plan to use for planting. Then, push the tiller in lines that are perpendicular to the others. If you don’t have a tiller , rent one from a home improvement store or a lawn and garden equipment rental store."

      "content": "Lay the oat seeds 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) apart in evenly-spaced rows. Each row of dirt should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide with a 7.5–12 inches (19–30 cm) gap between the rows. Within each row, drop a seed onto the top of the soil every 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm). Continue doing this until you’ve filled the planting area completely. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Rake 1 inch (2.5 cm) of dirt over the seeds.",
      "content": "Rake 1 inch (2.5 cm) of dirt over the seeds. Lightly rake dirt over the seeds so birds or other pests don’t get to them before they can germinate. If you don’t have a rake on hand, try walking over each row of seeds to push them down. [5] X Research source If your soil has a high clay content, avoid walking over it, as it could become too compacted. Don’t walk over the soil when it’s wet, either. If your soil is wet or easily compacted, place a wooden board over it and walk across the board instead."

      "title": "Keep the soil continuously moist.",
      "content": "Keep the soil continuously moist. Oats require more moisture than most other grains. Stick your fingers about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so into the soil as often as possible to make sure that it doesn’t feel dry. When it does feel dry, water the oats to encourage them to thrive. [6] X Research source In general, watering is all you’ll need to do to care for the oats while they grow. They don’t typically need fertilizer."

      "title": "Weed the area once your oats start growing.",
      "content": "Weed the area once your oats start growing. In general, oats start to sprout within a few weeks and continue to grow for 80-110 days depending on the growing conditions. When you water your oats, check the area for weeds and remove any that have popped up. This will ensure that your oats continue to thrive and grow properly until it’s time to harvest.

      "title": "Harvest the oats when the seed heads are hard and dry.",
      "content": "Harvest the oats when the seed heads are hard and dry. This is typically about 12 weeks after planting. Gently touch the seed heads to see if they’re damp or dry. Once they’re dry to the touch, cut them off of the rest of the plant with garden shears , or simply snap them off with your hands. If you find they aren’t as dry as they should be after you’ve removed them, store them in a warm, dry area for a few days or weeks to cure. [8] X Research source Alternatively, use a scythe or sickle to cut the oats at the stalk, then tie them together in a bundle and store them in a greenhouse or shed to allow them to dry before removing the grain. This method may be better if you plan on using the oats for hay."

      "title": "Winnow the oats.",
      "content": "Winnow the oats. Winnowing refers to separating the grain from the seed heads. Once the seed heads are dry, place them into a bucket and shake it to crack them open. Then, pull the grains out by hand and discard the seed heads. Put the grain in another bucket or container so you don’t lose any. [9] X Research source There are a number of other ways to thresh the grains, including putting them in a pillowcase and beating them against a wall, or tossing the seed heads up in the wind."

      "title": "Why are my oats not growing?",
      "content": "Why are my oats not growing? Usually, too little water will stunt the growth of oats. This could eventually cause the plant to die if not taken care of, so it’s important to monitor how much water the plant receives. Stick your fingers about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the soil. If it’s dry, water the oats. [13] X Research source Be careful not to water the oats too much, however, as this could lead to rot. If the soil feels damp or wet when you stick your fingers in it, hold off on watering until it’s dry again."

      "title": "What do I do if pests are attacking the plant?",
      "content": "What do I do if pests are attacking the plant? Pests like armyworms and aphids often attack the leaves of oats and other plants. To prevent this, first knock them off by spraying the plants with jets of water. Then, spray the plants with neem oil to keep the pests from coming back. Stinkbugs and wireworms also like to attack young plants, so keep them away by removing weeds and other debris from the area. [14] X Research source Rotating your crops each year will also help keep pests at bay."

      "title": "How do I prevent diseases?",
      "content": "How do I prevent diseases? Most oat diseases are fungal and caused by overly damp conditions, so make sure you don’t water the plants too frequently. Diseases like anthracnose, crown rust, and powdery mildew can be prevented by growing your crops in a warm, dry area and practicing crop rotation. Barley yellow dwarf is a virus transmitted by aphids, so controlling the aphid population is the best defense. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Can you grow oats from oatmeal?",
      "content": "Can you grow oats from oatmeal? Oats can only be propagated from whole oat seeds. Oatmeal is made from oats that have been steamed, ground, rolled, or steel-cut. Because these oats have been processed and roasted, they won’t grow new oats if you plant them. [17] X Research source If you’re not sure where to buy oat seeds, check your local livestock feed store."

      "title": "Can you grow oats in containers?",
      "content": "Can you grow oats in containers? If you don’t want to harvest a lot of oats, it’s technically possible to grow them in containers. Plant 3-5 seeds in a 6 in (15.24 cm) pot, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. Water only when the soil is dry, and add a little fertilizer after about a month. Make sure the oats get plenty of direct sunlight. [19] X Research source"
