The tail should be in the back on the right side, while the working yarn should be in the front towards your palm. [3] X Research source Note that this is very similar to the standard magic ring, but many prefer the double ring for projects that will see a little more action since a double magic ring provides greater durability. You should wrap the loop around the first two fingers on your non-dominant hand ."

Even though you will be creating a double ring, you only need to create a single loop on the crochet hook. The \"double\" portion mainly results from the double loop you made at the beginning of the process. Much of the remaining steps are similar to those you would use for a standard magic ring."
