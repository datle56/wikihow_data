      "content": "6666 could be a sign to worry less about money. It’s hard not to worry about money when you’re living paycheck to paycheck, but the truth is worrying won’t help the situation, either. Remember, 6666 is all about facing your problems and overcoming them, and that applies to your financial well-being too: instead of worrying about what’s to come, dive into action. Ask yourself how you can improve your financial standing, and work to make it happen. You might be wondering, if 6666 is a number of balance and equilibrium, why your finances are so un balanced! (You and us both, pal!) But 6666 may actually refer to the lack of balance in your focus : in other words, it may be a sign that you need to worry less about your finances than you currently are. Where is a more productive area to direct your attention? Maybe this is your nudge to change careers , to alter your spending habits , or to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for some financial support. Maybe it’s just a sign to try to release some of your financial anxiety and smell the roses, even if only for a moment."
