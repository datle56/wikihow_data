      "title": "Check the plant to see if it’s both green and purple.",
      "content": "Check the plant to see if it’s both green and purple. Examine the top and middle sections of the stem to confirm that the plant is green throughout. After this, check toward the roots of the plant to see if the lower stem looks purple or reddish-purple. If the plant doesn’t change colors at all, then it might not be sweetgrass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for clusters of yellow-green spikelets or flowers.",
      "content": "Look for clusters of yellow-green spikelets or flowers. Like the majority of the stem, some spikelets might look green, or have a yellowish on the ends. You may also see bronze spikelets or white flowers growing from the sweetgrass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the roots to see if they’re white.",
      "content": "Examine the roots to see if they’re white. Tug on the grass to uproot it completely. Look at any offshoots or roots growing from the basis of the plant and see if they’re white. If they’re some other color, there’s a chance that the plant isn’t sweetgrass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study the leaves to see if they’re reflective and tinted red.",
      "content": "Study the leaves to see if they’re reflective and tinted red. Look at the leaves in the sunlight, or shine an artificial light on them. In the light, the leaf blades will look shiny and glossy. You may notice shades of red along the ends of the blades as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Touch the leaves to see if they feel rough.",
      "content": "Touch the leaves to see if they feel rough. Look for long, green leaf blades leaves growing from the bottom of the sweetgrass. These leaves don’t have any fuzz or hair, but instead feel a bit rough around the edges. In many cases, sweetgrass leaves can be as long as 12 to 24 in (30 to 61 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Measure the plants to see if they’re shorter than 3 ft (91 cm).",
      "content": "Measure the plants to see if they’re shorter than 3 ft (91 cm). Use a yardstick or tape to measure the potential sweetgrass from the roots to the tallest leaf or spikelet. Note that most plants grow to be about 30 in (76 cm) high. As a grass, sweetgrass tends to grow in groups."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the branches to see if they’re short.",
      "content": "Look at the branches to see if they’re short. Unlike lawn grass, note that sweetgrass has spikelets, or flowering buds sticking off the sides. On average, this section of the plant tends to be around 1.6-3.5 (4-9 cm) long, with 3 buds growing from each spikelet."

      "title": "Find this plant in most of the US and Canada.",
      "content": "Find this plant in most of the US and Canada. Note that sweetgrass is native to many northern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern, northwestern, western, and southwestern states, as well as all of Canada. If you live in the southern US, there’s a good chance that won’t find any sweetgrass around. [1] X Research source For instance, sweetgrass isn’t native to states like Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, or Florida. You can also find sweetgrass in some sections of Iceland, northern Eurasia, and Greenland. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Search in wet, partially shaded areas for sweetgrass.",
      "content": "Search in wet, partially shaded areas for sweetgrass. Note that sweetgrass thrives in moist, watery environments, and you can likely find it near marshes, wet meadows, lakeshores, bogs, and other wet places. Its exact location will ultimately depend on the area you’re searching in. [3] X Research source Sweetgrass can also grow near the ocean."

      "title": "Check to see if the plant is blooming between May and July.",
      "content": "Check to see if the plant is blooming between May and July. Keep in mind that sweetgrass plants tend to flower earlier than other plants, so you might see this plant before you see other flowers and trees growing. Note that sweetgrass most consistently blooms in the summer months. [5] X Research source #* Sweetgrass is used in certain crafts and medicinal items, and it tends to look brownish after it dries.
