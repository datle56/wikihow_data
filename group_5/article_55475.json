      "content": "Attach hooks to the top of your door for easy installation. Purchase 5 to 6 wall hooks that have sticky backings. Place them about 1 foot (0.30 m) apart from each other on the wall above your door. Hang your garland on the hooks and let the ends frame the outside of your front door. [2] X Research source Hooks with adhesive backings work well on wooden walls, but they won’t do well on brick or stone. They also may fall off in hot or humid climates.

      "content": "Hammer nails into the spaces between stones in a stone wall. Choose nails that are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Use a hammer to push them into the spaces in between the stones in your wall that surround your door. Try to put the nails about 1 foot (0.30 m) apart, but add them wherever they will fit in with your stones. Hang your garland on the nails and let the ends frame your door.

      "content": "Use brick clips to hang your garland on your brick wall. Brick clips are metal clips that fit vertically over your brick without creating any holes or marks. Hold your brick clip vertically and attach it around a single brick above your door. Make sure it clicks into place so that it will support the weight of your garland. Use 5 to 6 brick clips spaced about 6 inches (15 cm) apart to span the width of your door. Hang your garland off of your brick clips and let the ends drape around your front door.
