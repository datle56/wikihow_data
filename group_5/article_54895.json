      "content": "Go into the ocean. To swim in Animal Crossing , you'll need to obtain a wetsuit from Nook's Cranny for 3,000 Bells. [1] X Research source You can also purchase a wetsuit using Nook Shopping in your NookPhone, or you can redeem a wetsuit in the ABD machine in Resident Services.

      "title": "Look for small black shadows.",
      "content": "Look for small black shadows. These little shadows indicate something underwater. You'll see different shadow sizes; these represent different sea creatures. Pearls will always be a small shadow, a little bigger than the size of your character's hand. You'll also see bubbles beside the shadow. The bubble patterns of pearls tend to be more straight than zigzag. Additionally, the bubble speed of pearls will be very slow compared to sea creatures ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press Y to dive underwater.",
      "content": "Press Y to dive underwater. Make sure your character is just above the shadow when you dive. Once your character touches the shadow, the item will automatically be picked up. As pearls are rare, it's very likely you'll pick up small sea creatures many times before getting a pearl. If the shadow moves, swim faster by tapping A to catch up to it. If you dive for medium shadows, you may catch a Scallop. In some cases, the otter Pascal will ask for the Scallop in exchange for a pearl, a DIY recipe for the Mermaid set, or an outfit piece from the Mermaid set."
