      "content": "\"Glazing\" basically means sucking up to someone. Have you ever thought you could impress the socks off someone just by giving them a million compliments? If so, you were probably glazing them. Glazing is different from flirting because glazing doesn’t have to apply to a romantic interest—it can be used on virtually anyone you’re trying to win over for whatever reason. Glazing can be both a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the situation it’s being used in. For example, someone may get made fun of by their friends for trying to “glaze” their teacher in order to get an A, while someone else may get high-fives for glazing and winning over a girl they like.

      "content": "Say “glazing” when someone is over-complimenting someone else. Whether a person is trying to rizz someone up or persuade their parents to let them go to that Friday night concert, glazing can be used in lots of different scenarios. It’s typically used with a negative connotation because glazing is so over-the-top that it might come off as insincere or phony. To use the word in the past tense, you’d say “glazed.” Example: “I can’t fail this class again—I really need to try and glaze Mrs. Jones for that A.” Example: “I saw Billy glazing his parents at the mall and trying to get a PS5, I think it was working!” Example: “She can glaze that boy in her calculus class all she wants, but he’s clearly not into her.” Example: \"This girl just glazed me with all of these compliments and asked for my number.\""

      "content": "TikTok is famous for its slang. Understanding these words and what they mean may help you enjoy the app a bit more. Some of these slang terms include: Bussin : \"Bussin” was born when Janelle Rohner used it to describe her creation of \"nature's cereal\"—a dish made with berries, coconut water, and ice cubes. Now, it refers to anything that is really good, especially food. [6] X Research source Cap: Cap is another word for lie. So, when you tell someone they’re “capping,” you’re saying they aren’t telling the truth. On the other hand, “no cap” means you’re being truthful. Caught in 4K : Being “caught in 4K” means you've been caught red-handed with something. 4K video is high-resolution, so when something is “4K,” it’s pretty obvious and clear. [7] X Research source Cheugy: This describes something that is not quite uncool, but also not fully cool. Usually, people who are cheugy are trying a bit too hard, and many Gen Zers think of Millenials as “cheugy.” [8] X Research source Dead: When someone says “I’m dead,” it just means something was so funny that it almost killed them with laughter. [9] X Research source Fire: “Fire” is a simple way of saying something is amazing. Maybe you just ate at an incredible new restaurant or bought a cool new shirt—you could describe either one as “fire.” It’s Giving: “It’s giving” means something is doing what it’s supposed to do and more! This may apply to an outfit, food, or a makeup look. For example, when someone looks great, you might say, \"Girl, you are giving today!\" Karen : You’ve probably heard Karen used quite a bit, but if you’re unfamiliar with the term, it’s describing a woman who is seen as bossy, demanding, or impatient. Many people associate a “Karen” with the type of woman to ask to speak to a manager when even the slightest thing isn’t going her way. Mid: “Mid” is a way of saying something is average. Short for “middle,” mid is used when something is just “meh.” It’s not really good and it’s not really bad. Pick Me Girl : The \"pick me girl\" is someone who tries to gain the attention of men by going above and beyond to seem as if she’s “not like the other girls.” She may pretend to like sports, comics, Star Wars , or anything that might make her seem cool in the eyes of a guy. She likely often puts down other women for enjoying common female interests like makeup, hair, or nails. [10] X Research source Rent Free: When something lives “rent free” in your mind, it means it’s something that you think about all the time. If you enjoy watching silly videos of cats and do it often, you might say, “Cat videos live rent-free in my mind.” Rizz : The term \"rizz\" refers to someone's ability to charm and attract women, commonly known as their \"game.\" Vibe Check: When something or someone passes the “vibe check,” it means they fit the mood. For example, if you throw an 80s-themed party and somebody shows up wearing leg warmers, you could tell them they passed the vibe check."
