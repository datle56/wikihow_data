      "content": "Use credit reporting to collect bad debts. Most people do not want a negative report on their credit history.

      "content": "Negotiate with removal of a bad credit entry. Another tactic to try in collecting payment is to report the bad debt to the credit agencies, and then offer to remove it if the debt is paid within a specific time period. Be sure that the debt is reported to all three bureaus, as an unreported debt will not show up on a bureau's credit report if that credit bureau does not have a record of it."

      "title": "Hire a collection agency.",
      "content": "Hire a collection agency. This is one of your options if you are not a large lender, but rather a small-volume creditor with only a few unpaid debts from customers. Collection agencies attempt to collect the debt owed to you. If they cannot collect, they report the default account to the three credit bureaus in their name. Therefore, using a collection agency is an indirect way of reporting to the credit bureau agencies."

      "title": "Choose a collection agency carefully.",
      "content": "Choose a collection agency carefully. Do a search for collection agencies in the phonebook or online. Shop around for the best price.

Collection agencies typically offer a discount for payment that may be substantial (50% or more). Be aware that you may be liable to the consumer if the collector violates the federal and state laws regulating the collection of a debt."
