      "content": "This can help you control any problem areas. Think of these pieces as underwear that offers a little more support. You can find shapewear that smooths, lifts, and firms any parts of your body that you aren’t fond of. [1] X Research source For example, if you have a bit of a belly, look for a camisole or bodysuit with extra tummy control. You can slim your legs with control tights or shorts."

      "content": "Different body shapes look best in different types of clothing. To flatter your body, focus on drawing attention to your favorite or thinnest part, whether it’s your waist if you have an hourglass figure or your legs if you’re more apple-shaped. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "This draws the eye to your thinnest section and away from problem spots.",
      "content": "This draws the eye to your thinnest section and away from problem spots. For example, if you have slim legs, wear bright-colored pants or a skirt in a bold pattern. Avoid wearing big prints in areas that you don't want to draw attention to. For instance, if you are self-conscious about your stomach, don't wear a shirt with a large floral pattern. Vertical stripes are a very slimming pattern. Horizontal stripes, on the other hand, tend to make you appear wider."

      "title": "Wearing 1 color creates an uninterrupted line down your body.",
      "content": "Wearing 1 color creates an uninterrupted line down your body. This, in turn, makes you look taller and leaner. And dark hues hide any shadows that are caused by unsightly lumps or bumps. Black in particular is a very slimming hue. Slip on a deep navy dress with matching dark pump or tuck a black shirt into black pants, for example. You can also wear dark colors just in your problem areas. If you think your legs are chubby, for instance, wear black trousers. Avoid wearing contrasting colors on the top and bottom if you dislike your waist, as it draws attention to your middle. For instance, don’t pair dark jeans with a bright white sweater."

      "title": "Anything baggy or oversized adds instant weight to your frame.",
      "content": "Anything baggy or oversized adds instant weight to your frame. That applies to chunky fabrics, too, like corduroy, heavy wool, and flannel. Stick to figure-flattering clothes in lighter materials that fit your body properly. [3] X Research source The most slimming fabrics are not only comfortable, they also have a little shape or stretch to them. These include jersey, cashmere, wool rayon, or anything with a fine ribbed texture. Don’t go too far in the opposite direction and wear head-to-toe skin tight clothing. That is equally unflattering. Find a balance between too big and too tight."

      "title": "This helps to elongate your legs.",
      "content": "This helps to elongate your legs. You can wear heels with anything from an elegant dress to a pair of casual jeans. The extra height gives the illusion of slimness. Heels also instantly improve your posture, making you look even thinner. [4] X Research source To add a few more inches to your legs, choose a pair of pointed-toe heels in a nude color that matches your skin tone. It doesn’t matter how high the heels are. Even a 1 in (2.5 cm) heel will have an effect."

      "title": "This helps make your waist look narrower.",
      "content": "This helps make your waist look narrower. Placing a belt around the thinnest part of your midsection cinches your waist, creating an hourglass figure. You can also pile on long necklaces, which lengthen both your torso and neck. Avoid wearing chokers. They cut off your neck and make your upper half appear thicker. You can use a belt with almost any outfit, like on a shift dress, over a jacket, or with a pair of high waist pants. For most people, the thinnest part of your waist is just above your belly button."

      "title": "An all-over bronze glow makes you look leaner and more toned.",
      "content": "An all-over bronze glow makes you look leaner and more toned. Take it a step further by using more tanning lotion in certain areas, like along your quadricep or calf muscle, to create the illusion of ripped muscles. [5] X Research source You can also use fake tanner along the lines of your obliques to give off the appearance of abs. Follow the application directions on the package. Don’t try to rush the process or apply multiple coats at once or you could end up with streaks of an orange color. For the best results, get an airbrush tan from a professional. They know exactly where to spray the tanner and what shade will go best with your skin tone."

      "title": "Blush helps highlight your cheekbones.",
      "content": "Blush helps highlight your cheekbones. To give your face that supermodel-esque structure, use a makeup brush to swipe blush under your cheekbones from just about the corners of your mouth up to your ear. Blend any harsh strokes with a beauty sponge. [6] X Research source Choose a blush that’s more brown than red. Red can make your face look rounder. If you aren’t sure where your cheekbones are, suck in your cheeks and you’ll be able to feel the bones. Apply the blush to the hollow area formed when sucking in."

      "title": "This can help your face look thinner.",
      "content": "This can help your face look thinner. You'll need 1 foundation that's slightly darker than your skin tone and 1 that's lighter. Swipe the darker foundation along your temples if you have a round face or down the sides of your nose to slim it. Apply the lighter foundation under your eyes, on the center of your forehead, and on the bridge of your nose. [7] X Research source Use a makeup sponge or brush to blend the foundations into your face so they look natural and not streaky. When picking your lighter and darker foundations, choose ones that are within 2 to 3 shades of your natural shade. Watch video tutorials online for a step-by-step guide to contouring correctly."

      "content": "Never keep your arms against your body in a photo. Place your hand in a natural position on your hip to create negative space and slim out both your arm and waist. [8] X Research source If you’re in a picture with other people, stand on one of the outer edges since the person on the outside can put their hand on their hip without blocking anyone else. For a more subtle pose, pull your elbow away from your body ever so slightly so it’s not pressed against your side."

      "title": "This will also elongate your neck.",
      "content": "This will also elongate your neck. Instead of pulling your chin in towards you, push it out a little bit and then tilt it slightly down so it looks natural. Tilting your head to side just a tad can also prevent chin rolls. Avoid sticking your chin out too far or high, or you’ll look like a turtle."

      "title": "This can make you look wide.",
      "content": "This can make you look wide. A better option is to stand at a slight angle, or even fully to the side. That will capture your body at a narrower point instead of at its widest, which is straight-on. [9] X Research source When you’re taking a group photo, have everyone angle in towards the center. Standing at an angle is a perfect opportunity to put your hand on your hip, too, to lean out your arm. Test out different angles to find out which one works best for you."

      "content": "Good posture is one of the oldest tricks in the book for looking skinny. Stand up straight, roll your shoulders back, and keep your back straight to fully elongate your spine. [10] X Research source To pull back your shoulders, imagine you're trying to squeeze a lemon between your shoulder blades. Push your chest out slightly if you want to draw attention to your collarbone. Another trick is to lean forward just a little bit, pushing your hips back. This makes your upper half slightly bigger than your lower half, instantly making your legs look thinner."

      "title": "This will help you appear leaner.",
      "content": "This will help you appear leaner. Hold the camera at any height that’s above your eye line. This slims your body and face, since it distorts the depth perception. [11] X Research source If you’re taking a selfie, stretch out your arm as far as it will go and hold your camera or phone up above your head. Don’t take pictures at an angle lower than eye level. These shots will make you look wider."
