      "content": "Pick your spot. You must pick a burial ground that leaves you a window of time alone and out of sight in which you will bury your package. This window of time must be no less than an hour (longer if the package is large), and occurring at least once a week. Why? Because if you get into some hot water and need to retrieve the package as soon as possible, you don't want to have to wait around for a month until you can dig it up unseen. Tips for picking a spot include: Make sure your spot isn't scheduled for construction or anything that might cause it to be built upon, dug into, or otherwise obstructed from your ever getting to it. A few examples of badly chosen terrain might be: an empty lot, a spot near a water main, a spot close to a public road or a playground/school. The spot must have ground that is easy enough to dig with a shovel. You don't want to be spending all night digging, and the use of large digging machines isn't conducive to secrecy! The spot must be easily found again without the use of a map. You should be able to find the spot in the darkness and completely by memory. Also, should the situation arise where you need to verbally convey to someone where your package is so that they might retrieve it (i.e. through a pane of plexiglass at a police station), you'll need to be quick and precise in your description. Don't pick a spot where your package might be moved by natural forces. A beach might not be the best idea as sand is moved to and fro on a daily basis. The same thing goes for a swamp. (Although you don't have to worry about moisture because your package will be more than watertight, as you'll read below) Don't pick an obvious spot. If somebody is searching for your package they should not be able to find it in your backyard. Pick a spot that has no ties to you or your family, friends, accomplices, etc."

      "title": "Construct your package.",
      "content": "Construct your package. Your package must meet three requirements: a) Watertight, b) Structurally sound, and c) as compact as possible. Do not use anything metal, such as screws or metal products. Robbers who may use metal detectors can easily locate your valuables through the detector. The following steps will show you how to create your package: First, take your object and put it into a heavy duty garbage bag. Use duct or packaging tape to completely cover the package two times over. This is the first step to ensure water tightness. Repeat three times for a total of four garbage bag/tape jobs. Your package is now watertight. Measure your now watertight package and construct a wooden box using wood panels one inches thick. Make certain your package will fit snugly inside of the box, so as to avoid creating a box bigger than necessary. Insert your package into the wooden box and repeat the garbage bag/tape job two times for good measure. You now have a watertight, structurally solid package that will last many years under the earth!"

      "title": "Bury your package.",
      "content": "Bury your package. During your window of burying opportunity, sneak to your chosen destination and dig. Dig fast and dig true; don't dig the hole any wider than is required, as you will be wasting time and energy. For maximum security, it is recommended that you bury your package no less than 2 1/2 - 3 feet deep. It will take more time and effort, but your peace of mind over the years to come will be well worth it. Once your hole has been dug, place your package into it and cover it with a layer of good-size rocks. Spray some pepper spray or Mace into the hole. This will deter any animals from potentially smelling something interesting and digging up your package. In thirds, fill the hole with dirt, step into it and compress the dirt with your feet (so as to avoid a sinkhole in the following weeks), and use the pepper/mace spray. Repeat until the hole is full."

      "content": "Don't touch it. Leave your package alone until you are ready to retrieve it. Don't check on it, don't poke at it. View it from afar if you have to, but don't go near it. If for some reason you do need to dig it up, don't put it back in the same spot. You've taken a big enough chance getting it into the ground the first time. Another attempt doubles your chances of detection."
