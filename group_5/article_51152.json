Some potential combinations are Quarrister and Clamble , Thumpies , PomPom , or Reedling . [1] X Research source This is also the best combination if you're trying to breed a Rare Humbug unless you already have a Humbug. [2] X Research source There is about a 1% chance of successfully breeding a Humbug. If you breed for a Humbug 70 times, you have about a 50% chance of successfully breeding one. If you do 690 breeding attempts, you will have a 99.9% chance of getting at least one Humbug. During a Breeding Bonanza, this chance is increased to 500% to 1000%. [3] X Research source"

The best choices to breed with Quarrister are Clamble, Thumpies, PomPom, and Reedling."
