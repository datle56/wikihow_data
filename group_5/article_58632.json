      "content": "Purchase a printer capable of printing high resolution photos and graphics. Not all devices are made equally in terms of print quality, and a printer's performance is most often reflected in its price. Review the device specifications prior to purchasing an inkjet printer. Choose a printer model that provides 48-bit color support and an optical scan resolution of at least 2,400 dots-per-inch (dpi) for the best results. Read and compare the product reviews for several different devices to help determine which inkjet printer will produce the best quality images and photos."

      "content": "Follow the inkjet printer maintenance and care instructions as directed by the manufacturer. Directions for performing scheduled maintenance can be found in the user's manual included with the printer at the time of purchase. Tasks, such as head cleaning and printer alignment, typically can be implemented from the device's control panel. Adhere to the recommended maintenance on an inkjet printer, as directed by the manufacturer. Blocked nozzles and clogged printer heads are a common source of issues with inkjet printers and can compromise print quality. Turn off the device when not in use. Leaving the device turned on exposes the printer heads to dust particles and debris, which can degrade the quality of images printed from an inkjet printer. Confirm that the latest device drivers and firmware updates are installed on the printer. These updates usually can be downloaded free of charge from the printer manufacturer's website. Save high-quality photo ink cartridges for use only when printing images and graphics to reduce wear and tear on the print heads. Ink cartridges tend to be fragile and can damage easily."
