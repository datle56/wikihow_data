If you’re dealing with a flood or a burst pipe, move onto the next step. Check underneath the carpet to make sure the carpet padding and the floor aren't sopping wet. If the carpet is only slightly damp, sprinkle baking soda over the area, then let it sit for 24 hours to let it soak up any moisture. Then, vacuum the baking soda up."

The wet vacuum cleaner removes water from the carpet itself, but it may not be able to remove it from the padding if the water has wicked through the carpet backing or soaked in under the edges. Keep an eye on the fill tank and make sure you dump it before hitting overflow. Depending on the amount of water in the carpet, you may have to dump the tank several times."

Open the windows and use a dehumidifier to dry out the area as quickly as possible. Again, check underneath the carpet to make sure that the floor and carpet padding are not still sopping wet. Try to create a \"vortex\" around the wet area. For example, you might take 3 fans and arrange them in a triangle around the wet area, all blowing outside of center instead of directly across the wet area. You could also rent air movers and professional dehumidifiers from a big box store. [4] X Expert Source Andrew Rohr Carpet Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 April 2021.

Try to dry the pad without removing the carpet, especially if the pad seems to have only gotten a little damp and the subfloor seems dry. Keep the corner or side of the carpet that you have lifted raised and use an industrial fan to blow air under the carpet onto the pad. Turn up the heat and open the windows to aid in the drying. Use a dehumidifier to dry the carpet out even faster. Attach a vacuum hose (for vacuuming up wet things) to the exhaust of a vacuum, then put the hose under the carpet, placing the carpet back over the hose. The hot air will cause the carpet to float over the pad and speed up the drying process."
