The arm should move smoothly. If it is difficult to move, ensure the springs of the arm are not damaged or missing. If the arm is undamaged but doesn't move properly, you will need to replace the solenoid. Remove the connecting wires with needle-nosed pliers and label them. Use a screwdriver to take out the screws and change the bad solenoid."

You should also inspect the selector switch, timer motor and heating element for the correct continuity. Test the bimetal terminal assembly last. Check the spray arm outlet holes to see if they are full of debris (e.g. plastic container labels etc). You may need to remove these and use a garden hose and/or a high pressure washer to force the debris out of them. Also check that your debris filters at the bottom of the unit are seated properly. Some may warp due to a heating coil close by. You may need to replace any that have warped. [15] X Research source"
