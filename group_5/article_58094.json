      "content": "Fear of intimacy usually stems from negative childhood experiences. These experiences deeply affect children and oftentimes they’re traumatic in nature (although not always). Regardless of the level of trauma, the end result is the same: the victim’s ability to trust is damaged. Trust is crucial part of creating intimacy, which is why the victim ends up feeling afraid if they start getting close to someone. [1] X Research source Some of the most common causes include: Physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in childhood Rape or intimate partner violence/abuse Past failed relationships Negative attitudes inherited from parents Fear of abandonment Low self-esteem Depression and/or anxiety disorder [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Withholding affection or feeling indifferent to it. Do you often find yourself shutting down or tuning out the world around you? The present moment always feels raw, real, and intimate, and these feelings may prompt you to shut down. If you catch yourself shutting down when you’re interacting with a partner or friend, gently remind yourself to really pay attention to what’s happening. Slow down and live in the moment. Look into their eyes, listen to their words, and feel their warm hand on your arm. [3] X Research source Mindfulness is hard for everyone at first, so don’t get discouraged! Just keep at it and it will slowly but surely become second nature. You can also try other mindfulness techniques like meditation and yoga."

      "content": "Difficulty sharing feelings and expressing needs. People who fear intimacy often dismiss or repress their emotional needs in order to protect themselves. It’s easier to shut down completely and tell ourselves we don’t need anyone, but in reality, we do. If you want to build intimacy, speak up when you need something. Admit to your loved ones that you’re struggling and be honest if you need help. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, “Robert, I’m really struggling with something that happened at work today. I really need to talk about it with someone. Are you free?” Try to remember that leaning on other people doesn’t make you weak."

      "content": "Inability to form close relationships. [5] X Research source People who struggle with a fear of intimacy often throw themselves into other things as a way to isolate themselves from intimate situations. If this sounds familiar, you can work on breaking this pattern. Prioritize the relationships in your life and challenge yourself to put relationships before work, school, and projects. For example: If your mother invites you to lunch, don’t use work or school as an easy way to blow her off. Take a lunch break and go meet up with her. If your boyfriend wants to come over but you’re tempted to tell him you’re busy, gently remind yourself that you’re just reading a novel. You aren’t really “busy.” Try spending time with friends who are comfortable with emotional intimacy. They can model what real emotional intimacy looks like, and help you feel more safe and comfortable being vulnerable.

      "content": "Being emotionally guarded or disconnected from emotions. Do you often find yourself ignoring or glossing over your feelings? Emotions can be scary and uncomfortable, but a big part of overcoming a fear of intimacy is learning to verbalize your feelings. When you feel something, give it a name. Say what you’re feeling out loud. Define it. You may feel vulnerable at first, but doing this can actually help you regain a sense of control. [7] X Research source For example, if your girlfriend hugs you and you feel yourself tense up, think about the feeling behind that instinct. Are you feeling vulnerable? Anxious? Agitated? Sit with the feeling for a moment. Ignoring or repressing your feelings is a habit that you can break. Honest self-expression is the first step."

Reflecting on painful experiences is uncomfortable for everyone, especially those who’ve experienced trauma.

[9] X Expert Source Donna Novak, Psy.D Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 8 December 2020. Fear tends to take control of our thoughts and dictate our inner-narrative, but we can actively change that. Make it a point to pay attention to your thoughts during the day.

      "title": "Communicate openly with your partner.",
      "content": "Communicate openly with your partner. Being vulnerable is hard, but help your partner understand what’s going on. Your first instinct is probably to push your partner away and repress your emotions. For people who fear intimacy, this is a common reaction. Remember: fear drives this instinct. You don’t have to say anything until you’re ready, but once you are, bring up your fears in a calm, low-pressure environment, like when you’re relaxing together at home. Try to explain what you're feeling and why. [11] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I put up emotional walls with you because that’s how I learned to deal with my parents’ neglect as a child. It’s a deeply ingrained habit and I know I need to face that.” You could say, “I freeze up when you hug me because of childhood abuse. My dad would hug me after he beat me, which was very confusing. Whenever someone hugs me, my mind automatically goes back to those memories.\""
