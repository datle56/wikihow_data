Use a stiff nylon brush to brush away the particularly pesky residue that won't come off with the putty knife. Once you've brushed and scraped away all the caulk, wipe down the surface with a soapy cloth. [1] X Research source Let the surface air dry when you’re done. Goo Gone is the most widely-recognized and respected caulk remover brand, but there are generic versions out there that should work as well. Anything that reads “caulk remover” will do the trick."

[3] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Avoid using this method on softer surfaces, like wood, as the sharp utility knife may scratch the wood's surface. A plastic razor blade is also a good option, especially since it's less likely to scratch anything. [4] X Expert Source Emily Fazio Home Improvement & DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021."

Apply the substance to the caulk residue and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Then, wipe up the substance from the surface along with the residue. [8] X Research source Since white vinegar is so gentle, it may take a few rounds before it removes all of the residue."

      "content": "WD-40 is a lubricant that can easily break down silicone caulk. First, clean the area with soap and water so that the WD-40 will be able to properly adhere to the residue. Let it dry and put on gloves. Then, use the straw on your can of WD-40 to thoroughly spray down the caulk residue. Let it soak for 2-5 minutes and then use a putty knife to scrape off the remaining residue. [11] X Research source If the residue is old or particularly thick, you may have to repeat this process a few times. Re-clean the surface with soap and water before each reapplication of WD-40."

      "content": "Use spirits for silicone caulk on concrete, marble, or porcelain. Put gloves on. Then, apply mineral spirits to a scrubbing pad and wipe down the caulk residue. If the residue is on plastic, use a rag soaked in mineral spirits instead. After you've wiped down the area, use a wet cloth to clean off the remaining residue and solvent. [12] X Research source Mineral spirits, also known as white spirits, are a common alternative for paint thinner. Do not use spirits on painted surfaces—you’ll strip the color. Wash your hands thoroughly when you’re done if you get any spirits on your skin. Mineral spirits can irritate your skin if you don’t rinse off."

      "content": "This is best for polyurethane caulk on glass and unpainted wood. Dampen a cloth with water and wring the excess out. Apply pure acetone to the cloth and wipe down the caulk residue. This will soften the residue so that you can wear away the residue with the cloth. Avoid using this substance on painted wood, as it can strip the paint off of the wood. [13] X Research source Feel free to use a putty knife instead of a cloth if you can’t get the residue up."

      "content": "Baby oil and body lotion are both great for removing latex safely from wood. Wood is sensitive to damage, so don’t break out the harsher solvents. Use a putty knife or a spatula to remove as much residue as you can. Then, use a blow dryer to heat up and soften the remaining residue. Finally, rub either baby oil or body lotion on the caulk for 5 minutes or until it has softened up. Remove the residue with your putty knife or your spatula and you’re done. [15] X Research source White vinegar is also gentle enough to use on wood. You may want to avoid getting the wood wet if you want to avoid swelling or water damage."
