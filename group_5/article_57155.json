      "title": "Clean and dry a small glass bottle.",
      "content": "Clean and dry a small glass bottle. To hold your homemade cuticle oil, you’ll need a small glass bottle that’s approximately the size of a nail polish container. Rinse the bottle out well with water to ensure that it’s clean, and then allow it to dry upside for a couple of hours to ensure there’s no excess moisture inside. [1] X Research source A bottle with a medicine dropper top is a good option for the oil because it makes it easy to apply a small amount. A bottle with a roller ball top also works well for the oil."

      "content": "Combine the lavender oil, eucalyptus, grapefruit, peppermint, and olive oils in the bottle. When the bottle is dry, add 15 drops of lavender essential oil, 10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil, 10 drops of grapefruit essential oil, 5 drops of peppermint essential oil, and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of extra virgin olive oil to it. Close the bottle and shake gently to mix the oils slightly. [2] X Research source Lavender essential oil is very moisturizing, but it also has antibacterial properties that can ward off bacteria that might infect the cuticles. Eucalyptus, grapefruit, and peppermint essential oils have antifungal properties, so they can help keep your nails healthy. Extra virgin olive oil easily penetrates the skin, so it moisturizes and softens cuticles very effectively."

      "content": "Pour the oil into a small bottle. When the oils are fully mixed, carefully transfer it to a small glass bottle. It’s best to use a dark colored bottle because it will keep the essential oils from breaking down. [6] X Research source A very small kitchen funnel with a diameter of about 2-inches (5-cm) can make pouring the oil into the bottle much easier. Look for a bottle with a medicine dropper top so you can apply just a little of the oil at a time."

      "title": "Clean out a nail polish bottle.",
      "content": "Clean out a nail polish bottle. A glass nail polish bottle is an ideal container for the oil because the attached brush allows for easier application. To clean out an old nail polish container, fill it with nail polish remover and allow it to sit for 30 minutes to an hour to dissolve any polish at the bottom. [8] X Research source After the polish bottle is clean, dump out the nail polish remover into another container for disposal and bring it to your local hazardous waste facility to get rid of it. You can also use a small glass bottle with a medicine dropper or roller ball to hold the oil."
