If you have a deadbolt, knob, or lever, make sure it’s in the locked position. Prop the door open with a large object so you won’t get locked out while rekeying the lock. [1] X Research source Consider leaving another entrance into your home open or unlocked so you have a way to get inside if the door closes accidentally."

You may feel the tool click inside the lock. When the tool is all the way in, remove the SmartKey along with the current key. [3] X Research source If you’ve lost the SmartKey, you can purchase a SmartKey Re-Key Lock Kit , which includes a new one. The keyhole will stay locked in the 90-degree position.

Fully insert the new key into the lock so the edge touches the indent in the face of the cylinder (the piece of the knob or lever that holds the lock). [5] X Research source Rotate the key back to the upright starting position, then rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise. Try to pull the key out of the lock. [6] X Research source If the key doesn’t come out, you’ve successfully rekeyed your lock. Rotate it counterclockwise 90 degrees and pull it out. If the key does pull out, rekeying was not successful. Insert the SmartKey firmly in the small hole, then remove it. Repeat this step once again. If the key still pulls out, contact Kwikset customer service for assistance at 1-800-327-5625 or submit a general inquiry ."

      "content": "Insert each cut of your new key into a key gauge to find its combination. Purchase a Kwikset Re-Keying Kit , which comes with a key gauge. Insert the key in the “0” hole so the first divot, or cut, is directly under the measurement. Slide the key down the gauge until it stops. The number above the key is the first number in the code. Repeat with the other 4 cuts on the key. [7] X Research source If the cut is between 2 numbers on the gauge, go with the number to the key’s right side. Start with the cut closest to the “bow end,” or part of the key you hold when inserting it into a lock. Move down the key until you reach the last cut. Write down all 5 numbers in order—once you disassemble the lock, you will pick the tumblers that match and insert them into the key mechanism. These Kwikset locks work by matching the cuts on the key with the tumblers inside. To rekey the lock, measure the cuts on the key so you can reset the tumblers inside to match. [8] X Research source"

To do this, gently twist and pull on the round plate on the inside of the door until it slides back. On one side under the plate, there will be a small metal arrow switch. Insert a screwdriver above the switch and gently push it down. [9] X Research source If the knob is already off the door, skip this step and the next 2 steps.

Locate the two screws on either side of the locking plate and unscrew them until you can rotate the plate and remove it.

Optionally, unscrew the latch for the door once the knob is removed. However, it isn’t necessary to rekey your lock."

[26] X Research source For example, if the combination you wrote down is “2 4 4 3 2,” place a “2” pin in the hole closest to the bow end of the key. Place a “4” pin next, then another “4,” and so on. Place the pins in the set of holes that’s flush with the top of the plug and the key. The “bow end” of the key is the large portion you hold that sticks out from the lock.

[35] X Research source However, the cost may be more or less depending on the type of lock and the number of locks that you’d like to be rekeyed. Rekeying a regular Kwikset lock yourself can cost around $70 for the Kwikset Re-Keying Kit. Rekeying a SmartKey Security lock yourself is free unless you don’t have the SmartKey. In that case, you’ll have to buy Kwikset’s Re-Key Lock Kit, which costs around $12."
