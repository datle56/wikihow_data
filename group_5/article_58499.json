Unfortunately, this could give them false hope that you might change your mind—or just leave them feeling confused about whether you’re interested or not. Send a message that’s as clear as possible so that there’s less chance of a misunderstanding. [1] X Research source For instance, say something like, “Sorry, but I’m not interested,” or “You seem cool, but I just don’t feel a romantic connection between us.” [2] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Unless you’re truly uncertain, avoid saying ambiguous things like, “I’m just not sure how I feel about going out with you right now,” or “I don’t know, I’ll have to think about it.” Whatever you say, keep it brief. There’s more room for confusion, frustration, or hurt feelings if you write a long essay about why you don’t want to go out with them."

Other reasons you might use include things like, “It wouldn’t work out with us living so far apart,” or “You’re so adventurous, but I’m more of a homebody. I don’t think our lifestyles are really compatible.” You can also keep it simple and just say something like, “I’m sorry, but I don’t see you in a romantic way.” Avoid saying anything that could come across as hurtful or unkind, such as, “You’re not that attractive to me.”"

The rejection will sting a lot more if you make it sound like there’s something “wrong” with your would-be date. [7] X Research source For instance, say something like, “I’m not feeling any chemistry here,” or “It sounds like you’re looking for something serious, but I’m not ready to commit to anyone right now.” Avoid saying things like, “You’re not my type,” “You’re a little bit high drama for me,” or “You don’t seem like boyfriend/girlfriend material.”"

It could be as simple as, “No, thanks.” Not only is it kinder to the other person if you don’t ghost them, but it’ll also save some potential awkwardness if you happen to run into them in the future.

You went to the effort to be kind and respectful, and they should do the same for you! If you like, you can send them another message asking them not to contact you anymore. If that doesn’t work, you may need to block or report them. If you’re already worried that you might be dealing with someone who won’t take no for an answer, it’s okay to be a bit blunter in your initial message. Say something like, “I don’t think we’re compatible, and I’m not interested in going on a date with you. Please don’t contact me further.” [11] X Research source"
