[1] X Research source Some clinics may offer free testing, and others may charge you a fee based on your income so the tests are affordable. If you don’t have any money, ask if you qualify for a free test."

      "content": "Some schools run them during school hours and they’re usually confidential. If your school holds a health clinic for students, go see the nurse, doctor, or medical professional there. Ask them if they provide STD tests and if they’re confidential. If they are, then you can get one right there on the spot! [4] X Research source Your school may provide free testing, but ask if you need to pay or provide insurance information just to be sure. Some schools may even offer STD testing programs you can use to avoid having to tell your parents. Ask your nurse about the confidentiality of the test. Depending on where you live, your parents may be able to access any information in your school file, including your health records and STD history. However, in some places, this info is stored separately from your school records to avoid this conflict. [5] X Research source"

In many places, as long as you’re over 13, you can ask for a confidential STD test. You may need to use your parent’s insurance, so ask if you do whenever you make an appointment. [6] X Research source Call your insurance company if you’re using your parent’s insurance to find out what their privacy policies are. Many medical insurance companies will send out a monthly statement that lists all of the medical services that were charged. The statement could include STD tests that could tip off your parents. However, they may keep STD tests confidential, so it's important to call and find out. [7] X Research source"

That way, your doctor or nurse can explain exactly what your rights are and whether there are any steps you need to take to secure your records. For example, in states like California or Delaware, you can get an STD test without your parents knowing as long as you're 12 or older, but in states like Hawaii and Washington, you have to be at least 14.

Unless you're visiting a clinic that provides free STD screenings, you'll either have to provide health insurance or pay for the tests up-front. Even if you're covered under your parents' insurance, in most places your parents will be notified if a claim is filed on their insurance, so you may prefer to pay for the tests outright. It's a good idea to call ahead to the clinic and talk to them about their insurance and self-pay policies. [12] X Research source Search online to try to find clinics that offer low-cost or free STD testing in your area. In some places, like California, you can request where your insurance statements will be sent, so your parents might not be informed even if you use their insurance. [13] X Research source"

Come up with a plausible reason that you might need to head out for a few hours, then ask someone to drive you to the clinic. Have them wait for you during your appointment so they can bring you home! For instance, you might tell your parents you’re staying the night with a friend or studying at the library. Just keep in mind if they call to check up on you, they might find out that you aren’t really there! If you don't know anyone you can ask, you could use public transportation or a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft."
