      "title": "Decide which horse or horses you want to bet on.",
      "content": "Decide which horse or horses you want to bet on. Start by reading the racing form , which will give you statistics about each horse, trainer, and jockey. [1] X Research source Pay attention to the following factors when choosing a winning horse: [2] X Research source Trainer stats: Pay attention to whether a trainer has been winning races, prize money, and whether they’ve had success in specific areas, such as certain types of horses or areas of the sport. Jockey stats: Look for jockeys that consistently place in first, second, or third place. Look at the jockey’s history with the horse they will be riding and whether that pairing has consistently finished in the top three spots together. Horse odds: Betting on the favorite horses (who will have the lowest odds) gives you the best chance of return on your money, although it may be a small return. Surface type: Read through each horse’s past performance on different surface types. If a horse has only won races on dirt tracks and you’re at an all-weather course, you may want to consider another contender. Gate position: Look at stats related to the race distances at each track and if there is a gate advantage depending on whether the horse is starting on an inside or outside lane. Speed figures: Look for how quickly a horse can move from one point to another to assess its overall ability or look for races in which only one horse has a solid early speed. Paddock behavior: Before they race, horses are walked through a part of the track called the “paddock.” Observe each horse’s behavior—go for horses that seem alert but calm, and avoid any that seem jittery, nervous, or have visible sweat stains. If you’re going to the racetrack for fun and aren’t too worried about winning, you can simply choose a horse that’s wearing your favorite number or color, has features you like, or has a cool name!"

      "title": "Place your wager with the track’s official teller.",
      "content": "Place your wager with the track’s official teller. Some race tracks offer machine tellers as well as human tellers. If you’re a beginner to horse betting, start with the human teller to make sure your bet is placed correctly. Have your money and your decided bets ready, as bettors have limited time to place their wagers, and you don’t want to hold up the line. Follow these steps to place your bets: [3] X Research source State the name of the racetrack and the race number you’re betting. State the dollar amount of your bet and the type of wager you’re placing. State the program number of the horse or horses you’re betting on. Hand the teller your money, check that your ticket information is accurate, and keep your ticket in a safe place so you can use it to claim your money if you win the horse race. For example “Arlington Park, race nine, $2 to win on horse #3.”"

      "title": "Straight bets",
      "content": "Straight bets Straight bets or wagers include win, place, and show. As a beginner, placing a straight bet with small stakes is a good place to start. The win is the most popular and straightforward bet, and it pays the most if won as it’s difficult to get right. [4] X Research source Win: Your horse must come in first place for the bet to pay off. Place: Your horse must finish in first or second place for the bet to pay off. Show: Your horse must finish in first, second, or third place for the bet to pay off. Across the Board: This bet combines win, place, and show wagers. If you use this bet on a horse, you are betting that it will win both place and show. If the horse comes in first place, you’ll collect on all three bets. If it places second, you collect place and show; if it's third, you collect show."

      "title": "Exotic bets",
      "content": "Exotic bets The most common types of exotic bets include the exacta, trifecta, and superfecta. Exotic wagers are popular among horse bettors because these bets allow them to put money on horses that are unlikely to win without needing them to win. [5] X Research source For example, if you think a horse with bad odds has a better chance of winning than its odds suggest, you could get a high payout if you include that horse in an exotic wager. Exacta: Bet on two horses finishing in first and second place, in that exact order. Trifecta: Bet on three horses that will finish first, second, and third place, and predict the exact order in which they will finish. Superfecta: Bet on four horses to finish in the top four runners and predict their exact placement order—this bet is nearly impossible to win but has a high payoff if successful. Box: Betting an exacta, trifecta, or superfecta box is more expensive but your bet covers all possible orders in which your chosen horses may finish. If you bet two horses in an exacta box, for example, your bet is successful as long as those two horses finish in the first two places, regardless of order. Quinella: Bet on two horses to finish in first or second place, in either order. While Quinella bets are similar to exacta box bets, but a quinella costs slightly less to wager and are made in a more advanced betting pool with a higher potential cash-out. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Bets for multiple races For more advanced bettors, there are several options to bet across multiple races. You can bet on which horse(s) will win two, three, four, or five consecutive races. However, your wagers for all races in a series must be placed before the first leg of the first race begins. [7] X Research source Daily Double Pick the first place winning horse of two consecutive races. Pick 3: Pick the first place winning horse of three consecutive races. Pick 4: Pick the first place winning horse of four consecutive races. Pick 5: Pick the first place winning horse of five consecutive races. Pick 6: Pick the first place winning horse of six consecutive races. Grand Slam Pick a horse to finish in three first three places of three consecutive races. Then, select the winner of the fourth race in the sequence."

For example, if a horse has a high speed rating but isn’t favored because they’ve been racing unsuccessfully on long-distance tracks, try betting on them on a shorter race. Or, if a horse hasn’t been ranking on soft tracks, place a wager on them once they’re on a firmer track. [16] X Research source Since these horses aren’t favored to win, you’ll receive a lot more bang for your buck if they do. However, you have to have a lot of knowledge and insight about horses and racing for this betting strategy, so use it with caution."
