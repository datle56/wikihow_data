      "content": "Check your safe’s owner’s manual. Most Sentry Safes provide the factory code, which is the code you enter to start the combination reset process, inside the owner’s manual. This code is usually printed on the back of the manual or listed in the instructions about programming your user code. [1] X Research source Some Sentry Safes have default codes that open the safe and reset the combination. All Security Safes come with the factory code 1-7-5-0-0-# while all Pistol Safes have the default code 1-2-3-4-1. If you have a safe with a default factory code, reset it as soon as possible. If you keep the combination as the factory code, anyone can look up the code and open your safe. Other safes, like the Fire Safe, come with factory codes that are unique to each safe. This code can’t be changed or deleted and always opens your safe."

If you’ve lost your safe’s unique factory code or don’t remember your combination, go to Sentry Safe’s lost key or combo page to request a recovery code. To get your code, enter your safe’s model and serial number, fill out and notarize the verification form , and pay a small fee. Or, call Sentry Safe’s Customer Care line at 1-800-828-1438. A replacement code costs $29.95 in the US, $40 in Canada, £19 in the UK, and €21 in most countries in the EU. It usually takes 7 to 10 days to receive your replacement code. Sentry Safe also offers key replacements if you’ve lost your safe’s keys."

Then, insert and pry a flat-head screwdriver into each notch to peel the plastic panel from the back of the door. Towards the top, right-hand corner of the door, look for a white barcode sticker. Simply scan it with your phone using a QR or barcode scanning app to receive the factory code. [3] X Research source Depending on your safe model, the panel covering the back of the door might be secured by screws. If you can’t scan the barcode because it’s covered by gears or other locking mechanisms, simply peel off the sticker."
