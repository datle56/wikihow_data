      "title": "Set up the bar before lying down.",
      "content": "Set up the bar before lying down. Start with a very low weight if you've never done this exercise before, particularly if you don't have a spotter. In fact, some barbells are weighted without adding extra weights to the end, which may be a good place to start. You can always increase what you press later, but you don't want to injure yourself by starting with an amount you can't handle. It's best to have a spotter to catch the bar if you can, especially if you're new. You can have a friend help you at home or a weight room employee help spot you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lie down flat on your back on the bench.",
      "content": "Lie down flat on your back on the bench. Position yourself so that you can easily reach the barbell once you're lying down; it should be pretty much right above your chest if possible as you don't want to reach too far."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a leg on either side of the bench.",
      "content": "Place a leg on either side of the bench. Bend your knees at a right angle. Your feet should be flat on the floor. If you're tall enough, your legs can go off the end of the bench instead of the sides. [1] X Research source If you arch your back while your feet are on the ground, then put your feet on the bench so your heels are close to your buttocks and your knees are bent."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab the bar with both hands in an overhand grip.",
      "content": "Grab the bar with both hands in an overhand grip. Place your hands a little bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Wrap your thumbs around the bar going the opposite direction of your fingers, as that will give you a steadier grip. [2] X Research source This grip width should put your elbows at a right angle midway through the pressing motion. Don’t bend your wrists backward to support the weight of the bar. Instead, keep them aligned with the backs of your forearms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set your shoulders and pull the bar off the holder.",
      "content": "Set your shoulders and pull the bar off the holder. Squeeze your shoulders together, pressing them into the bench. After ensuring you have a good grasp on the bar, lift it off the holder so you can move into the starting position. [3] X Research source Setting your shoulders helps work them more once you start pressing the bar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Extend your arms with the bar in your hands.",
      "content": "Extend your arms with the bar in your hands. Press the bar straight up from your chest. When your arms are all the way extended, you've reached the starting point for this exercise. [4] X Research source Try to keep your wrists straight. It helps to hold it as low in your palm as you can while still maintaining a firm grip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breathe in and lower the bar down slowly.",
      "content": "Breathe in and lower the bar down slowly. Take a deep breath. Draw the bar down until it touches your chest, keeping your arms tucked in close to your body as you do. Work against the weight of the bar as you bring it down. Don't allow it to slam down on your chest, as you could injure yourself. Plus, if you lower it quickly, you're missing out on some of your workout! Align the bar, your wrists, and your elbows throughout the pressing motion. If the front of your shoulders hurt during the exercise, try making your grip wider."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breathe out and press up.",
      "content": "Breathe out and press up. After a short pause, push the bar back upwards, aiming for your starting position. When you reach the top of your press with your arms fully extended, pause again for just a second. As you press, think about pulling the bar apart with your hands, which will help you stabilize your shoulders and the bar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your hips still as you press up and down.",
      "content": "Keep your hips still as you press up and down. You may be tempted to move your lower back but try to keep it in place. If it's hurting, you may need to adjust your position by putting your feet on the bench. If you need to, you can also arch your upper back a bit. Your core strength will help you hold the proper position. If you’re having difficulty keeping the form, you may have too much weight on the bar to support."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat 8-12 times for one set.",
      "content": "Repeat 8-12 times for one set. You don't want to push yourself too much, particularly as a beginner; 12 repetitions is plenty. Focus on doing the exercise correctly, which is more important. After a short rest, you can try another 1-2 sets. Aim to do strength training exercises 2-3 times a week."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use dumbbells if you don't have a barbell.",
      "content": "Use dumbbells if you don't have a barbell. Lie down as you did for the barbell press. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with the weight on your thighs. Bend one arm to bring a dumbbell up to your chest. Bring the other arm up. Turn the dumbbells like you're holding a barbell in an overhand grip. Breathe out and extend your arms upward. Pause for a moment, then bring them back down as you breathe in. If you want to do this at home and you don't have a bench or dumbbells, pick a flat surface and use canned goods or large water bottles for dumbbells. You can also use an exercise ball to support your back."

      "title": "Set yourself up on an incline or decline bench to work different muscle groups.",
      "content": "Set yourself up on an incline or decline bench to work different muscle groups. In these exercises, a sloped bench either raises or lowers your head above the rest of your body. The incline bench, where your head is above your body, works your upper chest muscles more. The decline bench works on your lower pectoral muscles. Perform the bench press the same way from these positions. [5] X Research source Of the three exercises (regular bench press, incline, and decline), the decline is likely the best option to work all of your chest muscles at once."

      "title": "Work on machine bench presses if you can't lie down on your back.",
      "content": "Work on machine bench presses if you can't lie down on your back. If you have issues lying flat on your back, you can use a chest press machine to sit up and do bench presses. To begin, press down on the lever and push the handles forward so your arms are fully extended in the starting position. Breathe in and bring the handles back towards your chest. Breathe out and push the handles back out. [6] X Research source You can also try other upper body exercises like tricep curls, lat pulldowns, push-ups. Reader Poll: We asked 366 wikiHow readers and only 11% said that the best exercise for building arm strength is a bench press . [Take Poll] So if your main goal is building up your arms, an alternative exercise may even be better for your purposes!"
