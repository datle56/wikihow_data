      "content": "Know that gender is from the mind. Gender identity is how people perceive themselves in their minds, and people like to express their gender identity through pronouns (for example, \"they/them\"), clothing, appearance, hairstyle, and more. On the other hand, biological sex is our biological and physiological characteristics (such as chromosomes, genitals, hormones, reproductive organs, and many more) that determine whether we're male, female or intersex. Gender is one's psychological identification, which may or may not align with one's biological sex. There is no fixed number of gender identities, as individuals may identify in various ways, but here are some common examples: Cisgender – identifying as the biological sex assigned at birth Transgender – identifying as the opposite sex assigned from birth Non-Binary – not identifying with either male or female. Bigender – identifying with both male and female. Gender Fluid – may identify with a gender that changes over time or depending on the situation. Sex is determined by a combination of biological factors, including anatomy, chromosomes (the two common ones being XX for female and XY for male ), and the reproductive system, most often within the male and female category. For example, boys and men typically have a penis and testicles, while girls and women typically have a vagina. A male before age 18 is a boy , while those ages 18 and older are men . A female before age 18 is a girl , while those ages 18 and older are women . Intersex is a diverse term for a small number of people who have chromosomes, hormones, and/or genitalia outside of the male and female binary. It is not a third sex as intersex variations are different and they cannot be classified together."

      "content": "Understand gender identity. Gender identity is about how we see ourselves in terms of gender. Gender identity refers to an individual's internal sense of self and gender, whether they are a man, a woman, neither, or both. Gender identity, unlike gender expression, is not visible to others, and is an internal sense. It should be noted that intersex is not a gender identity despite it is listed in the image. Common gender identities include: [2] X Research source Cisgender , or simply cis, is a term that refers to a person whose gender identity corresponds to the sex assigned to them at birth. Transgender , or trans, is an umbrella term that refers to someone whose gender identity differs from the gender assigned at birth. (Being intersex is not the same as being nonbinary or transgender.) Agender is an adjective that can be used to describe someone who does not identify as any gender. Nonbinary/genderqueer is a term that can be used by people who do not identify as male or female or who do not fit into the categories of man or woman. A variety of terms are used to describe these experiences; nonbinary and genderqueer are two examples. Genderfluid is a term used to describe individuals whose gender identity (the gender with which they most identify) is not fixed. It can change over time or from one day to the next. Fluid is a type of gender identity or expression, not a sexual orientation. Demiboy/Demigirl/Demigender are gender identity terms meaning having a partial, but not complete, attachment to a specific gender identity or to the concept of gender (for example, a boy feeling a partial connection to being a girl, but still identifying as a boy). This is considered a nonbinary gender. Bigender is a term for someone who identifies as man and woman, or two genders. Trigender is a label used for somebody who identifies with three genders. Pangender refers to a multigender non-binary gender identity referring to a vast and diverse multiplicity of genders in the same individual that can extend infinitely, always within the person's own culture and life experience, and may or may not include unknown genders."

Because others can see it, this is an external sense. These cues are identified as masculine or feminine by society, though what is considered masculine or feminine changes over time and varies by culture. [3] X Research source Gender expression varies from person to person. For example, some men love weightlifting, some men love nail polish, and some love both. None of these things make them more or less male."

Wearing masculine/feminine clothing doesn't imply that you are a boy/girl, but the way you dress and present can give you insight on your gender. If you enjoy wearing dresses, skirts, or bright colors, this could indicate that you enjoy presenting yourself as feminine. Perhaps you prefer a t-shirt and jeans to a fancy dress—this could indicate that you prefer to dress masculinely. You may prefer a combination of these styles, or you may prefer neither. Remember; gender expression does not always correspond to gender identity. To deal with dysphoria and feel better about your body, you may want to bind your chest , tuck and tape , pack , or stuff your bra ."
