      "content": "A Golden Retriever boyfriend is loyal, supportive, and energetic. The term “Golden Retriever boyfriend” is a trendy internet slang term (popularized by TikTok) used to describe boyfriends who are upbeat, goofy, and wholly devoted to their partner. They’re called such because they share many of their personality traits with actual Golden Retrievers, which are known to be trustworthy and eager-to-please. [1] X Research source Many describe the Golden Retriever boyfriend as the “ideal” boyfriend. Golden Retriever girlfriends also exist, though the phrase isn’t as popular as Golden Retriever boyfriend. The personality traits are the same. While the Golden Retriever boyfriend trend is mostly used by heterosexual couples, the term can be used by couples of all genders and in LGBTQ+ relationships. For example, if your boyfriend always brings you flowers when you have a bad day, you might say he’s a Golden Retriever boyfriend."
