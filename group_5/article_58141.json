Laminate paper is an inexpensive way to cover the surface of cabinets, but eventually, you may decide you want to update the look. You can remove the cabinet hardware, such as knobs, handles, and pulls, and sand the laminate to rough up the surface so the paint will adhere to it. You also need to choose the right primer and paint, but you absolutely can paint your laminate paper-covered cabinets. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use oil-based primer and paint for laminate cabinets. Laminate can be a tricky material for paint to bond to, so it’s important that you choose the right paint to avoid bubbles and clumping. An oil-based primer will lay the foundation for an oil-based paint to properly adhere to the surface of your laminate cabinets. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "No, you really need to sand the surface so the paint sticks to it. If you have raw, unvarnished wood cabinets, then you could probably get away with not sanding them before you apply your paint. However, laminate is a glossy surface that will affect how the paint and primer adhere to your cabinets. Use medium-grit sandpaper such as 180-grit and lightly sand the surface to prepare it.

      "content": "Yes, you need to prime the surface so your paint bonds to it. After lightly sanding the surface of your laminate cabinets, apply an oil-based primer with a paintbrush. Cover the entire surface of the cabinets with an even layer and allow the primer to dry completely. [4] X Research source Check the packaging of the primer for specific drying times because they can vary. It’s really important that the primer is fully dry before you add your paint."

      "content": "You can use 2 coats if necessary. Use a paintbrush to apply your oil-based paint over the primer coat, making sure to cover all areas of the cabinets evenly. Then, wait for the paint to fully dry. If you’re not satisfied with the coverage, apply a second coat and allow it to fully dry as well. [5] X Research source Adding too many coats can affect how well the paint adheres to the cabinets."
