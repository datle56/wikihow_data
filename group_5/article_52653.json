      "content": "Apply a thin layer of color corrector to neutralize the bruise’s tones. Choose the color corrector based on the color of your bruise. Color correcting uses color theory to neutralize the appearance of a bruise. The idea is that the colors on the opposite side of the color wheel cancel each other out. [1] X Research source Gently dab the color corrector over your bruise and blend it out lightly so the bruise doesn't show through. Blue bruises: Depending on your skin tone, use pink, peach, or orange color correctors to cover your bruise. Light skin tones need a lighter color corrector like pink or light peach. Use dark peach or orange on deeper skin tones. Purple bruises: Yellow color corrector is effective for covering purple bruises. However, blue and purple are close on the color wheel, so many of the same corrector colors will work on both depending on the shade of the bruise. Red bruises: Cover red bruises with a green color corrector . Brown bruises: Regular concealer , a shade lighter than your skin tone usually covers a brown bruise. Add a white color corrector to your concealer or foundation if it’s too dark. Yellow bruises: Use a lavender color corrector to neutralize yellow bruises. Orange bruises: If your bruise appears orange, use a blue color corrector to cover it. Remember, a bruise changes color as it heals, so you may need to adjust the colors you use to neutralize it as time passes."

      "content": "Use clothing and accessories to cover up the bruise. Physically covering the bruise with clothing may also help. Consider the location of the bruise and check your wardrobe to see what clothing and accessories you have that might help you cover it up. If the bruise is on your arm or leg, wearing a long-sleeved shirt or pants is an easy way to cover it up. However, this is not always possible, especially in hot weather. If the bruise is near your hairline or forehead, wearing a scarf, headband, or hat may provide coverage. If the bruise is on your eye or near the bridge of your nose, wearing sunglasses or prescription glasses may help."

Keep in mind that this will not cover the bruise, but it may help draw people's eyes away from it. For example, apply some black eyeliner with a couple of layers of mascara to create a dramatic eye look, or opt for a bright red lipstick to draw attention to your lips instead."
