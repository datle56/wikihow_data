      "content": "Wrap an ice cube in a towel for a short-term fix. Hold it against the pimple so only the cloth is touching your skin, and leave it there for 5 to 10 minutes. The cold helps contract the blood vessels underneath the skin, making the pimple less red and obvious. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Stick these over the pimple for a few hours. These draw pus out of pimples so they heal faster. You can buy them at a pharmacy as \"hydrocolloid bandages\" (which are cheaper), or as \"pimple patches\" (which sometimes have extra meds for deep, painful pimples). Either way, gently wash and dry the skin around the pimple and stick the patch over it. You might see the patch absorbing gunk within a few hours, and can leave it on for up to 12.

      "content": "Hide the pimples with makeup. Moisturize your skin, then cover your zits with a light layer of concealer the same shade as your skin. Apply a matching foundation to the rest of your face, and blend the concealer and foundation together using a clean brush or makeup sponge. [3] X Research source If this doesn't do the trick, try a color correcting product. Green or yellow tones help counteract the red color of the pimple. Using hypo-allergenic makeup is a good idea when you have a breakout."

      "title": "Try a green tea lotion or a used tea bag.",
      "content": "Try a green tea lotion or a used tea bag. Green tea on your skin might fight the bacteria infection that causes redness and swelling. A lotion with green tea extract as one of its main ingredients is probably your best bet, but in a pinch you could put a cool, wet tea bag over the pimple. Repeat once a day.

      "content": "Try this folk remedy if you have aspirin handy. Crush an aspirin into a powder, mix it with a few drops of water to make a paste, then dab it over your pimple with a cotton swab. There's not much evidence that this helps, but it's an easy thing to try.

      "content": "Dab a tea tree oil cream onto your acne. Look for a cream that has about 5% tea tree oil, and dab it over the pimples with a cotton swab. This is one of the most promising natural remedies, but (like all good acne treatment) it does take time to work. Repeat this every day to help your skin heal. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you haven't used tea tree oil before, it's not a bad idea to do a patch test on your arm first, just to see if you're allergic. [8] X Research source You can buy pure tea tree oil instead and dilute it yourself on a kitchen scale, adding 1 gram of tea tree oil for every 19 grams of vegetable oil (not water). Jojoba oil is a good choice, since it helps reduce inflammation (while some other oils could clog pores and make things worse).

(This could be listed as AHA, glycolic acid, or lactic acid. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source ) These are some of the cheaper and gentler face masks, and also better against acne than the harsh ones with lemon juice or the fancy ones with exotic, untested ingredients—so that's a win-win.

If you're putting the skin mask near your eyes, protect the sensitive skin there with a light dab of petroleum jelly. A clay mask with jojoba oil seems to work well for some people. Use it 2 or 3 times per week over your whole face or just over the area with acne. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

An oily scalp can cause acne around your hairline. Shampooing more often can help if your hair gets oily fast. You can also wash your face with a gentle cleanser.
