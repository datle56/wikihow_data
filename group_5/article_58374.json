You can find these sets online at a variety of price points, so don't worry, you won't need to shell out a lot of money if you don't want to! You should also be able to find them at gaming stores. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that different versions of the game have a different number of tiles. Some only have 136, for instance. Some sets are very expensive because they are hand carved!"

      "title": "Learn the suit tiles first.",
      "content": "Learn the suit tiles first. The game uses 3 suits for the main part of gameplay, which are dot/circles, Chinese characters, and bamboo. These function much like suits in a deck of cards. Each suit has 4 identical sets of 9 tiles. There are 108 of these tiles in total. [2] X Research source The suits tiles will have numbers, 1-9, and like playing cards, each tile will have a corresponding amount of the respective symbol, except for the character suit, which has the Chinese character for the number. The number 1 tile for bamboo is a bird, typically an owl or a peacock."

      "title": "Use honor tiles like suit tiles.",
      "content": "Use honor tiles like suit tiles. Honor tiles are special tiles. Honor tiles show red and green dragons or the 4 winds. You can use these almost like suit tiles in that you can match them to make \"melds,\" 3-of-a-kind or 4-of-a-kind. [3] X Research source You'll have 16 wind tiles, 4 each of east, south, west, and north, which you play in that order: remember \"eat soy with noodles.\" They typically have the first letter of the word in the upper left-hand corner. The dragons are usually represented by Chinese characters, but they'll also have a \"C,\" \"F,\" or \"P/B\" on them instead of the numbers 1-9 like the suit tiles. You get 4 sets of the same 3 tiles.

      "title": "Decide whether you will use the bonus tiles.",
      "content": "Decide whether you will use the bonus tiles. Bonus tiles show seasons and flowers. Typically, you include these tiles in Chinese and Korean versions of Mahjong, but not always in American or Japanese versions. You can't use these to make melds, but they can give you extra points in your hand at the end. [5] X Research source The pictures on these tiles vary by set. A set might have plum, orchid, chrysanthemum, and bamboo flowers, 1 of each. Then, it will have 1 tile for each season. You might also have 4 blank tiles, which can be used as jokers."

The West Wind is across from the East Wind, while the North Wind is to the East's left and the South is to the East's Right. The person to the right of the East Wind, the South Wind, goes first.

Just leave them in the middle in a group, as you'll draw from them throughout the game. Line up the tiles facing you to form your hand. [8] X Research source In traditional mahjong, you make a wall of tiles in front of each player before dealing, 36 tiles each in stacks of 2. Then you push all the walls together to form a square. The East Wind throws 2 dice, then counts from the right to that point in the wall and pushes 2 stacks of tiles forward to put in their hand. Players take turns pulling out stacks, 2 stacks at a time until they reach 12 each. Then, the East takes 2 tiles and the other 3 players take a single tile."

      "content": "Pass tiles using the \"Charleston\" rule in American mahjong. This rule is a variant, and it's typically only used in the American version. It's divided into 3 parts. You must do the Charleston the first time. All you do is take 3 tiles from your hand that you want to discard and pass them to the right, called the first pass. Then you do the same with the person across from you (second pass) and then for the person to your left (third pass). If everyone agrees, you can do the whole process a second time, but if 1 person says \"no,\" you don't. [9] X Research source On the third pass, you can use a \"blind\" pass, meaning you can move 1-3 tiles that are passed to you on to the next person without looking at them. Make sure you still pass 3, making up the extra from your hand. You can also do a courtesy pass at the end, where the players across from each agree to exchange 1-3 tiles. This is optional, and both players must agree on the pass, stating how many tiles they want to exchange. Whichever number is lower is the one used."

Otherwise, they can discard the one they picked up. When picking up a tile from the wall, you continue from the point where you stopped when the tiles were dealt and keep moving in the same direction; if you have a pile, just take any tile from the pile. [10] X Research source To decide whether to keep a tile, check to see if it matches any tiles in your hand. You're trying to form melds, which includes 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, and straights. If you used the wall method of dealing tiles, then the East has 14 tiles. In that case, the East Wind can discard a tile to start the game, which anyone can claim. [11] X Research source"

Every time you pick up a tile, either one a person has discarded or one from the draw pile, you must discard a tile from your hand. Place the tile on the table, and then say the name of the tile so that others can claim it. [12] X Research source aimj.altervista.org/extraregolamenti/american-mahjong-rules.pdf Discarded tiles just go into the middle of the table. You can line them up if you wish."

      "content": "Claim a tile as it's discarded if it fits one of your melds. If the tile completes a pong, meaning you already have the other 2 tiles in your hand, you can say \"pong\" and claim the discarded tile. Similarly, you can claim the tile if it completes a kong or chow in your hand, and you say it aloud when you claim it. Then, you must show the meld and put it on the table to prove it. This type of claiming goes in the order of players with one exception: if the tile would allow a player to win mahjong, they get the tile. [13] X Research source aimj.altervista.org/extraregolamenti/american-mahjong-rules.pdf Some variations only allow you to claim the third tile of a chow from the person directly before you. If you've played a 3-tile pong on the table, you can't claim the fourth tile, though you can play it if you draw it from the wall/draw pile. You can play a whole game without showing any melds from your hand, which is called \"concealed melds,\" but you can't claim any discarded tiles. Not showing melds gives you extra points. Melds laid on the table are called \"exposed melds.\""

If no one claims the discarded tile, then the next player to the right of the person discarding picks up a tile from the draw pile/wall. Once you rack a tile, no one can claim the previously discarded tile. [14] X Research source If you've picked up a tile and looked at but haven't racked it yet, someone can still claim the discarded tile.

Whenever a discarded tile is claimed, the turn skips to that person, and then play continues from them. [15] X Research source If you are mainly drawing tiles, then play just goes from person to person."

      "content": "Work on forming melds. Melds are sets of tiles you play together. You can play 3 of the same tile (\"pongs\") or 4 of the same tile (\"kongs\"). These tiles can be suits, honor tiles, or bonus tiles. You can also play 3 numbers in a row, called a chow. [17] X Research source These are similar to 3-of-a-kind, 4-of-a-kind, and a run or a straight in rummy . In some versions, you can only have 1 chow in your hand. Chows do not give you points at the end, but they contribute to forming mahjong. When you lay out melds, place the long ends next to each other and group them in front of you. The only time you \"play\" a meld is when you claim a discarded tile, as you have to show your meld then. Otherwise, you wait until you call mahjong to reveal your melds, much like gin rummy."

You'll need 4 melds, which can be a combination of pongs, kongs, and chows, plus 1 pair. Any bonus tiles will also give you points. [18] X Research source For instance, you might have 2 melds that are 3-of-a-kind and 1 that's a run of 3, plus a pair."

Mahjong is played over many rounds, so points will add up over those rounds.

A pong gets 2 points if it's exposed or 4 if it's concealed, while a pong of 1s and 9s, dragons, or winds is worth 4 if exposed and 8 if concealed. Kongs are worth 8 (exposed) and 16 (concealed) or 16 and 32 if they use 1s and 9s, dragons, or winds. Each flower or season gets 4 points, while a pair dragons or your own wind gets 2 points."
