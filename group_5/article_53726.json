      "content": "Determine what you’re comfortable wearing. Modesty means something different for everyone. Some people prefer to keep their arms and legs completely covered while others are okay with short sleeves and bare calves. Whether you dress modestly for religious reasons or because you simply like the style, it’s up to you to determine what you consider modest. It’s okay to have different opinions from friends and family. Don’t let anyone try to force their beliefs about modesty on you, and don’t try to force yours on them, either. Remember that you’re both doing what feels right and comfortable for you. A good rule of thumb is if you doubt a certain item or outfit is modest, don’t wear it. Trust your instincts—you know what you’re comfortable with. If you’re struggling, reach out to a parent, friend, or religious leader for advice."

      "content": "Get extra coverage by wearing multiple pieces at once. If you’ve just started to dress modestly, there’s no need to get a whole new wardrobe. Odds are, you can still wear most of your less modest clothes by wearing another piece over or under it. For example, wear a camisole under a low-necked shirt to cover your chest. By layering your clothes , you can still wear trendy pieces without sacrificing your modesty. [1] X Research source If you have a dress with a low neckline, throw a cute sweater on top of it. This makes the dress look like a skirt, and you can create several different outfits by wearing different tops with it. Another option is to wear a loose T-shirt and tie it up. If you don’t want to wear a cami under your low-necked shirt, wear it backward! Usually, the neckline is higher on the back of a shirt, and then you can add a cute jacket or sweater on top. No one will know the difference!"

      "content": "Avoid clothing that’s too tight or form-fitting. Materials like Spandex and other stretchy fabrics tend to be very form-fitting, so you might want to avoid them depending on your personal modesty level. When buying new clothes, be sure to try them on first to make sure they’re loose and breathable. [2] X Research source If you do wear Spandex or other leggings, make sure your underwear lines don’t show, and wear a longer shirt, tunic, or dress on top. Try pairing a fitted shirt with a flowy skirt or vice versa. This gives your outfit shape without being immodest. Just remember, fitted doesn’t mean tight! Avoid clothes that cling to your body. [3] X Research source Looser clothes are also great for staying cool in the summer! [4] X Research source"

Just play it safe by wearing leggings or shorts for extra coverage. [8] X Research source If you’re unsure if your dress or skirt is too short, stand in front of your mirror and bend at the hips.

      "content": "Pants and skirts with high waistlines help cover your midriff.

If you have trouble finding conservative tops in-store, search for modest clothing stores online! [9] X Research source It is possible to wear a crop top in a modest way, however.

      "content": "Avoid using bright colors and heavy makeup products. Some modest teenage girls may choose to wear no makeup at all, but there’s no harm in trying it out. In fact, wearing makeup can make you look polished and help hide any blemishes you may be insecure about. Keep it simple with some mascara, light eyeshadow and blush, and a bit of lip gloss or lip balm. [13] X Research source Just like with clothing, you may feel comfortable wearing more or less makeup than someone else who dresses modestly. Just remember that it’s a personal choice and no one is necessarily right or wrong."
