      "title": "Start with a friendly opening and introduction to your speech.",
      "content": "Start with a friendly opening and introduction to your speech. Welcome guests and express gratitude to them for being a part of your sister’s special day. Then, introduce yourself and your relationship to the bride. Keep in mind that this part of the speech will set the tone for the rest, so make sure it’s true to you and engages the attendees in a fun or heartfelt way. [1] X Research source Example: “Hi, everyone! Thank you so much for being here this evening, I’ve had the best time celebrating this special day with all of you. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m [ bride’s name ]’s younger sister, and I’m so excited to tell you all about my big sis and how happy I am for her.”"

      "title": "Talk about childhood memories and anecdotes.",
      "content": "Talk about childhood memories and anecdotes. This section of your speech can be more sentimental or nostalgic, talking about all of your special moments with your sister and all she’s done for you, or you can tell a funny story from your time growing up together. Consider including ways you looked up to your sister, special nicknames you called each other, or secret things you used to keep from your parents. However, try to avoid really embarrassing stories. Even if you think they’re funny, you don’t want to run the risk of humiliating your sister in front of her friends and family, not all of whom she may feel close to. Similarly, remember to stay positive. While you might privately reflect on how happy you are that your sister has gone through so much heartbreak to find her true love, mulling over toxic exes or other life hardships may not be appropriate for a maid of honor speech. Example: “One of the most defining memories that comes to mind when I think of my sister is my first time I visited her while she was living abroad in Tangier. In a classic older-sister move, [ bride’s name ] insisted on doing all the navigation herself as we road-tripped along the Moroccan coastline and obviously…we got lost. That’s how we found ourselves stumbling into an invite to a random local family’s dinner table where we experienced an evening of laughter, broken French, and an impromptu visit to their family holiday the following week. With [ bride’s name ], you can always expect even the most nerve wracking of mishaps to turn into a heartwarming and memorable adventure.”"

      "title": "Tie your memories to the present with an overview of the bride’s journey.",
      "content": "Tie your memories to the present with an overview of the bride’s journey. Transition from your childhood memories to talk about how your sister has grown and changed over time. Talk about your sister’s personal growth, her achievements, and how proud you are of how far she has come in life. [2] X Research source Example: “And adventure is really the name of the game when you’re lucky enough to share a life with [ bride’s name ]. She turns every day into something fun and exciting, even when you’re just sitting around the house. She makes a bad day better, and a good day unforgettable. I’m so grateful to have a sister like that, but I’m even more grateful for the distinct honor of watching her grow into such an incredible and beautiful person who’s about to embark on what will arguably be her greatest adventure yet (besides ours in Morocco, obviously).”"

      "title": "Transition from talking about you and your sister to the newlywed couple.",
      "content": "Transition from talking about you and your sister to the newlywed couple. Present stories of love about your sister and her new spouse. Talk about the depth of their love, the reasons why they’re perfect for each other, and personal moments that you’ve witnessed that show the strength of their relationship. [3] X Research source Keep this section as personal as possible—rather than cliched or overused statements about love, try sprinkling in some personal anecdotes or inside jokes about the couple. Example: “And, as ever, my sister has really turned her love story into an adventure. She and [ groom or bride’s name ] met on the other side of the world, despite being from the same small town here in Michigan. They fell in love doing things that would send most of us in this room (including me) into an absolute meltdown—if you don’t know, their first date was ziplining in the Alps. And despite a mutual love of spontaneity and adrenaline-pumping stunts, I’ve seen how [ bride’s name ] and [ groom or bride’s name ] love and care for each other in the quieter moments. How, when it comes to being with the person you’re meant to be with, there’s few adventures greater than just building a home together, wherever that home may be.”"

Wrap up your speech by welcoming your sister’s new spouse to the family and offer them well-wishes for their future together. If you have any pearls of wisdom for them as they embark on their marriage journey, this section would be the place to include it. Consider also extending appreciation to the families of the newlyweds, as well as the guests of the wedding. [4] X Research source Example: “[ Groom or bride’s name ], we’re so lucky to have you as part of our family, and I’m so grateful for all the love you’ve given my sister. I’m so excited to watch how the two of you navigate this next chapter together, and please know I’ll be by your side for the ups, downs, and in-betweens.

May your adventure together last a lifetime.”"

[ Groom or bride’s name ], welcome to the family. I can’t imagine anyone who could be more deserving of my sister, although I don’t know if you’re deserving of having to spend the rest of your life at our family’s crazy holiday dinners.

If we haven’t been formally introduced, I’m [ your name ], and tonight I’m both [ bride’s name ]’s maid of honor and very adoring sister. And if you know anything about my sister, you know that she’s a hopeless romantic. And if you really know anything about my sister, you know a second thing, which is that her favorite thing on earth is “Moulin Rouge.” And if you know “Moulin Rouge,” you know the quote, “the greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.” Now, my sister fell in love with that quote the first time she heard it. And while I think at the time she associated it with the great Aaron Tveit as we watched him sing it on Broadway, I know that she now gets to associate it with the beautiful person that she’s marrying today. But I , on the other hand, am lucky enough to have always associated it with her. Having a sister means always feeling loved, and [ bride’s name ] has given me the gift of loving me unconditionally through every moment and milestone of our lives. [ Bride’s name ], I am so grateful for your presence in my life, and I’m so happy that today you’re opening a new chapter in yours. Here’s to a life filled with love, both given and returned."

Before standing up to start your speech, inhale deeply through your nose, hold your breath for a few seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat as needed, or until it’s your time to speak. [10] X Research source You can also try to use positive visualization to calm your nerves. Close your eyes and picture yourself giving a confident, moving, and engaging performance. Envision the smiles on the faces of your sister and her partner, the audience laughing and applauding, and the joy you’ll feel at the end of your speech. Additionally, try power poses or positive affirmations to feel more confident before your speech."

If your sister is a really sentimental person, she may appreciate more nostalgic and heartfelt touches to your speech. If most of the guests of the wedding skew more traditional, you may want to write a more formal speech or leave out any embarrassing stories. [12] X Research source However, make sure to write a speech that fits your personality—your sister picked you as her maid of honor, so make sure that your speech sounds like you! Don’t force yourself to be funny, sentimental, or formal if that’s not your natural personality or way of speaking. If you have a special skill, such as singing, poetry, or music, consider incorporating that into your speech to make it feel more personal and more like you (but you may want to make sure this is okay with the couple first)."
