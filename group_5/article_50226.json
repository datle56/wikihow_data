For Word 2007 and later, which use the ribbon interface, click the Symbol button (which displays the Greek letter omega) in the Symbols section of the Insert ribbon tab. Select \"More Symbols\" at the bottom of the popup menu of commonly used symbols to display the Symbol dialog. For Word 2003 and earlier, select \"Symbol\" from the \"Insert\" menu."

      "content": "Choose the font you want to display the exponent in. In most cases, you'll want to display the exponent in the same font as the rest of the text, so you can leave the setting \"(normal text)\" in the Font dropdown alone. If you want to display the exponent in a different font, click the down arrow button at the right of the dropdown and select the font you desire from the list. Be aware that not all fonts include superscripted numbers or letters. If the font you're using for your primary text doesn't support the exponent you want to add, you'll have to choose a font that supports the exponent."

You can scroll to the exponent using the scroll bar on the right of the character display, or you can select one of these options from the Subset dropdown menu: \"Latin-1 Supplement\" (or simply \"Latin-1\") or \"Superscripts and Subscripts.\" The available numeric exponents are \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3,\" and a superscripted \"n\" is available to represent an exponent variable. Click on the superscript character to select it."

This will close the dialog and insert your exponent in the text at the point of your cursor. In Word 2007 and later, after you select an exponent, it will appear in the Recently Used Symbols display at the bottom of the Symbols dialog page. If you want to use the exponent again, you can select it from this location. You can also insert the exponent by using the shortcut key for that exponent. When you select an exponent, the Symbol dialog displays a shortcut key of \"Alt\" followed by a letter or 4-digit combination. By pressing the \"Alt\" key and entering this combination, you can display the exponent without displaying the Symbol dialog. (Older versions of Word may not display a shortcut key for some exponents.) You can also create or modify a shortcut key by using the Shortcut Key button."

The Font dialog not only lets you change the font and point size of your text, but it also lets you format the text in a number of ways, including making it into an exponent. How you access the Font dialog depends on your version of Word. For Word 2007 and later, click the diagonal down arrow button at the right of the Font section in the Home ribbon tab.

In addition to representing mathematical exponents, you can use this method to represent ionic charge, which is written as raised plus or minus signs (with either a number denoting how many electrons were gained or lost or with a sign for each extra or missing electron) after the chemical symbol. Do not use superscript numbers to represent multiple atoms of an element in a molecule; for that, use subscript numbers. Instead of typing the text you want to superscript first, you can bring up the Font dialog, check \"Superscript,\" click \"OK,\" and then type your text. If you do this, you must bring up the Font dialog box after typing your superscripted text and uncheck \"Superscript\" to turn this feature off."
