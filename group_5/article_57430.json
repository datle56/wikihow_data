      "title": "Chill a pitcher for at least 2 hours before making the cocktails.",
      "content": "Chill a pitcher for at least 2 hours before making the cocktails. Get out a pitcher that holds at least 5 cups (1,200 ml) of liquid. Place it in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before you want to serve the cocktails. [1] X Research source Using a chilled pitcher keeps the cocktails cooler for longer. If you have space in the fridge or freezer, place the cocktail glasses in there to chill as well."

    {
      "title": "Pour all of the ingredients into the pitcher.",
      "content": "Pour all of the ingredients into the pitcher. Remove the pitcher from the fridge and pour in 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of vodka, 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of orange juice, 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of cranberry juice, and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of peach schnapps. Although the liquids should mix on their own, you could stir them with a long spoon if you like. [2] X Research source Since you're using a lot of fruit juice, you can use an inexpensive vodka for the drinks. For smoother cocktails, use pulp-free orange juice."

      "title": "Set out ice and highball glasses.",
      "content": "Set out ice and highball glasses. Fill an ice bucket and set it near the pitcher of sex on the beach. Then, set out up to 8 highball glasses. Tell your guests to fill their glass with ice and pour the cocktail over it. It's important to set the ice on the side instead of in the pitcher since the cubes would dilute the drinks too much."

      "title": "Set out garnishes for your guests.",
      "content": "Set out garnishes for your guests. Although orange slices and maraschino cherries are classic sex on the beach garnishes, you could put out a variety of sliced fruit. For example, let your guests choose from: [3] X Research source Orange slices Thinly sliced pineapple Sliced star fruit Mango slices Lemon or lime twists"

      "title": "Make a pitcher of non-alcoholic sex on the beach.",
      "content": "Make a pitcher of non-alcoholic sex on the beach. If there will be kids at your party or people who don't drink alcohol, mix a pitcher of sex on the beach that doesn't have alcohol. All you need to mix together is: [4] X Research source 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of lemon-lime soda 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of orange juice 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of cranberry juice 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of peach nectar or juice"

      "title": "Use a different liqueur instead of peach schnapps.",
      "content": "Use a different liqueur instead of peach schnapps. One of the easiest ways to customize the flavor of sex on the beach cocktails is to use something other than peach schnapps. Try using 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of melon liqueur with 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of Chambord, for a fruitier drink. You could also substitute the schnapps with: [5] X Research source Coconut rum liqueur Apple schnapps Cherry liqueur"

      "title": "Substitute pineapple juice for the orange juice.",
      "content": "Substitute pineapple juice for the orange juice. To give your cocktails a slightly different flavor, use pineapple juice. Although you could try other fruit juices in place of the orange juice, the juice needs to be slightly acidic to balance out the sweet peach schnapps. [6] X Research source If you prefer sweeter cocktails, use your favorite juice even though these won't be traditional sex on the beach cocktails. Try the cocktails with pomegranate juice, grape juice, or lemonade, for instance."

    {
      "title": "Use rum or tequila instead of vodka to give the cocktails more flavor.",
      "content": "Use rum or tequila instead of vodka to give the cocktails more flavor. Vodka is known for being a strong alcohol that's flavorless. If you'd like your cocktails to have a warmer, richer flavor, use your favorite rum or tequila. For even more flavor, try a spiced rum. [7] X Research source If you're not sure if you'll like the substitution, play around with using half vodka and half rum or tequila."

      "content": "Blend the ingredients to make a large batch of sex on the beach slushies. Instead of putting all of the ingredients into a pitcher, pour them in a blender and add 2 cups (280 g) of ice. Put the lid on the blender and blend the mixture until all of the ice is crushed and the slushie mixture is smooth. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that slushie cocktails melt faster than traditional sex on the beach cocktails."
