      "content": "Use a caulk-style, waterproof compound to repair hairline cracks. A caulk-style liquid concrete repair compound is affordable, easy to apply, and the best choice for hairline cracks smaller than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) wide. Find a waterproof liquid concrete repair compound online or at a home improvement store. It'll hold up against the elements, help keep out water, and prevent the crack from reforming.

If necessary, chip away any thick deposits of concrete or old sealer with a small hammer and chisel. [2] X Research source If the crack is outdoors, such as in your driveway, work during dry weather. A stretch of at least 1 to 2 dry days is ideal."

      "content": "Sweep, vacuum, or blow away any remaining dust. After scrubbing the cracked area, sweep away dust with a broom, or remove residue with a shop vac. You could also use a canister of compressed air to blow away fine surface debris. [3] X Research source A power washer can loosen and blow away debris all in one go. However, you'll need to allow the cracked area to dry completely if you use one. Liquid concrete repair compounds can only be applied to dry surfaces."

Snip about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) off of the tip, then run a continuous bead of compound along the crack. Make another pass with the caulk gun if the first bead didn't fill the entire crack.

      "content": "Smooth the caulked surface, then let it cure for 4 to 6 hours. Run a 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) putty knife along the sealed crack to remove excess compound. Level the surface with the surrounding concrete, then allow the compound to cure for at least 4 to 6 hours, or as directed. [5] X Research source After smoothing the compound, wipe your putty knife promptly with mineral spirits before the epoxy begins to set. In addition to repairing floors and driveways, you can also use this method to seal hairline cracks in walls. For wider wall cracks, on the other hand, your best option is an epoxy injection kit."

      "content": "Fix a 1 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32 to 0.64 cm) wide crack with an epoxy injection kit. Purchase a concrete repair kit that includes a 2-part epoxy (an unmixed compound), caulk-type epoxy cartridges, and liquid concrete repair injection ports. The injection ports are small nozzles that help you fill the inside of the crack with sealer. You might need to purchase injection ports separately; you'll need 1 port for every 12 in (30 cm) of crack length."

Use separate sticks or putty knives to scoop the 2 epoxy parts onto a small scrap board. Mix the parts until you've achieved a uniform color, apply small dabs to the bottoms of the ports, and slide a port over each nail. The flat ends of the ports should be flush with the wall, and the nozzle ends should stick out. The nails align the injection ports with the crack. If you don't have finishing nails handy, use pins, toothpicks, or thin coffee stirrers. The 2 parts of the epoxy compound are stored in separate containers. After they're mixed, the parts cure and form a hard material. For this reason, scoop out the parts with separate sticks or putty knives to avoid contaminating one container with the contents of the other."

Use a putty knife or trowel to cover the crack and the ports' bases with a 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) layer of epoxy. Spread the compound 1 in (2.5 cm) on either side of the crack, and level it with the surrounding surface. [8] X Research source Check your kit's instructions for right amount of compound for the crack's surface area. Mix until you've achieved a uniform gray color. Be sure to scoop out each part of the epoxy with separate sticks to avoid contaminating the containers."

After 4 to 6 hours, or when the surface compound is hard, place a caulk-style cartridge of epoxy in the cradle of a caulk gun. Snip 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) off of the tip, then insert it into the nozzle of the lowest injection port. Squeeze the trigger to inject the compound until epoxy starts oozing out of the port above the one you're filling. [9] X Research source The epoxy injection port kit includes small plastic caps that fit into the ports' nozzles. After you've injected a port, insert a cap into its nozzle. Then repeat the process to inject the compound into each of the ports."

Then use a hacksaw to cut off the ports' nozzles where they meet the wall or floor. Patch the spots where you sawed off the necks to disguise your work and ensure the crack is watertight. Mix a small amount of 2-part epoxy, apply a dab over the cut spots with a putty knife, and level the epoxy with the surrounding surface."

Vinyl concrete patcher works best on wider cracks in horizontal surfaces, so it's perfect for broken steps. [10] X Research source Specific instructions may vary, so read your product's instructions carefully. Vinyl concrete repair compound will also work on wide, deep driveway and floor cracks. While you can use it to patch large cracks in a wall, you'd need to apply it in 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) layers and allow each layer to cure before the next application."

Additionally, use a wire brush to rough up any smooth surfaces within the crack. Then sweep, vacuum, or blow away any remaining dust and debris. [11] X Research source If you have a pressure washer, feel free to use it to prep the cracked stairs since the compound you'll use in this method needs a damp surface. It shouldn't be completely soaked, so mop up any puddles with an old rag."

Cut the plank wide enough to span the cracked area, or use multiple planks. Place the plank against the broken step, then set a brick against the plank to keep it in place. [13] X Research source The plank will act as a form and help ensure the repair compound takes the shape of the step."

While they're more convenient, they're typically more expensive than dry products, which you mix with water. If you go with a dry product, mix it with clean water in a separate bucket using the recommended mixing ratio.

Set times may range from 15 minutes to several hours, depending on the product, temperature, and moisture level. After the patch begins to harden, carefully remove the wood plank and the brick that held it steady. [16] X Research source The patch hasn't cured, so take care not to disturb it. If necessary, gently run the trowel over the patch to level it with the surrounding concrete."

Avoid rolling wheeled objects (such as a hand truck) over the patch for 3 days. [17] X Research source The instructions may call for damp curing in hot, dry, or windy weather. If necessary, cover the patch with a clean sheet of plastic for 24 hours to damp cure it."
