[3] X Research source There are four main skin types: Normal: This is considered the best skin type. It is has a good oil/water balance, with no impurities, or fine lines. Dry: This skin type has very tight pores, due to lack of oil. While it will not have any impurities, it tends to mature faster, and develop fine lines faster. Combination: Parts of the face are oily, while other parts are dry(usually the T Zone((the forehead, nose, and chin area))is the oily part, while the cheeks are the dry part). Oily: this skin type, has an overabundance of oil. Although this skin type matures the slowest, it usually has a shiny surface and multiple impurities."
