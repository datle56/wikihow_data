      "content": "Gather, or make, your materials. You can purchase specialty origami paper from most craft stores or online , or you might consider making your own origami paper . So that your fireworks look bright and festive, and to get this effect you'll want your origami paper to be brightly colored on one side and white on the other. You'll need 12 square sheets of paper. For the best arrangement of colors, you might use two sheets each of the following: Red paper Orange paper Yellow paper Green paper Blue paper Purple paper Folding bone (for sharp creases; optional)"

      "content": "Use a folding bone, if you desire. A folding bone is a tool that is used in paper crafts to help make sharp, crisp creases while preventing strain to your fingers. To use a folding bone, press it firmly along the lines of your folds. Some homemade folding bones can be fashioned from: A metal spoon An old credit card A flat paperweight"

Lay the papers so that the white sides are face up, and then turn the stack so that the squares of paper form a diamond shape in front of you. [1] X Research source Then: Fold your papers vertically so that a crease runs from the top to the bottom corner, then unfold and smooth. Fold your papers horizontally so that a crease runs from the left to the right corner, then unfold and smooth. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source To form your blintz fold: Take a corner and fold its tip to the center of your paper where your first two creases cross. Repeat this until all four corners of your paper have been folded so the corners meet in the center. Unfold your blintz fold and smooth your papers."

[9] X Research source Take your left and right quadrants and: Tuck the paper inward, toward the center. The folds that you have previously made should allow the paper to collapse into the shape of a triangle. Crease your waterbomb base sharply. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source"

A squash fold is where you fold your paper up into the air and then smush it down to form a crease that often reveals some of the opposite side of the paper's color (in this case, white). [12] X Research source Along the inside of your triangular waterbomb base, there should be creases in the shape of an upside down triangle. From the downward facing point of that inner triangle: Pull the bottom edge of your waterbomb base up so that the downward facing point of your inner triangle is touching the upward point of your waterbomb base. As you pull the bottom of your paper toward the top, you may need to pull the corners of your triangle inward. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source Turn over your paper and repeat the process. At this stage, your paper should be a solid triangle shape on top, with two \"legs\" at the bottom of the triangle that are unconnected."

Use a squash fold by lifting the bottom of one leg of your paper so that it's bottom folds in line with the bottom edge of the base of the triangle at the top of your paper. [15] X Research source [16] X Research source Repeat this process with the other leg of the same side of your paper, then turn your paper over and then perform this fold again.

If you have been folding your sheets individually, you won't need to separate your papers, but if you have been folding six at a time, you'll need to separate these to move forward. Stack your finished, folded papers into like piles, one with the colored side out and the other with the white side out. [18] X Research source Be sure your colors correspond between piles.

Then fold the top of your paper down so that the flat top edge is even with the base of the now inverted triangular shape.
