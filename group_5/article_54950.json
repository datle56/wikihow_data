      "content": "Exfoliate to help fade your tan. Exfoliation is the process of removing dead skin cells from the top layer of your skin, which can help get rid of awkward tan lines faster. When the dead skin cells are scrubbed off, your tan can lighten and restore your skin tone. Use a gentle exfoliating cleanser or scrub with a loofah . [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source How often you exfoliate depends on your skin type and sensitivity. Stop exfoliating if your skin becomes red or irritated. It may take several exfoliation treatments before you begin to notice a difference, so be patient. Avoid using a loofah if you have a sunburn, as it could damage your skin."

      "content": "Soak in a milk bath. Taking a bath with whole milk could help naturally exfoliate and soften your skin, helping the farmer’s tan fade faster. The milk in the water can help soften dead skin cells and make them easier to fall off, resulting in a more even tan. Draw a bath and add a cup or two of milk to the warm bath water. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stay in the bath for no longer than 15 or 20 minutes. The best milk for this DIY solution is whole 2% milk from a cow, as milk alternatives may not have the same effect."

      "content": "Rub lemon juice and sugar on your skin. Some people have found success using this method to fade tan lines, although it isn’t officially tested by dermatologists, so proceed with caution. It may work because lemon juice is a natural skin brightening agent and sugar has exfoliating properties. [4] X Research source For this remedy, cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice in with some sugar. Apply the mixture to a washcloth or your fingertips, and rub it against your skin using circular motions. Avoid the sun for at least an hour after doing so, or you may get a darker tan."

      "content": "Apply a self-tanner to the sections of your skin that didn’t get tanned. This is the safest way to disguise a farmer’s tan! Simply choose a self-tanning product with an added moisturizer that’s a light tone, as this can help blend in any awkward tan lines. Then, use the product on your non-tanned skin as instructed on the packaging. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source It may be tempting to match the self-tanner to your tanned skin areas, but if the colors don’t match up exactly, it could make your tan lines more obvious. Gradual self-tanners take about one week to work, but they will look the most natural. If you don’t like how the self-tanner looks, don’t worry! Tareen suggests removing it by rubbing on white vinegar, letting it sit for 10 minutes, and then rinsing."

      "content": "Get a spray tan from a professional. Spray tan specialists use an airbrush to gently apply fake tan to blend in your skin tones in a semi-private atmosphere. These tans can last about 2 weeks and fade away at the same rate as your natural tan.

      "content": "Go to a tanning bed. Tanning beds can create a consistent, full-coverage tan all over your body. While this is a good way to conceal a farmer’s tan and even your skin tone, it’s also the most risky. Tanning beds emit the same UV rays as the sun, which can lead to skin damage and cancer, so use them at your own risk. [7] X Research source In a tanning bed, you can control which areas of your skin are exposed to UV rays and for how long. This allows you to match the tone of your skin more accurately.

      "content": "Prevent a farmer's tan with sunscreen. The best way to protect your skin and stop unwanted tan lines from forming is to wear SPF 30 or higher. Tareen notes, even after you get a tan, continue applying sunscreen to protect your skin (and so your tan lines don’t become even darker). It takes 30 minutes for sunscreen to absorb into your skin and start protecting you. [8] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If you know you are going to be outside in the sun all day, continuously apply sunscreen to your exposed skin every hour to prevent a farmer’s tan."

      "content": "Wear different cuts of clothing every day. Odd tan lines happen when you have long sun exposure in a specific cut of clothing. By mixing up what you wear, you can expose different parts of your skin to the sun and help even your skin tone. [9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Try alternating between a tank top and a T-shirt to avoid getting a tan line across your arm and neckline. Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeve shirts or pants to protect your skin from the sun."

      "content": "Stay out of the sun from 10 AM to 2 PM. As Tareen says, “The most natural way to fade a sun tan is to reduce the amount of sun exposure to the skin.” The sun and its powerful UV rays are at their strongest during the afternoon hours. Because of this, it’s easier to tan or burn between the hours of 10 AM and 2 PM. If you find yourself outside during these hours, try standing in the shade as much as possible.
