      "content": "Dab a dish soap mixture onto the stain with a clean cloth. In a large bowl or bucket, pour 2 cups (0.47 L) cups of warm water, along with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dish washing liquid and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of white vinegar. [1] X Research source Dip a clean cloth into the cleaning mixture, wringing out the cloth to avoid saturating the carpet. Gently press onto the stain with the cloth instead of rubbing it, which could embed it deeper into the carpet fibers."

      "content": "Blot the stain with a dry cloth as you clean. After applying the cleaning mixture onto the hair dye stain, use a clean, dry cloth to blot the area. This dry cloth should soak up some of the dye loosened by the cleaning mixture. Alternate between applying the cleaning liquid and blotting it up with the dry towel until the stain disappears. Be sure to use a cloth that you don't mind getting dirty."

In a bowl or bucket, mix 2 cups (0.47 L) of warm water with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of dish soap and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of ammonia. [2] X Research source Dip a clean cloth in the ammonia solution and wring it out. Dab it onto the hair dye spill until the entire surface of the stain is covered. [3] X Research source Try an ammonia solution if cleaning with dish soap, vinegar, and rubbing alcohol does not work to remove hair dye from your carpet. Open doors or windows to create ventilation while you use this solution, which can cause poisoning. [4] X Research source"

If you don't have an eyedropper, you can also carefully apply the hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon. Note that hydrogen peroxide may strip your carpet of its color, so this should be used as a last-ditch method after trying other options."

If the hydrogen peroxide causes discoloration to your carpet, purchase a felt-tip fabric marking pen at a craft store that closely matches your carpet color. Apply the color in light strokes to the faded part of the carpet until the color is fully applied. Let the area dry for 24 hours and apply more color if necessary. [9] X Research source Test the marker on a piece of fabric first to see the actual color."
