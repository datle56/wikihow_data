    {
      "title": "Be prepared.",
      "content": "Be prepared. Reading Homestuck is no easy feat, and will take a large amount of time. Set aside time just as you would for reading every novel, but be prepared to set aside much more of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read it on a computer.",
      "content": "Read it on a computer. Homestuck uses Flash, which means that it has interactive games, videos, and the like. A mobile or tablet doesn't support Flash, which means that you won't be able to fully enjoy the comic if you read it by those means."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take notes.",
      "content": "Take notes. Homestuck is filled with important details, and missing one could make you really confused. Write a few sentences for every 50 pages, then you'll understand it pretty well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't skip anything!",
      "content": "Don't skip anything! There are several 'rules' to reading Homestuck. Don't skip the intermissions. Don't skip acts. Don't skip Pesterlogs. Don't give up, either, even when it seems incredibly dull. Details in Homestuck are everything! Though Act 1 may initially seem long and convoluted, it acts as an overture for the work as a whole, and is filled with plenty of important details."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid spoilers.",
      "content": "Avoid spoilers. Most spoilers can be found on Tumblr, the MSPA wiki, and YouTube. While it can be difficult to avoid, the payoff is definitely worth it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Reiterating; Do not skip over anything!",
      "content": "Reiterating; Do not skip over anything! Ever! No matter how useless or boring a part might seem, it is incredibly relevant. This applies to PesterLogs, Intermissions, comic links and the videos. The Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff comics are optional, but they're a short read and are referenced many times throughout the comic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Homestuck is best enjoyed with the sound on.",
      "content": "Homestuck is best enjoyed with the sound on. You get the full experience when you are simultaneously listening to the epic tracks that will sometimes be on a couple pages of the comic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy the comic.",
      "content": "Enjoy the comic. Long chunks of text may drag you down, but they are filled with wit and incredible writing. Don't let the sheer size of the thing intimidate you, and just enjoy the work as it is."
