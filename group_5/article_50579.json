You should try to get your boyfriend in a romantic mood first, and lower the pressure with a few slower, warm up kisses first. Make these a few soft pecks after it's clear he's in the mood to kiss. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Perhaps your boyfriend will start French kissing you without being asked if you seem receptive enough during the first kisses. The best approach is to wait a bit and see if it happens on its own. You will know he wants to kiss you when you make eye contact, and one or both of you moves closer to the other. Tilt your head to the side, and part your lips. Gently draw one of your boyfriend’s lips between your own as you kiss so your lips interlock a bit. Don’t be afraid to tilt your head a bit as this will signal renewed interest. You could say, \"Let's go slow\" to be clearer to your boyfriend, especially if he is inexperienced at kissing or you are. You could also acknowledge your nervousness by saying something like, \"Hey, I'm a little nervous. Are you too?\" He may appreciate your honesty. Remember, he might be just as nervous as you are. If he's a more experienced kisser, telling him something like, \"I love kissing slowly at first\" can help set the mood."

      "content": "Rub your tongue over your partner’s lips. Because French kissing involves kissing with tongues, if you rub your tongue over your partner’s lips, it will give him the signal that you’re OK with French kissing. Do this lightly because it will be romantic to your partner and a bit teasing. That’s good. Sometimes your boyfriend might feel insecure and is looking to see if you’re all right with it. You could say something like, \"You have really nice lips\" as you rub your tongue over them, looking him briefly in the eye. Feel free then to gently push the tip of your tongue into your partner’s mouth. If your partner has any experience, he will probably then move his tongue deeper into your mouth."

Find the right place and time, which is when you are both alone and comfortable with each other. It might feel embarrassing at first, but he will probably appreciate your honesty, and it might excite him to think that he will be the first person to French kiss you. It's a good idea to have this conversation before you actually are kissing. Find a casual way to say it. For example, while you're driving in a car or eating dinner together, you could say, \"This is hard for me to say, but I've never French kissed before! Maybe you can show me how later.\" Don't make it overly serious. You could also start the conversation with a question by asking him if he knows how to French kiss. This might entice him to show you how to French kiss. Remember that the best relationships are built upon a foundation of strong communication anyway. It's best to wait until you've been dating for a little bit before you have this conversation, though."

Breathe through your nose when kissing. Try not to get saliva all over him. When you’re done with kissing him, wind it down back to the little warm up kisses rather than just suddenly stopping."
