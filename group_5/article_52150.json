      "title": "Hold your dog by the collar to keep it steady.",
      "content": "Hold your dog by the collar to keep it steady. Your dog may be a little resistant to having its ears wiped out. Try sitting on the floor with your French bulldog between your legs or on your lap. Hold its collar with 1 hand and use the other hand to wipe out its ears. Keep treats nearby, and give your dog a treat at the beginning and end of the process. If your dog will not sit still and you are having a hard time cleaning its ears, position it with its butt in the corner of a room and its side against a wall. Then, sit on the other side of your dog to keep it still. [1] X Research source Ask a friend or family member to help you if possible!"

      "title": "Wipe out the visible parts of your dog’s ear with a moist paper towel.",
      "content": "Wipe out the visible parts of your dog’s ear with a moist paper towel. Wet a clean paper towel with ear cleaning solution and wring out the excess so that it is just damp. Then use the paper towel to wipe out the visible parts of the inside and outside of your French bulldog’s ear. [2] X Research source This is a great way to keep your dog’s ears looking their best without irritating them. If you are mostly concerned about surface dirt, wiping your dog’s ears with a damp paper towel may be all you need to do. Never use water to wipe out your dog's ears! It causes the skin to soften and swell, which puts your dog at risk of infection."

      "title": "Wet a cotton ball with ear cleansing solution.",
      "content": "Wet a cotton ball with ear cleansing solution. Only use ear solution that is made specially for dogs. Squirt enough ear cleansing solution onto a cotton ball to wet it. It should be wet all the way through, and it is okay if there is some excess solution dripping off the cotton ball. [3] X Research source Don’t worry about getting ear cleaning solution in your French bulldog’s ear canal! Your dog will shake it out after you finish cleaning its ears. [4] X Research source You may need multiple wet cotton balls to clean out your dog’s ears. Soak 1 at a time and wet a new 1 after 1 has visible dirt and debris on it."

      "title": "Wipe around the outside of your dog’s ear canal with the cotton ball.",
      "content": "Wipe around the outside of your dog’s ear canal with the cotton ball. Press the cotton ball against the inside of your French bulldog’s ear and wipe around the visible parts. Wipe the outside of the ear canal to clean any dirt and debris at the opening, but do not push the cotton ball down into your dog’s ear canal. [5] X Research source Repeat with as many cotton balls as needed to get your dog’s ears clean. Never push a cotton ball, cotton swab, or other item into the inside of your dog’s ear! This will push the debris further into your dog’s ear. You may even puncture your dog’s eardrum, which would be painful for your dog. Take your dog to a veterinarian if you are concerned about debris trapped in your dog’s ear canal."

      "title": "Let your French bulldog shake out the excess solution.",
      "content": "Let your French bulldog shake out the excess solution. After you have finished wiping around the outside of your dog’s ear canal, release your dog’s ear and let your dog shake out any solution that has run down into their ear canal. Your dog may also shake out some debris from the inside of its ears in the process. [6] X Research source Move away from your dog quickly to avoid getting splashed with the excess solution and debris! You can let your dog shake its ears for as long as needed, but it should only take a few minutes."

      "content": "Wipe your French bulldog’s ear with a dry paper towel or cloth. After your dog has had a chance to shake out its ears, use a dry paper towel or cloth to wipe around the inside of your dog’s ears. Make sure that the inside of your dog’s ears are completely dry. [7] X Research source Don’t skip drying your French Bulldog’s ears! Wetness can lead to bacteria, fungus, and infections, so it is very important to keep your dog’s ears dry! After you have finished cleaning and drying 1 of your dog’s ears, repeat the process on the other ear. Make sure to reward your dog with a treat after you are finished with each ear!"

      "content": "Position your dog in the corner of a room if it will not sit still for you. Cleaning the inside of your dog’s ears is a bit hard and it may not want to stay still for you. Positioning your dog in a corner and using your body to keep your dog still will help to make the process easier on both of you. Your French bulldog’s butt should be in the corner and its side should be right up against the wall. Sit on the other side of your dog to help keep it still while you clean its ears. [8] X Research source Since your dog will shake solution and gunk out of its ears when you clean them, you may want to do this outside, such as on your patio. If you clean your dog’s ears indoors, make sure there is nothing around that would be damaged by ear cleaning solution or debris, such as food or delicate clothing. Ask a friend to help you by holding your dog steady! This will free up both of your hands to clean your dog's ears."

Pull it upwards gently to help open up the ear canal. Hold the ear in this position with 1 hand while you clean the ear with your other hand. [9] X Research source French bulldogs have large ears. Holding the earflap while you clean each of your dog’s ears will help you get cleansing solution deep into the ear canal for a thorough cleaning. If your dog shows signs of pain when you do this, such as whining or yelping, then stop and take it to see a veterinarian. Your dog may have an ear infection."

You can keep squirting it in until it runs out your dog’s ear. [11] X Research source Keep the tip away from your dog’s ear. If it touches your dog’s ear, wipe it off with an alcohol pad.

[12] X Research source Massage your dog’s ear canal for 20 to 30 seconds. [13] X Research source You should hear a squishing sound as you massage your dog’s ear canal. This is the solution moving around inside your dog’s ear. Your dog will probably not like this part. Make sure to talk to your dog while you massage its ear and offer praise, such as by saying, “What a good dog!” or “Almost done, buddy. Good job!” You could even give your dog a treat at this time."
