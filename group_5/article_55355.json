      "content": "Add 1 spoonful of boric acid to a fire-safe bowl. Boric acid is a powder that’s commonly used as a pesticide. [1] X Research source When it reacts with fire, it turns the flames green. Simply pour some boric acid into a ceramic, stainless steel, cast iron, or other fire-safe bowl. [2] X Research source Tip : If you can’t find pure boric acid, use a pesticide that contains boric acid . Alternatively, use Borax in place of boric acid. This household cleaner also turns flames green."

      "content": "Pour 1 spoonful of methanol into the bowl and mix the ingredients. Methanol is a type of alcohol that acts as the fire’s fuel. Simply add 1 spoonful of methanol into the bowl and mix the fuel and Borax together. [3] X Research source Tip : If you can’t find pure methanol, use an antifreeze that contains it, like HEET . Methanol is commonly used as engine fuel or antifreeze for vehicles. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Light the fire with a lighter or match. Put on a pair of fire-resistant gloves and safety glasses . Then, hold a lighter or lit match over the bowl to ignite the methanol. Watch as the flames immediately react with the boric acid and turn a brilliant green! [5] X Research source As the methanol burns away, the flames typically get duller and smaller. When you want more green flames, extinguish the fire and add more methanol. Then, ignite the fuel. Boric acid doesn’t burn, so you don’t have to add more. Warning : Light the fire outside or in a well-ventilated room. Borax and boric acid can potentially be irritating and lead to coughing when inhaled.

      "content": "Green flames burn at temperatures from 1,000 to 1,400° C (1,800-2,500° F). Green flames are typically the same temperature as orange and yellow flames, which run at around 1,000 to 1,400° C (1,800-2,500° F). This is because the green color comes from chemical additives and isn't an indication of heat on its own. White flames are generally the hottest flames, burning at 1,400 to 1,600° C (2,500-2,900° F).
