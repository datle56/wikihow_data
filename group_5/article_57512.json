Use a large white Paintbrush to quickly erase any details that you don't want to see. Use a black Paintbrush to fill in areas of white to make solid black spaces. You can use the Crop tool to quickly cut out large chunks of the image that you don't want to use."

      "content": "Link any islands of white space. When you cut and print the stencil, you will be cutting away the black spaces to paint through. This means that if there are isolated details in white, they will need to be connected to the rest of the white space so that you can cut it properly. Use the white Paintbrush to quickly connect your islands to the rest of the white space.

When you're finished, all that should be left are the white parts of the image, with empty space where the black parts were."
