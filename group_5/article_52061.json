      "content": "Fill a cup with isopropyl alcohol. To clean and sanitize your lipstick, you’ll need a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, which you can find at any drugstore. Pour enough into a plastic cup so you’ll be able to easily submerge the lipstick into it. [1] X Research source Isopropyl alcohol comes in different percentages. For cleaning your lipstick, 70% is usually the best option. It’s strong enough to kill the bacteria and germs that might be present on the lipstick, but won’t evaporate as quickly as higher concentrations."

      "title": "Apply a layer of petroleum jelly to your lips.",
      "content": "Apply a layer of petroleum jelly to your lips. When you’ve removed the top layer lipstick with the tissue, spread a thick layer of petroleum jelly over your lips like a mask. Allow it to sit on your lips for 1 to 3 minutes, leaving it on the longest for dark, matte lipstick shades. [5] X Research source If you don’t have any petroleum jelly on hand, you can also use coconut oil or baby oil. However, apply just a thin coat to your lips or you may wind up with lipstick-colored oil running down your chin."

      "content": "Wet a cotton pad and use it to wipe your lips. When you’ve let the petroleum jelly sit on your lips for a couple of minutes, take a cotton pad and dampen it with warm water from the sink. Wipe the pad over your lips with firm pressure to remove the remaining lipstick. [6] X Research source Don’t use cotton balls to wipe your lips. They’re usually too fuzzy and can wind up sticking to your lips. Be careful when you’re wiping the cotton pad over your mouth to make sure that you don’t rub it beyond your lip line -- you can wind up smearing lipstick on your face that way. It helps to “wrap” the pad around your index finger to keep it confined to the lip area."
