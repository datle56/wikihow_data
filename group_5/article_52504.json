      "content": "Divide the number of seconds by 3,600. Note that there are 3,600 seconds in one hour. [2] X Research source So, if you have more than 3,600 seconds, your conversion will be greater than 1 hour. If you have less than 3,600 seconds, your conversion will be a fraction of an hour. For example, 2 , 400 3 , 600 = 0.6667 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2,400}{3,600}}=0.6667} . So, 2,400 seconds is equal to 0.6667 hours. As another example, 5 , 600 3 , 600 = 1.5556 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5,600}{3,600}}=1.5556} . So, 5,600 seconds is equal to 1.5556 hours."

      "content": "Convert your decimal to minutes. This step is helpful if you are working with a number of seconds equal to less than an hour, so that you can gauge how long a certain decimal is. To convert the decimal to minutes, multiply it by 60. [3] X Research source For example, 0.6667 × 60 = 40 {\\displaystyle 0.6667\\times 60=40} . So, 2,400 seconds is equal to .6667 hours, or 40 minutes. For your second example, you have 1 whole hour, plus 0.5556 of an hour. So, you only need to convert 0.5556 to an hour: 0.5556 × 60 = 33.336 {\\displaystyle 0.5556\\times 60=33.336} . So, 5,600 seconds is equal to about 1 hour, 33 minutes."

To find the factor of change, divide the number of seconds you are converting by 60, the number of seconds in the unit rate. Note this factor, but do not write it in your chart. For example, if you are converting 9,000 seconds, you would calculate 9 , 000 60 = 150 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {9,000}{60}}=150} . So, the factor of change is 150."

The unit rate is 60 minutes per 1 hour. [6] X Research source Use the number of minutes you are converting, instead of the number of seconds, in this table. For example, if you converted 9,000 seconds to 150 minutes, you are now converting 150 minutes to a number of hours. In your table, you need to find the factor of change from 60 minutes to 150 minutes. Since 150 60 = 2.5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {150}{60}}=2.5} , your factor of change is 2.5. Multiply this by 1 hour. 1 × 2.5 = 2.5 {\\displaystyle 1\\times 2.5=2.5} . So, 9 , 000 seconds = 150 minutes = 2.5 hours {\\displaystyle 9,000\\;{\\text{seconds}}=150\\;{\\text{minutes}}=2.5\\;{\\text{hours}}} ."

To do this, multiply the decimal by 60: .4444 × 60 = 26.664 {\\displaystyle .4444\\times 60=26.664} , or about 26 minutes. So, 12,400 seconds is equal to about 3 hours and 26 minutes."
