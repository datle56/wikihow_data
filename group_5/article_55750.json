[1] X Research source If the new relationship is super solid and there aren’t a ton of hang-ups on the previous partner, then the relationship can last a long time. If the new relationship is shaky and there are a lot of hang-ups on an ex, then it might not last very long at all. Rebound relationships tend to fail after the honeymoon stage , which typically lasts between 2 and 3 months."

      "content": "There are lots of comparisons to an ex-partner. When someone isn’t over their ex, they will often compare their new partner to their previous partner. If you’re the one who went through a breakup, try to note every time you note the similarities or differences between your ex and your new partner. If you’re not the one who went through a breakup recently, keep an eye out for your partner making comparisons between you and an ex. These comparisons can often be difficult for a new partner to hear. No one wants to be reminded of their partner’s ex constantly, and they especially don’t want to hear how they might not be measuring up to them."
