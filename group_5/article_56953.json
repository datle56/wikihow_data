There are many ways you can prepare flavourings: Use powdered drink mixes: The key to this type of flavouring is to have it come out very concentrated and very sweet. A simple way to do this is mix 2 cups of sugar and Â¾ cup of water in a pan. Heat the mixture to a full boil and remove the pan from the heat. Then add the powdered drink mix like Kool-Aid into the liquid. Cut up fruit: Fruits are great when paired with some sugary liquid like condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, or just plain sugar water. Use soft fruits cut into bite-sized squares like mangos, peaches, strawberries, berries, passion fruit, bananas, and kiwis. Use syrups: You can purchase syrups specifically designed for shaved ice or snow cones. There are variety of flavours that you can drizzle onto your shaved ice.

      "content": "Shave your ice. You can purchase machines that make shaved ice or make your own shaved ice with a sturdy blender or food processor. Create shaved ice with a blender by pressing the \"crush\" button for about a minute. If the mix is too thin, add more ice; if too thick, add more liquid. Crush ice thoroughly, then press blend until it is blended to your desired consistency. If your ice cubes are too large, blend small amounts of ice thoroughly until you've created a powdered like consistency. It may be helpful to get a bag and crush the ice in it with a rolling pin beforehand."
