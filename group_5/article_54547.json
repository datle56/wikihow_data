Put on your wrap dress and pin it where the dress crisscrosses at the waist. Push the safety pin through the under-layer of fabric instead of all the way through, if possible, so the safety pin isn’t visible.

      "content": "Hold your neckline exactly where you’d like it using double-sided tape. [5] X Expert Source Shaelynn Haning Professional Tailor & Business Owner Expert Interview. 30 August 2023. Purchase double-sided tape made specifically for clothing so that it sticks to your skin properly without causing irritation. Put on your dress and cut a strip of the tape. Place the tape along the inside edge of your dress’s neckline before pressing it down on your skin to keep it in place. [6] X Research source Double-sided tape for clothing can be found at a big box store or online. The tape will attach right at the neckline's hem in a V-shape. This is a great option if your neckline is too low."

      "content": "Attach a snap button to the neckline to hold it together. Put on the wrap dress and decide where you’d like the snap button to go so it holds your neckline together without pulling too much. This is usually where the bottom of the V-shape is in your dress's neckline. Mark this with a safety pin and sew the bottom of the snap button on the bottom layer and the top of the button on the top layer by pulling a needle and thread through the holes of the snap button parts. If your neckline is way too low, move the snap button up about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the V-shape. Snap the button into place and enjoy your dress’s new neckline. Snap buttons can be found at a local craft or big box store. Use a snap button to fix a neckline that's too low or gaping."

      "content": "Sew a hook-and-eye clasp onto the neckline for a permanent solution. These clasps are a little more noticeable but will hold your neckline together similar to a snap button. Position the clasp where the fabric gapes or put it higher than the V if the neckline is too low. Sew each piece onto one side of the wrap dress’s neckline by looping a needle and thread through the holes in the clasp pieces. Once it’s sewed on, put on your dress and hook the clasp to show off your new neckline. [7] X Research source Look for hook-and-eye clasps at a craft or big box store, along with a needle and thread to attach them to the dress. Hook-and-eye clasps will fix gaping necklines as well as necklines that are too low."

      "content": "Wear the wrap dress over a camisole or slip for a quick fix. Pick out a camisole or slip that matches your wrap dress and wear it underneath so you don’t have to worry about your neckline. Wearing a modest layer of clothing under your wrap dress is a great way to fix a neckline that's gaping or too low. Choose a cami or slip that’s the same color as your dress so it blends in seamlessly. Slips or camisoles with V-necks are best since your wrap dress has a V-shape too."

      "content": "Let a lacy bra peek out from your dress to add texture. If your neckline is just a little too low, letting a little bit of lace show can be a nice way to cover up more skin while still creating a stylish look. Pick out a lacy bra or bralette that matches your wrap dress and wear it under the dress to show off some contrasting textures. [8] X Research source For example, you might wear a black lace bralette under a black, blue, and white floral wrap dress."

      "title": "Add lace or ribbon to the neckline to make it more modest.",
      "content": "Add lace or ribbon to the neckline to make it more modest. Purchase strands of lace or ribbon that match your wrap dress. Measure the neckline's length and cut the lace or ribbon so it’s long enough to go around the entire neckline. Use a needle and thread to attach the ribbon or lace to the edge of the neckline, making the neckline taller. Sew the ribbon or lace onto the inside of the dress so the stitching isn’t super visible. [9] X Research source Choose wide ribbon or lace for more coverage. If you have a sewing machine, you can use this to attach the ribbon or lace instead."

      "content": "Take in the shoulder seam to fix a big neckline gape. Undo the sewed seams in each shoulder of your wrap dress using a seam ripper or scissors. Pull up the fabric so that the neckline is slightly shorter and sew the shoulder seams back together at the new fabric points. Use sewing pins to hold the seams in place as you sew them. [10] X Research source Try your dress on to see how much fabric you should take in at each shoulder seam before pinning it, if you'd like."

      "content": "Create a drawstring gathering to make your neckline smaller. If you don't mind part of your neckline looking scrunched up, this is an easy way to bring the neckline in so it fits you better. Sew a straight stitch along the area you'd like gathered, such as near the shoulders or at the base of the 'V' shape. Tug on the fabric to scrunch it up before knotting your thread so the fabric stays in place. [11] X Research source Use thread that matches the color of your wrap dress neckline so it blends in well."

      "content": "Use stay tape along your neckline to keep it from stretching out. Take out the stitches in your neckline's hem and cut strands of stay tape that fit along each edge of your neckline. Secure the stay tape using steam or its sticky coating in a straight line along the fabric's edge before folding it over into the neckline. Stitch the fold together so your wrap dress looks just as it did before, but it now has stay tape to keep it from stretching. [12] X Research source Use a straight stitch or zig-zag stitch to hold the folded neckline hem in place. Some types of stay tape need steam for them to adhere to the fabric while others already have a fabric glue on them."

      "content": "Make darts in the fabric to remove excess fabric so the neckline fits. Take out the stitching of the entire bodice of your wrap dress so that you can lay the front flat. Mark the fabric where you'd like to create the darts and cut a slim triangle on either side of the chest area to form them. Pinch the fabric together to gather the material and sew the triangle together so there isn't any empty space anymore. [13] X Research source Put your wrap dress on and create two darts on either side of your chest by pulling the fabric into an overlapping triangle with your fingers to see how big the darts need to be. Sew the wrap dress bodice back onto the dress once you're finished making the darts."
