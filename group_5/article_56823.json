      "content": "Use an online generator for the simplest way to make bingo cards. Generators allow you to add custom words or pictures, and they’ll create randomized cards on their own. Some bingo card generators are free to use, but others require you to register an account. Some of the best sites for generating bingo cards include: My Free Bingo Cards allows custom text and theming for free. Bingo Baker allows you to add words or images to your custom bingo card for free. OSRIC gives you free basic tools for adding a custom word list and creating simple black-and-white bingo cards. Print Bingo is free and gives you options to add words only to specific columns on the bingo card, plus they have pre-generated word lists you can use. You can also pay a one-time fee of $12 for premium features, like saving your designs or adding serial numbers to your bingo cards. Canva lets you add words or pictures for free, and it allows a lot of customization for how your bingo card looks. However, you have to make an account first."

      "title": "Type in a title for the cards and the words to fill the spaces.",
      "content": "Type in a title for the cards and the words to fill the spaces. Look for a text box near the top of the generator with a phrase like \"Card Title.\" Click on the text box and type in the name of your bingo card, such as \"Adam's Bingo Card\" or \"Volunteer Fire Department Bingo Tournament.\" After that, find the text box that says something like “word list” and enter all of the words you want for filling the bingo boxes. [1] X Research source Each generator is a little different, but you’ll usually separate different words, numbers, and symbols with a comma. Then, the bingo card generator randomly assigns the items into separate boxes. Example : If you want to make an animal bingo game, your word list may read, \"bat, bird, turtle, deer, hippo, dog, cat, bear, lion.....\" You can also list numbers (3,5,17,24,56,78,....etc.) and symbols ($,&,*,%,@,....etc.) as options for your bingo card."

      "title": "Decide whether or not you want a free space.",
      "content": "Decide whether or not you want a free space. On many bingo cards, there is traditionally a \"free space\" where the person playing gets to place a chip down before the game begins. Look for the option on the bingo card generator asking whether or not you want a free space on your bingo card. Click on either \"Yes\" or \"No.\" The generator may ask you to fill in the text of the free space. This could be something simple such as \"Free Space\" or you can write in custom text, like “Mark this spot!” Most of the time, free spaces are placed in the center of a bingo card, but some generators let you decide where you want the free space."

      "content": "Choose the size of your bingo card. Bingo cards are traditionally laid out in a 5 X 5 block grid. However, you can change the size based on the number of words you have or the length of the game you want. Find the size option on the generator, and enter in the number of rows and columns you want your bingo card to have. You can even make bingo cards with elongated rectangles rather than the normal squares if you want."

Then click on the button that says \"Generate Bingo Cards\" or something similar. The generator will connect with your printer and print the cards so the options are randomized on each one. When your computer pulls up your print box, make sure to change the paper position to Landscape to fit more cards on a single sheet. Because bingo cards get pretty beat up over the course of numerous games, print out your custom cards on cardstock rather than traditional printer paper. Consider getting your cards laminated if you want them to last for a long time. Companies like FedEx and UPS typically offer laminating services."

Make the square large enough that you’ll easily be able to write or draw inside of it. Plan out how many rows and columns you want for your bingo board so that you can plan your measurements. For example, if you make a standard 5 x 5 bingo card, draw each side so it’s 10 inches (25 cm) long. That way, the rows and columns easily divide into 2 in × 2 in (5.1 cm × 5.1 cm) squares."

Put a term in each square depending on what theme you’re using for your bingo game, such as \"dog\" or \"moose\" if you’re doing animals. If you want more of a classic bingo game, fill the bingo card with numbers instead. For a more creative game, you can also put in pictures of terms. Example: If you are making a bingo card for your Spanish classroom, you can put in Spanish words on the bingo card. When you play, then call out English words so students have to mark the correct Spanish word on the bingo card. Don’t be afraid to decorate the card as well. Give the bingo cards a title and draw designs surrounding the actual square if you want. Feel free to be as creative as you can imagine!"
