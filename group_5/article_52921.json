      "title": "Comb your sideburns in the direction your hair grows.",
      "content": "Comb your sideburns in the direction your hair grows. Use a fine-toothed comb to smooth and align your sideburns. Follow the grain of the hair. While that typically means combing downward, keep in mind sideburn hair angles slightly toward the ears for some people. Combing before cutting gives you the best perspective on your sideburns' length, thickness, and evenness. Additionally, running a comb through your hair will detangle it and make it easier to trim."

      "title": "Choose a clipper guard that matches the surrounding hair length.",
      "content": "Choose a clipper guard that matches the surrounding hair length. Even if you want your sideburns to end up shorter than the hair above, start by clipping them to the same length. If you’re not sure which guard to use, try a higher numbered one, like #4 or #5. You can always trim more hair with a lower numbered guard, so it’s better to start with a higher number. Guards also usually have corresponding hair lengths marked on them, such as 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) for #4. You can measure the surrounding hair with a ruler to determine its length and choose the correct clipper guard. Clipper guards usually simply snap onto the end of the clippers."

      "title": "Clip from the bottom up to blend your sideburns evenly.",
      "content": "Clip from the bottom up to blend your sideburns evenly. Turn on the clippers and place the flat side of the guard against the back of your upper cheek. The tips of the guard’s teeth should be just below your sideburn. Glide the clippers upward then, once the teeth are roughly parallel with the top of your ear, angle the trimmer up and away from your face. Repeat this maneuver 2 or 3 times to make sure you don’t miss any stray hairs. If you have a longer hairstyle, pull the trimmer away when it's roughly in line with your ear canal instead of going to the top of the ear. You'll also need to take a few extra steps to part your hair and create sections to trim into sideburns."

    {
      "title": "Fade the bottoms of your sideburns with a lower numbered guard.",
      "content": "Fade the bottoms of your sideburns with a lower numbered guard. If you want to taper your sideburns, or make them shorter than the rest of your hair, switch to the next lowest numbered clipper guard (for instance, from #3 to #2). Make the same upward gliding motion, but stop in line with or just above your ear canal. That way, the upper portion of your sideburns above the ear canal will blend into the surrounding hair, while the lower portion will be thinner. Try to angle the clippers away slowly to create a seamless transition between hair lengths. If you’d like, you can create multiple taper lines for a more gradual fade. Divide your sideburns into thirds, and thin each third with next lowest guard (for instance, from #3 to #2 to #1)."

      "title": "Use your fingers to trim your sideburns to even lengths.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to trim your sideburns to even lengths. Look straight into the mirror with your head level and chin parallel to the floor. Place your index fingertips against both sideburns at the points where you want them to end. Then choose features on your face that line up with your desired sideburn length to keep track of where to cut. [1] X Research source Using your ears as markers may seem like an obvious option, but most people have uneven ears. If you trim your sideburns to your earlobes, they may actually end up at slightly different lengths. [2] X Research source If your face is round, keep your sideburns longer, or roughly in line with your earlobes, to elongate your features. If you have an oval face, trim your sideburns shorter, or about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) above your earlobes, to balance your longer facial features. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Shape the bottom edges and sides without a guard. Place the guardless trimmer against a sideburn at your desired length to define the bottom. Pull the clippers straight downward to create the bottom edge, then trim the other side. For a classic look, make the bottoms of your sideburns parallel to the ground. If you want to mix things up or accentuate the lines of your cheekbones, try angling them downward. If necessary, carefully shape your sideburns by trimming stray hairs along the sides. Hold the tops of your ears away from your head and pull your skin taut to reach the spots between your sideburns and ears."

      "content": "Clean up the sidelines at your temples if you have a lineup. A lineup is a haircut in which the hairline is sharply defined into straight sidelines at the temples and curved, C-shaped arches that frame the browline. Using a guardless razor, define the straight edges of your hairline that run from your temples toward your browline. [4] X Research source If your hair is starting to grow out and you’re handy with clippers, you can also trim and fade the hair around your temples and neck. Use gradually lower numbered guards to taper your cut. For instance, trim hair around the temples to around 2 inches (5.1 cm) above the ear at #2, then switch to #1 for hair below that line. To blur out fade lines, angle the clippers so only the bottom third of the blade touches your head. If you’re not confident, just shape your lineup and sideburns and don’t worry about fading."

      "content": "Create C-shaped arches from the sidelines toward your ears. Continue to shape your hairline and sideburns with a guardless trimmer. Begin the C-cut arch where your natural hairline curves back from above your browline toward your ear. If you can see where the barber shaped your C-cuts, follow those lines and trim hair that’s grown in since your last haircut. [5] X Research source If you’re shaping a C-cut on your own, remove hair bit by bit to avoid making a mistake. Gradually shape your hairline from above your outer eyebrow to your sideburn in a defined curve. Look in the mirror and hold your head level and still to help keep your cut even. It’s also wise to use both a wall mirror and a hand mirror so you can see the sides and back of your head."

Otherwise, continue shaping the C-cut along your natural hairline to the back of your upper cheek. Trim the hair on both sides of your sideburn to shape it into a line that gets gradually thinner as it runs down toward your jaw. [6] X Research source Remember to remove hair little by little to avoid making a mistake. If you have a detail trimmer or attachment, use it to carefully clip the hair around your ears."

[7] X Research source If you’re not sure how long you'd like your sideburns, start by cutting them longer, or roughly in line with your earlobes. If you want them shorter, trim them about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) above the earlobe. After adjusting a sideburn's length, you may need to trim carefully on each side to keep the point sharp and defined."

The right guard size depends on your desired length, but using a #3 or #4, or 3 ⁄ 8 to 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.95 to 1.27 cm), is a good start. Hold the hair above the part behind your ear as you thin out your sideburn with the trimmer. Press the trimmer to the bottom of the sideburn, move it upward toward the part, then angle it up and away from your face.
