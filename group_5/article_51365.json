[7] X Research source The interest rate is usually shown as an annual figure; which is why it needs to be divided by 365 to reach the daily interest rate. For example, if your principal to invest is $10,000, and your savings account offers .5 percent annual interest, enter \"10000\" in cell B1 and \"=.005/365\" in cell B2. The number of periods determines how long your investment will remain in the account untouched, except for the added compounding interest."
