      "title": "Change your hair.",
      "content": "Change your hair. Hair is incredibly important for visual identification, and should be the first step in creating a drastic difference between the old you and the new you. Simply changing one's hair color goes a long way in making a person less recognizable, but if you aren't willing to dye or get highlights, a new haircut works too. Bushy or shaggy haircuts and bangs/fringe have the added benefit of obscuring more of your face. Try styling your hair differently: if you have long hair that you usually leave down, put it in various updos."

      "content": "Your face is another very important aspect of your look. Do it differently. If you don't usually wear eye makeup, use some eyeshadow and liner to obtain a smoky eye look. Similarly, if you do wear makeup regularly, cut it back to moisturizer and chapstick. Change your lipstick shade (e.g., from light pinks to red; from dark shades to a sheer gloss). Start or stop using blush. [1] X Research source If you typically remain clean shaven, try growing your facial hair out (These can make a huge difference in your appearance). [2] X Research source If you typically style your facial hair, try going for a full beard; if you let your mane run wild, try a more controlled look (Restrict your beard to stubble or a chinstrap, perhaps). Eyebrows also can have a huge effect on what you look like. If yours are neatly groomed and shaped, let them grow out for a bit. If you let them go, try plucking a bit at them. Bleaching or penciling them are other options for modification. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Change the way you dress.",
      "content": "Change the way you dress. Often, each person dresses uniquely and this is a way to tell people apart. If you mindlessly throw clothes on and don't pay much attention to style or fashion, this would be a good time to start. [4] X Research source People tend to have distinct approaches to light outerwear, which contributes significantly to a look. Zip-up jackets, hoodies, sporty windbreakers, (cropped, full, loose, or snug) cardigans, wraps, pullover sweaters, flannel, plaid shirts worn as a top layer over tees--all of these result in very different looks. If you normally dress down in light, distressed jeans or sweatpants and sweatshirts, printed tees or crop tops/tank tops, take the formality up a notch with darker jeans and less casual looking tops. Perhaps this means polos or dress shirts, perhaps it means blouses with some sort of frills or camis under blazers; this varies, depending on gender, regional trends, and what looks good to you. Similarly, if you usually try to look put together, try a hoodie, old jeans, and a quick ponytail (if female). Vary your fit. If you dress in slim-fitting, snug clothes, try some flowy or loose styles, and vice versa. Throwing a baggy button-up sweater over tight outfits is a good way to change a fit."

      "title": "Wear different shoes and accessories.",
      "content": "Wear different shoes and accessories. This includes jewelry. To alternate styles, wear no jewelry, dangling jewelry, jewelry of different colors and stones, etc. If you default to sneakers, try some non-athletic slip-ons or flats. If you usually wear sandals, get some more formal-looking closed toe shoes. Try to incorporate less ubiquitous styles of footwear, such as boots or heels, into your look, unless you already vary your style; in that case, cut it back to casual trainers."
