      "content": "Keep a good credit score. Your Credit Score depends on how responsible you are when playing the game. Do not go AFK, be toxic to your teammates, or intentionally feed. When the system detects that you are ruining the game experience for others, it will deduct your credit score and not give you battle rewards. Having the highest credit score of 110 increases the weekly BP limit up to 8,500 BPs weekly. If you currently have Credit Scores less than 100, each successful match gives 1 point. For 100 Credit Scores and above, each 7 successful non-AFK match gives 1 point."

      "content": "Activate double Battle Point Time and Win cards. There are 2 types of double BP cards that can be used in-game: double BP time and double BP wins. You can activate the two at the same time allowing you to get up to 3x the battle points each game if you win. These don't only speed up BP farming by adding 100% additional BPs after every match. They also increase the weekly BP limit by +1,500. That means a weekly limit of up to 10,000 BPs with a double BP card and 110 Credit Scores. Make sure to only use the double BP card with a maximum credit score, or your weekly BP limit may not increase to 10,000. Double BP Cards can be obtained from in-game events such as the Mentorship Program, and Starlight Membership."
