      "content": "The goal of every Spot It! game is to find 2 matching symbols. Each of the 7 Spot It! minigames involve 2-8 players comparing (at least) 2 cards and racing to find the 1 symbol that appears on both cards. The player who spots it first says it out loud, then performs an action with it, like taking it or discarding it, depending on which minigame you’re playing. [1] X Research source The winner of the minigame is the player who’s spotted the highest number of identical symbols by the time the cards are gone. Any time you spot a match, call it out by saying the name of the symbol. For example, if you spot 2 snowflakes, say, “Snowflake!”"

You might even play a Spot It! tournament, which starts with The Tower. After the player who wins each minigame chooses the next, and players compete in a total of 5 minigames. Count the points as follows: [2] X Research source In The Tower , give each player 1 point for each card they collect, and the winning player an additional 5 points. In Twins , award 1 point for each card collected. In The Well , award 10 points to the first player who runs out of cards, and deduct 20 points from the last player standing. In Catch ‘Em All , award 1 point for each card collected. In Hot Potato and deduct 5 points from the person who loses the round. In The Poisoned Gift , award 20 points to the player who got handed the fewest cards, and give 10 points to the player who came second. In Triplet , award 1 point per card collected, and 5 points to the player with the most cards."

      "content": "Twins This is the easiest game to play. Start by arranging the cards into a face-down pile. Then, take the 2 cards off the top of the pile and, at the same time, flip them over so every player can see. Players then try to spot a symbol that’s present on both cards. When they do, they call it out, and take the 2 cards for themselves. A new round starts with 2 new cards. [3] X Research source Win the game by collecting the most cards by the time the pile is gone, signaling the end of the game."

Then, on the count of 3, each player flips over their card and compares it to the card in the center, trying to find the matching symbol. When you do spot it, call it out! [4] X Research source Then, take the center card and put it on top of your own card, and keep looking for matches using your new card and the new center card—the game doesn’t stop! Win the game by having the most cards in your personal pile once there are no more cards in the center pile."

On the count of 3, each player flips over the top card of their pile and searches for a symbol on their card that matches a symbol on the center card. When you spot it, call it out! [5] X Research source When you call a match, place your top card face-up in the center. The game continues as players try to make matches with this new card. Win the game by being the first player to place all the cards in your personal pile into the center."

On the count of 3, each player flips one of the face-down cards, then examines every card at the table for a symbol that matches with the center card. When you see a matching symbol, call it and take the card, then flip over a new card from the deck to take its place as you continue to play. [6] X Research source Win the game by collecting the most cards by the time there are no more cards in the deck, signaling the end of the game. Note that in this game, the center card never changes and stays put for the whole game. Players only take the cards around it."

      "content": "Hot Potato Start by dealing each player 1 face-down card, then decide how many rounds to play—5 is a good number. On the count of 3, flip your card and compare it to the other players’ cards. If you spot a match, call it out, then place your card face-up on top of the matching player’s card. The round ends when a single player holds all the cards. That player sets the cards aside, then deals another round. [7] X Research source Win the game by collecting the fewest cards at the end of all the rounds. If you’re holding more than 1 card (after a player has given you theirs), use your top card to make matches, and hand the other player all your cards when you spot a match."

On the count of 3, flip over your card and look at other players’ cards to find a match with the center card. As always, if you spot it, call it! Then, grab the center card and place it face-up on that player’s card. Keep playing until there are no more cards in the center.

As soon as all 9 cards are on the table, each player tries to spot the same symbol on 3 different cards. When you spot a set of 3, call it out and take the 3 cards that share the symbol. Replace them with 3 new cards from the deck and continue playing. [9] X Research source Win the game by collecting the most cards by the time there’s no more cards in the deck, fewer than 9 cards on the table, and no possible matches, which signals the game’s end."
