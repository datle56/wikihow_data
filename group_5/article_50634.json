      "content": "Pisces men tend to have artsy souls and admire creativity. Combine a love of the arts with an emotional and spiritual side, and you have a man who will definitely appreciate the work you put into making something just for him. Don't worry if it's not a masterpiece! If you don't have a lot of artistic skill, just keep it simple. [8] X Research source For example, if he writes or draws in journals, you might buy a journal for him, then decorate the cover."

      "content": "Both of you tend to be types who are \"in love with love.\" As a Libra, you're likely no stranger to cooking up the grand gesture to snag someone's eye, and a Pisces loves to feel like he's been swept off his feet. Don't be afraid to go all out and let your feelings be known. [9] X Research source For example, you might engineer a scavenger hunt with little notes hidden in various places that lead him to you, sitting on a park bench. If he's an athlete, you might show up to one of his games and hold up a sign for him. Look to rom-coms for inspiration as well! Maybe show up outside his window blasting a love song, à la Say Anything , or serenade him with a song ( The Wedding Singer , Top Gun , 10 Things I Hate About You ). The Pisces man also has a tendency to be shy at first, so a grand gesture can help him open up. At the same time, he's attracted to confidence, making this a win-win for you! [10] X Research source"

Walk slowly through the museum, taking time to talk about each piece together and describe how it makes you feel. [11] X Research source Look for moments of inspiration in pieces you see. The two of you might decide you want to take an art class together to learn a particular style or find out more about the methods used to create the works you like the most."

      "content": "A Pisces man typically enjoys any place that feels magical. Do you have a special place you go to be alone, to journal, meditate, or gather your thoughts? Maybe you know of a special corner in your favorite park where time seems to standstill. If you show your spot to a Pisces fella you've got your eye on, he'll appreciate its mystical quality. [12] X Research source For example, you might take him on your favorite hike which ends at a beautiful overlook. Or follow a trail to a \"secret\" waterfall that most people don't know about. The more private and secluded your spot, the better—a typical Pisces man loves places where he feels like he can commune with nature or be one with his surroundings."

      "content": "Use this opportunity to share inspiration and be creative together. The typical Pisces man is an artistic, creative soul with imagination to share, so painting or crafting together is a great way to capture his heart. [13] X Research source As a Libra, you're probably drawn to art and beauty as well, so you'll thrill to see what you two can come up with. There are many art studios that have couple's classes where you can try painting, sculpting, or even glass blowing together, then take home your piece as a souvenir of the experience. If you're not particularly artistic yourself and he is, level out the playing field a bit by choosing something neither of you has done before. While he might still have an edge, you'll both get to experience something new and you won't have to worry about him outshining you too much. Remember, even if your creation doesn't turn out like either of you envisioned it, it's still special because it's yours—and on top of that, you have a fun story to share about it."

      "content": "Pisces men often need solitude to clear their heads. Don't take it personally if your Pisces guy needs time alone—it's not that he doesn't like being with you. He just needs time to think. [14] X Research source This shouldn't be too hard for you if you're the typical Libra lady and want time to go out and do things on your own. [15] X Research source For example, you might go out shopping with some friends while he sits at home alone and reads a good book. Afterward, you can get together and show him what you bought and listen while he tells you about the ideas he got from his reading. Pisces men tend to prefer partners that aren’t super social. And, if a person they’re dating is more social than them, Pisces men like for that partner to be able to expend their social energy with other people in their lives so that they can recharge. Reader Poll: We asked 708 wikiHow readers who are Pisces, and only 4% said their biggest deal breaker is their partner being less social than them . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Don't expect a Pisces man to reveal everything about himself right away. Pisces tends to be pretty secretive, but this doesn't mean he's hiding something bad from you, cheating on you, or anything like that. As much as he cares for you, it takes him a lot of time to open up. [16] X Research source Try not to pry into things either—let him tell you what he wants to tell you. If you ask too many questions, he'll start to think you don't trust him. For example, if he doesn't text you all day and you ask him about it, accept his answer at face value. He's likely to get upset if you keep poking at him or try to argue that he still could've texted you. When he sees that you're willing to respect his privacy, he'll open up more."

There might be some days where you think, \"What would he do without me?\" Things that you probably think are important, such as organization and cleanliness, your Pisces might be content to shrug off. But at the same time, he'll appreciate all the little things you do for him so he can devote more energy to big ideas. [17] X Research source Your Pisces guy might have a hard time making and sticking to a schedule or planning ahead for things. Just keep in mind he can be easily overwhelmed by mundane details. If you're willing to pick up the slack for him a little, you'll both come out on top."

If this sounds like your fella, a relaxing couple's day at the spa will leave him swooning. [18] X Research source If you're the typical Libra lady, you love indulging yourself. [19] X Research source If you have a regular spa appointment, bring your Pisces guy along—he'll love feeling like you're letting him in on your life."

[20] X Research source You know those social media \"aesthetic\" posts you love, close-ups of fingers entwined as a couple looks out at an awe-inspiring vista or the socked-feet propped up in front of a roaring fire? Your Pisces guy likely loves that imagery just as much as you do. For example, you might book a weekend at a quiet beach resort in the off-season, so it can just be the two of you. As a water sign, your Pisces guy is going to thrill to be at the shore, but being alone with you makes the whole thing even greater. Even better, both signs are known to be adventurers, so trying new things and making memories together will make you both happy. [21] X Research source"
