Most states allow individuals to apply for a learner's permit when they are 14, 15, or 16 years old. Research the requirements for a learner's permit in your state and pass the test before you start driving practice.

While you are logging practice hours, do not drive with children under 18 in the car. If you get pulled over, you may face legal repercussions.

Record the date, start time, and end time of each practice on your log to keep careful track of your progress. Try to record your practices in the log on the same day that they happen to keep the information as accurate as possible. If you practiced driving on November 3rd from 7-7:30 PM, for example, you would record the date as \"11/3/20xx,\" the start time as \"7:00 PM,\" and the end time as \"7:30 PM.\" Some driver's logs also require you to record the weather conditions during your practice session. You might put, for example, \"sunny,\" \"rainy,\" \"snowy,\" \"foggy,\" or \"windy.\""
