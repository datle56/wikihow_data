The opening line establishes the topic of your email, so you can be simple and concise—save the details for the body of your response. If they’re a bigger client, you may want to mention your company name in the opening line. For example, you could say, “As your representative for Accenture, I want to thank you for sending me a formal farewell email.”"

      "content": "Include the exact date their contract terminates. Most companies require you to include the last day of service as part of their policy, so be sure to clearly state the month, day, and year. To avoid any confusion, place this date at the start of the second body paragraph or in a separate section/block. [5] X Research source To directly state the date, you could say, “Please note that your contract with us terminates on May 4, 2023.” You can also embolden the text to draw extra attention to it. If you’ve experienced miscommunication with the client in the past, you may want to request a read receipt through your email provider (or set one up to know if your email was read )."

[6] X Research source Close your business email with “Wishing you all the best,” “Kind regards,” or “Best wishes” for a warm yet professional salutation. Create a professional email signature for a cleaner look at the end of your response. If your company had a negative experience with the client, you don’t have to add your contact information.

If you had a bad relationship with the client, be grateful that you no longer have to work with them. If you had a great experience, reflect on all the wins you shared with the client"

Through your customer relationship management tool, check in with the client to see if there’s an opportunity to reconnect.

From there, you can gently offer to solve their problem by discussing the benefits of your service and reminding them of your former wins together. [12] X Research source When interacting with clients , be sure to demonstrate kindness and generosity. If your old client isn’t in a financial position to work with you again, provide them with helpful resources, such as links and personal recommendations. If a former client recently experienced a life event, like a promotion or marriage, congratulate them to open the conversation in an organic way. This allows you to slowly transition into a business discussion. If you’re emailing them out of the blue, you could start by saying, “How’s business?” or “Is there anything you’ve been struggling with this year?”"
