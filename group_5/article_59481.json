If you feel like you’re about to act out, take a second. You don’t need to do anything right now.

You might say, “This is coming to me as a total shock, and I’m really not sure why you’re doing this. I feel like you could at least explain your reasoning here.” You could even say, “I’m exceptionally upset right now. I thought things were going really well with us. What went wrong?” Alternatively, you could play it cooler with something like, “I had a suspicion something like this might happen. I understand, and I’m sure this is for the best.”"

If there are unresolved questions surrounding your relationship, or you want to know more about why they’re breaking up with you, ask. Some people prefer not knowing—and that’s fine if that’s how you feel—but if the curiosity is going to keep you up at night, go ahead and ask. Richer suggests, “Another way that you can respond is to try to better understand what is happening. If it feels like a surprise to you, maybe you weren't aware that the relationship had issues because your partner wasn't communicating with you. See if there's an opportunity to communicate about what the underlying issues are.” [5] X Expert Source Laura Richer Licensed Mental Health Counselor Expert Interview. 24 September 2021. Don't expect them to change their mind, but see if you can understand where they're coming from. You could ask the standard questions like, “Did you meet somebody else?” and, “Why are you breaking up with me?” Asking, “Is there something I did?” is totally okay, but keep in mind that it opens the door for them to take the blame off of themselves. Don’t let them! They’re breaking up with you—you didn’t do this to yourself. Other common questions might include, “What went wrong?” or, “What do you think we could have done differently?” This may also be a good time to make plans to get your belongings or discuss the living situation if you share a home."

It’s understandable that you have an impulse to get defensive and try to compromise over this. But unfortunately, no good can come from it. If they agree, you’re in a relationship where you know the other person wants to break up, and if they don’t agree, then you may just feel worse about yourself for trying to talk your way out of it."

I enjoyed our time together,” or, “I don’t love that you chose to do this over text, but I get it. I’ll look back fondly on our relationship.” If they’re being especially cruel, just hit them with “K,” or, “Alright, when can I come to get my stuff from your apartment?” If they’re going to act like a child, just don’t engage; they’ll feel way worse about this later on."
