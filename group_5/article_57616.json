You will be experiencing more disappointment and irritation than normal. You can handle it. Put yourself in the right mental space to do so. Accept the reality of your situation to empower yourself emotionally. [1] X Research source Practicing acceptance is a good way to feel better about your situation. As the Serenity prayer states, “Change what you can and accept the things you cannot change.” Stay calm and recognize that you will recover. This will make the recovery process go more smoothly, and allow you more pleasure along the way. Recognize that you have an opportunity to organize your time and energy however you’d like to do so. Though it may seem forced, tell yourself that you have the freedom to choose how you’re going to benefit from (and enjoy!) your new found time. Try meditation, deep breathing, and practicing mindfulness to help you stay calm."

However you choose to do so, the important thing is to get some type of exercise despite your injury. For instance, you can use exercise tools such as weights or resistance bands, or go for a walk (with crutches! – instructions in this article). Be sure to stretch after doing any kind of physical activity. [2] X Expert Source Catherine Cheung, DPM Board Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020. You can do upper and lower body stretches while sitting."

Perhaps the best way is with a vacuum, which can draw air through the porous material that makes up your cast, forcing fresh, dry air to replace it and refresh your skin. You can buy vacuum attachments designed for this purpose, or simply try the attachments you may already have. You just need something of a seal between the vacuum hose and the wall of your cast."

There are some surprising facts associated with bone recovery in particular. Some helpful points to know: You may actually need to increase your caloric intake. This may seem odd, since you’ll likely be more sedentary with a broken ankle. However, bone recovery processes sometimes lead to increased metabolic demand, so much so that your ideal caloric intake will be much higher than normal. If you’re your metabolic demand is not met by your caloric intake, your healing process may be slowed. Eat more protein. Research has indicated that even small increases in protein consumption will speed up your bone’s recovery process. Make sure you’re getting your nutrients. Zinc, calcium, copper, phosphorus, magnesium, and silicon are particularly important to bone health and recovery. Take your vitamins. In fact, step up your vitamin intake. Whereas protein and minerals provide the materials with which bones are rebuilt, vitamins make it happen. Vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin K, and the B vitamins have been proven to play a role in this process."

      "content": "Learn how to use crutches. If you want to walk around while wearing a cast or splint – and you should – you’re going to need to use crutches. Crutches will help with both balance and stability, and will allow you to walk without putting pressure on your injured leg. In order to walk safely on crutches, be sure to wear a rubber-soled, non-slip shoe on your strong, uninjured leg. [13] X Research source Place your weight on your uninjured leg, and grip your crutches comfortably. Move each crutch forward simultaneously. Take care not to hit your injured ankle. Place the crutch about a foot in front of you, a bit wider apart than your shoulders. Lean your weight into the support of the crutches and step forward with your uninjured leg. The crutches will hold you during the step, until you land on the same leg you stepped forward with. Only your uninjured leg should ever touch the ground. Turn by pivoting on your good foot, and never let your injured ankle touch anything. Go slow! Repeat the process until you’ve arrived wherever you want to be."

Your crutches could help here – they can act as a second foot to help stability. To sit down: Hold both crutches in the hand corresponding with the side of your body with an injured leg, putting your weight on your strong leg and weak-side crutch. (If you are unable to hold both crutches in one hand, set your strong-side crutch down within reach.) Reach back with your free hand and grab something firmly attached to whatever you’re going to sit down on. Sit down slowly."

(If unable to do so, set the crutch up in such a way that you will be able to easily reach it while maintaining stability once standing.) Use your free hand to help push yourself from your seat as you stand up with your uninjured leg. Carefully balance on your strong, uninjured leg as you position a crutch in each hand."

Until then, sit down and move yourself up and down stairs one at a time. It may feel silly, but it will feel less silly, and less painful, than re-injuring your leg or busting your other ankle! Once you’re ready to use your crutches on stairs: [14] X Research source Up: Step up with your strong leg first, then bring the crutches up at the same time, one in each arm, placing them on either side of your body. Down: Place your crutch ends on the next step down, one in each arm, a bit wider apart than your shoulders. Move your weak leg forward and down, without resting weight on it. Move your strong leg down last. With handrail: Hold the handrail with one hand if you feel more stable. Hold both crutches on your other side in your other hand.

Products like IcyHot use menthol and methyl salicylate to cause the skin to feel cool and then warm. This effectively distracts your sense of feel away from the ache or pain beneath the surface of your skin. Use IcyHot only on the skin. Do not use IcyHot on your face or in your nether-regions. Do not touch those areas of your body when IcyHot is on your hands. Apply a thin layer to the uncomfortable area up to 4 times a day, but no more. Rub the ointment into your skin gently, but thoroughly. Wash your hands after applying this medication. Do not use IcyHot, Biofreeze, or Bengay on skin that is cut, scraped, sunburned, or otherwise injured. Do not use this medication in proximity to activities or environments that will increase your skin temperature. Since there are many products similar to IcyHot available at varied strengths, always read your medications’ labels and consult a doctor with any questions."
