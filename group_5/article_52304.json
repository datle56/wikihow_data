      "content": "Condition, rarity, and noteworthy stories make some comics valuable. Like any collector’s item, there are a variety of factors that influence how much a comic book may be worth at auction. Take a look at these key aspects: An important or novel storyline: Issues that provide backstories for major characters, describe pivotal plot points in the context of a series, or reflect important pop culture or political moments of the time may be valuable. [26] X Research source Condition: The better the condition, the higher the value (especially if it’s graded as near mint or mint). However, exceedingly rare comics with some defects may still be more valuable than more common ones in great shape. [27] X Research source A “first”: A comic that features the introduction of a new character or that is the first issue in a volume or series is often more valuable than other issues. These are also called “key issues.” Age: In the US, comics published before 1970 (during the Gold and Silver Ages of comic books) are the most valuable. Very few modern comics are considered valuable (with one exception being 2003’s The Walking Dead #1 ). Signatures: If an issue is signed by its author or illustrator, it may be worth more (especially if the creator isn’t known for signing things very often). Rarity: If it’s hard to find, it may be worth a lot! This is especially true of Golden Age comics, sometimes printed in batches as small as only 200,000 copies."

Consider the following: [32] X Research source Comic collector sites, auction sites like eBay, or social media: These options are great if you want to sell whole collections or large quantities directly to a buyer. Factor shipping costs into your asking price, though, because it can be prohibitively costly.
