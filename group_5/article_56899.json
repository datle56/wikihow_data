    {
      "title": "Gather the ingredients.",
      "content": "Gather the ingredients. For this method, you’ll need 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, ⅓ cup of peanut butter, ⅓ cup of cocoa powder, and 1 tablespoon milk. You won’t need any cooking supplies besides a large bowl in which to mix the ingredients. The ingredients will form a dough that you mold into fake poop. [1] X Research source The peanut butter you use can be creamy or chunky. Chunky peanut butter can add a little texture to the eventual product. If you’ve only got creamy peanut butter, but want to add some texture, you can include some chopped nuts of any kind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the ingredients in a large bowl.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients in a large bowl. There’s no special order in which you need to add ingredients. Just throw them in as you’d like. Spend about 2 minutes stirring with a large spoon until all the ingredients are well-mixed. The color should be a dark brown and you shouldn’t be able to spot any constituent ingredients. If the mix seems too thick for shaping, add more milk until it feels malleable enough to mold into pieces. If it seems too runny, consider adding a bit more cocoa powder or peanut butter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shape the mix.",
      "content": "Shape the mix. Once all the ingredients have been combined and mixed in with one another, you’ll want to begin to mold your fake poops. The size is entirely up to you, though it’s important to keep it reasonable if you’d like the fake poop to be believable. Depending on the size of your mold, this mix should yield six to eight separate pieces. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Set aside to dry.",
      "content": "Set aside to dry. Once you’ve molded all the individual pieces, set them aside on a large plate, uncovered, to dry. Due to the milk used in the mix, the pieces will still be a little moist for use. There’s no precise amount of time you will wait; continue checking the pieces until you feel they’re dry enough to handle. These fake poops contain dairy products. You’ll want to make use of them within the day. If you want to make them last longer, refrigerate them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a bowl with water.",
      "content": "Fill a bowl with water. In this method, you’ll need only a cardboard toilet paper roll (with the toilet paper gone) and some water. To begin, fill a relatively large bowl with water. Be sure the temperature of the water is comfortable enough to put your hands in. You could also fill a sink for quick drainage later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the cardboard roll.",
      "content": "Open the cardboard roll. On your toilet paper roll, you should see that it is formed by a spiral glued to itself. Generally, the ends of the spiral will be pointed tips at either end of the toilet paper roll. The cardboard should be soft enough that you can rip it yourself, undoing the glue and unfurling the paper roll into a cardboard sheet. [3] X Research source If the cardboard doesn’t seem to want to budge, don’t hesitate to get scissors and simply cut the roll lengthwise in half."
    },
    {
      "title": "Submerge the paper roll.",
      "content": "Submerge the paper roll. Take the now open cardboard roll and push it to the bottom of the bowl of water. You’ll most likely need to hold it at the bottom with your hand. Allow a minute or so for the cardboard roll to fill with water. Once soaked, it will be pliable and capable of molding into your fake poop. Don’t fret if the cardboard ends up ripping. Once you begin the mold, you can simply stick the fallen pieces back on. The only concern is pieces falling off once the mold dries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mold your fake poop.",
      "content": "Mold your fake poop. Remove the cardboard from the water. You may need to hold it above the bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess water to fall off. The cardboard is best molded by laying it flat in your hand and squeezing into a closed fist. This will compress the cardboard into your fake poop. [4] X Research source Like the previous method, this fake poop is also used best shortly after its creation. Otherwise, the cardboard may dry out and begin to crack and fall apart. You may be able to make your fake poop last longer by sprinkling a bit of water over it as it begins to dry."

    {
      "title": "Collect your ingredients.",
      "content": "Collect your ingredients. For this method, you’ll need a 1/2 cup of white glue. Elmer’s glue is the go-to here or any other white school glue. You'll also need about 1 teaspoon of brown paint or brown food coloring, 1/2 a cup of warm water, and 1 teaspoon of borax powder. You’ll need two containers for mixing, at least one of which is fairly large for the final mix. [5] X Research source If you have neither brown paint or brown food coloring, use chocolate syrup. You will need a slightly higher amount of chocolate syrup than you would brown paint or food coloring. This is not the method to use if you think there’s any risk of anyone or any pet eating the fake poop. Borax, while not deadly in small amounts, is still harmful and very upsetting to the stomach."
    },
    {
      "title": "Combine your ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine your ingredients. First, in the large bowl, (which will eventually contain the entire mix), combine the 1/2 cup of white glue and whatever you’re using as brown coloring. Add color until you have your desired hue. In another container, mix your borax and water until the borax is visibly dissolved. Once both individual mixes are complete, combine them in the larger bowl, stirring constantly as you do so. You should immediately notice the mixture begin to thicken and become more viscous, almost like pudding."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knead the mixture for about a minute.",
      "content": "Knead the mixture for about a minute. The mixture, once combined, quickly becomes too thick to be mixed by hand and must be kneaded like dough. Using your hands, take the borax dough and push into it, pull on it, and remove it from the walls of the bowl. It should be ready for molding once you’ve formed it into a ball, with no mixture remaining on the sides of the bowl. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Form your fake poop.",
      "content": "Form your fake poop. Again, the ultimate size of the fake poop(s) will be up to you. This one can be used altogether as a single lump or broken into individual pieces. Prank-wise, this fake poop is best to be stepped in, as it matches texture with the real thing closer than a lot of other methods will allow."
