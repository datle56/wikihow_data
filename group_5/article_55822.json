      "title": "Tell your spouse what happened.",
      "content": "Tell your spouse what happened. Lying is a major part of cheating, which is why it’s important to be honest about the affair moving forward. Be completely transparent about the situation, and be open to answering any and all questions your husband may have. [2] X Research source Admitting your mistake and taking full responsibility for your actions can show your spouse that you regret cheating. Can this be incredibly hard and scary? Of course. But directly stating what you did wrong and why you regret it can go a long way when rebuilding trust. Resist any urge to blame your partner for your infidelity. It might be tempting to explain why you cheated by saying that you had needs that were missing during the relationship. And that makes sense, nothing happens in a vacuum. However, bringing up those issues now might sound like you're not fully aware of the weight of your infidelity, which could risk you and your husband's ability to reconcile."

      "content": "Apologize for your actions and make a commitment not to repeat the mistake. There are few words more powerful than “I’m sorry.” Be genuine when you say what you’re sorry for, and make sure that what you say directly relates to the actions you committed that caused harm. If you promise never to cheat again, hold up the end of your promise and make yourself accountable. Placing emphasis on what you did wrong can show that you know you made a mistake. Try saying, “I’m sorry for what I did” instead of “I’m sorry that this hurt you.” Apologizing for cheating can feel so difficult and stressful. When you get stuck, take a moment to breathe and think. As long as you're leading with patience, honesty, and love, you're probably offering a valuable, heartfelt apology.

      "title": "Listen to what your husband has to say.",
      "content": "Listen to what your husband has to say. When you talk to your husband about the affair, carefully and actively listen to his point of view. Practicing reflective listening can validate your partner’s emotions and reduce any chance of misinterpretation. When your partner expresses his emotions, rephrase and repeat back what he says. For example, if he says, “I don’t understand why you did this to us,” say “What I’m hearing is that you’re not sure why I would hurt our relationship by cheating.” This let's him know that you're engaged and you understand. Your husband might be angry, and he might not always lead with kindness. Do your best to listen respectfully: he's hurt, and trying to make sense of his betrayal."

When your partner is still making up their mind, it might feel impossible not to call or text before they're ready.

The level of transparency is up to the two of you — you might give up activities that don’t make him comfortable, tell him where you’re going and who you’re going with, or even give your partner access to your email and text messages. [6] X Research source At some point, you'll surely phase out of this, but in the short term, it can help him move to a place of trust more quickly."
