      "content": "Door wiring: Most new vehicles have a lot of wiring in their doors. That wiring is connected to the control computers in the car. In order to prevent the wiring from getting damaged or corroded, manufacturers enshroud the wiring that travels from the car body to the door in a rubber tube. [1] X Research source Pull the rubber tube out of it’s recess in the door or car body, and push it back until you reveal an electrical connector (try not to tear the rubber). Pull the connector apart: Depress the tab and separate the door connector half from the car body connector half. Some connectors are more complicated. If your connector appears to have two tabs on it, try pulling the centermost tab out of the connector (it may not come all the way out) and then push in the other tab and pull them apart. Be careful, especially if your car is older."

The door holder is only intended to keep the door from opening and closing by itself and is very weak. You do not want the weight of the door on the door holder. [2] X Research source Unbolt the door holder from the body of the car. Note: In some vehicles the door holder is an integrated piece on one or both of the door hinges. If you find this is the case, skip to the next step."
