      "content": "If your tree is thriving on its own, you really don't need to fertilize it. Each year, your apple tree should grow an extra 8 and 15 in (20 and 38 cm). You don’t need to fertilize your apple tree if it’s already growing at least 8 in (20 cm) a year. However, if your tree isn’t growing that much, it probably needs fertilizer. [1] X Research source Fertilizing too much can actually stunt the growth of apple trees, so it's important to evaluate growth first."

If your tree is more than 2 years old, you only need to apply fertilizer once in the springtime to kickstart growth. [3] X Research source"

Instead, it really depends on where you live and the current soil conditions. A soil test will help you pinpoint which nutrients your soil needs so you can choose the right fertilizer.

Your test results will list a recommended NPK ratio—this is the percentage of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash that your soil needs. Write down this specific ratio, and head to a garden supply store. Then, buy a fertilizer with the same NPK ratio as your test results. [6] X Research source For instance, if your test results recommend a fertilizer with 15-5-10 NPK, buy fertilizer with a 15-5-10, 3-1-2, 9-3-6, or 12-4-8 ratio. If the nutrients in the soil are pretty even, some experts suggest going with a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer.

      "content": "Try applying a nitrogen-rich fertilizer for mature trees. Apply 1 ⁄ 8 lb (0.057 kg) of pure nitrogen for every year of your tree’s age. Once your tree is at least 8 years old, cap off the nitrogen fertilizer at 1 lb (0.45 kg). The 1 ⁄ 8 lb (0.057 kg) rule applies to pure nitrogen. You can also use a 21-0-0 or 16-16-16 fertilizer, or a more organic fertilizer, like rabbit or steer manure. However, compared to the pure nitrogen, you’ll need to use 5 times as much 21-0-0 fertilizer, 7 times as much 16-16-16 fertilizer, 35 times as much rabbit manure, and 70 times as much steer manure."

In the following years, apply an extra 1 lb (0.45 kg) of fertilizer for every 1 in (2.5 cm) of tree trunk. Cap off the fertilizer once you’re using 2 1 ⁄ 2 lb (1.1 kg) every year. [9] X Research source Some experts suggest adding an extra 1 ⁄ 2 lb (0.23 kg) of fertilizer for each year of life. For instance, a newly planted tree gets a 1 ⁄ 2 lb (0.23 kg) of fertilizer, a 2-year old tree gets 1 lb (0.45 kg), a 3-year old tree gets 1 1 ⁄ 2 lb (0.68 kg), and so on.

Instead, scatter the fertilizer evenly around the tree trunk. [11] X Research source You can water the soil after spreading the fertilizer."

      "content": "You pruned or fertilized your tree too much. When you over-fertilize and over-prune, your apple tree spends more time growing its wood, and the tree doesn’t yield any flowers or fruit. This can happen when you fertilize the grass near your apple tree, and your tree ends up absorbing some of the extra nitrogen.
