      "content": "Measure around your overbust, bust, waist, and hips. To make your own strapless dress pattern, start by taking using a fabric tape measure to take a measurement just above your bust, or under your armpits. This will be where the top of your dress sits. Then, measure around the fullest part of your bust, the narrowest part of your waist, and the fullest part of your hips. [1] X Research source Keep the tape measure as straight as you can while you're measuring. Take careful measurements, especially at your chest—the bodice is what will hold the dress in place. [2] X Expert Source Kpoene Kofi-Bruce Couture Bridal Designer Expert Interview. 28 January 2021. If you're making the dress for yourself, it may help to have someone else take your measurements to ensure they're accurate."

Label the overbust measurement \"A,\" the bust measurement \"B,\" the waist measurement \"C,\" and the hip measurement \"D.\" [3] X Research source For instance, if you measure 36 in (91 cm) at your overbust, 40 in (100 cm) around your bust, 32 in (81 cm) at your waist, and 44 in (110 cm) around your hips, line A would be 9 in (23 cm), B would be 10 in (25 cm), C would be 8 in (20 cm), and D would be 11 in (28 cm)."

      "content": "Take vertical measurements between lines A, B, C, and D. First, measure from your overbust straight down to the fullest part of one of your breasts. It helps to do this centered over a breast, rather than in the middle of your chest. Then, measure from the fullest part of your breast down to the narrowest part of your waist, and from your waist to the fullest part of your hips. Finally, measure from the center of your chest down to where you want the dress to end. [5] X Research source Label the line from your overbust to your bust as line F, the line from your bust to your waist as line G, from your waist to your hips as line H, and the total length of the dress as line I."

      "content": "Draw line I on a piece of pattern paper near the left edge. Lay your pattern paper flat in front of you, then measure and draw the length of line I vertically down the left side of the paper. This will create the total length of your pattern. [6] X Research source If you'd like, you can use chalk and draw the pattern directly onto the fabric. However, using pattern paper is helpful in case you make a mistake. Start each of your lines on the left side of the pattern, beginning along line I and extending to the right."

Measure vertically down from line A, using the length of line F—the distance from your overbust to your bust—then draw line B extending from that point. Measure down again, this time the length of G, then draw line C extending horizontally from there. Finally, measure down the length of line H, and draw line D horizontally from that point.

Then, draw a straight line down from the end of line D, and connect it to line I with a horizontal line along the bottom of the pattern.

Measure just outside of your pattern by about 1 in (2.5 cm) all the way around, except on the outside of line I. This will give you extra fabric so you can connect the sides of the dress and hem the top and bottom. Once you've done that, carefully cut all the way around your pattern, including the seam allowance. [9] X Research source If you're experienced at sewing, you might prefer to work with a smaller seam. If that's the case, you can adjust it to 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) or 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.9 cm), if you'd like. However, if you're just getting started sewing, a 1 in (2.5 cm) will be easier to work with."

Cut out the shape of your pattern from the pattern paper and lay it on top of your folded fabric so line I is against the fold. Trace around the pattern with fabric chalk, then cut around the shape you drew, being careful not to cut along the fold. Once you have the first piece, fold the fabric again, then retrace the pattern and cut a second piece. [11] X Research source If you don't want to use fabric chalk, you can pin the pattern to the fabric, then cut around it."

Then, use a zig-zag setting on your sewing machine and carefully sew along the left and right sides of the pieces, about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the edge, to create your hem. [12] X Research source A zig-zag stitch will work with the natural stretch of your dress. Only sew the hourglass-shaped curves you drew when you connected all the pieces on your pattern. Do not sew the tops and bottoms of the pieces, or you won't be able to put your dress on."

With the dress still inside-out, fold down the fabric along the top hem and sew it into place with the same zig-zag stitch you used on the sides of the dress. Then, turn the hem up on the bottom and sew it down, as well. [13] X Research source Be sure to only sew through the folded fabric, rather than through all 4 layers. If you sew the dress closed, you won't be able to wear it. When you're finished, turn the fabric right-side-out, and try on your new custom-fitted dress!"

Lay it flat in front of you, then fold it in half so the sleeves are lined up together and the fold runs vertically along the center of the shirt. [14] X Research source The shirt doesn't necessarily have to be long enough to be a dress on its own, since you'll add some length with the bust piece. However, it is best if the shirt is a little long, so avoid babydoll-style tees for this project! You can use this same technique to make a T-shirt dress into a strapless dress!"

Then, make a horizontal cut running from just under the center of the collar, all the way across to the sleeve area. This should leave you with a roughly rectangular shape, although the T-shirt may still be wider at the bottom than the top. [15] X Research source Be sure to remove the seam with the rest of the sleeve, since leaving that on your dress will look messy."

Once you've done that, unfold both pieces and lay them on top of each other so the right sides (or the outsides of the fabric) are together. Then, cut the pieces into a rectangle shape. To do that, first cut straight vertical lines along the left and right edges of the sleeves to square them off. Then, cut a straight horizontal line across the bottom of the fabric to remove the curved bottom seam. [16] X Research source Cutting the sleeve pieces together helps ensure they'll be exactly the same size."

Look in the mirror to ensure you have the coverage you'll be comfortable with. If the bust piece is too loose, take it in a little at the sides. If you need more coverage in your bust area, you can use fabric from another T-shirt instead of using the sleeves. Just cut 1 rectangle that fits all the way around your bust, and sew the left and right edges together vertically to create the tube shape. [18] X Research source"

Lay it in front of you with the top of the dress away from you and the bottom closest to you. Then, place the bust piece right above the top edge of the T-shirt. [19] X Research source Make sure to center the bust piece neatly, since if it's messy, the dress might come out uneven. The bust piece can be right-side-out or inside-out for this."

Using a straightedge and fabric marker or fabric chalk, draw a line starting at the outside left edge of the bust piece, running all the way down the length of the T-shirt. Then, do the same thing for the right side of the bust piece. If you'd like a little more room at the bottom of the dress, you can angle both lines toward the outside corner of the dress. However, if the angles on the sides are different, the dress may not fit well, so it's easiest to work with straight lines."

Repeat for the right side of the shirt, then turn the body of the dress so it's right-side-out. [20] X Research source About 1 ⁄ 2 – 3 ⁄ 4 in (1.3–1.9 cm) should be enough room for your seam. A zig-zag stitch is best when you're working with a stretch material, like a cotton T-shirt, because the seam will be able to stretch with the fabric."

Then, slide that piece over the T-shirt piece, lining up the top edge of the tube piece with the top of the T-shirt body. [21] X Research source The bust piece should be sheathed around the body of the T-shirt, with the top edges lined up. If the bust piece has a design that needs to be right-side-up on the finished piece, make sure it's upside-down (and inside-out) for this step."

This will create a seam that will hit just below your bust. [22] X Research source Only sew right along the top hem of the dress. If you sew down into the bust piece, you won't be able to turn it right-side-out when you're finished. You don't need to hem the bottom of the dress because the T-shirt hem should still be intact there."
