      "content": "Collect tadpoles from a nearby pond or creek in the spring. Frogs lay their eggs in the spring, so when the weather warms up, search for tadpoles swimming in a small body of water near you. Simply use a clean bucket or bowl to scoop up the tadpoles and the water. [1] X Research source For instance, collect tadpoles from a pond or creek in your neighborhood. Or, ask your neighbors if you can search for tadpoles in their yard. Warning : Check if your area has certain laws about collecting and raising tadpoles. Your area might prohibit you from collecting tadpoles from public areas, like parks, or raising certain species of frogs. [2] X Research source Do not purchase tadpoles, as they might not be native to your area. Introducing non-native wildlife to your area can potentially harm the native wildlife."

      "content": "House the tadpoles in a large aquarium tank or container. Tadpoles can be raised in most containers, though it's best for them to be housed outside. This helps attract more mosquitos to lay their larva, which the tadpoles like to eat. The fresh air also provides a cleaner and more oxygenated atmosphere. Just be sure to keep the tadpoles mostly shaded, though. Suitable containers include: A large aquatic tank A large plastic container A large, shallow pan A small inflatable pool"

      "title": "Fill the tank with gravel, large rocks, and plants from the pond.",
      "content": "Fill the tank with gravel , large rocks, and plants from the pond. Cover the bottom of your tank with gravel. Then, take several rocks from the pond where you got the tadpoles and place them around the tank. Collect some small weeds and grasses from the pond, too, and nestle them in the gravel. [3] X Research source The large rocks act as shelter for the tadpoles. They also provide land when the tadpoles transform into frogs and need air. The plants also provide shelter for the tadpoles. They also like to eat the algae on the leaves, as well as the roots. [4] X Research source Bernard says aquarium decorations like rocks and plants aren’t just ornamental—they provide animals with places to hide. He asserts that “animals need a place to escape if they feel threatened or overwhelmed…so giving them [decorations] will make them feel more at ease.” Make sure there has not been a recent application of pesticides on any plant life you add to the tank, as the chemicals can kill the tadpoles."

      "title": "Pour pond water or rainwater into the tank.",
      "content": "Pour pond water or rainwater into the tank. Tadpoles need clean, dechlorinated water to survive and thrive. Simply fill the tank with water from where you gathered the tadpoles. Or, collect rainwater and pour it into the tank. [5] X Research source As a bonus, both pond water and rainwater can contain mosquito larvae, which tadpoles like to eat. Morton does not recommend using tap water, as it's full of chemicals that can harm tadpoles. If you have to use tap water, treat it with a water conditioner to remove the harmful chemicals like chlorine."

      "title": "Add 3 to 5 tadpoles per 1 liter (4 c) of water in the tank.",
      "content": "Add 3 to 5 tadpoles per 1 liter (4 c) of water in the tank. If you overcrowd the tank with tadpoles, they may die out quickly or even become carnivorous. So, add no more than 3 to 5 tadpoles per 1 liter (4 c) of water in the tank. [6] X Research source For instance, if your tank holds 7.5 liters (2 gal) of water, add no more than 37 tadpoles. Note : Make sure the tank water and the water the tadpoles are in are at similar temperatures before you place the tadpoles in the tank. Sudden temperature changes can shock and kill the tadpoles. Most frog species prefer staying at room temperature, or around 65 to 74° F (20-23° C). However, they often grow more quickly in warmer temperatures around 75 to 80° F (24-27° C).

      "content": "Set the tank outside in a spot where it receives mostly shade. Tadpoles need some light to survive but don’t do well in intense, direct light. Put the tank in a place where it gets about ¾ shade and some indirect sunlight. The tadpoles must be able to get out of direct sunlight when they want to. [8] X Research source For instance, set the tank under a tree or next to a fence in your backyard. If you can’t find a shady spot, hang a tarp or other covering over the tank."

      "title": "Feed the tadpoles small amounts of boiled lettuce each day.",
      "content": "Feed the tadpoles small amounts of boiled lettuce each day. Boil romaine lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the leaves are soft and squishy. Then, drain the lettuce and cut it into tiny pieces. Simply sprinkle a pinch of lettuce into the tank every day. [9] X Research source Adjust the amount of lettuce you give the tadpoles to ensure they’re not getting too much or too little food. If there is a lot of leftover lettuce in the tank the next day, add smaller pinches. If the tadpoles eat all of the lettuce very quickly, they likely need more food. As the tadpoles grow, their appetites grow, too. Tadpoles also like eating other greens, like spinach. Just make sure you choose greens with softer leaves and cut the pieces small enough for their tiny mouths. Alternatively, feed the tadpoles tadpole food or plant-based fish food ."

      "content": "Give the tadpoles small insects when their back legs develop. Tadpoles start out as herbivores but turn into carnivores when they grow back legs. Simply drop mosquito larvae or water fleas into the tank each day. [10] X Research source As an alternative, feed the tadpoles fish food made out of animal matter."

      "title": "Stop regularly feeding the tadpoles when they grow front legs.",
      "content": "Stop regularly feeding the tadpoles when they grow front legs. Tadpoles typically stop eating once their front legs are fully developed. This is because they start absorbing their tail back into their body, which gives them enough nutrients and energy to survive. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Change the water when it appears dirty and cloudy.",
      "content": "Change the water when it appears dirty and cloudy. Morton recommends changing “25% of the water every two weeks,” or whenever the water starts looking dirty. Simply scoop out the old water with a cup, being careful not to pick up any tadpoles. He says to “make sure the new water temperature is close to [the] aquarium temperature” before adding it into the tank. Replace the old water with water collected from the pond you got the tadpoles, rainwater, or tap water treated with water conditioner . Changing a small amount of water at a time helps keep the pH of the water balanced. Instead of using a cup to change the water, use a turkey baster. This disturbs the tadpoles as little as possible whilst making it easy to remove debris on the bottom of the tank. Wash your hands and handle the tadpoles as little as possible when you change the water, as this can introduce germs and bacteria. Additionally, tadpoles don’t like being touched."

      "title": "Be patient as the tadpoles grow.",
      "content": "Be patient as the tadpoles grow. It typically takes tadpoles 12 to 16 weeks to fully transform into frogs. They usually develop back legs around 8 to 12 weeks and lose their tail at around 12 to 16 weeks. [12] X Research source This is just a general development timeline; different species of frogs grow more quickly than others. Keep in mind that tadpoles tend to grow faster in warm temperatures and slower in cool temperatures."

      "title": "Provide the tadpoles with more land as they grow legs.",
      "content": "Provide the tadpoles with more land as they grow legs. Tadpoles start to develop lungs when they grow their legs, which means they can’t breathe water like a fish. Make sure your tadpoles have plenty of rocks and plants to climb on to get air when they need it. [13] X Research source If most of the tadpoles have legs, lower the water level so they have more land to climb on."

      "title": "Release the fully-formed tadpoles back to the area where you got them.",
      "content": "Release the fully-formed tadpoles back to the area where you got them. Once the tadpoles have front and back legs and lose their tail, it’s time to release them into the wild. Simply go back to the water source where you got the tadpoles and release the baby frogs near the edge of the water. [14] X Research source Warning : Do not release the frogs in a different spot than you collected them. This can potentially spread bacteria and diseases among the frog population that lives there."

      "content": "Provide the baby frogs with more space as they grow bigger. If you plan on keeping some of the baby frogs as pets , know that they require more space than tadpoles. Separate small groups of frogs into larger tanks to ensure they’re comfortable and happy. Find out what species of frog you're caring for to ensure it has all the space it needs. For instance, search for frogs native to your area and look at pictures to identify the species of frog you have."
