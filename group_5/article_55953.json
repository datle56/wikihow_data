If you tend to sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees in order to keep your hips aligned, and to prevent you from twisting to rest your knee on the mattress. [4] X Research source If you tend to sleep on your back, you can also place a pillow underneath your knees to make sure your back is in the optimal position.

Go to source If you are a stomach sleeper, then you likely need to work the most to improve your sleep posture, as this is typically considered the worst sleeping posture. Sleeping on your stomach forces you to turn your head to the left or to the right, creating pressure on the spine. If you use a pillow, it also pushes your head higher than the rest of your spine. This can lead to pain, numbness, and tingling.

In order to improve your posture during the night, you should also work to improve your posture during the day, as this also contributes to aches and pains that may force us into a particular posture. You may not immediately know what proper posture should feel like, so you should check your posture against a wall several times a day as you begin a back and shoulder strengthening routine. Stand against the wall. For most people with poor posture, their shoulder blades do not touch the wall. Pull your shoulder blades down and in so that they connect with the wall. Next, lengthen your neck as if someone is pulling the back of your head up. Move it back until your head touches the wall. Move your chin until it is parallel to the ground. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure you stand with equal weight in both legs. Move to a mirror and mimic the pose to ensure your neck and shoulders are straight. Pull your shoulders down as far as possible. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Consider seeking the help of a physical therapist. If you have trouble maintaining proper posture, you may need to seek the assistance of a physical therapist, who can show you stretching exercises that will help strengthen your core."

Therefore, you should take some time to learn about how to choose a mattress. It is a good idea to choose a firmer mattress, as a firm mattress provides better support for your skeleton. If you cannot afford to replace your mattress, you can try flipping over your current mattress and placing a piece of plywood underneath in order to provide a bit more support."

      "content": "Assess your current pillow. There are many factors that affect how often you should replace your pillow, including the quality and type of filling in your pillow. However, like your mattress, if you wake up with a sore neck or a headache, it’s probably a good time to look for a new one. To help you determine whether or not your pillow is worn out, you can perform the “fold test”. Fold your pillow in half for thirty seconds and then release it. If it doesn’t spring back into its original form relatively quickly, it’s likely time for a new one. Finally, if you notice that your pillow is very lumpy or that there is a large dent where your head usually goes, it’s likely time for a new one."

Take the time to learn how to choose the correct pillow for you. Since you will likely be learning to sleep either on your side or on your back, you will do best with a medium thick to thick pillow, that provides good support for the neck. Make sure that any pillow you purchase keeps your neck in a straight line with your spine. You do not want the pillow to make your neck go higher or lower than the rest of your spine."

[15] X Expert Source Alex Dimitriu, MD Sleep Medicine & Psychiatry Professional Expert Interview. 16 October 2019. In order to get the best sleep possible, it is important that you create a sleep routine that you can stick to every day of the week, including weekends. By going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, you help your body know when to be ready for sleep. If you end up going to bed later than normal one night, you should still do your best to get up at the same time. This way you don’t disrupt your routine as much. If you feel very tired, try taking a short, mid-day nap to help you rather than sleeping in later or going to bed earlier. Just be sure to keep the nap to under 45 minutes.

      "content": "Have a bed time ritual. Each night, before going to sleep, have a ritual that you do in the same order to signal to your body that it is time to sleep. For example, you might brush your teeth, wash your face, and change in to your pajamas. You might then do some very gentle stretching or yoga. Finally, you can really get into rest mode by reading for a few minutes before turning out the lights. It is best not to let electronics, such as smart phones, televisions, or lap tops be a part of your bed time routine. While entertaining, the backlights from these devices can be stimulating and can even suppress melatonin production. [17] X Research source"
