      "content": "“She ate” is a term expressing admiration or praise for someone. When you say, “She ate,” you’re basically saying, “She’s amazing!” or “She looked incredible!” The phrase emphasizes when someone has done something impressively or with lots of style. It’s often used in the context of fashion or performance but can apply to other situations as well. [1] X Research source “Omg she ate that role!” “Wow, he really ate in that costume, it was so good!” You might also see people say, “She ate that,” which is just another version of the above phrase; it means the same thing (expressing praise for someone). Keep in mind that you can use other pronouns with “ate” too (like “He ate” or “They ate”), and it’ll mean the same thing."
