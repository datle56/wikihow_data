      "content": "No, you cannot get a price change refund on Amazon. In the past, Amazon offered price adjustments, aka partial refunds, on past purchases that are now cheaper. For instance, say you bought a $60 blender, and the same blender is now on sale for $40—Amazon used to offer a $20 return if you followed the correct steps. However, this is a thing of the past. As of 2024, the only way to receive a refund is to return an item. However, there is a subtle way to “trick” the system. Say you ordered something last week and now notice the price is significantly lower than when you bought it. If the item is unopened/unused, you can simply return the one you purchased and repurchase it at a lower cost. When asked for the reason for your return, select “No longer needed” or “Other.” Keep in mind that this method is foolproof and isn’t approved by Amazon. It’s simply a hack many Amazon shoppers have shared online. Use at your own discretion."
