      "content": "Head to the sink and hold your glasses under running water. Let the water wash over the front of your lenses and then flip them over to rinse the other side. This will remove any surface dirt from your glasses. You can do this with hot or cold water—the temperature doesn’t really matter."

      "content": "Squirt some hand soap on your fingers and rub it into your lenses. Flip the lenses over and repeat this process on the other side. Spread the soap around in a smooth circular motion to cover each portion of your lenses. The soap will leave a filmy substance behind after you wash it off which will protect your lenses from fogging up."

    {
      "title": "Hold your glasses under the water to rinse the soap off.",
      "content": "Hold your glasses under the water to rinse the soap off. Take your soap-covered glasses and hold them under the water again. Flip your glasses over to rinse the soap off of both sides. Once you’ve washed the soap off, give them a quick shake to knock off any excess water."

      "title": "Grab a microfiber cloth and wipe your glasses dry.",
      "content": "Grab a microfiber cloth and wipe your glasses dry. Hold the glasses by your frame while you dry the lenses to keep smudge marks off. Once your glasses are dry, put them back on. Your lenses will no longer fog up while you’re wearing a mask! You can also let them air dry if you’re not in a rush."
