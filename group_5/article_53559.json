      "content": "There are many web-based YouTube downloaders that let you save part of a video. The drawback is that most of them only allow you to download videos in standard definition, not HD, unless you upgrade to a paid plan. You have several options if you're looking for a fast way to download a video and don't mind standard 480p to 720p quality. YouTube4k's Clip Downloader is a free website that allows you to download part of any YouTube video in 1080p (full HD) quality. Clideo is a solid option if you're willing to download the YouTube video first and then upload it to the editor. You can cut any quality YouTube video with a free account, though it will contain the Clideo watermark unless you upgrade. ClipConverter is another free option that lets you download just one part of a YouTube video in HD quality. The drawback is that you won't be able to use ClipConverter to download parts of music videos or copyrighted content. Kapwing's Video trimmer is easy to use and considers their \"Standard\" quality 720pâ€”this technically qualifies as HD, although it's not Full HD. The drawback is that the service will add a watermark to the video unless you create an account. Streamable allows you to download standard definition video clips of up to 10 minutes from YouTube for free. If you want HD or longer clips, you'll need to pay for a subscription. Because YouTube frowns upon video download sites (downloading videos violates YouTube's terms), these websites tend to come and go. [1] X Research source Try any of these sites or search for \"YouTube video cropper\" to find an alternative."
