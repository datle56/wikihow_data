Whether you’re celebrating a personal milestone, posting about a sale from your online store’s social media accounts, or simply announcing that it’s party time in a group chat, use the 📣 emoji to show you’ve got something important to say. Place it at the beginning of your post as an attention-grabber. [1] X Research source “📣 It’s time for our annual sale! 📣” “📣 Milestone alert: I just landed my first full-time job!”"

      "content": "Start a message with 📣 in a group chat to make your text stand out. If your group text is blowing up but you’ve got some important or interesting to say, include a 📣 emoji to stand out above the noise (just like if you had a megaphone in real life!). Put a 📣 at the top of your message, or send a solo 📣 emoji first as an attention-getter (on most phones, an emoji will appear jumbo-sized if it’s sent by itself). [2] X Research source “📣 Hey you guys!! The dinner reservation got changed to 8pm!” “📣📣📣 Like this message if you’re coming to my birthday party tomorrow!”"

      "content": "Call attention to a problem or cause with a 📣 emoji. Megaphones and loudspeakers are a staple of marches, protests, and activism. Include a megaphone emoji in your calls to action online or over text to drum up support for charities, emergency relief organizations, social justice campaigns, or any other cause that’s near and dear to you. “📣 We’re losing bees at an alarming rate! Sign my petition today to preserve our buzzy little friends.” “📣 I’m raising money for the victims of yesterday’s tornado! 📣 Donate at the link in my bio to help out a neighbor.”"

Whether you’re tweeting about the World Series or giving a shout out to a friend who just had a major accomplishment, add a megaphone emoji to show your loyalty and pride. If you’re feeling extra festive, try typing out a supportive chant like you might yell at a live game.

      "content": "Confirm you’ve read an announcement containing the 📣 emoji. If someone sends an update or important message your way with a 📣 to grab your attention, send a supportive reply to let them know you’ve seen it. Say something as simple as “Got it!” or just send a 👍 (thumbs up) emoji. On most smartphones, you can also tap and hold the message to “react” to it. Of course, if the announcement is a public one on social media, you don’t have to respond unless you want to. Them: “📣 Update! We have to cancel the BBQ because of the weather ☹️” You: “Aw man! Hopefully we’ll find another day soon.” Them: “📣📣📣 I’m launching my own skin care line!” You: “Congrats!”"

      "content": "Acknowledge someone’s megaphone message in a busy group chat. Let your friend know they’ve been heard by replying to their text, reacting to it, or messaging them separately about it if you want to keep your response private. On many smartphone messaging apps, just tap and hold the message and select “Reply” to start a visual thread of responses to a text. This helps keep the info in the group chat a little easier to navigate. Them: “📣 Hey let me know if you want in on the dinner rez tonight!” You: “Me me me! 🙋‍♂️” Them: “📣 Send me your availability for John’s surprise birthday party please! 📣” You: “Ugh my schedule is crazy, I’ll text you separately.”"

If you spot someone’s message or post about raising awareness or money for an organization or cause you care about, respond with a positive message to show your support. Then, show you care by making a donation, reposting the information, or volunteering to help out . If you don’t know the person posting or the post is from an organization’s social media account, you don’t have to reply unless you want to. Them: “Attention everyone! 📣 Help me meet my fundraising goal of $5,000 for the food pantry downtown!” You: “Just donated. Keep up the good work!” Them: “📣 We’re taking clothing donations to give out to struggling families this winter. More info at the link in my bio if you can pitch in!” You: “🙌🙌🙌”"

Get enthusiastic and sound off with texts, tweets, or replies with all caps, lots of exclamation points, and fun emojis to show your excitement for whatever sports team or hyped-up game your friends are cheering for. Use the 📣 to make it seem like you’re yelling back at them in a crowd of fans, or send whatever seems fitting to your competitive spirit. Them: “📣📣📣 THE CUBS ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!!” You: “AW YEAH LET’S GOOO!!!” Them: “📣Hey y’all, Alisa just won the spelling bee!” You: “📣HEY Y’ALL, ALISA IS THE CHAMP!!! 📣🏆”"

      "content": "Use other loud, attention-grabbing emojis to emphasize your messages. Try using the 📢 (loudspeaker) emoji from time to time to make announcements or cheer on your favorite team. Lots of people use 📢 and 📣 interchangeably since they represent similar contraptions in real life. [4] X Research source Give some of these other flashy emojis a whirl, too: Use 🚨 (police car light) to say “Attention!” or “Warning!” Try ❗ (exclamation mark) to signal that a message is important. Throw in a 🗣️ (speaking head) to make it seem like you’re yelling or trying to be heard. Go for 🙋 (person raising hand) to draw attention to yourself or your text. For a retro attention-getter, try 📯 (postal horn) to announce your message with a fanfare."
