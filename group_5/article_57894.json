      "content": "Projection is a defense mechanism narcissists use to shift blame from themselves. It involves attributing one’s own negative characteristics to another person. [2] X Research source In other words, a narcissist denies their own flaws and bad behaviors, instead accusing others of displaying them. [3] X Research source The narcissist does this to avoid confronting difficult truths about themselves and protect their (typically fragile) sense of self. [4] X Research source Projection itself is a common human behavior, and it doesn’t always indicate narcissistic personality disorder. [5] X Research source Research has shown, however, that people who have Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) may display an excessive use of projection compared to others. [6] X Research source NPD is a mental health condition that requires a formal diagnosis by a professional. People with NPD typically have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance and lack the ability to empathize with others. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It’s normal to show some narcissistic tendencies occasionally, and this would not necessarily indicate NPD.

      "content": "They accuse you of being unfaithful. Narcissistic projection involves accusing another person of behaviors the narcissist themselves is guilty of. [10] X Research source In a romantic relationship, a narcissist might unfairly accuse you of cheating, flirting with others, or having unfaithful thoughts, when they are actually the one engaging in this behavior. Their projection is an attempt to deflect blame and avoid confronting their own actions. [11] X Research source For example, if you confront a narcissist for cheating, they may respond by accusing you of flirting with a friend or coworker. They could then go on to claim that this behavior bothered them so much that they were driven to cheat on you. This maneuver is an attempt to justify their own behavior while placing all the blame for their own indiscretion onto you. They criticize your physical appearance. Though it may seem like narcissists have a high opinion of themselves, they’re actually very insecure. Narcissists often engage in projection because they are unable or unwilling to confront these insecurities. [12] X Research source If a narcissist feels unattractive or insecure about their own body, they’ll often deal with this emotion by calling you unattractive and criticizing your body. They claim that you hate them. Narcissists try to present an extremely confident mask to the world, but underneath it all they struggle with their sense of self-worth and may even think very poorly of themselves. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Because they lack the self-awareness to deal with their own negative view of themselves, they’ll instead accuse you of viewing them this way. For example, an insecure narcissist might claim that you secretly hate them, or that you’re harboring critical thoughts about them, even though you've given them no reason to think this. They make everything your fault. Projection is the narcissist's tool to shift blame away from themselves. So, if you confront a narcissist about their behavior, instead of taking responsibility, they’ll immediately accuse you of being too sensitive or too critical. [14] X Research source They’ll claim you’re picking a fight, and that it's your fault you're arguing with each other. If you find yourself apologizing at the end of the conversation, even though you were initially trying to confront them about their behavior, you're likely dealing with narcissistic projection. They call you a narcissist. Since narcissists are so prone to projecting their own flaws and behaviors onto others, they might even project the label of “narcissism” onto you. In other words, a narcissist will accuse you of exhibiting narcissistic behavior, all the while displaying that exact behavior themselves. [15] X Research source For example, they may accuse you of being self-obsessed or attention seeking even when you're exhibiting completely normal, non-narcissistic behavior."
