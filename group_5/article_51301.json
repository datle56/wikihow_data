      "content": "Amazon collects their returns and loads them onto pallets. If you’ve ever sent something back to Amazon, whether it was the wrong size, broken, or the wrong item all together, it’s most likely gone into a warehouse and is being stored in a large pallet. Amazon groups hundreds of items together in 1 pallet and then sells them in bulk to recoup some of their money. [1] X Research source Amazon usually sells the pallets to liquidation companies, who then sell the pallets to individual customers (like you!). Not all items returned to Amazon are sold. Some of them go straight to a landfill. However, Amazon has said that they are working toward a zero waste return policy. [2] X Research source"

Keep in mind that once you purchase an Amazon pallet, you will most likely have to pay for shipping on top of that price. [7] X Research source Auction prices usually vary depending on the condition of the items inside. Most liquidation services will tell you the grade of the goods, ranging from new or like new products, all the way down to “salvage,” which means you can use it for parts only. [8] X Research source"

Keep in mind that you never know what’s going to be inside of a return pallet, and most companies do not accept returns once you purchase one. [9] X Research source To get the most out of your Amazon return pallet, be sure to check the listing details carefully. Most sites will specify the quality of the products inside so you have a vague idea of what you’re getting. On most sites, you can sort by category to choose the type of products you’re purchasing. Most customers receive enough products to make back most if not all of the money they spent. However, it’s always a gamble!"
