      "title": "Bumble bees like soft nesting spaces, so clear out leaves and debris.",
      "content": "Bumble bees like soft nesting spaces, so clear out leaves and debris. They also dislike sunny, hot spaces, so pulling up weeds or raking leaves can remove some of the shade that's protecting them. They'll move on if it's too sunny. [1] X Research source Bumble bees nest underground, so you may not spot their actual nests—you may see holes that are their entrance tunnels. These are around 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter. If the bees are nesting underneath decks or patios, you might see a nest—it looks like a waxy clump of debris."

    {
      "title": "Fill the holes with soil if they're nesting in the ground.",
      "content": "Fill the holes with soil if they're nesting in the ground. Pack down the soil so they can't easily get in and out. If they're nesting under your shed or deck and coming up through a hole in the wood, use putty to seal the hole. [2] X Research source The bees under your shed or deck will probably find a new way to get in and out, so keep looking for them after you've sealed their hole since you may need to block their new entrance."

      "title": "Insert 1 inch (2.5 cm) flexible tubing into the nest entrance.",
      "content": "Insert 1 inch (2.5 cm) flexible tubing into the nest entrance. Then, you can direct the tube wherever you want the bees to come and go. For instance, if you've got a nest right next to your patio and you want the bees to be farther away, use long tubing and snake it along the side of your patio so the end is on an unused side of your house. [3] X Research source Place a few pot plants, pebbles, or flowers around the new entrance so the bumble bees can use these as landmarks. They'll remember that this is the new entrance so they'll avoid the original entrance."

      "title": "Turn on your sprinklers or use a hose to saturate the ground.",
      "content": "Turn on your sprinklers or use a hose to saturate the ground. Bumble bees are a type of ground bee which means they dig through loose soil to make their nests underground. When you flood their nests with water the bees will either drown or move somewhere drier. [4] X Research source You may need to do this every few days until the bumble bees are gone."

      "title": "Seal the bird box with a sponge and take down the birdhouse.",
      "content": "Seal the bird box with a sponge and take down the birdhouse. Wait until the evening to move the birdhouse that has the bees' nest in it—that way they'll all be back inside. Push a piece of flexible foam sponge into the entrance hole so the bees can't fly out. Then, take the birdhouse down and at least 1 ⁄ 2 mi (0.80 km) away. [5] X Research source Remove the sponge the next day so the bees will fly out when they're active. Bees won't fly at night, which is why you have to wait until the next day to remove the sponge. If it's too much of a hassle to go back and get the birdhouse, contact a professional pest control company to transfer the bees from the birdhouse to a colony. [6] X Research source Wear a long-sleeved shirt and pants that you've tucked into your socks. Then, pop on a pair of gloves before you stop up the birdhouse. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Combine 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of liquid soap with 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. You can use liquid laundry detergent or liquid dish soap. Just stir it into the water until it's dissolved and pour it into a spray bottle. Spray the bees' nesting area at night when they're more likely to be there. The soap will kill the bumble bees by dehydrating them. [8] X Research source Repeat this every few days until the bees are gone."

Do it at night when they're more likely to be in their nests. The strong vinegar smell may drive them away.

Then, simmer the mixture over medium heat for 10 minutes to release the oil in the fruit. Let the citrus repellent cool completely before you pour it into a spray bottle and spray the bees' nesting area. Since they dislike the strong smell, they'll leave the area. [11] X Research source Wait until the evening when the bumble bees are back in their nests before you spray. Wear protective clothing when you do this so you don't get stung. Repeat this every day until the bees move on."

These are protected under the Endangered Species Act so you must have a permit to remove their nests. Rust-patched bumble bees are found in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. [14] X Research source Rusty-patched bumble bees look like regular bumble bees, but they have a rusty-red patch on the middle of their back."

Ask the local company if they relocate bumble bees or if they exterminate them. If they exterminate, they'll probably need to dig deep into the ground to remove the complex nest structure. [16] X Research source It may cost a few hundred dollars to get professional bumble bee removal. If you want to do this, call the company as soon as you notice the bees so it will be easier to remove them."
