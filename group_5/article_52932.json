      "title": "Wash the kiwifruit.",
      "content": "Wash the kiwifruit. Washing the kiwifruit ensures that any possible contaminants on the skin, such as bacteria, are not transferred to the fruit itself. This way you will not get sick."

      "title": "Chop the kiwifruit in half, across the widest part.",
      "content": "Chop the kiwifruit in half, across the widest part. Use a clean, sharp fruit knife and a chopping board. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, the knife should cut right through. If it's still a little hard, you may need to slice again to cut through the core. [2] X Research source At this point, you can eat the kiwifruit as it is, scooping the flesh out of the skin with a spoon, like you would eat a boiled egg. [3] X Research source Some people prefer to remove the small, black seeds from the kiwifruit, but this is completely optional as the seeds are perfectly edible."

      "title": "Cut the kiwifruit into circular slices.",
      "content": "Cut the kiwifruit into circular slices. For smaller, more decorative slices of kiwifruit, cut the entire fruit into circular slices, working from one end to the other, discarding the end pieces. Then cut through the diameter of each circle to form small, kiwifruit semicircles. [4] X Research source These kiwifruit slices make a great addition to a decorative fruit salad and add a splash of tropical color to the tops of cakes, pavlovas and other desserts. They also make a great bite-sized snack for small children and work well in school lunches. If you want to remove the skin before chopping, just follow the method below."

      "title": "Cut the ends off the kiwifruit.",
      "content": "Cut the ends off the kiwifruit. Place the kiwifruit on a chopping board and carefully slice off both ends of the fruit, using a small knife. Don't worry about wasting the fruit, you will need to expose a decent amount of the kiwi fruit's green flesh in order for this method to work. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Insert a spoon between the skin and flesh of the kiwifruit.",
      "content": "Insert a spoon between the skin and flesh of the kiwifruit. You can use a regular tablespoon to do this. Try to get the spoon as closely underneath the skin as possible, as this will make the fruit easier to remove. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate the spoon around the kiwifruit, beneath the skin.",
      "content": "Rotate the spoon around the kiwifruit, beneath the skin. This will loosen the skin from the fruit. Depending on the size of the spoon, you may need to work on one side of the kiwi first, then switch to the other side to loosen all of the skin. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pop the fruit from the skin.",
      "content": "Pop the fruit from the skin. Once all of the skin has been loosened, you should easily be able to slide the entire kiwi fruit out, leaving you with a perfectly smooth, cylindrical fruit. [8] X Research source It is also possible to just peel the kiwifruit with a knife, but you will inevitably remove some of the fruit doing it this way, and end up with a strangely-shaped kiwifruit."

      "title": "Slice the kiwifruit vertically in half.",
      "content": "Slice the kiwifruit vertically in half. Then slice each half again to form little kiwifruit wedges, perfect for fruit salads or an attractively arranged fruit plate. Alternatively, you can easily dice the kiwifruit into cubes of any size. [9] X Research source"
