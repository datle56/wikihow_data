    {
      "title": "Have a clear reason as to why you want to convert this person.",
      "content": "Have a clear reason as to why you want to convert this person. Do you want to prove to others something? Are you feeling obligated to do it? Has Allah put this desire in your heart? Or do you just really love this person and care for this person and you want them to go with you to heaven?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a clear understanding of Islam.",
      "content": "Have a clear understanding of Islam. Are you a devoted Muslim? Do you put Allah first in your life? Are you a good example of how a Muslim should be? Make sure to have a close relationship with Allah. Attend a mosque every Friday, read your Qur'an, do not sin, etc. Help yourself before helping others."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pray.",
      "content": "Pray. Prayer is the number one factor here. If you want to convert your Christian friend to Islam, you have to tell Allah first! Tell Him how you feel, really open your heart to Him so that He can see how devoted you are and so that He can help you overcome this victory. Remember to pray daily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand their religion as well.",
      "content": "Understand their religion as well. This knowledge may come in handy especially when it comes to discussions. Look at the similarities and differences between both religions. Explain how Muslims respect the Prophet Jesus ('Isa)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invite them to attend a mosque!",
      "content": "Invite them to attend a mosque! Introduce them to some of your Muslim friends so that they can feel the warmth and love that we share towards each other. Mosques usually have sessions for converts or those wishing to convert to provide support, and help with any queries there may be. Just remember that they are not obligated to go if they do not wish to. Don't pressure them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be kind to others.",
      "content": "Be kind to others. Showing a good example is also a big key. Be kind, not only to them, but to everyone! Always have a smile on your face and always be happy, for Allah always wants our light to shine. Our actions can create a great impact on others. Remember talk is cheap; actions are worth so much more."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be a best friend.",
      "content": "Be a best friend. Be there whenever you can. If your friend is in a bad situation, don't just sit there and say you're sorry—do something for them! That way they can see how extraordinary you are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect their decision.",
      "content": "Respect their decision. Your friend may not ever want to become a Muslim, and that is perfectly alright. They have the right to their own beliefs. If Allah wants them to convert, He will make Himself present in their life. It's best to leave them be and drop the topic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make contacts with other Christian converts to Islam.",
      "content": "Make contacts with other Christian converts to Islam. Have them join you in persuading an individual into accepting Islam. Having them see and discuss with people who were once Christian will help get your point across."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't force it.",
      "content": "Don't force it. You have to be really smart and delicate with how you present the topic. If you're throwing information in their face and drowning them, it'll only discourage them. If they decline, respect their decision—remember, there's no compulsion in religion in Islam. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"
