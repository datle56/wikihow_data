      "content": "Pull out the emergency key. If your Nissan vehicle doesn’t need a key to start, there should be a little latch on the back of the fob. Pull on it and remove the emergency key. [1] X Research source If your key fob has a flip-out key blade, press the silver button in the upper corner to flip the blade out so you can open the fob more easily. If your key is for a 2013-2019 Nissan Sentra, unscrew the back. Use a #0 Philips head screwdriver to remove the screw near the bottom of the key. [2] X Research source If your fob is a Nissan proximity key for a Micra, Note, or Qashqai model, pull the tab on the side of the key and slide the bottom casing to the opposite side. Pull off the casing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull apart the two sides of the key fob using a screwdriver. Insert a screwdriver into the small slot at the bottom of the fob and twist until the fob pops open. The battery for the remote is the small silver disk on the side of the fob without buttons on the outside. [4] X Research source If the model of your car is older, the notch at the bottom of the fob might be wider, making it harder to use a screwdriver. Use a coin instead to easily push open the two sides of the key fob. Make sure your hands are clean and free from oil or grease before touching the inside of the key fob. [5] X Research source"

When putting the battery back in, make sure that the side with the specs etched into the battery and the plus sign (+) are face-down in the key fob. Push the battery against the springs on the inside and push down until it clicks into place. [7] X Research source If you’re not sure what kind of battery to get, there may be an engraving in the plastic behind the old battery indicating what type of battery it takes. Here are common battery specs: Nissan Altima (2007-2021): CR2032 Nissan Rogue (2010-2023): CR2032H Nissan Rogue (Flip Key Fob) (2014-2020): CR2032 Nissan Sentra (2013-2019): CR1620 Nissan Micra, Qashqai, or Note: CR2032 Nissan Leaf (2010-2020): CR2025 or CR2032 [8] X Research source If you’re still not sure what kind of battery your key fob takes, check your owner’s manual."

If you have an emergency key, push it back in the slot and reset the latch on the back to its original position. [9] X Research source If the key fob doesn’t click together right away, make sure that the battery is inserted correctly. If the two sides still aren’t coming together, wrap a piece of cloth around the casing and use a pair of pliers to gently squeeze the two sides together until they click into place.

      "content": "Test to make sure the key fob is working properly. Press the lock and unlock buttons a couple of times while near your car to see if it locks and unlocks. You will not have to reprogram your key fob after replacing the battery. If your car doesn’t respond, the battery you put in the fob may be dead. Replace the battery with a new one and try again to see if the fob is working correctly. Try removing and reinserting the battery. If your fob is still not working, it may be that the battery isn’t seated correctly. Make sure that the battery is in the correct orientation, face down in the fob. [11] X Research source If your key fob still doesn’t work, take your Nissan to a mechanic or your auto dealer. There might be a problem with the key fob’s programming or your car’s electrical system."

      "content": "Flip the key over and push the small latch release on the back of the fob. All push-start Nissan vehicles will have an emergency key in the fob that can be used to drive the car. Pull the emergency key from the bottom of the fob, insert it into the driver’s side door, and unlock your car. Enter your vehicle. [12] X Research source There are two ways to start your car depending on whether or not you have a key fob port: If your Nissan has a key fob port by the steering wheel, insert your key. Tap the brake pedal or the clutch as you press the START/STOP button to start your Nissan. If your Nissan doesn’t have a key fob port, step on the brake or clutch. Press the key fob against the START/STOP button to start your car. [13] X Research source If you’re having trouble starting your Nissan with a dead key fob, contact your auto dealer to arrange to get a replacement fob right away. If your Nissan does not have a push-start, use your key as normal to unlock the doors and start the vehicle."
