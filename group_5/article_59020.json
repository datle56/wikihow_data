      "title": "Draw something that comforts you.",
      "content": "Draw something that comforts you. Content does not matter as much as the connotations you associate with whatever you choose to draw. If you find mountains or trees relaxing to be around, try your hand at drawing your very own. Other likely candidates include: Your pet. Or your imaginary pet. Flowers, leaves, or bumblebees. Fruit, or other particularly attractive edibles. A building or place you admire or have positive memories in. Made-up combinations of animal parts. For instance, draw a dog’s head on a pig’s body with a turtle’s legs and tail."

      "content": "Just draw. Experiment drawing with different colors, patterns, and moods. [3] X Expert Source Jessica Elliott, ACC, CEC Certified Executive Coach Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. Believe it or not, drawing can help induce physical relaxation by decreasing your blood pressure, slowing your respiratory rate, and lowering your pulse. [4] X Research source Color your illustration with bright, exciting colors. Draw patterns. Start with variations of circles, as they're easier and more soothing to draw. Simply cover a page in a pattern. Losing yourself to abstraction can be a very effective method of providing yourself with a healthy distraction and can boost creativity and memory too! [5] X Research source Draw your subjects smiling. Whether mountain, human, or animal, add a smiley face. Sure, it’s silly – but you’ll probably smile back."

      "title": "Be somewhere where you feel calm.",
      "content": "Be somewhere where you feel calm. Choose somewhere with minimal distractions. Switch off your phone, and avoid areas with television or computers. Somewhere private is best, as your drawing will not be inhibited by the presence of others, and you will be less likely to be interrupted. Get outside. Simply being outside will calm you down. Drawing outside can also give you inspiration and ideas of things to draw."

[6] X Expert Source Jessica Elliott, ACC, CEC Certified Executive Coach Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. [7] X Research source Sitting down to draw for just a few minutes can rekindle your youthful spirit. You'll get a boost in energy and may even feel more open-minded for the rest of the day.

[8] X Research source Mount your work. Hang it up somewhere it will catch your eye. Put it in your room or near a doorway you use to leave your house for unexpected boosts in your mood."

      "title": "Draw whatever is stressing you out.",
      "content": "Draw whatever is stressing you out. Be detailed and don't hold back. Draw literal or metaphorical representations of scenarios that indicate the sources of your stress. Creating a visual equivalent of what you’re facing is a powerful way to affect your feelings, and even help conceptualize solutions. [9] X Research source Destroy the representation of your stress. Scribble all over it, or tear the page into tiny pieces. Use your hands to make the act of destruction especially satisfying. Throw it all away! Just the act of metaphorically throwing your stressors away can be powerfully therapeutic."

      "title": "Release emotion onto the page.",
      "content": "Release emotion onto the page. Without intending to draw anything in particular, simply apply your drawing utensil to a blank sheet of paper. Close your eyes. Focus on whatever emotions you’re feeling and would like to get rid of. Once you’re focused on emotion, allow it to pass through your arm and hand onto the sheet of paper. Allow your emotion, not your mind, to dictate the movement of the pen or pencil. Whatever comes out on the page is simply an expression of what you’re feeling. Since visual art is nonverbal, you don’t have to struggle to try to express yourself with words. Evoking feelings through creative expression can help you release emotions you’re holding in. [10] X Research source Recognize that the illustration itself is insignificant. Focus purely on the act of drawing. By doing this, you’ll be more mindful of the present moment. This allows your mind to clear itself and calmly begin to recalibrate your emotions. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep an illustrated journal. You can conceptualize the journal in a certain way, or as a catch-all for your drawings. You may want to focus on drawing everything you feel positively about in life. Alternatively, you may simply want to draw everything that frustrates you. Or you can simply attempt to draw things that you find aesthetically pleasing. [12] X Research source Keep a specific version of an illustrated journal in which you draw about feelings or ideas that come to you in specific contexts. For instance, keep a dream diary by your bed and attempt to draw what your imagination conjures in your dreams."

      "title": "Listen to music while you draw.",
      "content": "Listen to music while you draw. Music can powerfully affect your mood by relaxing and inspiring you. Consider your music selection. Soft, rhythmic music (ideally without lyrics) will be especially effective in putting your mind at ease. Vary the music depending on your mood – faster music can energize you as long as it doesn’t distract you or make you uncomfortable. Play songs you know well. Lyrics can be welcome if you already know them. Singing along or mouthing the words without thinking can have a calming effect that distracts you from whatever has been stressing you out."

      "title": "Take a drawing class.",
      "content": "Take a drawing class. You don’t need to achieve a certain level of ability to benefit from the mood-improving and calming aspects of drawing, but getting better can make drawing even more rewarding. [13] X Research source Community colleges often have low-cost classes taught by well-qualified teachers, and classes often meet in the evenings. Lots of communities also have arts councils that will also offer fun-oriented, open-enrollment classes in drawing and other creative mediums."

      "title": "Keep your drawing materials with you.",
      "content": "Keep your drawing materials with you. Keep at least a notepad and pen or pencil with you so you can draw whenever inspiration (or stress) strikes. As you go about your day, jot down ideas of what you’d like to draw later on. Simply visualizing yourself drawing will both calm you down and increase the satisfaction you derive once you get the chance to do so!"
