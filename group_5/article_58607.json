[2] X Research source If you've got really dry skin, look for a thick moisturizer or a moisturizing cream. If you have eczema, skip products with fragrances since these can irritate your skin. Although you should usually moisturize your skin after getting out of the bath or shower, don't use a moisturizer right before you wax, or the product will have trouble sticking to your skin."

Yes, you already used a dry brush to physically exfoliate your skin, but chemical exfoliation is also important to prevent ingrown hairs. Massage an exfoliating product onto your bikini line and rinse it away. Chemical exfoliators dissolve the protein bonds in dead skin cells so they won't clog your pores. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Read product labels and choose an exfoliator with salicylic acid if you've got really oily skin. Beta hydroxyls are also in most exfoliators since they cleanse your pores and help slough off dead skin cells. You can use an exfoliator before or after washing your bikini line. Either way, plan on washing and exfoliating before you wax the area."
