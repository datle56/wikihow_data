      "content": "Make sure the battery is below 25%. This will reduce the fire risk if your battery is damaged during this process. If the battery is swollen, there's a greater chance that it will explode or catch fire. In that case, take the Switch to a professional, and don't attempt to replace the swollen battery yourself. If your battery smells bad or feels hot, don't attempt to remove the battery. Never breathe in fumes from a smoking battery, and take immediate action to reduce the fire hazards in the area. If the battery should catch fire, smother it with sand, use foam or CO2 fire extinguishers, pour cold water over it, cover it with a fireproof container, and stand clear. [2] X Research source"

If you have a newer model, you most likely have a foam piece to remove. Use your fingers or tweezers to remove it. Don't yank it if it doesn't come off easily since it can tear. Instead, pull at different spots to remove it. If the shield plate is tough to remove, insert a plastic chip or spudger under it. You'll see thermal paste lining the other side of the shield plate. This paste prevents your Switch from overheating. You can reuse the thermal paste from the shield plate if it isn't dirty. If the paste doesn't look good, use K-9 thermal paste instead."

      "content": "Remove the battery. Apply a few drops of adhesive remover or isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher) inside the battery well. Allow either liquid ample time to dissolve or loosen the adhesive, which may take 2-20 minutes. Since the battery can be challenging to remove, you might want to lift a corner using the spudger or plastic putty knife, then use floss to peel the battery away from the adhesive. Be very careful if you use heat to loosen the adhesive! Heating your battery incorrectly can cause it to explode or catch fire. Avoid bending the battery as you remove it."
