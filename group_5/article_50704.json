      "content": "Gaming addiction occurs when play habits interfere with someone's life. The addiction usually happens with internet-based games but can occur with any electronic device. The player can’t control how much time they spend on the game, meaning their lifestyle becomes unhealthy, and they fall behind in self-care, relationships, school and work.

      "content": "Accept responsibility. [2] X Research source The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. The first step is realizing there's a problem and deciding that the place you're in, is not working for you. It is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them. Video game is habit-forming, you must consciously decide to end the practice. Know that playing video games is not an addiction until you let it take over your life; so much so that you become dysfunctional. If you are unable to complete daily routine activities, then it's time to sit down and make conscious choices."

      "content": "Identify the impact. How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book?

      "title": "Avoid blame.",
      "content": "Avoid blame. Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step. Also, do not make excuses, take responsibility."

      "content": "Set limits. [3] X Research source Set a certain time amount of time each day when you allow yourself to play. If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that and choose your games accordingly. If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves, or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games. Set a reminder on your phone to alert you when to start and stop playing. If you find yourself unable to stop when the notification is up, it is a sign that you should quit playing completely."

Developing your confidence level is essential, know beating an addiction is a challenging goal; and every minute of every day will count.
