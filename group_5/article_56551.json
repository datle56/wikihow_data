      "content": "Learn the center line theory. A foundation of Wing Chun is the protection of your body's center line. Imagine a line that starts at the middle top of your head and travels along the middle of your chest to the lower body. This is the center line of your body and it is the most vulnerable. It must be protected at all times. [1] X Research source According to the center line theory, you should always attack down the center line and perform your defensive moves against your opponent’s center line. The basic open stance in Wing Chun is based on the theory of the center line. In the open stance, stand facing forward with your knees bent and your feet pointing slightly outward. By facing your opponent head-on, you are able to attack with the most balanced force."

[3] X Research source If you have experience in other martial arts, (especially \"hard styles\"), you will have to \"empty your cup\" or unlearn bad habits. Wing Chun is a soft style with many neutralizing techniques that require you to be \"soft\" and relaxed. Reconditioning your muscle memory and building relaxed habits can be frustrating and takes time, but it will be worth it in the long run."

They may only teach the basics, and if you are serious about learning advanced Wing Chun, you may need to go to an area that has more advanced classes. Meet with the sifu (instructor) and ask about their background. How many years of experience do they have? How did they learn Wing Chun? Sit in on a Wing Chun class. Get a feel for how the sifu conducts the class and how the other students respond. Learning Wing Chun in person is the most preferred method."
