If you have normal skin, your pores are likely barely visible and you rarely have breakouts, irritation, or sensitivity to skincare products. Your complexion likely looks radiant and clear if you have normal skin.

      "content": "Notice the symptoms of dry skin. When you have dry skin on your face, it feels dry and perhaps even stiff when you move your face's muscles quickly or try stretching your face. Your dry facial skin may look flakey or like it needs to peel on occasion. Your dry skin might form cracks that bleed. It may also look noticeably like it needs hydration or moisturizing. Many people get more severe dry skin in the winter because of the climate change. The surface of your skin may also appear dull and you may have visible fine lines if your skin is dry."

      "title": "Recognize if you have oily skin.",
      "content": "Recognize if you have oily skin. Immediately after you wash your face, oily skin won't stay matte for long. It gets shiny again very quickly. Your face will shine because of the oil produced on the surface of your skin, and your pores will be easily visible across the center of your face. There will likely be many breakouts on your face if you have oily skin. Oily skin is more common in younger people. Skin typically gets more dried out as we age."

      "content": "Determine if you have a combination skin type. If your face is oily in the T-zone (the area of your nose, between your eyes and eyebrows, and forehead only) but everywhere else is dry, you probably have combination-type skin. [3] X Research source If you have combination skin, then you will need to moisturize the different areas of your face appropriately. Follow guidelines for oily skin for your T-zone and follow guidelines for dry skin for the rest of your face. Combination skin usually involves pores that look larger than normal because they are more open. This can also lead to more frequent breakouts."

When washing the face, it is best if you wash your face with warm water. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source When showering or washing your face, use warm or lukewarm water instead of hot water. Use a gentle cleanser that is fragrance-free. Try using a micellar solution to remove makeup and dirt if you want to cleanse your face without water. Avoid using hot or cold water when washing your face. Exposing the skin on your face to these extreme temperatures can cause excess dryness, irritation, or even rupture blood vessels.

Start using a moisturizer product that is labeled \"for dry to very dry skin.\" If you think that your skin is only a little dry, pick the product that is labeled \"for normal to dry skin.\" Opt for a lightweight moisturizer during the day and a heavier moisturizer at night, such as an intensive moisturizer. [9] X Research source If you want to use a natural ingredient, use an oil, such as olive oil or coconut oil. You should also look for moisturizers with ingredients that are beneficial to dry skin, such as olive oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, urea, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, dimethicone, lanolin, glycerin, petrolatum, and mineral oil.

It is important to apply your moisturizer immediately after washing your face so that the cream can help hold in any added moisture remaining from washing your face. Apply evenly and leave it for few minutes, until your face feels more hydrated. After this, you can apply your makeup.

A hydrating sunscreen that is broad spectrum (protects from both UVA and UVB rays) will protect you from burns and sun damage that ages the skin and will also prevent skin from drying out further. Apply sunscreen as your morning moisturizer. You shouldn't need more than that, but if you want to supplement with an additional moisturizer, apply the SPF first. Wait a few minutes and allow it to dry, then apply the moisturizer on top."

It is recommended that you wash your face twice a day with a cleansing soap. However, don’t wash your face more than this or you may make your oily skin worse. Don't use hot water or steam to clean your face, as this removes essential fatty acids from your skin. [12] X Research source And since oily skin is the easiest type of skin for acne to emerge on (owing to the excessive oil that is trapped inside the pores), it is better to have a cleansing face soap that contains tea tree oil/lemon/salicylic acid. Over-washing can dry your skin, which can actually cause it to produce more oil to compensate."
