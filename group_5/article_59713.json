      "content": "Scorpios make a passionate, well-matched pair. A Scorpio man and a Scorpio woman will bring equal amounts of passion, emotional sensitivity, introspection, sensuality, and loyalty to a relationship. And did we mention the sex? These two just need to learn to trust one another—not something that comes naturally to them—and their relationship will thrive. Scorpios are naturally a bit mistrustful and secretive, but this means that once their loyalty is won, they don’t relinquish it easily. These two are capable of soulmate-level intimacy—if only they can learn to rely on one another, share their secrets, and let down their guard."

      "content": "Sex between Scorpios is hot, hot, hot. Each sign in the zodiac rules over a different body part, and it’ll come as no surprise that Scorpio rules over the genitals. [1] X Research source Scorpios are deeply passionate. They infuse every moment of their day with sensuality, making it almost an intrinsic part of their day-to-day life—like air.

      "title": "As water signs, these two share a strong emotional connection.",
      "content": "As water signs, these two share a strong emotional connection. They are both deeply empathetic people and are likely to be twin flames. Slow to trust, intimacy may not come quickly, but when it does, it comes naturally. They are capable of plumbing one another’s emotional depths, and they love to do so: these two signs are on an emotional wavelength other signs can’t even contemplate. It's almost as if they're reading one another's minds at times. [2] X Research source Because they’re so secretive, sharing secrets with one another is the best way to cultivate a strong emotional connection. Scorpios consider it an honor to be entrusted with another person’s private secrets, especially another Scorpio. Since Scorpios can be slow to trust, it’s vital that they be honest with one another to make this a compatible match."

      "title": "They’re stubborn but sensitive communicators.",
      "content": "They’re stubborn but sensitive communicators. Because Scorpio is ruled by the dark and mysterious Pluto, they may be slow to share their feelings. And since they’re also ruled by the aggressive Mars and are fixed signs, they may sometimes be overly stubborn or refuse to give ground in an argument. However, their emotional intelligence and sensitivity, as well as their strong sense of devotion, mean that they’re usually invested in resolving disagreements with their partner. It may help two Scorpios who are arguing to intentionally slow down and take breaks often. Since they’re both Scorpios, they’re likely to understand one another’s emotional and communication weaknesses and to have some grace for those weaknesses."

      "title": "Scorpios value loyalty, making betrayal a major offense.",
      "content": "Scorpios value loyalty, making betrayal a major offense. Because Scorpios are so guarded and mysterious, when they devote themselves to something or someone, they expect loyalty and devotion in return. They’re emotionally intelligent enough to understand the reasons behind betrayal, but as the sign with the rawest nerves in the zodiac, they’re unlikely to forgive disloyalty. Represented by the scorpion, a Scorpio’s intensity can make them “scary” to other signs, but their cold, dark, intense personas are really just there to defend the ultra-tender hearts underneath. Reader Poll: We asked 637 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios, and 67% of them agreed that their biggest dealbreaker is lying . [Take Poll] So to avoid feelings of betrayal in a Scorpio-Scorpio relationship, both partners should always tell the truth—even when it's hard."

      "title": "Two Scorpios may struggle to trust one another.",
      "content": "Two Scorpios may struggle to trust one another. Scorpios in love share an intense emotional connection verging on telepathy. They can sense what the other feels and needs, and their loyalty and dedication make them a natural pair. They just need to be sure to abandon their instinct for self-preservation around one another—the instinct that makes them prone to secrecy and stubbornness. A relationship won’t last without vulnerability, trust, and flexibility. Scorpios in love may also struggle if they become competitive with one another—say, if they’re in the same career field or have the same hobby. As long as they maintain some independence within their relationship, they may avoid competition with each other."
