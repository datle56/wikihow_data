      "content": "Close the door to restart cooking. As a safety precaution, the oven will turn off if the door is open for too long. If the oven door was cracked a little while you were cooking, the auto-shut-off feature may lead you to think that something is wrong with your oven! This is a super simple fix: make sure the oven door is shut so it stays heated and cooks your meal."

      "content": "Check if the gas is on in your house. You can try lighting the burners on your stovetop or using the gas in other places around your house to see if your gas is on. By default, your oven ignites periodically to maintain the temperature you set while cooking. However, if the oven doesn't stay warm when you don't have burners on, the gas pressure is too high. In that case, you need to get further help from your gas company. If the oven doesn't heat up when the cooktop is on, contact Samsung for a repair service."

      "title": "Your oven may not be getting sufficient power.",
      "content": "Your oven may not be getting sufficient power. Electric ovens need 240v to work, and many houses use two 120v circuits. Sometimes one circuit will work and the other won't, so you need to restart the circuit breaker. In this case, the oven will turn on but not heat. So you might think the oven is working, then pull out an uncooked meal. Electric ovens can still look like they are working, but gas stoves will not turn on or spark the igniter. Turn the circuits off and back on again to see if your oven heats."

      "title": "An incorrect thermostat can cause issues with heating.",
      "content": "An incorrect thermostat can cause issues with heating. Testing this first is pretty easy, especially if you have an oven-safe thermostat that you can put in the oven while it's heating. You want to see if the temperature you're setting the oven to is the same temperature that your oven thermometer shows. To calibrate this, go to Settings/Options > Thermostat Adjustment and follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate your thermostat! If your Samsung oven does not have a \"Settings\" or \"Options\" button, look in your user manual to find which buttons you need to press!"

      "title": "A faulty bake element can cause your oven not to heat at all.",
      "content": "A faulty bake element can cause your oven not to heat at all. This is more likely for older Samsung ovens. To check the bake element , use a multimeter. Unplug your oven and access the back panel. Test the two terminals near the base of the oven for continuity. You're looking for a 10-50 ohms reading. If there's no continuity, the bake element isn't working and needs to be replaced. If you're handy and confident in this repair, you can replace it yourself . But, if you're not confident in your handiness skills, request a repair service through Samsung's support page ."

Once you've located the burner that won't ignite, connect your multimeter to it, and see if the needle moves. If not, then the igniter is faulty and should be replaced. You might be able to repair the oven yourself , but you can always contact Samsung for a repair service."
