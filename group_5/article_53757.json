      "content": "Serve the soju cold and neat for the best flavor. Chill the bottle of soju in the refrigerator for a few hours if you are drinking at home. Don’t add ice to the drink because it is typically served as a small pour and taken as a shot. [2] X Research source Chilled soju is a popular serving option in the summer months, though it may be served warm during the winter months. It can also be served at room temperature."

      "content": "Swirl the bottle around to create a whirlpool inside. Hold the soju near the bottom of the bottle in one hand and vigorously swirl it in a circular motion. It should only take about 2-3 seconds of swirling to create a whirlpool effect inside the bottle. [3] X Research source This tradition dates back to the old days when sediment was deposited into the bottles during production. Swirling the bottle is meant to bring the sediment to the top of the bottle. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Slap the bottom of the bottle with your palm and twist off the cap. Hold the bottle towards the bottom of the neck in one hand. Then, use your other hand to firmly slap the end of the bottle. After a couple of slaps, twist off the cap. [5] X Research source You may also bang the bottom of the bottle against your elbow instead of slapping it with your palm. [6] X Research source Some say the purpose of this part also has to do with breaking up the sediment in the bottle."

      "title": "Spread your middle and index finger apart and jab the neck of the bottle.",
      "content": "Spread your middle and index finger apart and jab the neck of the bottle. Grip the lower portion of the bottle with one hand to hold it steady, and use the webbed area between your middle finger and index finger on your other hand to sharply jab the neck of the bottle. This should be done with enough force to make a little bit of the soju splash out of the bottle. [7] X Research source Back in the day, this motion was meant to knock the sediment that was deposited during production out of the bottle so it doesn’t get drank. Even though it’s no longer necessary to do this, it’s still part of soju drinking culture."

After everyone has received their pour, another member of the group uses both hands to pour a shot for the server. [9] X Research source Make sure to cover the bottle label while pouring your elder. These traditions are all rooted in a sense of respect."

As members of the group take turns pouring rounds of shots for one another, each needs to hold the bottle with both hands (while covering up the bottle label). This is another way of showing respect, especially when serving your elders. [10] X Research source If you are pouring the shots, do not fill your own glass. After you have filled everyone else’s glass, set the bottle down so someone can fill yours for you. If you’re pouring soju for a friend, you only need to use 1 hand. [11] X Research source"

Despite being a liquor, it doesn’t have the same alcohol content as other types of hard alcohol—for reference, a bottle of soju can have anywhere from 16.7% to 45% alcohol. [20] X Research source Historically speaking, soju used to be made solely with rice; however, in 1965, using rice for soju was forbidden thanks to post-war food shortages. Because of this, the soju brewers expanded their recipes to include other types of starches to make what was known as “diluted soju.” [21] X Research source Some may use terms like “traditional soju” and “modern soju” to describe the beverage nowadays. Traditional soju refers to liquor made purely with rice, while modern soju refers to liquor brewed with other starches. Modern soju is often sold in distinctive green bottles. [22] X Research source"
