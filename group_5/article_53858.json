      "content": "Smaller dishes and cutlery instantly shrink your serving size. During a party, researchers gave the party-goers a big or small dish, as well as a big or small ice cream scooper. Overall, people who had bigger bowls and scoops ate more ice cream than the people with smaller dishes and scoops. This is because smaller dishes and serving utensils make it way easier to enjoy food in moderation. [9] X Research source For instance, you could grab the smallest dish available at a buffet, or eat dinner on smaller plates at home."

      "content": "Check the food label to see what the recommended portion size is. When you eat directly out of the bag, it’s all too easy to lose track of how much you’ve actually eaten. Portioning your food helps you enjoy your favorite snacks without eating really big portions. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source For example, you might pour some potato chips into a small dish instead of snacking directly from the bag. You might pour out a handful of your favorite candy instead of eating the whole package at once."

Choose to eat when you’re hungry, but not starving—this way, you can appreciate your food instead of eating it really quickly. Then, dish out a small portion for yourself. Take a couple of minutes to think about the time and effort that went into making the meal. As you start eating, enjoy your food in small bites, taking time to chew carefully.
