      "content": "Wait until the in-game summer or winter seasons. Sturgeon only spawn in Stardew Valley during the in-game summer or winter seasons. If it’s currently spring or fall in your game, continue playing until the seasons change. Sturgeons are most likely to pop up during a rainy summer day, and less likely to pop up on a rainy winter day. Thankfully, rainy winter days aren’t even possible unless you craft and use a rain totem."

      "content": "Go to the Mountain Lake area between 6 AM and 7 PM. As soon as you wake up in the morning, head toward the mountain area in the game, which is above (north of) your farm. The body of water just past Linus’s tent is known as the Mountain Lake area. Focus on fishing in the bottom right portion of the lake by standing on the center island or right-most riverbank.

Press and hold the “Use Tool” button on your device console to determine how far your line gets thrown out—ideally, try to let go of the button when the on-screen bar is filled up to throw the line out as far as possible.

      "content": "Use special fishing gear and enhancements when you fish . Upgrade to a fiberglass rod (requires Fishing Level 2) to unlock the ability to use bait or an iridium fishing rod (requires Fishing Level 6) to unlock the ability to use both bait and tackle. A cork or trap bobber may make it easier to reel in the difficult sturgeon, while bait makes fish bite your line more quickly. [3] X Research source Eating fish dishes in-game (like Trout Soup, which you can buy at Willy’s) boosts your Fishing Level temporarily, which can be helpful. [4] X Research source Equip your fishing rod with bait and tackle by hitting the tackle with the “Use Tool” control; then, hit the fishing rod with the “Do Action control” ( A on Xbox, ✕ on PlayStation, A on Switch, and right-click on PC) to place the tackle. The same process applies for bait. Seafoam pudding, fish tacos, shrimp cocktail, lobster bisque, fish stew, maple bar, escargot, chowder, and dish o’ the sea can also give you a Fishing Level bonus. Tip: Catch a variety of fish in-game to help boost your Fishing Level. The higher your Fishing Level, the larger your bobber is and the greater proficiency score you have with a fishing rod.

After 2 days, Robin will be finished building the pond; at that point, drop your sturgeon into the pond, where it will eventually make sturgeon roe. [8] X Research source When placed in a preserves jar, sturgeon roe becomes caviar after fermenting for 4 in-game days. [9] X Research source For the population to increase in the pond, the fish will ask you to drop certain items into the pond, like 1 diamond; 1 jelly, 1 pickles, or 2 maple syrup; 3 omni geodes; and 1 nautilus shell.
