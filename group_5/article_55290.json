      "content": "Relax and enjoy each other’s company. You don’t have to do anything special to have a memorable kiss with someone. If you and this girl like each other, she will probably enjoy kissing you and remember the kiss regardless of what you do. Try doing something that is fun for both of you and kiss her when the mood feels right. [1] X Research source For example, if you and this girl enjoy watching movies, watch a movie together. If you’re both avid sports fans, you could attend a local sports game and give her a kiss when your team scores."

      "title": "Look at her and hold her gaze when you want to kiss her.",
      "content": "Look at her and hold her gaze when you want to kiss her. Look into her eyes and smile or keep your expression neutral. Keep looking at her until she notices you or say something simple like, “hey,” to get her attention. If she looks back at you and holds your gaze, she probably wants to kiss you, too. [2] X Research source Even if you don’t kiss right away, this can be a great way to build anticipation for the kiss. Try leaning in closer to her, but stopping a few inches from her face so your lips are just out of her reach. Look her in the eyes and smile to let her butterflies fly inside her belly, creating anticipation. Keep moving your eyes from her eyes to her lips to make it clear you're interested in kissing her."

      "content": "Wait for a good moment if you want to heighten the romance. The right time to kiss someone could be when you least expect it, so be on the lookout for a romantic moment. This might be while you’re talking, walking, or dancing together. While you don’t have to stage an elaborate scene, try waiting until you're alone together so you can express your feelings for her with a kiss. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to avoid kissing her when she might be distracted. When your girl is engrossed in the latest episode of her favorite show or is busy talking to her friends probably isn't the best time to kiss her. You may want to go somewhere quiet and private with her if you are somewhere public and think she might be uncomfortable if you kiss her in front of other people. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Say something romantic just before you kiss her.",
      "content": "Say something romantic just before you kiss her. Tell her she’s beautiful, that you love the way she laughs, or that you just love her (as long as you mean it). Saying something romantic before you kiss her can help to ensure that she will always remember the moment. It may also help to increase the chances that she will want to kiss you in the first place. [5] X Research source Try saying something like, “You are so beautiful,” or “I love spending time with you.” Make sure that you say something genuine to her. Don’t lie or flatter her because you think she will kiss you if you do."

      "title": "Look her in the eyes and lean in towards her slowly.",
      "content": "Look her in the eyes and lean in towards her slowly. When you’re ready to go in for the kiss, make eye contact with her. If she looks away, she might not want to kiss yet, so hold off a little longer. However, if she looks back into your eyes, try leaning towards her. If she leans in toward you, this is a good sign she wants to kiss you. [6] X Research source Try taking this opportunity to look at her closely and appreciate her beauty. You could even run your thumb across her lips before you kiss her and gaze into her eyes for a few seconds before you kiss her."

      "content": "Take it slow and tease her a little at first. Avoid rushing or kissing her too aggressively as this can make a kiss awkward and uncomfortable. Start by kissing her lightly on the lips with no tongue. Then, apply more pressure to her lips with your lips as the kiss continues. If you want to intensify the kiss even more, gently slide your tongue into her mouth and massage her tongue with yours. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Touch her face or neck while you kiss her.",
      "content": "Touch her face or neck while you kiss her. Try cradling the side of her face or her chin with one hand while you kiss her. Or you could gently stroke her cheek or neck while you kiss. For an even more intense option, place one hand on each side of her face and pull her towards you as you go in for the kiss. Hold her face close to yours while you kiss her. [8] X Research source Make sure to be gentle when you touch her face or neck. Grabbing her roughly in these areas could hurt her and ruin the mood."

      "title": "Place your hands on her waist and pull her closer to you.",
      "content": "Place your hands on her waist and pull her closer to you. Watch for signs that she’s enjoying the kiss and seems to want to get closer to you, such as by holding onto your shoulders or pressing her body against yours. Show her that you noticed and you want to get closer too by grasping her hips or waist and pulling her towards you. Even placing your hand on the small of her back and pressing her gently towards you can be a great way to get closer and intensify the kiss. [9] X Research source For an even more memorable moment, you could lift her up into your arms while you kiss her or pull her onto your lap if you're sitting down. However, only do this if she seems to be enjoying the kiss."

      "title": "Pay attention to how she reacts to your kiss and respond sensitively.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how she reacts to your kiss and respond sensitively. She may lean in closer to you, run her fingers through your hair, sling her arms around your neck, or possibly even push you away. No matter what she does, be sensitive to it and respond appropriately. [10] X Research source For example, if she runs her fingers through your hair, you might respond by softly stroking her hair, back, or arm. If she pushes away from you when you kiss her, take a step back from her as well to let her know you won’t do it again. You could even say something like, “I’m sorry. Was that too fast?”"

      "title": "Kiss her neck, earlobes, jawline, or shoulders after the kiss ends.",
      "content": "Kiss her neck, earlobes, jawline, or shoulders after the kiss ends. Adding a few gentle kisses to other areas of her upper body can heighten the romance and make the kiss even more memorable. If she seems to want to keep kissing you after you pull away, try gently kissing her on her earlobes, jawline, neck, or shoulders. Then, kiss her on the mouth again after exploring these areas of her body. [11] X Research source Avoid sucking on her neck or other areas of her body. This will leave unsightly bruises and it can be painful."
