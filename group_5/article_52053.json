This will help remove bugs, visible dirt, and other surface grime. You may want to make broad circular motions to reduce streaks. Most dirt should come off easily, but you can scrub a little if there is something stuck on the headlight. Your headlights may still be yellow or foggy, even after you clean off the visible debris. You can remove these issues by using a baking powder and vinegar mixture. You may repeat this as many times as you need to remove the dirt."

Keep rinsing until the headlight is clear and sparkling. Once it is clear, you can wipe it dry with a clean cloth or paper towel. You can rinse the headlight using a sponge. Soak the sponge in clean water, and use it to wipe away the baking soda. You may need to squeeze out the sponge and soak it again to help remove all of the baking soda. You can also rinse it by filling a spray bottle with water. Spray the headlight, and wipe the water away until the baking soda is completely gone."
