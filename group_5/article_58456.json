While the quarter is spinning, the player must then take a chug of beer with the same hand they spun the quarter with and then pick up the quarter before it stops spinning also with the same hand they drank their beer with. If you are caught using the wrong hand, then you must take a drink and redo your spin till you get it right."

By using these empty beer cans, you can smash a person's quarter mid-spin causing them to have to down a good portion of their beer and restart their turn; not to mention that once that empty can is used, that empty beer can remains in the spot it was for the remainder of the game."
