      "content": "See which of you can take the most interesting and artistic photos. To start, make a list of subjects for you and your date to try and photograph. Then, head out and look for opportunities to take pictures of those subjects, wherever they might be. When you’re done, compare the results! If you have time, pick the photos you like best and create a photo album with them. Any subject could work for a photo challenge—it depends on where you are and what you want to photograph! For example, if it’s the middle of the summer, why not go outside and do a nature-themed photography challenge? Your subjects could include things like flowers, butterflies, and birds. Alternatively, try a couple’s photoshoot. Play with different poses, facial expressions, and backgrounds to add variety to your pics."

For example: Go skydiving together Revisit the place you had your first kiss Get matching tattoos Buy a home together Share a kiss by the Eiffel Tower in Paris Spend New Year’s somewhere different every year"

      "content": "Turn up the heat on your date while playing a sexy version of poker. The rules of poker are nearly identical to regular poker; the only difference is that whoever gets the worst hand in each round has to take off a piece of clothing. Keep playing strip poker until one of you loses all your clothing (or as much clothing as you’re comfortable with.) Comfort is key, so check in before playing and discuss your boundaries. If you’re both comfortable baring it all while you play, great! If not, figure out how far you’re willing to go to ensure the game doesn’t cross that line. If you’re in the mood for a night on the town, try playing poker (and other fun games) at a casino instead. Get dressed up with your date and see how much money you can win!"

Rather than trying something new, whip up those family recipes and sample one another’s favorite childhood dishes. Alternatively, try a DIY cheese or chocolate tasting. Buy several varieties of cheese (or chocolate, if you have a sweet tooth) from the grocery store and sample them together!"
