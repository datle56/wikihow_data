[3] X Research source The diameter is the length of a line segment that connects two points on a circle and passes through the center of the circle. In other words, it represents the fullest distance across the circle. [4] X Research source The diameter will always be twice the radius. If you know the radius, you can multiply by 2 to get the diameter; if you know the diameter; you can divide by 2 to get the radius. Remember that a line that connects two points on the circle (also known as a chord) but does not pass through the center will not give you the diameter; it will have a shorter distance."

To denote a circle at a particular location on a graph, simply put the location of the center after the symbol. [5] X Research source A circle located at point 0 would look like this: ⊙O."

      "content": "Know the equation of a circle. The standard form for the equation of a circle is (x – a)^2 + (y – b)^2 = r^2. The symbols a and b represent the center of the circle as a point on an axis, with a as the horizontal displacement and b as the vertical displacement. The symbol r represents the radius. [6] X Research source As an example, take the equation x^2 + y^2 = 16."

If there are no brackets – as in our example – that means that a = 0 and b = 0. [7] X Research source In the example, note that you can write (x – 0)^2 + (y – 0)^2 = 16. You can see that a = 0 and b = 0, and the center of your circle is therefore at the origin, at point (0, 0)."

Be careful: if the r part of your equation does not include a square, you will have to figure out your radius. [8] X Research source So, in our example, you have a 16 for r, but there is no square. To get the radius, write r^2 = 16; you can then solve to see that the radius is 4. Now you can write the equation as x^2 + y^2 =4^2."
