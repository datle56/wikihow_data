This is the second step of salvation, after repentance. It may be thought of as a self portrait of your joining with Christ in the death and resurrection in your heart (core of your being) and in the eye of the observer. “Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit” (Acts‬ ‭2:38). Baptism was described by the apostle Paul as: \"Therefore we are planted together (united) with Him by baptism into death: that as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life\" (Roman 6:4). [5] X Research source Remember when you get baptized it is an act of obedience but cannot grant you salvation by itself. You must repent, believe and place your faith in Jesus Christ."

      "content": "Repent which means, \"turn to God\" for salvation. Repent for your sins. When you in your mind or deed are convicted of sin, make penance so that you can be forgiven, and you can keep on living as a Child of God. Verbalize your belief in Jesus' forgiveness and your regret for all the ways you have fallen short in obedience. This is a good time to admit your personal failure and disobedience to God. Believe that Jesus Christ forgives you. Repentance always expresses itself in a changed life; you turn from sin and to Jesus Christ; then, accept your free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus' redemptive death through grace from God. As Son of Man, Jesus said, \"Father, if it is your will, let this bitter cup pass from me - nevertheless, not my will but thine be done\", giving Himself freely to His Heavenly Fathers will for He loves His Father.

When reading the Bible, don't just read pages of words, just to look good and think you're doing a good thing. Study small portions at a time, or as much as you can. Absorb mentally without being overwhelmed. You will find it helpful to continue to study who Jesus is and what He has done. The Bible states that \"all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23). In other words, each and every person has done wrong. Romans 6:23 continues, \"The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.\" His love is perfect, with the power to overcome through His all sufficient grace, abundant, that His Holy Spirit should reside in you, and His blood, as your Father flow within your veins as a child of The King. Thus, you yourself, then \"walking not with but in Him\" by receiving His measure of faith, a free gift -- that you may serve Him (by loving others, thus showing Him forth)."

Understand fasting or any other act of giving away something should be done with knowledge. Because Jesus said, \"If you do not love one another, you are none of mine.\" And so, Jesus explained God's amazing gift to us when He was asked about not loving each other: 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?' He answered, \"Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of my children, you did not do it to Me. These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\"(Matthew 25:44-46)"

There are many non-believers, but that doesn't mean you can't be friends with them. Be an example with your attitude which should be like that of Christ.

Don't be ashamed, live freely, approach God at all times, come into a personal relationship with Him, and be transformed as His own.

After all, when the Lord Himself was accused of guilt (even though He didn't do anything wrong as He is holy), He didn't retaliate or even get angry. Act wise when someone accuses your faith or speaks unkindly of God. Jesus drove away those who made His Father's temple as a marketplace. Follow His example. God does not make mistakes. Don't think He did something wrong or bad. He knows exactly what He's doing, and all of His plans for you are good and attainable. If you walk in the straight and narrow path He places before you, He becomes your refuge."
