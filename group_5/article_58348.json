The first stage after each challenging stage is always (except stage 4) a Double Side attack stage. Otherwise, they will enter as described below. Galagas and red aliens enter from the bottom left.

Doubled-UP attack: The aliens come in side-by-side. This is the most difficult set to kill. You have to destroy one layer to get to the other. You can get away with sloppy play in most stages. Always bring yourself to full attention during the Doubled-UP attack stage. Single-File attack: Twice as long, but one after another.

Allow the creature to fully form, if you shoot it while its morphing, the bonus will be lost."
