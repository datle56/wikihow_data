      "content": "A personalized greeting It may seem obvious, but a personal greeting shows you’ve researched who you’re contacting and makes your email seem handcrafted (instead of copied and pasted from a template). If you’re cold-emailing an individual, politely address them by last name with an appropriate title (like Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.). [2] X Research source Or, if you’re writing to a new colleague on your team or at your company, feel free to use their first name if it fits into your work culture. Address groups or teams as a whole. For example: Dear Ms. Kensington, … Dear Dr. Smith, … Hello, Henry, … Hi, marketing team!"

Clearly state your name and why you’re communicating (it may be tempting to add some personality here, but keep it simple and save humor or flair for later sections of your message). [3] X Research source Go for a clear but friendly tone and be specific about why you’re writing: [4] X Research source My name is [your name] and I wanted to introduce myself to discuss arranging an informational interview. I hope you’re doing well this afternoon. I’m [your name] and I’m writing to introduce myself. Let me introduce myself. I’m [your name] and I’m your new department manager.

[5] X Research source Try to make a connection with the person; this can make you more memorable and help build a stronger potential relationship with them. It also makes your email feel more personal and less insincere or unprofessional. [6] X Research source For example: I got your email address from our mutual connection, Sheila, who let me know you may be searching for an administrative assistant. I found your contact information on LinkedIn and admire the work you’re doing to fight homelessness in the city. It’s something I’m quite passionate about as well! I received your email address from the HR department and wanted to share how much I admire your graphic design work. As a designer myself, I find your projects fascinating! It’s a pleasure to e-meet you! We have several mutual contacts who’ve told me about your upcoming projects, and I’d like to offer my services.

[7] X Research source If you’re inquiring about a potential job or business inquiry, pick something related to the field that highlights why you’re a good fit. If you're introducing yourself to new colleagues or a new team, you can share something less work-related (just make sure to keep it appropriate). A bit about myself: I graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in economics and have lived in Portland for the past 6 years. Outside of work, I love baking and trying new recipes. Right now, I’m trying to master a chocolate soufflé, but I definitely need some more practice! I’ve always been engaged in local politics, from being Student Body President at my undergrad university to serving on my town council for the past 2 years. That’s why I’d be thrilled to work for your campaign. You’ll probably see photos of my dog Peanut on my desk when you walk by.

Although you want to write a professional-sounding email , using super stiff or impersonal language can make you seem disinterested or like you’re simply copying from an email template.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source A great way to sound agreeable and personable is to show gratitude for the recipient reading your message or doing something for you, like setting up a meeting. This slight vulnerability is especially important if you’re cold-emailing someone who has an advantage over you, like a hiring manager. For example, you could say “I’m really grateful for your consideration” or “Thank you so much for the chance to connect.
