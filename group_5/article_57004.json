      "content": "A regular scrubbing prevents bacteria growth and odor. Aim to clean your toilet seat and bowl every 2 or 3 days. This will ensure that everything is disinfected and there’s nothing but a clean smell. [1] X Research source Keep a toilet brush and cleaner next to your toilet to remind you to clean. Use a cotton swab to wipe out the hinge of the toilet seat. Bacteria can build up in nooks and crannies, causing an unpleasant smell. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Toilet sprays eliminate odors once they hit the water.",
      "content": "Toilet sprays eliminate odors once they hit the water. Unlike air fresheners, toilet sprays are sprayed over the toilet’s water, leaving a mask of aromatherapy essential oils on the surface. This mask traps odors in while releasing pleasant smells even as you go. Simply flush, and no one will be the wiser! Poo-Pourri is the top-selling toilet spray, but Air Wick’s V.I.Poo is another comparable option. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Toilet drops",
      "content": "Toilet drops can prevent odors from slipping out after you flush. These nicely scented drops work similarly to toilet sprays, but they’re mainly used once everything’s long gone. If you get up from the toilet and smell a funk, use 1 or 2 drops after the toilet stops running to deodorize lingering odors. Aesop’s Post-Poo Drops is highly recommended with its citrus peel scent. [4] X Research source Make sure you read the toilet drops’ instructions, as some products, like Just a Drop , are used before going to the bathroom."

      "content": "Odors can come from the toilet tank, so keeping it clean is important. When bacteria builds up in the tank, you’ll start to smell it. A few squirts of Windex on top of the tank’s water will kill germs and help the toilet smell fresher with each flush. [5] X Research source Windex does the trick for this hack because it’s an alcohol and ammonia-based solution designed to target bacteria while leaving behind a clean scent. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Vinegar is a natural deodorizer that leaves behind a neutral, pleasant scent. Say goodbye to stinky fumes because a little bit of white distilled vinegar in the toilet tank can absorb foul-smelling bacteria. All you have to do is pour about 1 cup (8 oz) of vinegar into the tank’s water. Let it sit for 10 minutes, scrub the sides of the tank with a toothbrush or cleaning brush, and flush all the water. [7] X Research source Hold the flush handle down until all the water has left the tank. Do not let the vinegar sit in the water for longer than 10 minutes as the acidity could damage the toilet or pipes."

      "content": "Destroy bad-smelling odors with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a natural oxidizing agent, meaning it breaks down odors. [8] X Research source After you’ve done your business in the morning, spray this topical solution on top of the water inside the bowl. Let it sit until your next flush to help get rid of any nasty smells. [9] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide can irritate the skin, so be careful when handling the spray bottle. If you can’t find a hydrogen peroxide with a spray bottle attached, carefully pour the solution into an empty spray bottle ."

      "title": "Powdered laundry detergent is a great alternative to toilet cleaner.",
      "content": "Powdered laundry detergent is a great alternative to toilet cleaner. One of the main reasons a toilet stinks is because it needs a good scrubbing. Instead of skipping a clean because you’re out of cleaner, use powdered laundry detergent instead. Take about a half scoop of powder and sprinkle it around the inside of the bowl. Wait 15 minutes, and then scrub away with a toilet brush. [10] X Research source Use the scooper that came with the laundry detergent or a 1/2 cup (64 g) measuring cup. Flush the toilet before adding the powder. This will ensure that the powder sticks to all sides of the bowl. Not only does powdered detergent kill bacteria, but it also smells fresh and clean."

      "content": "Freshen a toilet’s water with every flush using Fabuloso. Fabuloso is a multi-purpose cleaner safe for toilet use that comes in a variety of scents, making it the perfect cleaner to make a DIY freshener. Drill a small hole in the bottom of a 500 ml (16.9 oz) bottle of Fabuloso. Place the bottle on one side of the tank away from the toilet’s chain and flapper. [11] X Research source Remove the label before placing the Fabuloso in the tank, so the paper won’t fall off and clog the tank. Tie a string around the neck of the bottle, hang the string outside the back of the tank, and put the tank lid on over the string. This will keep the bottle from floating near the flapper."

Pour the solution into the toilet bowl and give the toilet a good scrub with a toilet brush. [12] X Research source The mixture will naturally start foaming up thanks to the vinegar reacting to the baking soda—just imagine what that foam will do to those odors! This DIY cleaner is for single use only, and cannot be stored for later use."

[14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Add more or less water to your mixture depending on the consistency—it should feel like wet, moldable sand. Use a silicone ice cube tray to make multiple toilet bombs the size of your palm. Let the bomb sit and fizz at the bottom of the toilet bowl, and then use a scrub brush to swirl the mixture up the sides of the bowl.
