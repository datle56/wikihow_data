      "content": "If you or your ex need space to heal, it’s best to hold off on sexting. If one or both of you still are really sad about your old relationship, then suggestive messages will probably lead to heartache. Plus, if either of you are feeling withdrawal but want to move on, then sexts might make you really crave a connection that already ended.

[4] X Research source If your ex says they’re totally fine with sexts, then establish boundaries . For example, say, \"Nice! So, what's fair game? Texts? Pics? Vids? Just want to be clear.\" If your ex doesn’t want to sext, thank them for advocating for themselves. Make a comment like, \"I totally respect that. Thanks for letting me know. I'm fine just being friends.\""
