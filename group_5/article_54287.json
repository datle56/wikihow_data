      "content": "Browse the “ Free with Ads ” section on the Movies & TV page. Open YouTube on your computer, phone, smart TV, or any other device. Under the Explore tab or menu on your device, find the “Movies & TV” option and select it. At the top of the next screen, click “Free with Ads” to see the movies you can watch with your YouTube account at no extra charge. Movies range from recent releases to classics, and new ones are added frequently so you’ll always have options available. While you cannot search or filter the free movies to find a specific film, they are separated by genre so it’s easy to find something that matches your mood. If you have a YouTube Premium account , then you won’t have any ads interrupting your movie. [1] X Research source Premium doesn’t give you access to additional movies however. Once you click on a movie, look below the video to see the rating, runtime, and summary of the plot."

      "content": "Search for the title followed by “full movie” to see if it’s been uploaded. Log in to YouTube on your computer, phone, or any other device and open the search bar. Type in the name of the film you want to watch followed by “full movie” or “free.” Look through the search results for a video that’s the same length as the movie. If you’re lucky, another person may have uploaded it to their account. Finding movies this way may be more difficult because the videos quickly get taken down for copyrighted material. Avoid following links to download movies in video descriptions because they may lead to sites that contain harmful malware. Downloading pirated movies from these sites may also be illegal in your area."
