      "title": "Brushing with water is better than nothing.",
      "content": "Brushing with water is better than nothing. Run your toothbrush under the sink and vigorously scrub your teeth, tongue, and gums. If you don’t have a toothbrush, simply swish water around your mouth to loosen up plaque and bacteria. This isn’t a great long-term solution, but it can help you out for a night or two. [1] X Research source Unfortunately, brushing with water probably won’t freshen your breath."

      "title": "It’s a mild abrasive that can scrub off plaque and bacteria.",
      "content": "It’s a mild abrasive that can scrub off plaque and bacteria. Simply sprinkle a bit of baking soda onto your toothpaste, get it wet, then start brushing! It’s not quite as good as regular toothpaste, but it will help freshen your teeth and get rid of any buildup. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a toothbrush available, just sprinkle the baking soda onto your finger and brush your teeth like that instead."

      "title": "It’s another mild abrasive that can get rid of plaque.",
      "content": "It’s another mild abrasive that can get rid of plaque. Add a pinch of sea salt to a cup full of warm water, then let it dissolve. Dip your toothbrush into the mixture and brush your teeth with it to freshen up your mouth when you don’t have toothpaste. [3] X Research source Always dilute sea salt with water before brushing. Scrubbing your teeth with straight sea salt can damage the enamel on your teeth."

      "title": "Give your mouth a quick pick-me-up with minty mouthwash.",
      "content": "Give your mouth a quick pick-me-up with minty mouthwash. Simply pour a capful into your mouth, swish it for 60 seconds, and spit it back out. It will help freshen your breath and tide you over until you can get some toothpaste again. [4] X Research source Try not to use mouthwash as a long-term replacement for brushing your teeth. It can help in the short-term, but nothing beats a good scrubbing with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Rinsing with mouthwash is better than nothing, especially if you don’t have a toothbrush around. It will help to freshen your breath and get rid of some of the bacteria that builds up on your teeth."

      "content": "It will help remove food particles and plaque. If you don’t have toothpaste but you do have access to floss, go through and clean out in between each individual tooth. It’s not quite as good as brushing with toothpaste, but it can tide you over for a little bit. [5] X Research source It’s always a good idea to keep some floss with you in a travel or overnight bag."

      "title": "Water flossers clean between and around your teeth.",
      "content": "Water flossers clean between and around your teeth. Fill up the base of your water flosser with water and point it inside of your mouth. Turn the flosser on and slowly work your way across each tooth, focusing on the spaces in between each one. [6] X Research source You can buy water flossers at most drugstores. They’re great to use if you’re at risk for cavities or gum disease."

      "content": "Gum helps freshen your breath and loosen up food particles. If you don’t have toothpaste, pop a piece of sugarless gum in your mouth. You’ll feel refreshed and make your breath smell great! Make sure the gum you choose is sugarless. Chewing gum with sugar in it can add plaque and bacteria to your mouth."

      "content": "Fiber-rich vegetables can help clean your teeth. If you’re really in a pinch, reach for some celery, carrots, or even an apple to scrub away plaque and clean your gums. Be aware, though, that eating fruits and veggies probably won’t freshen your breath.

      "content": "Both teas help to kill or hold off bad bacteria. Brew a pot of green or black tea and drink a cup after a meal to prevent bacteria from growing or stop it from making it worse. While drinking tea isn’t a replacement for brushing your teeth, it can be a nice way to freshen up your mouth during the day.
