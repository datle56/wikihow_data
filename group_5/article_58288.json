Turn the TENS device off while you are adjusting the electrode placement. You may arrange the electrodes in several ways, depending on what works best for you. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Place the electrodes on either side of the area that hurts or over points that your physiotherapist shows you on a chart. If the electrodes are colored red and black, position the black electrodes farther from your trunk or torso, such as on your arms or legs, and the red electrodes closer to your torso. This will help prevent unpleasant impulses from going to your central nervous system. It will also stimulate muscle contractions. You may arrange the electrodes in lines, in X formations, or in squares, but they must be at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) or farther apart. To make an X, place one pair of matched negative and positive electrodes for one diagonal and another pair for the crossing angle. [2] X Research source"

Then, increase them to an effective setting if needed. See a physiotherapist to get help adjusting the settings. This will reduce the likelihood of using a setting that is too high or too low. Ask about common massage points useful for relaxation on your body. Your physiotherapist will have experience and will be able to advise you as to what is best for your condition and what to avoid. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source To relieve your pain, find the pain points with your finger tips and apply electrode pads around there. The various settings feel different for each person, depending upon how sensitive you are and what your condition is. The body gets resistant to a unit that has only one pattern of electro “tapping.” Some have a random pattern."

      "content": "Adjust the amount of electricity slowly, gradually, and carefully. Start with the machine completely off, then turn it on so that the dial is at its lowest setting. Slowly raise the electrical current until you feel a pleasant tingling feeling. If it hurts, then the current is too high. [4] X Research source More is not necessarily better. Turning it up too high will not increase the amount of pain relief. Your body may get used to the effect of a certain level of current after a while. If this happens to you, increase the current slightly."

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This doesn't necessarily mean starting at that setting, which might be painful. Start out on a low setting, then increase it slightly until you get to your preferred setting. Use TENS as long or as often as you want (up to 12 hours per session when the pads begin to dry out). [6] X Research source If you use it for long periods of time while doing other things, you can clip the unit to your belt or keep it in your pocket. The amount of time that you're going to use the TENS unit will differ depending on the condition being treated, the chronicity of your health condition, and the way your body will respond. A physiotherapist will be able to provide the proper recommendations on the amount of time to use the TENS, in addition to the number of times that you can use the TENS. Be aware that using it too often will lead to your body getting used to the impulses. Eventually, the effects may diminish over time."

If you have a disorder which affects the rhythm of your heart/heartbeat, your heart might be particularly sensitive to electrical impulses, and malfunction. If you are allergic to the electrode pads, you may be able to get hypoallergenic electrode pads. If you are pregnant or might be pregnant, do not use TENS without it being prescribed. The risks of using TENS during pregnancy aren't known, so do not use it without consulting your doctor. Some women find it helpful for pain relief during labor pains, but be sure to ask your doctor whether it is safe for you and your baby before using it.
