      "title": "“How did it go?” asks about the outcome of an event.",
      "content": "“How did it go?” asks about the outcome of an event. The speaker is referring to some event or situation that took place in the past. For example, let’s say someone just gave a presentation. Asking that person “How did it go?” is the same as asking them “How did your presentation go?” or “How was your presentation ?” [1] X Research source “How’d it go?” has the same meaning as “How did it go?” “How’d” is just a contraction of “How did,” making this phrase more casual."

      "title": "The phrase “how did it go?” is used to ask about a past event.",
      "content": "The phrase “how did it go?” is used to ask about a past event. The speaker asks the listener to tell them about a certain event or situation. These events are often related to work tasks or small talk, like asking how a meeting or doctor’s appointment went. [2] X Research source Usually, someone asking, “How did it go?” is hoping for a positive outcome. For example, asking, “How did it go?” when you know someone just went on a date or had an important presentation at work is a sign of empathy or encouragement."

      "title": "“How did it go?” is used to refer to past conversations and context.",
      "content": "“How did it go?” is used to refer to past conversations and context. Both speakers must know what the “it” in “how did it go” refers to. The two speakers must have had a previous conversation about a certain event. For example, say you had a job interview and had been telling your friend how nervous you were. After the interview, you call up your friend. They ask, “How did it go?” In this case, you automatically know that they are asking about their interview because you expected to discuss it the next time you talk to each other."

      "content": "How did + (thing or event) go? This question is in the past tense, signified by the past tense “did.” If you already know the context of the question, you can say, “How did + it go?” Otherwise, you can replace “it” with the specific thing or event you’re asking about. [3] X Research source How did the presentation go? How did your date go? How did your performance go? How did your dentist appointment go?"

      "title": "Did + (thing or event) + go + (adverb)?",
      "content": "Did + (thing or event) + go + (adverb) ? By removing “how” from the beginning and adding an adverb at the end, you can turn “how did it go” into a yes-or-no question. “Well” is the most used adverb in this context, used to ask if something went successfully. [4] X Research source Did it go well ? Did the presentation go well ? Did your date go well ? Did your performance go well ? Did your dentist appointment go well ? In more casual settings with native English speakers, you may also hear “okay” used as an adverb, which has the same meaning as “well,” such as “Did it go okay?”"

      "title": "How do you think + (thing or event) will go?",
      "content": "How do you think + (thing or event) will go? This question is similar to “How did it go,” but asks about a future event instead of a past one. For example, if you tell a coworker about an upcoming meeting, they may say, “How do you think it will go?” [5] X Research source"

Did it happen as planned? Did you enjoy yourself? Were parts of it challenging? Was it better than expected? Would you do it again? Why? What did others involved think about it? Would you recommend something like this to me? I know you were worried about it—how do you feel about it now?"

[9] X Research source The question: “How did it (your meeting with the client) go?” What this question means: I know you’ve been spending a lot of time preparing for this meeting, and you told me you were nervous about it.

The client arrived, and I gave my presentation. Good answer: The meeting went well. I feel like the client really responded to the new product, and I convinced them that it was the right choice for them.
