      "content": "Save your plunging necklines and daring styles for another event. Tea parties are traditionally somewhat conservative when it comes to the wardrobe. You don't want to show too much skin, so wear a skirt or dress with a knee-length or longer hemline. Choose an outfit with a modest hemline, too. [1] X Research source A button-down sweater or cardigan is a great way to add a little coverage if your dress or top has a low neckline."

      "content": "A vibrant, colorful dress is a tea party classic. Dresses and tea parties are a timeless combination. Any kind of semi-formal, colorful dress will work. Leave your little black dress in your closet for this occasion—black clothes of any kind aren't usually appropriate for a tea party. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pair a skirt with a blouse for a sweet, comfortable look. This is a great example of a semi-casual outfit that works really well for tea parties. Choose a skirt that's at least knee-length—like a snug-fitting pencil skirt or flared full skirt. Then, wear a top that you can tuck into the skirt so your outfit looks polished. [3] X Research source For example, wear a blouse with billowy sleeves and tuck it into a colorful pencil skirt. Finish the look with kitten heels or sandals. To make a retro tea party outfit, wear a short-sleeved shirt with a cashmere cardigan and a full skirt."

      "title": "Reach for pale colors, fun patterns, or clothing with ruffles.",
      "content": "Reach for pale colors, fun patterns, or clothing with ruffles. Instead of dressing in bold patterns or edgy prints, choose soft, timeless looks. You might find a tea-length dress with a pale blue polka dot pattern, a light pink dress with a ruffled hem, or a soft plaid suit, for instance. [4] X Research source In general, skip the color black for a tea party, which can look way too formal or serious. Remember, you want light, bright, fun colors! Choose light, flowy dresses made from cotton, linen, or a synthetic blend for spring and summer teas. Save heavier dresses made with velvet, chenille, or tweed for cool weather teas."

      "content": "Soften your tea party look by putting a cardigan on over your dress or shirt. Not only does a cardigan, button-down sweater, or vest add a little warmth, it can also add a nice pop of color. If you're wearing a white dress or shirt, for instance, throw on a soft rose or pale green sweater. [5] X Research source For something a little more masculine, wear a pale sweater vest over a collared shirt. To add a little interest, pick something with a pattern like argyle print."

      "title": "Opt for stylish pants to create a comfortable tea time look.",
      "content": "Opt for stylish pants to create a comfortable tea time look. Dress pants or slacks are totally fine for men or women to wear as long as they're tailored to fit you perfectly. Wear a stylish blouse or shirt with the pants and consider throwing on a light blazer to make your outfit look really put together. [6] X Research source For example, you could wear navy slacks with a crisp, white or pale blue collared shirt, and leather shoes. To give the look a more feminine feel, choose a blouse with a floral print and choose kitten-heeled shoes. Skip the jeans, shorts, and T-shirts since these are way too casual for most tea parties."

      "title": "Comfortable sandals, flats, or boat shoes are great for semi-casual outfits.",
      "content": "Comfortable sandals, flats, or boat shoes are great for semi-casual outfits. Open-toed shoes are perfect for most garden teas, although you could reach for casual flats. Match a comfortable style of shoe with your look—boat shoes work well with slacks while you can find sandals that work with any dress or skirt. [7] X Research source Avoid wearing sneakers or flip-flops to a tea party since these are a little too informal."

      "content": "Dress up your look with stylish closed-toed shoes like heels or mary janes. For a more formal tea party, feel free to reach for heels—just skip stilettos and choose something with a stacked style so it's a little more conservative. If you're wearing slacks, wear nice leather shoes, pointed ballet flats, or leather Mary Janes, for instance. [8] X Research source Not sure which shoes to wear? Try pairing brogues with a tailored suit or wear wedges with a flowy maxi dress."

      "title": "Look for an elegant hat or fascinator that matches your outfit.",
      "content": "Look for an elegant hat or fascinator that matches your outfit. Since there aren't rules about what type of hat you should wear, the sky's the limit! Go for a big, floppy hat if you're attending a garden tea party, for instance, or pick a small, artsy fascinator for an intimate tea party. [9] X Research source If you'd like to complete a masculine outfit, pop on a fedora to give it a sharp style. Hats are usually optional at a tea party, but it's a good idea to check the invitation for a specific dress code."

      "title": "If you're wearing an elegant dress, finish the look with long gloves.",
      "content": "If you're wearing an elegant dress, finish the look with long gloves. Save the short gloves for more casual events. [10] X Research source Gloves aren't required at tea parties, but wearing gloves with lots of lace accents or small bows can make you look even more dolled up. While you don't need to remove your hat during tea, it is good manners to remove your gloves before the tea service begins."

      "content": "Choose simple, elegant accessories that don't overwhelm your outfit. Accentuate your outfit without going overboard—pick one statement jewelry piece like a cocktail ring, classic watch, or a sparkly brooch, but keep the rest of your jewelry simple. If you're wearing a suit, reach for classic cuff links. [11] X Expert Source Nejla Renee Fashion Stylist & Image Consultant Expert Interview. 18 May 2020. For example, if you're wearing a simple tea-length dress with sandals, classic pearl stud earrings are perfect. If you're dressing up for a more formal tea, you might wear diamond studs and a simple gold necklace. Dressing up for a children's tea party?
