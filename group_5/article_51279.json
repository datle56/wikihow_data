    {
      "title": "After work you can find me…",
      "content": "After work you can find me… This prompt gives you a chance to tell potential matches how you spend your free time. Your response says a lot about what your interests are and how you prioritize the different parts of your life. Focus on something unique—most people enjoy food and music. [1] X Research source “Hitting the gym or heading out to the river for an evening run.” “Unwinding! Usually by grabbing a happy hour cocktail with friends or curling up to watch Netflix with my pup.” “Coaching my youth soccer team to glory!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If I had an extra hour in the day, I would…",
      "content": "If I had an extra hour in the day, I would… Start your response to this prompt with an insight into what your daily life actually looks like. Then, mention what types of hobbies or activities you’d like to pick up if you had the time. Your answer should give potential matches an idea of what kind of future life you’d like to lead (together). “Call my family in Hawai’i. Living on the East Coast, my chances to talk to them are few and far between, and I’d treasure having a little extra time to catch up.” “Take Swedish classes! My lifelong dream is to spend a year or two living abroad in Scandinavia, and that seems like an essential first step!” “Literally just wandering. I moved to Austin recently, and I’d appreciate the extra time to turn off my brain and explore my new city!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "My perfect Sunday…",
      "content": "My perfect Sunday… Let your fellow Bumble users know what your Sunday actually looks like. Then, add information about what you would add to make it absolutely perfect. Be honest and realistic, and don’t start throwing out ideas for activities that you would be unlikely to actually do in real life. [2] X Research source “Sleeping in is non-negotiable, but I’d follow that with a slow morning reading the newest addition to my crime thriller library. Then tennis, Sweetgreen for lunch, and having my friends over for sushi and board games.” “I typically work Sunday afternoons, but my ideal pre-shift morning would be grabbing a flat white from Blue Bottle and soaking up the sun with my Boston Terrier at the dog park. After that, I’ll usually bring my guitar to my friend’s house and jam with the guys.” “I like a Sunday reset before the busy work week begins, so I’d go to Whole Foods, meal prep, and do some laundry (boring, I know) before winding down for the night.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Perfect first date…",
      "content": "Perfect first date… Outlining your ideal first meet is a great way to let potential matches know exactly what you’re hoping for. Be specific and write out a mini-itinerary—but don’t get too focused on the details! Keep things light and offer a few ideas for first-date activities . [3] X Research source “Seeing a movie (preferably comedy) then grabbing dinner at In-N-Out (with animal fries, duh!). If the weather’s nice, I’d take dinner to the nearest park for a little sunset picnic.” “Break every high score at the boardwalk arcade, then make a Spotify Blend playlist to listen to together while sipping Coronas on the beach.” “Eat our way through as many pizza slices as possible in Little Italy and top it all off with (individual) tiramisus at Ferrara Bakery.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Must-see movie",
      "content": "Must-see movie Personalize this prompt to make sure it really tells people something about you. Add a sentence explaining why this is your favorite movie or a funny anecdote associated with it. Movies can be great conversation starters if a match shares your taste—and even if they’ve never seen it, that gives you an opening to suggest it as a first-date activity. “I think Before Sunrise is one of the most subtle and beautiful films ever made, plus it inspired my solo trip to Vienna when I was 19.” “I’m obsessed with Napoleon Dynamite and can recreate his infamous dance routine (but only for my nearest and dearest).” “ West Side Story , hands down, I love musicals almost as much as I love anything that Steven Spielberg has had a hand in.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "I quote too much from…",
      "content": "I quote too much from… This prompt allows you to talk about your interests, whether it be quotes from a movie, book, T.V. show, or popular musician. Whatever your choice, make sure that it’s actually a truthful answer that will help someone get to know you and your personality better. [4] X Research source “ Lord of the Rings for sure, but especially when it comes to convincing my friends that ‘second breakfast’ is a valid meal.” “Should I be embarrassed to say it’s Jersey Shore ? I mean, shouldn’t “cabs are here” really be part of everyone’s daily vernacular?” “I really resonate with a lot of Hozier’s lyrics. One of my faves is “‘And just knowing that everything will end should not change our plans.’”"
    },
    {
      "title": "My childhood celebrity crush is…",
      "content": "My childhood celebrity crush is… This fun and slightly embarrassing prompt is a great conversation starter (especially if your childhood crush was a bit out of the norm). However, make sure matches are getting enough out of this question. Add fun personal details along with your crush’s name to make your response really stand out. [5] X Research source “I was enamored by Joey from Dawson’s Creek , with the added benefit that that show has the greatest theme song of all time!” “Tiffani Amber Thiessen…I definitely ripped all of her pictures out of Tiger Beat magazine and stuck them on my wall lol.” “Does Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid count as a celebrity?”"

      "content": "If I could eat one meal for the rest of my life… If you’re a foodie or really into cooking, this prompt is a great chance to flex your culinary skills or invite a match to your fave restaurant. If food isn’t a major passion or interest for you, however, feel free to skip this one. [6] X Research source “It’s gotta be a full tray of shrimp tacos from ¿Por Qué No? Taquería in Portland…if you haven’t been there already, I’ve got an idea for our first date!” “The first meal I learned to make from scratch was chicken pot pie, and that recipe still has me in a chokehold! I could easily eat that every day for the rest of my life.” “The Japanese-Style Fried Rice from Trader Joe’s. My freezer is never without it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "My hidden talent…",
      "content": "My hidden talent… You can definitely use this prompt to show off your goofy side, but it may be worth a serious response! Write about something you would bring to the table in a potential relationship, especially if it’s something that may not be immediately obvious about you. [7] X Research source “Choosing the fastest checkout line at the grocery store. Believe me, it makes a real difference.” “I have an extremely good sense of direction. I never use my Maps app—if I’ve been somewhere once, I can get there again without any help!” “Knowing who the perp is within 10 minutes of any Law & Order: SVU episode .”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If I could have a superpower, it would be…",
      "content": "If I could have a superpower, it would be… Avoid giving a generic, one-word response like “invisibility” or “flying.” These responses are technically fine, but they don’t really say anything about you! Instead, think about superpowers that would give you access to the life you want to live. [8] X Research source “To be able to speak any language fluently. I would love to be able to connect with more local people when I’m traveling and hear their stories and tips!” “Always being able to find the perfect song for any given mood, moment, or person—music is definitely the way to peoples’ souls!” “Time travel. I studied history and anthropology in school, and it would be so incredible to be able to really experience all the time periods that I’ve studied.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "The person/thing that holds me the most accountable is…",
      "content": "The person/thing that holds me the most accountable is… This prompt really shows off your guiding principles and what kind of people or things are important in your life. You might use this question as an opportunity to demonstrate your faith, your daily routines, or someone who’s a big part of your support system. “Myself! I love my friends and family, but at the end of the day, I’m the person in charge of my life and how I live it.” “My best friend. He always tells it to me straight and gives great advice.” “God. My religion has never steered me wrong, and I’m really grateful to have that spiritual support.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "I’m most grateful for…",
      "content": "I’m most grateful for… By sharing what you’re grateful for, you’re really telling potential dates about your personality and values. This prompt is a good opportunity to show your more serious and reflective side and share what really matters to you! “My son. I get him every other week, and I always treasure the time I spend with him.” “My two cats, who are always down for a cuddle when I get home from work.” “My studio apartment (that’s conveniently close to my favorite beer garden).”"
    },
    {
      "title": "The world would be a better place with more…",
      "content": "The world would be a better place with more… This prompt shows off your more philosophical or existential side. It’s a chance to express your most firmly held values and beliefs—and to see if your views align before you even match. You could write a funny response to this prompt, but only if it’s highly specific and original. “People who engage with current events and politics, and don’t turn a blind eye to what’s happening in the world around them.” “Body neutrality. Our bodies are about function and health, and we spend so much time focusing on our appearance and judging others for things outside their control!” “Four-day work weeks! I’m down to work smarter, not harder (and they do it in the Netherlands, so we know it’s chill).”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If I had three wishes, I’d wish for…",
      "content": "If I had three wishes, I’d wish for… Be specific and thoughtful as you answer this question to make sure your response truly represents your values and personality. [9] X Research source Once you decide on your three wishes, give a sentence or two to explain why you made the choices you did. “The money to put a home library into my house—complete with a moving ladder, of course!” “A house in Santa Barbara. I spent summers there with my brothers growing up and would love to recreate those memories for any future kids I have.” “One more day with my cousin who passed away last year.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "My dream dinner guest…",
      "content": "My dream dinner guest… Your response to this prompt says a lot about what type of people you admire and what kinds of conversations are important to you. You could choose a loved one that has passed, a celebrity that you idolize, or a present-day figure whose brain you’d like to pick. [10] X Research source “The next U.S. president. I’d love to pitch some ideas about social issues and education reform.” “My grandmother who passed away when my dad was a kid. I never got the chance to meet her, and I would definitely love to hear about her life firsthand.” “Paul McCartney. He’s just such a musical genius, and I grew up listening to the Beatles nonstop.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Go-to karaoke song is…",
      "content": "Go-to karaoke song is… This prompt definitely shows off your fun side, but you should still try to say something specific about you. Maybe your karaoke song is from a movie franchise that you love, by an artist that you’ve seen in concert 10 times, or reminds you of your sister since you always sing it together. [11] X Research source “It’s always going to be ABBA songs for me (usually ‘Waterloo’). I used to always watch Mamma Mia with my mom growing up.” “ Believe by Cher is my go-to, always.

      "content": "I get way too excited about… Share something you’re genuinely passionate about with your potential date. Not only should this prompt highlight a really important part of your life, but it also gives your matches a natural opening to ask you more questions about your interests. “Video game releases. I love classics like FIFA and GTA but I’m always excited to see what new stuff is coming out.” “New restaurants in my neighborhood. Especially if they serve a cuisine that isn’t very popular in the area, I love checking out the new foods and the new community it brings!” “Rock climbing. I spend at least two nights a week at the climbing gym and love to go bouldering whenever possible.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A pro and con of dating me…",
      "content": "A pro and con of dating me… Name one reason someone would love to date you and another area you need to work on. Be honest , but remain lighthearted. Owning both your pros and cons (even when they poke at your insecurities) shows emotional intelligence and self-awareness. [12] X Research source “Pro: I’ll answer every part of your text. Con: Sometimes, your Amazon Prime orders will be delivered faster than my reply (but I’m working on it!).” “Pro: I’m a HUGE fan of birthdays and will always make sure you celebrate yours exactly how you want.

    },
    {
      "title": "We’ll get along if…",
      "content": "We’ll get along if… Share the kinds of experiences you want to share with your future partner, rather than writing a generic, throwaway response like “you like margaritas” or “you want to travel.” Being specific and unique is the key to using dating apps successfully .

    },
    {
      "title": "Favorite quality in a person…",
      "content": "Favorite quality in a person… Your response to this question doesn’t have to be romantic for a match to learn more about the type of people you include in your life. You could allude to a trait you appreciate in a best friend, beloved coworker, or potential long-term partner. “I love someone who is really flexible and spontaneous, like my best friend.” “People who can always make the best of a bad situation (but also be serious when the moment calls for it).” “I appreciate an S.O. who will stand up for me and always have my back when I need them.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A non-negotiable…",
      "content": "A non-negotiable… Here comes your opportunity to present your “dealbreaker.” Mention a crucial quality, value, or shared goal that you’d like your partner to have. Use a positive tone and try not to list off more than one or two things that are really important for you to have in a partner. [14] X Research source “Someone who’s a great communicator and takes the time to take in alternate perspectives.” “You’re interested in making travel a priority and living abroad at some point in the future.” “You understand that me and my kids are a package deal (and a great one at that!).”"

    {
      "title": "I promise I won’t judge you if…",
      "content": "I promise I won’t judge you if… This prompt is a great place to show off your silliness and sense of humor.

Share something that you think would make you a great choice to bring to a wedding, office party, or other social event. “I’ll come up with a code word (or signal) to pull you out of any uncomfy convos.” “I absolutely tear it up whenever the Cha Cha Slide comes on.” “I am a complete believer in the snack table being the best place to be at any party.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "A review from a friend…",
      "content": "A review from a friend… Time to call in the reinforcements! Ask a close friend to write a little blurb about how awesome you are. They could mention your best personality traits, a favorite memory together, or five reasons they would date you (in another life). “The best karaoke partner and an even BETTER life partner (although I only have solid evidence of one, which is that this guy belts T. Swift like no other).” “2 stars for text responsiveness, 3 stars for style, 4 stars for mad dance moves, and 5 stars for empathy/generosity/humor/good vibes.” “My parents love Andy more than they love me. And to be honest, he’s a great guy, so I can’t even be mad about it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Best travel story…",
      "content": "Best travel story… Share an anecdote about a trip or travel experience that says a lot about your personality. Include information about who you traveled with, how long you were away, how old you were on the trip, etc. Be cautious when using this prompt, however, and avoid using “travel” as your main personality trait unless it’s truly a passion of yours. [15] X Research source “I went ziplining in Costa Rica and got stuck halfway down the line…I truly thought that was it for me 😬” “I went to Valencia with friends in college, and we spent an entire night drinking sangria on the beach until the sun came up. I need my beauty sleep now, but those were some magical memories.” “Tie between coming face to face with a buffalo while road-tripping through Wyoming and seeing the Blue City on a solo trip to Morocco.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Beach or mountains?",
      "content": "Beach or mountains? It’s easy to write a one-word response to this simple prompt, but you shouldn’t. This prompt acts as a great icebreaker, but it should still say something more about you than just whether you prefer sandy shores or alpine heights. Give your choice and a reason for it that reveals more about your personality. “I love the mountains. I grew up in Washington state, and hiking is my go-to weekend activity.” “I have to have access to a beach wherever I live. My parents always had to drag me out of the water whenever we took family trips to the coast!” “This is a tough one, but I like the idea of a cozy cabin weekend in the mountains with some fishing or hot-tubbing.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Nightclub or Netflix?",
      "content": "Nightclub or Netflix? This lifestyle question helps get the conversation going, but it’s important to be specific in your answer. Elaborate on how your choice aligns with your personality, how you like to spend your free time, and why you chose one option over the other. If neither Netflix nor nightclubs are really your thing, skip it! “Nightclubs. I love to dance, and I love to feel the energy of all the people around me!” “Netflix. I like the clubs every once in a while but I much prefer a night in watching Breaking Bad .” “My response to this changes every day tbh. Whatever my friends and I have planned, I’m down to go with the flow and make the most of it! Balance is key!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest and authentically represent who you are.",
      "content": "Be honest and authentically represent who you are. Pick the best Bumble prompts to showcase your personality and values. Write responses that are completely true to you and your life—if you write responses based on what you think matches will want to hear, you won’t attract the right people. [16] X Research source When writing your prompts, consider whether your closest friends would read them and agree with how you presented yourselves. You can even ask them to read your prompts if you feel comfortable!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be specific and clear about what you want.",
      "content": "Be specific and clear about what you want. Make sure to name anything extremely important to you or that presents a dealbreaker . Your profile should “accurately represent who you are and what you’re looking for in a potential partner,” says expert dating coach and matchmaker Laura Bilotta. On the lighter end of this spectrum, you may really need to be with someone who wants to live in a warm climate or have lots of pets. On the more serious side, you may want to make clear your political beliefs, religious views, sober lifestyle, desire for children, etc. An overly generic or unspecific profile will attract fewer matches since people won’t get a good sense of who you are. Also, these profiles are likely to lead to frustration for you since you’ll match with people who aren’t compatible with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be positive about your outlook on life and dating.",
      "content": "Be positive about your outlook on life and dating. Keep things light-hearted and fun, even when it comes to more important prompts like “The world would be a better place if…” or “A non-negotiable for me is…” It's okay to have deal breakers, but try to present them in a way that doesn’t make you come across as jaded or cynical. [17] X Research source For example, a response like “I’m tired of people never responding. If you’re a flake, avoid wasting both our time and just unmatch me” is super negative and unappealing. Instead, write something like, “I’m looking for someone with good communication who’s really serious about taking steps forward. Should we start with a coffee this weekend?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a little bit of your specific brand of humor.",
      "content": "Add a little bit of your specific brand of humor. Infuse your prompts with some wit and quirkiness to seem more relatable and ease your matches into conversation. Make sure that your jokes match your sense of humor and aren’t just a copy-paste job from the internet. [18] X Research source Here are some more tips for writing funny Bumble prompts: Use wordplay : “If I could only eat one meal for the rest of my life… Tacos. Because they’re delicious and relatable (they fall apart from time to time, just like me) . Be relatable : \"I get way too excited about… finding a matching pair of socks in the laundry. They returned from the mysterious great beyond! ” Showcase wit as well as humor : “If I could have any superpower, it would be… invisibility. I used to actually think I could turn invisible as a kid, but it turns out I was just great at hide-and-seek. ” Keep the prompt in mind : “My favorite quality in a person is… if they laugh at my jokes. Bonus points if they have a great fake laugh for the questionable ones. ” Use a pop culture reference : “My hidden talent… being able to yodel (well). With great power comes great responsibility. ” Show off your quirky side : “I’m a real nerd about… trivia night! I love an obscure fact or two (got any to share?). ”"

    {
      "title": "Build a unique and eye-catching profile.",
      "content": "Build a unique and eye-catching profile. Choose photos that are “high-quality and clearly show your face,” recommends Bilotta. Along with great photos , Bilotta recommends adding a bio that “highlights your interests and personality.” Lauren Sanders, another professional matchmaker and dating coach, agrees that posting good photos is “the best way to increase your chances of getting a match on Bumble.” Sanders also advises writing a Bumble bio that’s detailed and contains a “description of what you’re looking for. Profiles that are very detailed stand out as better than the rest.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Message someone with an opening line based on their profile.",
      "content": "Message someone with an opening line based on their profile. “The best thing to message a match on a dating app would be regarding something you read on their profile,” asserts Sanders. “This will let them know you are truly interested in getting to know them and will let them know you pay attention to details.” Bilotta also advises using an “engaging conversation starter that shows you’ve taken the time to read the other person’s profile.” “Avoid using generic Bumble opening lines ,” Bilotta warns, “and instead strive for a personalized approach that demonstrates your interest and sincerity.” If you get a response, it’s important to continue writing engaging messages in order to build a strong connection. Bilotta’s tips for messaging on Bumble include “using a positive and respectful tone…[and] to be authentic and genuine; let your personality shine through in your messages.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Suggest meeting in person if the text conversation goes well.",
      "content": "Suggest meeting in person if the text conversation goes well. You can also suggest continuing the conversation elsewhere, like over text or in a video call. Taking this step, as Bilotta describes, shows that “you’re confident and interested in taking the next step while also being respectful of the other person’s boundaries and comfort level.”"
