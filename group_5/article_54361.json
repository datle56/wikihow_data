      "content": "A few web-based payphone directories are still somewhat maintained. These sites are run by individuals, not companies, so locations may not be updated often. Still, checking a payphone directory is a great way to explore some of the last remaining payphones in the United States and across the world. [1] X Research source Payphone Directory : One of the oldest payphone listings on the web, organized by country, state, and city. Some of the listings may be out of date, but you'll likely find one or two payphones that are still working in some areas Payphone Project : This is a website dedicated to payphone history and preservation. It also includes a mostly-maintained list of payphones in the United States, which you can visit at https://www.payphone-project.com/numbers/usa . Waymarking : This site is great for finding information on things near your location, including payphones. Just type \"payphone\" into the \"find waymarks\" box, and enter an address or postal code to find nearby payphones reported by other users. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Airports, bus stations, and train depots. Public transit centers in many towns still have a pay phone or two at places that cater to travelers. Just keep in mind that since payphones are less common, they aren't typically maintained. The stations of interstate bus companies, especially those of Greyhound, often still have pay phones. Greyhound stations are worth mentioning in particular because, in many larger cities, they are open 24 hours and have several pay phones that are in good repair. Major airports, and most smaller ones as well, usually have some pay phones around. Airport managers seem to realize that people traveling often leave certain vital things at home. International travelers are also in need of pay phones if they have not purchased special ones for the country they are traveling to. As a result, airports still have large numbers of pay phones."

      "content": "Government, community, and medical centers. Government buildings, such as the county's courthouse or jail, often have payphones. Every county in the United States has a courthouse or some form of office, and many still offer payphones which are accessible to the community. Because people in courthouses often have important messages that they need to share with family members, there seems to be an understanding that pay phones can provide a needed service. Outside of government locations, you might also want to try these: Post offices Public libraries Hospitals High schools Workforce training centers"

      "content": "Search Google Maps for \"Payphone near me.\" Searching Google Maps for the nearest payphone will usually produce a location, though there's no guarantee the phone will be in working order. [3] X Research source You can also run this search in the Google search engine, which will display the nearest payphone location in a map right on the page. To see payphones in a particular city on a map, just head over to https://maps.google.com and type \"payphones in New Orleans\" or \"payphones in 70118\" (or your preferred city/ZIP or postal code) into the search bar. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that the payphones you find may not be in service. Have a backup plan in case the payphone you want to use is not working or was removed. Some existing payphones will not appear in Google Maps, so don't lose hope."
