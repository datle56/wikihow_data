      "content": "Press a cold compress on your skin for temporary pain relief. Your scalp may feel hot even though you're not outside anymore. To bring some relief, make a homemade cold compress—fill a sealable bag 3/4 full with ice water and squeeze out the excess air before you close it. Wrap it in a damp towel and press it against your scalp until it doesn't feel cool anymore. [1] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. You can use a compress as many times as you like throughout the day. Don't have ice? For an alternative, wet a towel with cold water and fold it so it fits into a sealable bag. Freeze the bag for 15 minutes. Then, take it out and press the chilled bag with the towel against your scalp.

      "title": "Skip the hot water the next time you jump in the shower.",
      "content": "Skip the hot water the next time you jump in the shower. Instead, use cool water which can soothe your skin and keep your shower short so you don't dry out your skin. If your scalp really hurts, it's fine to skip the shampoo and just let cold water run across your skin or you could wash your hair as long as you use a moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo. Avoid using a dandruff shampoo since these have harsh chemicals. [3] X Research source Sulfates are basically detergents that make shampoo suds up. They also strip your hair of its natural oils so they can be too harsh for sensitive, sunburned skin."

      "content": "Massage a gentle conditioner onto your scalp to lock in hydration. Use a conditioner that doesn't contain dimethicone which is a silicone. Dimethicone can block the pores on your scalp and trap heat. Instead, use a dimethicone-free conditioner that will keep your scalp hydrated as it heals and rinse it out with cool water. [4] X Research source If you want to moisturize your scalp in between washing, wet your scalp with cool water so it's a little damp. Then, rub some non-petroleum or non-oil-based lotion onto your scalp. Oil can block your pores which traps heat and sweat. There's no need to rinse out the lotion although your hair may look a little greasy near your scalp."

      "content": "Keep your scalp dry and skip moisturizers on the blisters. You don't want to pop or drain them or they could become infected. Instead, just treat the sunburn around the blisters and don't put any products on the blisters themselves. They should heal on their own within a few days.

      "content": "Heat tools like blowdryers or straighteners will probably feel uncomfortable. They also heat up your scalp which can really dry out your skin. Avoid using heat-styling tools for about a week or until your sunburn is totally healed. In the meantime, let your hair air dry. [11] X Research source Skip the styling products, too, since most of them have chemicals that will irritate your sensitive scalp. Give your skin time to heal before you start using them again."
