      "title": "🐕 (Dog)",
      "content": "🐕 (Dog) The basic dog emoji shows a light brown dog with a curled tail and perked ears that resembles a Shiba Inu (although the design may look different from platform to platform). Use this emoji to represent your own beloved pet, any dog in general, or famous dogs from TV and film. “Idk what I would do without my adorable pupper 💗🐕” “I love the movie Balto ! That was my favorite as a kid 🐕”"

      "title": "🐶 (Dog Face)",
      "content": "🐶 (Dog Face) This emoji shows a friendly, cartoonish dog or puppy face looking straight ahead with white fur and brown ears and spots. Like the 🐕 emoji, send 🐶 to talk about your favorite dogs, whether they’re your own pet or a friendly doggo from down the block or TV. The dog face emoji has a more playful tone than the regular dog, although they generally have the same meanings. [1] X Research source “I wish I had the time to adopt a puppy. I miss my childhood dog so much 🐶😭” “I heard some rustling in the yard and found the neighbor’s new dog playing in our pile of leaves lol 🐶😂🍂”"

      "title": "🐩 (Poodle)",
      "content": "🐩 (Poodle) This emoji features a grayish-white poodle with the iconic, fluffy poodle haircut. Use this emoji to talk about poodles specifically, or dogs in general. Since poodles are known for being a little high-maintenance (that coat takes a lot of upkeep to stay snazzy!), try using it to lightheartedly tease someone when they’re taking a long time to get ready or have a lot of specific needs. “I saw the most gorgeously groomed poodle on my walk to work today 🐩” “I think a poodle’s haircut takes less time than yours! 🐩😆”"

      "title": "🦮 (Guide Dog)",
      "content": "🦮 (Guide Dog) Also called the seeing eye dog, this emoji shows a yellowish-brown Golden Retriever in a harness with a handle to assist someone with visual impairments. It’s often used interchangeably with 🐕‍🦺(service dog), although a guide dog is trained specifically to help those who have trouble seeing while a service dog is helpful for a variety of needs. [2] X Research source Use this emoji to talk about a special guide dog in your life, or how dogs are generally so helpful and valuable to humans. “I was worried when my grandpa’s eyes started to go, but his guide dog has been such a blessing in helping him get around 🦮🙏” “It’s so cool that dogs just help us out all the time! 🦮💯”"

      "title": "🐕‍🦺 (Service Dog)",
      "content": "🐕‍🦺 (Service Dog) The service dog emoji depicts a black, furry dog wearing a red vest with a leash on and is often used interchangeably with 🦮 (guide dog). According to Apple’s proposal for the emoji, it represents dogs that sense and help with seizures and other “hidden disabilities” people may have and is part of the company’s push to include more accessibility emojis. [3] X Research source Use this emoji to describe any helpful dog or service animal in your life. “It’s so much easier to go out on my own now that I’ve been paired with such a wonderful helper 🐕‍🦺😍” “My toddler started bawling on the subway today because I wouldn’t let her pet a stranger’s service dog 🐕‍🦺🙄”"

[4] X Research source Talk about dogs directly, or combine them with other animal, plant, or nature emojis to describe your experiences with the great outdoors. “We just added a new pet puppy to the mix. My house is officially a zoo! 🐶🐦🐱” “Nothing beats a good backpacking trip through the mountains ⛰️🎒🐕🌄”"

Dogs have a number of positive traits that make them so lovable and helpful to humans—especially guide dogs and service dogs!
