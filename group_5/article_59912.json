      "title": "Set the choke butterfly valve upright.",
      "content": "Set the choke butterfly valve upright. Pop the trunk and locate the choke in the middle of the carburetor. Move the butterfly valve to the upright position . This way, air will flow into the engine as it runs and you can get a more accurate reading of your engine’s idle speed as you make adjustments. [1] X Research source Ensure the air cleaner is on when adjusting the carburetor."

      "content": "Warm the engine up by letting it run for 3-5 minutes. Turn the engine on and let it run for a few minutes. Then, shut the engine off. This will give your carburetor time to smooth out any kinks before you make adjustments. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Adjust the fast idle adjuster screw to barely not touch the cam.",
      "content": "Adjust the fast idle adjuster screw to barely not touch the cam. Locate the throttle spring on the left side of the carburetor. Look on the top of the throttle arm (facing to the rear of the car) to find the fast idle adjuster screw. Make sure that the choke is fully open and the fast idle adjuster screw is resting on the very bottom of the stepped cam, which is the stair-shaped component behind the screw. [3] X Research source Unscrew the fast idle adjuster screw until it is clear of the stepped cam. Screw it back in until it just touches the very bottom of the stepped cam— not on any of the steps themselves. Now, screw it in another 1/4 turn. This sets the throttle butterfly open the required 0.004 inch (0.10 mm). This screw works with the choke to give a smooth idle on a cold engine. As the choke warms in concert with the warming engine, the butterfly valve in the throat of the carburetor opens and the fast idle adjuster moves down the stepped cam, reducing the engine idle speed."

      "title": "Set the volume control and the bypass screws on the left.",
      "content": "Set the volume control and the bypass screws on the left. Look just behind the throttle spring on the left to find the screws. Turn the bypass screw (the larger one) out a couple of turns. You’re going to adjust this screw several times, but you need to reach a baseline before you make additional changes. [4] X Research source The volume control screw is the smaller of the two adjusting screws. Turn it in very gently until it bottoms. Then, unscrew it exactly 2.5 turns. Then, start the engine and adjust the bypass screw again until the idle runs at its highest speed."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the volume screw to reach the highest idle minus 25 rpm.",
      "content": "Reduce the volume screw to reach the highest idle minus 25 rpm. Go back to the volume screw and adjust it (usually out/counter-clockwise) slowly until you reach the fastest idle. Monitor the tachometer on the dash to make sure you’ve reached the maximum rpm. Then, turn the screw back in very slowly until the revs drop by about 25-30 rpm. [5] X Research source A tachometer is an instrument that measures the working speed of your engine in revolutions per minute (rpm). It's typically on the dashboard next to the speedometer."

    {
      "title": "Turn the bypass screw again to reach an idle speed of 850-900 rpm.",
      "content": "Turn the bypass screw again to reach an idle speed of 850-900 rpm. Leave the engine running and go back to your bypass screw. Continue making adjustments and checking your tachometer until you’ve got an idle speed between 850 and 900 rpm, which is the manufacturer recommendation for the 34 Pict-3 carburetors. [6] X Research source This is actually the recommended setting for most of the Solex 30-34 PICT-3 models. If you can’t achieve these rpm settings, it’s possible that the threads on one of the adjuster screws is stripped. You may also have a damaged hole for the tapered screw, or a damaged needle valve or O-ring. If the screws work just fine but the rpm isn’t staying stable, you probably have a vacuum leak and air is leaking the intake manifold."
