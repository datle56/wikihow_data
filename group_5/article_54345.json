      "content": "Use the remote to set the Sleep Number to 100, which is the firmest setting. By default, the Sleep Number remote is set to 20, which is the “very soft” setting. The Sleep Number on the remote will slowly progress from 20 to 100, and the mattress will continue to grow firmer as the bed automatically adjusts to its firmest setting. Alternately, press “Menu,” select “Settings,” select “Find Your Sleep Number,” and follow the on-screen instructions on your remote to find your ideal Sleep Number. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take note of your comfort level, as well as how your neck, shoulders, hips, and back feel as the mattress becomes firmer. The optimal goal is to find a Sleep Number that offers full body alignment and support. Side sleepers: Select a Sleep Number that makes your shoulders and hips feel cradled, and your stomach and ribs feel supported. Back sleepers: Select a Sleep Number that supports your lower back, and that allows for your shoulders and hips to sink slightly into the bed instead of resting on top of the bed. Stomach sleepers: Opt for a firmer Sleep Number setting that supports your back and prevents your stomach from sinking too low into the mattress. [2] X Research source"
