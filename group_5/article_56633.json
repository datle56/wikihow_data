The \"-\" indicates that you want to log in as username and assume their environment variables, home directory, and shell preferences. [1] X Research source Once you enter their password, your prompt will change to that user's prompt. If you want to change users without changing your shell, omit the hyphen. E.g., su username . sudo – username is the same as sudo -l username and sudo --login username . In some Linux distributions, ( not Ubuntu ), you can use su - (with no username specified) to become the root user . It's better to use sudo to execute root-level commands as needed instead of becoming the root user—you're far less likely to break things."

Just like when you use sudo to run commands with root permissions, you can also use it to execute any command as another user.
