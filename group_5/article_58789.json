Eucalyptus can soothe an irritated throat. Use fresh leaves to drink as a tea or use as a gargle. Do not drink eucalyptus oil as it is poisonous. Peppermint is similar to eucalyptus and can help treat common colds and sore throats. Do not use peppermint or menthol with infants and do not take peppermint oil by mouth. Licorice is used as a treatment for sore throat. However, consult with your doctor before eating licorice especially if you are taking medications such as aspirin or warfarin. This may affect people who are pregnant, have high blood pressure, or who have heart, liver or kidney disease. Slippery elm is thought to relieve throat irritation since it contains mucilage that coats the throat, but scientific evidence for this herbal remedy is limited. To test it on your laryngitis symptoms, mix 1 teaspoon of the powdered extract in a cup of warm water and sip slowly. Try to hold the mixture in your mouth for as long as possible before swallowing. Slippery elm might also impact the way your body absorbs medication, so talk with a healthcare expert and avoid taking other medication with slippery elm. You should also avoid this herb if you are pregnant or breastfeeding."
