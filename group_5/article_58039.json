      "content": "Obtain software and service for your computers. One such provider is LogMeIn . They have several levels of service ranging from free for \"simple remote control\" (LogMeInFree) to the more robust \"full service\" offerings (such as LogMeInPro) but has a monthly fee of about US$20 per computer. The LogMeIn service in general works very well, but like any network based solution, is best when connected by high speed LAN or broadband internet between the computers. Select the service level that best meets your needs, create an account and download/install the software."

      "content": "A hardware based solution can be achieved with a \"KVM Switch\" KVM is an acronym for \"Keyboard, Video, Mouse\". These devices typically have connections for multiple Video inputs from the computers and a single output to connect to a monitor. There are also multiple PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard outputs to connect to the computers and two inputs for connecting both a keyboard and a mouse. Newer KVM switches have transitioned from PS/2 and round Keyboard connectors to the popular USB ports instead. Be sure to obtain a KVM that supports the style Keyboard and Mouse connectors the computer uses or obtain adapters. Due to limitations on the length of cable that KVM (and USB for that matter) signals can travel, all the computers will probably have to be located fairly close (within 10 feet or so of the KVM hardware) unless some other repeater or extender hardware is employed."

      "content": "Install the KVM and software as specified in the manufacturer's instructions. To keep your Windows desktop computer or laptop safe from viruses, use the Windows Defender. It is an anti-virus software built into a Windows operating system. You can use this software instead of other paid and tested software because they may try to clean up programs and software on your computer that are not bad. Email providers like MSN, Gmail, or Yahoo have different filter systems. To know if the email is legit or not is to look at the domain of the email."
