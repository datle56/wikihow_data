      "content": "Sign up for a Steam account if you don’t already have one. Counter-Strike is produced by Valve, so it’s only playable through their online distribution platform called Steam. Go to the Steam website and click on the login button in the upper right corner of the screen. The official website is https://store.steampowered.com/ . [1] X Research source Consider downloading the Steam app by clicking the “install” button next to the login button. After installing Steam on your computer, you will be able to log into the service without opening your browser."

      "title": "Purchase and install the game.",
      "content": "Purchase and install the game. Go to the Steam storefront and type Counter-Strike into the search box to quickly find the game. You will see a few options for the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is, as of 2018, the most recent version. The full version of the game costs $15 USD and is located at https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/ . [2] X Research source CS:GO now has a free version. This version doesn’t include multiplayer, but it’s a good way to get accustomed to playing the game before deciding on a purchase."

      "title": "Open the game and navigate to the servers menu.",
      "content": "Open the game and navigate to the servers menu. Click the “Servers” button in the game's menu. A massive list of all the available maps will appear. The amount of information may feel a little confusing at first, but each server contains a different game set up by other players. Read the information on the map name, number of players, and password needed, then select a map you wish to join. [3] X Research source Maps are recognizable by the prefix in their name. For instance, maps that start with CS are hostage rescue maps. The terrorist team prevents the counter-terrorists from rescuing them. The DE prefix indicates bomb defusal maps. The terrorist team protects the explosives from the counter-terrorists. AS means an assassination map. A counter-terrorist player becomes a VIP. The rest of the team has to protect them from the terrorists. One of the most popular game types is deathmatch, which takes place on DM maps. The emphasis is on combat and killing other players gets you better weapons."

      "title": "Choose a low latency server for the best playing experience.",
      "content": "Choose a low latency server for the best playing experience. Check the latency number on the right side of the list. The lower the number, the more lag-free your experience will be. When you end up in a match with a lot of latency, the game stutters, players appear to teleport, and you have a hard time figuring out what your bullets are hitting. [4] X Research source Reduce your own latency as much as possible. Having a strong, direct Internet connection helps you become a better player."

      "title": "Choose a side to join after the game loads.",
      "content": "Choose a side to join after the game loads. Each map has a terrorist and counter-terrorist side. The teams are largely the same and the game lets you change teams throughout the match. The team you pick determines your objectives on the map. For example, on a bomb defusal map, the terrorists have to plant and explode a bomb. The counter-terrorists win by defusing the bomb. [5] X Research source The teams spawn at different points of the map and have a slightly different weapon selection. Press “M” during the match to switch sides. You will be eliminated from the current round and respawn on your new team when the next round begins."

      "content": "Use spectate commands to watch if the game has already begun. Chances are you will join a game in progress. You can’t jump into the fray until the round finishes. Instead, the game lets you watch the action from the point of view of another player. Press the duck button, which is “CTRL” by default, to access your options. [6] X Research source Clicking the left mouse button allows you to switch between players. Pressing the spacebar shows you different camera angles."

      "title": "Use your keypad to move and your mouse to aim.",
      "content": "Use your keypad to move and your mouse to aim. Using the mouse is easy since it comes down to pointing and shooting like in many other games. Most people get tripped up a little with movement. The “W,” “A,” “S,” and “D” keys control your movement by default. \"W\" and \"S\" let you move forward and backward. “A” and “D” allow you to strafe, or move from side to side. [7] X Research source In Counter-Strike, you do not need to move forward or backward to strafe. That means that, if you’re standing still, pressing the “A” and “D” buttons is all you need to move to the left and right, respectively. Moving, turning, and shooting requires coordination. It may feel a little tricky at first, but you get used to it as you play. Test your mouse sensitivity. Most pros access the settings menu to move the sensitivity slider down to 2.0, giving themselves more precision when aiming. Start low and increase the sensitivity as you play. To make adjustments to your mouse sensitivity, open your system's Control Panel and look for the mouse settings."

      "content": "Master the jump, duck, and walk controls to avoid enemies. Running everywhere is a sure way to alert enemies to your presence. Hit the “Shift” key to slow your character down, then hit it again to return to running. Press “CTRL” to duck and the spacebar to jump. [8] X Research source These keys are important to remember for map navigation. Mix some stealthy maneuvers into your playstyle to get the drop on enemies and reduce the amount of damage you take."

      "content": "Press the mouse buttons to fire your primary and secondary weapons. You are only allowed to carry 2 weapons at a time in Counter-Strike. The left mouse button fires whatever weapon you are holding. The right mouse button activates the weapon’s secondary function, such as zooming in with a sniper scope. It’s a very simple shooting scheme that anyone can figure out with a few rounds of practice. [9] X Research source Press “Q” to switch between your primary and secondary weapon. The “R” button allows you to reload your weapon. Do this before you enter a firefight. You mainly switch weapons by purchasing them at the start of the round, but the game lets you take weapons you find by pressing “G.”"

      "title": "Press “B” to bring up the gun menu when you begin playing.",
      "content": "Press “B” to bring up the gun menu when you begin playing. Counter-Strike’s unique feature is its weapon economy. When you enter a game, you get $800. That money allows you to buy guns, grenades, and armor from the menu. The menu gives you a lot of toys to play with, so it may feel a little intimidating at first, but don’t feel pressured to buy anything. [10] X Research source Navigate the menu by clicking the prompts are using keypad numbers. You start with a pistol and a knife, so you don’t need to spend your in-game currency right away. Buying weapons and armor is all up to your preferred strategy. Some players get armor and grenades right away, while others save for a submachine gun."

      "content": "Press “K” or “U” to communicate with your team throughout the match. Communication is a key part of Counter-Strike, so press “K” when you need to activate voice chat. This only works if you have a microphone on your computer. For text chat, press “U” to call up the dialogue box, then type your message and hit enter to send it to your team. [11] X Research source Pressing “Y” allows you to send a message to the entire server. Don’t use this command while strategizing with your team. The game also has pre-recorded commands activated by typing words into the chat box. For instance, type “coverme” to make your character say “Cover Me!” Few players pay much attention to these commands, so they aren’t important to memorize."

      "content": "Select weapons that balance firing speed, accuracy, and power. There are no hard and fast rules about what guns players need. Everyone has a different style of play. Practice with as many guns as possible to learn what you like and don’t like. Then, choose your guns according to your role in the game and how much money you have available. [12] X Research source The AK-47 is by far the most popular weapon. It’s a relatively inexpensive but powerful assault rifle. Other popular rifles include the M4A4 and M4A1-S. For sniper rifles, many players choose the Magnum or AWP. It’s expensive, slow, but very powerful. [13] X Research source The USP-S and Glock 18 are a couple of powerful pistols to try. The P250 is a cheaper alternative. [14] X Research source Players often go with the penetration power of the inexpensive UMP-45 when choosing a submachine gun. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Accumulate money at the end of each round to buy new weapons. The game gives you a cash bonus depending on what happened during the previous round. You get more money per kill for using weaker weapons, particularly the knife, a shotgun, or a submachine gun. Your team also gets a bonus for completing objectives that lead to a round win. Any money you don’t spend carries over to the next round, so save up to buy better guns. [16] X Research source The losing team also gets a bonus. They get about half of what the winning team earns, followed by a bonus for consecutive round losses. Some modes do not have money at all. Play arsenal or deathmatch maps if you would rather not deal with the money system."

      "title": "Move frequently while staying near your team to avoid enemies.",
      "content": "Move frequently while staying near your team to avoid enemies. Some players like camping, or waiting in the shadows for an enemy to walk by. While this is a nuisance in most games, it will get you killed very quickly in Counter-Strike. Faster, more experienced players know the maps well. In addition, you aren’t able to back up your team when you’re not pushing towards the objective with them. [17] X Research source Counter-Strike is a fast-paced game. Keep moving even while you’re shooting. Stay with your team so you are able to defend them against surprise attacks and pick off weakened enemies."

      "title": "Shoot in small bursts at the target’s head and chest to succeed.",
      "content": "Shoot in small bursts at the target’s head and chest to succeed. All weapons in Counter-Strike have recoil, which means that holding down the shoot button is a bad idea. A burst shot happens when you fire 2 or 3 bullets at a time. Anything more than that becomes spray, and spray tends to be very inaccurate. Tap the mouse button to fire off a few shots and get quick kills. [18] X Research source Spraying bullets everywhere is only useful in close-quarter combat or when you’re using an inaccurate weapon like a submachine gun Every gun has its own spray pattern. Practice with different guns so you know exactly how they react when you fire them."

      "title": "Throw grenades to clear out and protect tight spots.",
      "content": "Throw grenades to clear out and protect tight spots. The main grenade players use is the HE grenade, which produces a fiery explosion. Throw it into corners to flush out and eliminate enemies. Other types of grenades have similar versatility without causing damage. When in doubt, remember that whatever grenade you have acts like its real-life counterpart. [19] X Research source Flash grenades blind enemies temporarily. Throw them when you need to enter an area or escape a pursuing enemy. [20] X Research source Smoke grenades emit a smoke cloud used for coverage. Enemies may not be able to see you in the cloud, but they can still shoot you. Use them as a distraction. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Communicate with your team to coordinate your weapon purchases. If you’re unsure what to do, ask your team for advice. With experience, you will be able to sense the flow of a game and develop your own strategy. Base your playstyle on your role in the match, then select weapons and tactics that benefit your team. [22] X Research source For example, if someone on your team has the expensive Magnum Sniper Rifle (also called the AWP), you don’t need to get one. Instead, get something faster that works at a closer range. For instance, a player in a “fragger” role is usually aggressive, meeting the enemy head-on. A person in a “lurker” role sneaks around the enemy, picking them off while gathering intel."

      "content": "Stay calm and have fun while playing the game. Counter-Strike gets rough sometimes, especially with voice chat. Everyone has a bad game occasionally. One of the biggest keys to success is keeping your emotions in check. Getting irritated or annoyed ends up making you play worse. Take things as they come and shoot everything that moves! [23] X Research source If the voice chat begins to annoy you, disable it by typing “ignoremsg” in the chat box. Counter-Strike has been around for a long time now, and unfortunately, some players go overboard on the trash talking."
