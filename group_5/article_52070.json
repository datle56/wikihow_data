      "content": "Add mineral spirits to a small non-plastic bowl. To help thin the oil paint on your brushes, you’ll need a paint solvent. Odorless mineral spirits work well, so fill a small glass or ceramic bowl with a small amount of the liquid and place it in the sink where you plan to clean the brushes. [1] X Research source You can also use turpentine to remove oil-based paint from brushes. However, it has an extremely strong odor so it’s important to ensure that you’re working in a well-ventilated area.

Coconut oil usually work best because it is solid at room temperature so it won’t make as big a mess as you rub it into your skin. The amount of coconut oil that you’ll need depends on how much paint is on your skin. Start with a small amount and add more if the paint isn’t coming off. Adding the lemon essential oil is optional.
