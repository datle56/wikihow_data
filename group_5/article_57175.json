      "content": "Establish a pre-sleep routine . Sticking to a sleep schedule will program your body to know when it’s bedtime. Try to go to bed at the same time every night and to rise at the same time each morning. Give your body other clues that it is time to slow down, relax, and drift off to sleep. One tip is to slowly make your surroundings more dark. Dim light signals to your body that it is time to sleep. Avoid exposure to natural light in the evenings, for example, and, inside your bedroom, slowly dim the lights or progressively shut off lights. [1] X Research source Make your room a comfortable space. Cover your bed with comfortable blankets and pillows. Also, ensure that the room temperature is to your liking. Flip your pillows, adjust your covers, or turn on a fan. Do anything else that puts you into a relaxed mood. Try a warm shower if that does the trick, or have a cup of a warm, sleep-inducing tea like chamomile or “sleepy-time” blend."

      "title": "Read a book.",
      "content": "Read a book. If reading makes you fall asleep easily in class, then it should do the same at home during the evening. This is also a very effective strategy if you tend to dwell on the problems of the day — reading a book will let you decouple from those stress-inducing thoughts. Pick something that is easy or bland. Don’t distress yourself by reading the newspaper, for instance, or a horror novel. Pick a textbook or a dense novel, instead."

      "title": "Turn off all the lights.",
      "content": "Turn off all the lights. When you’ve finally put your head down, make sure that you are in complete darkness. This is one of the most important factors in quality sleep. Light not only inhibits the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, but also stimulates the hypothalamus to raise the body’s temperature and produce cortisol, both of which inform the body to be awake and alert. [2] X Research source Even if you fall asleep with lights on, you won’t sleep as soundly. If you live in the city, share a room with a night-owl, or always have to leave a nightlight on, wear a sleep mask to give yourself a fighting chance. Try also to use a low-illumination night-light.

      "title": "Keep electronics out of the bedroom.",
      "content": "Keep electronics out of the bedroom. Televisions, phones, and computers tempt and distract us. They tell our brains to be up and alert. In fact, you should avoid using them before bed, because the particular kind of light they emit (blue light) can reduce the quality of your sleep. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source One study shows that two hours of exposure to light from iPads and other tablets at night reduced melatonin levels by about 22 percent. Consider ways of changing your routine if you are a heavy user of smart phones or tablets. Resist the urge to browse the internet if you’re having a sleepless night. Screens on computers, phones, and tablets are backlit, which will arouse you from sleep and lower your melatonin levels, making it harder for you to fall asleep. [5] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Set a time to stop all device use each night, such as 30 minutes before bedtime. You can also download software, apps or changes the setting on some of your devices so that they reduce the amount of blue light emitted as it approaches bedtime. Your screen will instead look yellow or reddish, which is easier on your eyes and will not inhibit melatonin production."

      "content": "Listen to ambient noise. Ambient or white noise is a steady, low noise that hovers in the background and sort of pushes out other noises. Your preferred white noise might be light music, \"rainforest sounds,\" or even the sound of a rotating fan. The point is just to have low-level sound. There are free white noise generators that you can find online. If you prefer your phone, you can also buy ambient noise apps. These generators will help you to fall asleep more readily by dampening external sounds."

      "title": "Clear your mind.",
      "content": "Clear your mind. If you are the fretful type, try to force out the stressful thoughts about the day, work, or school. Do not reenact problems or arguments from the day in your head. If you find you are prone to doing that, try playing music as described above — and focus all your thoughts on that music and let it carry you into slumber. Quieting a worried mind can be hard. Let your thoughts wander. For example, try the standard technique of “counting sheep.” You might also try to think in mental pictures instead of words."

      "title": "Don’t wait out insomnia.",
      "content": "Don’t wait out insomnia. Studies have shown that staying in bed, without sleeping, can actually worsen insomnia because your brain begins to associate bed with being awake. If you can’t fall asleep within 20 minutes or so, get up and do something else for a while like read. Then, when you feel tired again, go back to bed. [6] X Research source Try changing places as a last ditch effort. If you can’t get comfortable in your bed, move to your sofa and try to fall asleep there. Sometimes the change will work."

      "content": "Exercise regularly. Working out during the day is an incredibly effective way to rest better at night. In fact, exercise seems to correspond so directly with sleep quality that many of our hypotheses about the purpose of sleep stem from our observations of how exercising depletes our energy reserves.

      "content": "Go to the bathroom. Make a stop at the bathroom just before bed. This will help you to clear your digestive system so that you fall asleep more easily — and stay asleep throughout the night. In the same vein, don’t drink large amounts of fluids in the hours leading up to your bedtime and which might wake you up in the middle of the night. Limit what you drink after about 8 pm.

      "content": "Get comfortable. Make your body as comfortable as you can for sleep. If some of your clothing feels tight, don't hesitate to loosen or remove it. This includes your hair bands, socks, bra, and anything else that might feel like it's not letting blood circulate freely. Make sure that you have enough pillows and blankets to be comfy, as well."

      "content": "Fix your sleeping position. If you pay attention to how you sleep, you might notice that you are sleeping in a bad position or putting strain on your posture. Keep your back straight and make sure your neck is not resting too high or too low. If your bed is too firm or too soft, consider replacing it, covering it with a foam pad, or even sleeping with a body pillow to make yourself more comfortable."

      "title": "Eat foods that are soporific.",
      "content": "Eat foods that are soporific. Soporific means “sleep-inducing.” For example, some foods are high in the sleep-inducing amino acid tryptophan, like cheese, chicken, soy products, eggs, tofu, fish, milk, turkey, nuts, peanuts and peanut butter, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. Choose foods that have these qualities, especially for dinner. To activate tryptophan more efficiently, favor foods that are high in complex carbohydrates but medium to low in protein. Carbs make tryptophan more available in the brain, whereas protein has the opposite effect. [10] X Research source . Plan “meals for sleep” that load up on complex carbs and tryptophan. Try pasta with Parmesan cheese, hummus with whole wheat pita bread, peanut butter on toast, sesame seeds sprinkled on salad with tuna chunks with whole wheat crackers on the side, or a baked potato with cottage cheese."

      "title": "Keep meals light.",
      "content": "Keep meals light. Limit the amount of food that you eat in the late afternoon and early evening, as it can affect the quality of your sleep. Lighter meals are more likely to give you a restful night, for example, whereas high-fat meals and large servings prolong the work your digestive system needs to do, and all the gas production and rumblings may keep you awake. Some people find that highly-seasoned foods (e.g., hot peppers and garlic) interfere with sleep, especially heartburn-sufferers. Avoid them if you have heartburn troubles."

      "title": "Avoid caffeine and alcohol.",
      "content": "Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Coffee and other caffeinated beverages can disrupt your sleep patterns. Coffee stays inside your system for up to 8 hours after you drink it, so that cup you had in the afternoon could be keeping you up later at night. Try to go without caffeine in the later afternoon and early evening. Alcohol will also wreak havoc on your sleep patterns. When you drink, you tend to sleep lighter and fall into fewer periods of deep sleep or restorative Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. So even if you think a drink or 2 helps you fall asleep at night, you'll likely wake up tired and not feeling rested. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Drink a warm, relaxing beverage. Many people swear by drinking a cup of herbal tea or a glass of warm milk before bed, and there is research to support them. Dairy products like milk are rich in tryptophan and stimulate the brain to produce sleep chemicals like serotonin and melatonin. [12] X Research source Chamomile tea has also long been touted as an insomnia buster. In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that chamomile can reduce symptoms of anxiety and is a mild sleep aid in animal test subjects. [13] X Research source If you don't have chamomile tea, try other caffeine-free herbal teas like lemon, ginger, and raspberry ginger."

Many are habit-forming, meaning that you can become addicted to them, and also do not give you deep and restorative sleep you need, with side effects like drowsiness, headache, memory problems, and behaviors like sleep-walking.
