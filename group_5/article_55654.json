      "content": "Himedere is a character archetype in anime and manga. It’s a term for a character (normally female) of noble status who generally craves attention, acts prim and proper, and believes themselves superior to others. In romantic stories, himedere characters often want to be pampered and spoiled by their love interest—only to realize they truly care and act more considerate later in the story. [1] X Research source Himedere is a combination of the words “hime-sama” (which means “a young lady of noble birth” in Japanese) and “deredere” (which means “to be lovestruck”). Sometimes, “hime-sama” is translated to “princess” in English, but it’s an honorific used as a sign of respect for all women of nobility; the actual Japanese word for princess is “oujo.”"

      "content": "Himedere are female characters who are considered nobility. They’re normally either the daughter of a noble (or even the daughter of a king), or they have a high standing of some kind in the context of the anime or manga, even if they’re not technically “noble.” This usually plays into the arrogant, entitled attitude that’s typical for a himedere character. [2] X Research source Because they’re noble, himedere tend to be dignified and ladylike. They often attend high-class venues or events, have other noble friends, and enjoy fine things. It’s also common for a himedere character to have blonde hair, sometimes with curls at the bottom. However, not all himedere characters look the same (and not all have blonde hair)."

      "content": "Himedere often start off acting arrogant, selfish, and demanding. Initially, himedere are super needy—particularly around a love interest. Himedere tend to demand attention, and expect their love interests to satisfy all of their needs without considering how they (their love interests) might feel. This might mean constant compliments (being told they’re beautiful or cute), getting presents, or only doing the things they want to do. [3] X Research source They may also be prideful and unwilling to take the first step in confessing their feelings for a love interest. Instead, a himedere might try to make their love interest notice them (and ask them out). If their love interest doesn’t pay enough attention to them, a himedere may get angry (even if their love interest has a good reason, like needing to go to work). This is sometimes called the “hime” period, when himedere characters are most demanding and entitled."

      "content": "Later, himedere tend to show a softer, sweeter, more affectionate side. Although they seem conceited and entitled on the surface, himedere characters usually care much more than they let on at first. Over time, himedere often realize that they haven’t treated their love interest fairly and feel guilty for it; after that, they’re more open, honest, affectionate, and willing to show their partner love in return. [4] X Research source Once they’ve realized the error of their ways and entered the “dere” period, himedere may feel a strong desire to reciprocate their love interest’s romantic gestures. Himedere will also realize that not everything has to be catered to them; they’ll want to do things their love interest enjoys doing as well. Himedere may show a cuter side to themselves, even going so far as to fawn over their partner—or they may simply feel more comfortable with vulnerability and intimacy."

      "content": "The term “himedere” originates from the My Sweet Devil manga series. The series is a collection of short stories, and the third story is called “ Himedere♡ .” Released in June 2016, it centers around a noble lady named Shoko Saionji and the man she’s dating, Satoshi. It begins with Shoko accusing Satoshi of prioritizing his job over her, but after her friends intervene, Shoko realizes how devoted he really is. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Oujodere Oujodere are similar to himedere in some respects. An oujodere is a female character with a strict, ladylike (or even princess-like) exterior in public. However, oujodere differ from himedere because they’re not attention-seeking or entitled; they’re gentle, sweet, and kind when alone with their love interest right from the start. [6] X Research source Himedere are sometimes thought of as “entitled oujodere.” Similarly, an oujidere is a term for a male character who wants their love interest to treat them like a prince—and male himedere characters are sometimes called “oujidere.” Bocchandere is a term for any character with a high status and likes to flaunt it, believing they’re superior to everyone else."

      "content": "Tsundere Tsundere is a character archetype that describes a character who acts distant, rude, or stuck up to hide their true feelings for their love interest. Tsundere can be similar to himedere in that they both act harshly toward people they have feelings for; however, tsundere push their love interests away while himedere demand attention and affection. [7] X Research source Tsundere also insult their love interests to make it seem like they don’t have feelings for them, whereas himedere only get rude and insulting if they feel like their love interest isn’t paying attention to them. Tsundere may seem like they have a superiority complex, but it’s usually just to hide their feelings. On the other hand, himedere genuinely feel—and act—superior (at least initially)."

      "content": "Kamidere Kamidere is an archetype describing any character (regardless of gender) who looks down on their love interest and wants to be treated like a god. They tend to be even more bossy than himedere—and, rather than simply craving attention, they actually treat their love interest as an inferior. They also don’t usually have “ladylike” manners."

      "content": "Many anime and manga series feature himedere characters. While the decision to label a character a “himedere” (or any other archetype) is subjective, plenty of existing characters generally fit the description of a himedere. Those characters include: [8] X Research source Mio Aoyama from The World God Only Knows . In the series, Mio’s family loses their fortune, but Mio continues to act rich and privileged—until the main character, Keima, shows her that happiness is more important than living lavishly. Rurichiyo Kasumioji from Bleach . Rurichiyo has a haughty, headstrong character prone to outbursts when she doesn’t get her way and refers to herself with the royal “we,” but genuinely has a kind heart despite her pride. Minerva Orland from Fairy Tail . Minerva is initially prideful and arrogant when introduced, even believing herself to be a queen. Although she retains elements of that pridefulness, she eventually shows more compassion when connecting with her guildmates. Saki Tenjouin from To LOVE-Ru . Saki is cocky and a bit of a show-off; she even gets offended when she believes another girl is getting more attention than her, though she does try to treat people (regardless of station) with respect. Mary Saotome from Kakegurui . Mary Saotome is shown to be quite full of herself, cruel, and demanding—especially in the way that she treats her classmate, Ryota. Later, however, her experiences teach her to be less cruel and more sympathetic. Erina Nakiri from Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma . Erina is a queen bee character determined to be admired and respected; she even pictures herself sitting on a throne and wearing a crown when she’s in a good mood! Azazel Ameri from Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-Kun . Azazel is the student council president at her school—very dignified, ladylike, strict, and a bit conceited, though she also has a sweeter side to her personality. Daki from Demon Slayer . Daki is more sadistic than the average himedere, but she’s definitely conceited, prideful, and loves being the star of the entertainment district."
