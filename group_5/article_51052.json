Your doctor will provide more information about the injection and how you can prepare before receiving the follistatin-enhancing gene therapy.

Talk to your doctor about whether you might be able to receive myostatin-blocking gene therapy."

Myostatin inhibitors are still experimental and not widely available, but your doctor might be able to enter you in an experimental myostatin blocker drug trial. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source In this case, you may or may not be given a myostatin-blocking drug, since the nature of experimental trials is often such that some participants get placebo drugs, while others get the authentic drug.

It involves doing lots of different exercises consecutively without breaks. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To perform HIRT, string several exercises together into a “super-set.” A super-set consists of multiple exercises done as fast as possible over a set amount of time. For instance, you might perform 10 bicep curls, 10 push-ups, and 10 sit-ups in a cycle for eight minutes straight, but with 1 to 1 ½ minute breaks in between sets.

      "content": "Choose an adequate weight level. When doing resistance training, it is important to lift enough weight to feel strained, but not so much that you hurt yourself or that your form is compromised. To determine the right amount of weight for you, start lifting with the least amount of weight. Perform 8-12 repetitions of the given exercise. If you do not feel winded by the end of the set, add weight in five-pound increments and try again. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source You’ll know that you’ve found the right amount of weight for you when you feel winded after 8-12 repetitions of the exercise in question."
