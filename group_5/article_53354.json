      "title": "The Divine Masculine represents assertive, active energy.",
      "content": "The Divine Masculine represents assertive, active energy. Divine masculine energy, the counterpart to divine feminine energy, represents the parts of us that take action in our outer worlds. Harnessing the Divine Masculine means taking charge of a situation, practicing accountability, protecting others, and generally “doing” instead of “being.” Divine feminine energy , on the other hand, is about attracting, accepting things as they are, and getting in touch with your spiritual side. [1] X Research source Although the Divine Masculine and Feminine have gendered terms, the energies exist equally in all people. Whether you’re a woman, man, nonbinary, or another gender-diverse identity, you can improve your life by accessing and balancing your Divine Masculine and Feminine energies. Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine energies also align with the Phallic and the Yonic symbols that represent the penis and the vagina. [2] X Research source Yonic things are like funnels; they pull energy into them. Phallic things are like arrows; they move forward and pierce into things."

      "title": "Leadership",
      "content": "Leadership The Divine Masculine is perhaps best embodied by a strong, fair leader. [3] X Research source Good leaders know how to help each member of the group reach their highest potential, not through force but through wisdom. They are aware of the slowest member and challenge them without leaving them behind. Divine Masculine energy is often associated with fatherhood. You can think of being a leader as being a kind, loving father who equally wants their children to succeed and grow."

      "title": "Resilience",
      "content": "Resilience In the face of adversity, the Divine Masculine gives you mental and emotional fortitude, allowing you to take care of yourself while knowing how far you can extend yourself without breaking. When you practice resilience, you’re ready to deal with and adapt to any situation. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Logical thinking",
      "content": "Logical thinking Divine masculine energy carries out its decision-making with careful analysis and logic. [5] X Research source Although emotional integrity and maturity is a must for embodying the Divine Masculine, ultimately actions are based on critical thinking (that still takes balancing emotions into account). Divine feminine energy, on the other hand, is more about following your intuition and emotions—even if you don’t know why you should do something, the Divine Feminine says to go with your gut."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protection",
      "content": "Protection The Divine Masculine is also represented by a drive to protect your family, friends, and any vulnerable person or thing you may run into. As the Divine Feminine nurtures, the Divine Masculine makes sure that danger is kept at bay to allow things to safely grow."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emotional strength",
      "content": "Emotional strength Instead of cutting off your emotions to charge ahead, the Divine Masculine requires developing emotional presence and empathy . [6] X Research source By acknowledging and trying to understand your emotions, you can make mature decisions about your actions without sacrificing your own feelings and needs. Without empathy, you’re unable to be a good leader and protector. Even if you have the best intentions, you can never know how someone will react to something. Empathy gives you a larger window of prediction and the framework to adapt your plans with other people in mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clear sense of direction",
      "content": "Clear sense of direction Divine masculine energy isn’t about the journey: it’s about the quest. As you move forward with intention, something must drive you on your path, whether it’s your strong moral compass or an underlying knowledge that you must go the way you go. [7] X Research source The Divine Masculine gives you the ability to set clear intentions and to take deliberate steps to achieve your goals. Common motivators for people exhibiting the Divine Masculine are collective liberation and the pursuit of social equality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Accountability",
      "content": "Accountability The Divine Masculine demands that you stand firmly behind your actions and are ready to own up to them, good or bad. [8] X Research source Take accountability by being honest with yourself and others about your intentions and their outcomes, and make amends for things you’ve done when it’s appropriate. Everything that plays into the Divine Masculine is held together through accountability. When you’re ready to take responsibility for all of your actions, it allows you to do your best work while keeping your impact on other people in mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Activate your Divine Feminine.",
      "content": "Activate your Divine Feminine. To truly be in the Divine Masculine, you have to be in the Divine Feminine, as well. The two are not separate energies as much as they’re parts of a continuum—one begins where the other ends. Activate your Divine Feminine by mediating on your emotions, accepting the outcomes of your actions, and practicing manifestation . [9] X Research source Whenever you think about a Divine Masculine quality, try to figure out its Divine Feminine counterpart. Protection goes along with nurturing, risk-taking goes along with acceptance, action goes along with passion, etc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep commitments to yourself and others.",
      "content": "Keep commitments to yourself and others. If you’re just starting out, committing to things may be difficult, so build your commitment-making muscle by making small, achievable goals for yourself. [10] X Research source Commit to going to bed early every night for a week, eating more vegetables, or writing a page of your manifesto every day. As you achieve your goals, making commitments will become easier. Once you can rely on yourself, then you can start working on being reliable to other people. It may be easier to make goals that align with your strengths when you’re just beginning. For example, if you already love to work out, challenge yourself to join a team sport or try a new physical activity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out your wants, desires, and what drives you.",
      "content": "Figure out your wants, desires, and what drives you. People embodying the Divine Masculine are guided by the light of their commitments. [11] X Research source Find your path by taking time to reflect on what’s important to you. Do you fight for freedom? For your family? For love? The Divine Masculine fights as a warrior, not a soldier. Soldiers are conscripted and work for pay, warriors fight from the heart—they carry their message in every action. When your divine masculine and feminine energies are balanced, you can use your Divine Feminine’s intuitive voice to guide your Divine Masculine. Your intuition may simply manifest itself as a part of your brain that tells you what you should and should not do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start things you've been planning on doing.",
      "content": "Start things you've been planning on doing. Step into divine masculine energy by getting active. [12] X Research source Now is the perfect time to start projects you’ve put off or have been overwhelmed or intimidated by. One thing that the Divine Masculine is associated with is flow state—by starting your projects , you allow your innate masculine energy to take over and get you chugging along towards success."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take calculated risks.",
      "content": "Take calculated risks. The action-oriented Divine Masculine thrives by taking leaps of faith. Doing anything big—moving, switching jobs, admitting feelings for someone, running for office, becoming a parent, etc.—activates the Divine Masculine as it works to adapt and move forward in your situation. [13] X Research source To keep yourself in the moment, don’t focus on the potential results of your risk. While it’s important to look before you leap, the Divine Masculine demands action above all else."
    },
    {
      "title": "Build solo skills in nature.",
      "content": "Build solo skills in nature. While Divine Masculine energy has a large community focus, to really embody it, you have to be self-sufficient. Spend time alone doing something challenging or going somewhere you’ve never been before. Think about your skills as you use them—what are you good at, what needs work, and what new skills would help you? Going out alone also helps you build resilience. Whether it means you’re fighting bears by yourself or deciding to go back home early, you’re the person to rely on if anything goes awry. Being in the natural world can help get you connected to your Divine Masculine and your Divine Feminine. Divinity, which is older than the concept of “inside,” exists within the water and the trees, the air and the ground, in the sun and the moon—you just have to be open to it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take leadership opportunities.",
      "content": "Take leadership opportunities. When you start feeling the Divine Masculine come over you, that’s the perfect time to start practicing leadership. [14] X Research source Become the team lead in a workgroup, join a committee or executive board of a club, or bring people in on your own project. Try to get to know everyone on your team so you can learn their strengths and weaknesses. For example, if you’re working on an animation with someone who is a great artist but bad with deadlines, pair them to work with a punctual person, check in on them regularly, or speak with them about creating many smaller deadlines to help keep their production well paced."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unlearn the negative characteristics you associate with masculinity.",
      "content": "Unlearn the negative characteristics you associate with masculinity. Toxic, or wounded, masculinity is unruly and only thinks of itself. This, however, is not a masculine trait but a trait of social hierarchy. Find Divine Masculine role models to help you see how positive masculinity can be. [15] X Research source They could be people in your life, community leaders, spiritual figures, and more. Masculinity has been associated with the idea of the “the patriarchy”—a society we live in that is male-centric and doesn’t respect the lives and desires of other genders. However, gendering itself arises from class relations, not from inherent sexual differences. [16] X Research source It may be more correct to think of “the patriarchy” as the tyranny of the elite, passed down to interfamily dynamics that are themselves mirrors of class struggle. Don’t forget that divine masculine energy is in everyone. Your mother could be your Divine Masculine role model if she showed the right characteristics. Without having a positive relationship with masculinity, it’s difficult, if not impossible, to access your divine masculine energy."
    },
    {
      "title": "The wounded masculine is sometimes thought of as “toxic masculinity.”",
      "content": "The wounded masculine is sometimes thought of as “toxic masculinity.” It takes the traits of the Divine Masculine and extends them without balance—leadership becomes domination, logic becomes materialism, strength becomes guardedness, protection becomes defensiveness, etc. [17] X Research source The wounded masculine overcompensates masculine energy. Sometimes it happens when we’re very vulnerable and in a situation where we have to take charge and fend for ourselves, for example, if you had to raise your own siblings growing up. Some traits of the wounded masculine are aggression, egotism, selfishness, emotional withdrawal, over-competitiveness, and spiritual disconnection. [18] X Research source You can almost think about it as a muscle supporting an injury. The overcompensating muscle is likely to cause problems in other parts of your body (twisting joints, pulling ligaments) but it’s only there because it’s trying to protect you from further hurting yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask out your crush.",
      "content": "Ask out your crush. If you’ve been waiting around to tell someone how you feel, now’s the time. Tell them that you like them or are interested in getting to know them better, then ask if they want to do something directly. [19] X Research source There are three possible outcomes: they want to go on a date with you, they don’t want to go on a date with you, or they haven’t considered it and need time to think. No matter the outcome, you will have just moved your relationship forward and gone after what you want."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on your independence.",
      "content": "Focus on your independence. Invest time in yourself as you look to form new relationships and better your old ones. Make plans with friends, start interesting projects, and commit to your routines. By bringing your best self to the table, your relationships will flourish and lead you towards more of what you desire. [20] X Research source When you’re embodying the Divine Masculine and balancing it with the Divine Feminine, your independence will attract the kinds of relationships you need for fulfillment and growth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set and respect boundaries.",
      "content": "Set and respect boundaries. Just because you’re in a relationship with someone doesn’t mean you have to share everything. When you find out what you want, and therefore what you don’t want, communicate it clearly with other people. You may want to communicate with someone less, have more personal space, or need some independence in a relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn from rejection, and don’t take it personally.",
      "content": "Learn from rejection, and don’t take it personally. If someone rejects you or doesn’t have time for you, let that be a lesson about your relationship with that person, not a slight that says something about you. [21] X Research source Your Divine Masculine will carry you towards good relationships if you let it, so don’t wait up for inconsistent lovers when you’re trying to have a good time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for leadership positions, responsibilities, and compensation.",
      "content": "Ask for leadership positions, responsibilities, and compensation. One major trait of the Divine Masculine is knowing what you want and going after it. [22] X Research source In the workplace, this can look like taking over a project, asking for a promotion, or even negotiating your departure from the company. Make a list of the reasons why you are the right person for the job. If you’re a strong salesperson, bring a record of your sales versus the average for your company. If you’re a teacher, speak to your students about your strongest abilities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enstate your ideas and practices.",
      "content": "Enstate your ideas and practices. Let your colleagues know if something at your workplace could be done better, then volunteer to set it up or oversee it. It could be anything from making your business more accessible to changing the filing system. The Divine Masculine calls you to protect and serve your peers and can give you insight into what needs to be done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Begin your own career venture.",
      "content": "Begin your own career venture. Sometimes the Divine Masculine fills you so much that you have to strike out on your own. To have complete creative freedom, start a new business by yourself or as the leader of a team. If you constantly feel like your skills would be better put to use elsewhere or that you’re not reaching your full potential, it may be time for you to invest in yourself and do what you want to do."

In times of war, Odin was called upon to give advice and to intercede in the battles. He is such a beacon of divine masculine energy that later authors rewrote myths so that other gods would be Odin’s children."
