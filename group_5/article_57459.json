      "content": "Simplify your ratio (optional). You may want to simplify your ratio to do something like scale down a recipe. If you're using 20 g of flour for a recipe, then you know you'll need 8 g of sugar, and you're done. But if you'd like to scale down the ratio as much as possible, then you'll need to simplify it by writing the ratio in its lowest possible terms. You should use the same process as you would use to simplify a fraction. To do this, you have to find the GCF, or the greatest common factor, of both quantities, and then see how many times that number fits into each given quantity. [2] X Research source To find the GCF of 20 and 8, write down all of the factors of both numbers (the numbers that can multiply to make those numbers and thus can be evenly divided into those numbers) and find the largest number that is evenly divisible into both. Here's how you do it: 20: 1, 2, 4 , 5, 10, 20 8: 1, 2, 4 , 8 4 is the GCF of 20 and 8 -- it's the largest number that evenly divides into both numbers. To get your simplified ratio, simply divide both numbers by 4: 20/4 = 5 8/4 = 2 Your new ratio is 5 g flour/ 2 g sugar."

If you'd like to turn the ratio into a percentage, you just have to complete the following steps: [3] X Research source Divide the first number by the second number. Ex: 5/2 = 2.5. Multiply the result by 100. Ex: 2.5 * 100 = 250. Add a percentage sign. 250 + % = 250%. This indicates that for every 1 unit of sugar, there is 2.5 units of flour; it also means that there is 250% as much flour as there is sugar."

For example, if you know that you'll need 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of pasta you boil (2 cups water/1 cup pasta), but you want to boil 2 cups of pasta, then you'll need to scale up the ratio to know how much water to use. To scale up a ratio, simply multiply the top and bottom by the same number. [6] X Research source 2 cups water/ 1 cup pasta * 2/ 2 = 4 cups water/ 2 cups pasta. You'll need 4 cups of water to boil 2 cups of pasta."
