If you’re dealing with a ton of congestion, stir 1/2 tsp (2.8 g) of non-iodized salt and 1/2 tsp (2.8 g) of baking soda into 2 cups (470 mL) of lukewarm distilled or previously boiled water. Fill a small bulb syringe or a neti pot with the water mixture, then insert the tip into one nostril and lean over a sink. Gently squeeze the bulb or tilt the neti pot into your nostril and let the water stream out your other nostril. Repeat this on the other side. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Always use distilled water or water you’ve boiled at home. Using straight tap water can introduce bacteria into your sinuses, and that can lead to an infection.
