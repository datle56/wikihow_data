      "content": "Pick a Cavalier with the right coloring. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have luxurious coats and come in four different color combinations known as Blenheim (chestnut red and white), Black and Tan, Tricolor (chestnut red, white and black) and Ruby (solid chestnut red). Most breeders value Cavaliers with long, slightly wavy fur. They prefer dogs to have clearly definable colors. They don't like dogs with a lot of \"ticking\". This means that if a Cavalier has a predominantly black back, they shouldn't have \"ticks\" or little spots of other colors mixed in."

      "content": "Choose a Cavalier with a quality coat. Purebred Cavalier show dogs are normally celebrated for their straight fur. If the dog you're thinking of adopting has a slight wave in its fur, this is completely acceptable. Cavaliers require a modicum of grooming. You should brush them regularly — a couple of times a week. A Cavalier Spaniels rarely have their coats trimmed and they generally only require bathing once every couple of weeks.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Cavaliers shed a lot. When you go to pick out a Cavalier for yourself, pay close attention to their coat. If you see a lot of loose hair on the dog or in its area, ask the seller how frequently they brush the dog or clean the area. Most of the time, shedding is the result of the dog's environment or its diet — both of which can be changed by you."

      "content": "Choose a healthy looking dog. Purebred Cavaliers generally have a lot of health issues resulting from generations of inbreeding to keep their line pure. The most obvious signs of a healthy Cavalier will be its coat, its eyes, and its ears. These tend to be the biggest problem areas on Cavaliers and therefore should be the first aspects to consider when purchasing a new Cavalier. Make sure its eyes, nose, and ears are clean and free of discharge. Its coat should be clean and free of parasites such as fleas. A puppy with prominent ribs and a potbelly is likely to have worms. Worms can be treated, but could indicate that his care or that of the mother, was less than ideal."

      "content": "Have a veterinarian examine the Cavalier. Regardless of what the seller says, have your vet check out your new friend. Make sure they focus on issues specific to Cavaliers (like those mentioned above) and environmental concerns like mites, fleas, ticks, and heart worms. Health-wise, always have puppies checked out prior to purchase. A heart murmur in a puppy is likely to be bad news in the long run, with a high risk of progression into premature heart failure. If you get an adult dog, then it is wise to have a veterinarian check the dog prior to purchase also. The veterinarian can check for common ailments that affect Cavaliers and other issues.

      "content": "Determine if it's friendly. Cavaliers should be welcoming to people. They are primarily lapdogs that provide entertainment and comfort. [4] X Research source Helen Bowler, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Bowler. Publisher: Interpet Publishing. Cavaliers can be great for families with young children. Because of their small stature, there is less chance that your children will be hurt accidentally - as is often the case with large lumbering Labradors. Cavaliers can still bite and scratch, but in general they are easy breeds to handle. Some dogs are conditioned to fear people. Perhaps, they had a traumatic experience early on in life, which has taught them to fear and even strike out at humans. While this behavior can be corrected, it might be a challenge that you're not keen to take on. When you first visit the dog, present your hand and let it take in your scent. Act friendly and don't invade its space too quickly. Attempt to pet and play with the dog. See how the dog responds. If the dog welcomes your attention, then you probably have found a sociable animal."

      "content": "Focus on how the dog interacts with other animals. Many families have more than one dog or more than one animal. If this is your situation, then see how your prospective dog plays with its litter mates or other dogs in its area. Does it show aggressive behavior? Does it sulk by itself in the corner of the pen? Or does it join in the fun and lead the pack? You can learn a lot quickly about an animal temperament by seeing it interact with other animals. If you plan on entering your Cavalier into shows, it will need to be good around other dogs as well. The last thing you want in this situation is to have a beautiful dog, whose behavior distracts judges from its appearance. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose an active Cavalier. Cavaliers are energetic spaniels who love to play and explore the out-of-doors. Individuals considering this breed should be prepared to provide regular exercise to keep their Cavalier healthy. For athletic owners, Cavaliers can gradually be trained to accompany you on long walks or hikes.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Inactive, even lethargic Cavaliers are unusual. Normally, a downtrodden Cavalier is a sign of a poor upbringing and could signal later behavioral problems. Do not interpret fatigue for ill-temperament. Young puppies often sleep a lot and so do older dogs. This should not be interpreted negatively; instead, see if you can gently coax the dog awake. Try to play with it. See if you can encourage it to interact with the other dogs. This will give you a better sense of its personality."

If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider common Cavalier health issues. People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. [9] X Research source Alex Gough, Breed Predispositions to Disease in Dogs and Cats. Gough. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic. [10] X Research source Alex Gough, Breed Predispositions to Disease in Dogs and Cats. Gough. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook \"Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats\" lists this condition as \"very common\" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age. [11] X Research source Alex Gough, Breed Predispositions to Disease in Dogs and Cats. Gough. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time [12] X Research source Alex Gough, Breed Predispositions to Disease in Dogs and Cats. Gough.
