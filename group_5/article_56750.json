      "content": "Virgo men can be control freaks. They just can’t help it—they're shrewd perfectionists who insist on doing things their way. Since everything has to be just so, Virgos prefer to take the reins in most situations. Your man loves that you’re headstrong and outspoken, but at the end of the day, he's uncomfortable unless he's in the driver’s seat. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re planning a vacation together, let him handle the itinerary. He’s probably already created a PowerPoint presentation with a color-coded list of his preferred activities. On the flip side, if your man loosens up and lets you take the lead sometimes, that means he trusts you. This is a big deal for Virgos."

      "content": "Observant Virgos can spot a lie a mile away and they're slow to forgive. This sign has a tendency to be distrustful; because of this, they scrutinize every detail. If there’s even a tiny discrepancy in your story, your man will point it out and demand answers. It’s best to just be transparent with him from the get-go. [6] X Research source Even little white lies will upset a Virgo! For example, if he gives you a gift and you don't like it, he'll probably know just by looking at your facial expression. Just say \"thank you\" and tell him how much you appreciate the gesture.
