The option to cure yourself of lycanthropy becomes available after you complete the entire questline. \"Glory of the Dead\" is the final quest in the Companions questline. This quest involves going into Ysgramor's Tomb, fighting previous Companion's ghosts, and throwing a Glenmoril Witch head on the flame to free Kodlak's wolf spirit, which you will have to fight. After this quest, you can cure yourself of lycanthropy. [1] X Research source After completing Glory of the Dead, you have the option to cure yourself of lycanthropy before exiting Ysgramor's Tomb. Simply throw another Glenmoril Witch head on the flame to release your own wolf spirit, which you will have to fight. Once you are cured of lycanthropy, you will not be able to complete the Totems of Hircine quest, which grants a unique ability you can use while in wolf-form. You will also lose access to the Underforge."

[3] X Research source Fast travel to the Glenmoril Coven. After completing the “Blood's Honor” quest, it should be an accessible location on the world map. It is located northwest of Falkreath. Enter the coven and you will find five Glenmoril witches there. Kill them and loot their bodies to gather at least three heads (one for both Farkas and Vilkas, and one for you)."

To reach Ysgramor's Tomb from Winterhold, head north and pass over the water. The tomb is located right on the bank of a small island. To reach Ysgramor's Tomb from Whiterun is a much longer journey. The tomb is located northeast of Whiterun. After exiting Whiterun, go past the town walls in the north and continue heading north. You will pass many mountains along the way, but do not stop until you reach Dawnstar.

This wolf is not a particularly difficult enemy. Its most challenging feature is its speed, hence the need to keep a distance. However, if you favor close combat, heavy hitters will quickly be able to kill the wolf with a few swings of a war hammer."

Instead, you'll be turned into a vampire lord. [6] X Research source The Dawnguard DLC centers on the ancient battle between vampires and their hunters, with you being forced to pick a side to fight on. If you side with the vampires, you will be turned into a vampire lord, a much stronger version of the typical vampires you come across in-game. Turning into a vampire lord will cleanse you of your lycanthropy since it is impossible to be a werewolf and vampire at the same time."
