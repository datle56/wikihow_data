      "content": "The best time to harvest rosemary is in the spring and summer. While you can harvest rosemary almost year-round, it grows most actively during the spring and summer. So, this is the best time to harvest it as the sprigs you cut off will grow back more rapidly. Simply trim some of the plant off daily or weekly to help encourage its growth. [1] X Research source If you are planning on drying the rosemary , harvest the herbs once buds appear but before the flowers open. This is when the leaves contain the most oil and flavor.

      "content": "Make your cuttings in the morning after the dew evaporates. The best time to harvest rosemary is mid-morning, or once all of the nighttime dew evaporates. This leaves you with dry herbs and prevents you from being outside during the heat of the day. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop harvesting rosemary about 1 month before the first frost.",
      "content": "Stop harvesting rosemary about 1 month before the first frost. To keep your rosemary healthy during the winter, stop cutting off fresh sprigs around 1 month before your area’s first projected frost date. Harvesting rosemary too close to freezing temperatures can cause new growth to die back. [4] X Research source Search for your area’s projected first freeze date online, or check out this map of average freeze dates across the US . If your rosemary is in a pot, bring it inside during the winter to reduce the risk of frost."

      "title": "Harvest from tender branches that are at least 8 in (20 cm) long.",
      "content": "Harvest from tender branches that are at least 8 in (20 cm) long. Look for long sprigs of rosemary that are thin and springy rather than woody. [5] X Research source Taking cuttings from tender branches encourages more growth while new branches can’t regrow from thick, woody stems. [6] X Research source The tender sprigs are also usually more flavorful than thicker, woodier stems. Grow several plants at once to ensure you always have long branches to harvest. The number of plants you’ll need varies on their size, but 2-3 should be fine for most people."

      "title": "Cut off the top 2 in (5 cm) of each sprig with shears or scissors.",
      "content": "Cut off the top 2 in (5 cm) of each sprig with shears or scissors. Only snip off 2 to 3 inches (5-7.6 cm) from the stem so some green leaves are left on each branch; this helps encourage branching and regrowth. Just make sure you use clean and sharp scissors or pruning shears to make your cuttings . [7] X Research source Disinfect your scissors or shears with rubbing alcohol before harvesting rosemary. This helps protect your plant from bacteria and diseases. [8] X Research source Put the clipped rosemary sprigs in a basket or bowl. If you just want to use a small amount of fresh rosemary at a time, simply pick off a few leaves from the top of a sprig. [9] X Research source Don’t cut more rosemary than you need at once."

      "title": "Don’t harvest more than ¼ of a rosemary bush at one time.",
      "content": "Don’t harvest more than ¼ of a rosemary bush at one time. Leave at least ¾ of the plant intact to ensure it continues to thrive and produce new sprigs. Just let the rosemary plant grow back before you harvest more of it. [10] X Research source Use the harvested rosemary in your cooking . Chef Ollie George Cigliano says rosemary pairs well with protein like poultry, lamb, fish, pork, and eggs. She also recommends flavoring veggies like potatoes, squash, tomatoes, and eggplant with rosemary. [11] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021. Make self-care products with rosemary, too. For instance, mix rosemary into homemade soap or make rosemary water for your hair . Remember not to harvest rosemary too close to winter because it will not grow back very fast. Perform your last harvest at least 1 month before the first frost so it has time to grow back before winter sets in. Bigger, fuller rosemary bushes are able to survive winter better."

      "content": "Store fresh rosemary in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Rinse the rosemary sprigs with water and let them air dry on a clean towel or paper towel. Then, wrap the sprigs in a damp paper towel. Seal the rosemary in a plastic storage bag or container and place it in your fridge. [12] X Research source As another option , trim the ends of the sprigs and set them in a jar of water. Just ensure no leaves are resting in the water. Then, set the jar in your fridge. [13] X Research source Storing rosemary in the fridge helps retain more of the flavor than dried rosemary. However, using fresh-cut rosemary provides the most flavor."

      "title": "Freeze rosemary for up to 1 year.",
      "content": "Freeze rosemary for up to 1 year. Wash and dry the rosemary sprigs. Then, strip off the leaves. Place the leaves in an ice cube tray and fill each compartment with water or olive oil. Simply set the tray in your freezer and use the cubes in sauces or soups to add a fresh rosemary taste to your recipes. [14] X Research source The amount of leaves you freeze per cube is up to you. Check how much rosemary a common recipe you might make requires, and freeze that amount in each cube. Once the rosemary is frozen, store the cubes in an airtight container or plastic freezer bag. Make sure to write the date on the bag so you remember when you froze the rosemary. Choose water or olive oil depending on what types of recipes you plan to use the ice cubes in. If you don’t know, do some of each. As another option , lay the washed and dried sprigs of rosemary on a baking sheet. Then, set it in the freezer. Once the sprigs are frozen, transfer them into an airtight container or plastic freezer bag."

      "title": "Infuse olive oil with fresh rosemary.",
      "content": "Infuse olive oil with fresh rosemary. Wash and air dry your freshly harvested rosemary sprigs. Then, mix 1 tbsp (11 g) of citric acid with 2 cups (473 ml) of water and soak the sprigs in the solution for 24 hours. Drain the solution. To make the oil , combine the rosemary and olive oil in a saucepan. Then, heat it over low heat for 5 minutes. [15] X Research source Strain out the rosemary and allow the oil to cool before pouring it into a clean jar or bottle. Then, store the oil in your fridge for about 1 week. Soaking the rosemary in citric acid prevents bacteria from growing in the oil which can cause food poisoning or botulism. Use the oil in recipes or as a delicious dipping sauce for bread. Add other ingredients to the oil, such as fresh garlic, basil, peppercorns, or chili peppers. Just make sure to acidify the garlic and other herbs to prevent bacteria from growing. As another option , add rosemary sprigs to rice wine vinegar. [16] X Research source Or, mix rosemary leaves into butter. [17] X Research source"

Take down the rosemary when it is completely dry, which is usually after about 10 days, and strip off the leaves to store them. [18] X Research source Store the dried rosemary leaves in airtight containers or jars in your cupboards or pantry. Use twine or rubber bands to hold the bundles of rosemary together. Use the dried rosemary within 1 year for the best flavor."

      "content": "Cut back long branches in the spring to encourage growth. Each year in the spring, use clean pruning shears or scissors to cut off 2 to 3 inches (5-7.6 in) from long stems around the plant. This helps stimulate more branching growth and prevents the stems from becoming woody or leggy. [20] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Do not prune more than ¼ of the plant at a time to ensure it keeps growing healthy and strong. Shape your plant as you prune to get it down to a size you like. Use the rosemary cuttings in your cooking or to propagate new plants. Note : Do not prune below the thick, woody branches. Shoots don’t grow from the woody stems, so this can inhibit your plant's growth."
