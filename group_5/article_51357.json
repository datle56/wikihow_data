The day-count convention on your bond is defined in the accompanying indenture (contract). [1] X Research source For example, 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year would mean a DCC of 30/360. Other bonds, especially U.S. government (Treasury) bonds, calculate interest using the exact number of days in a month and year. Such a DCC is sometimes referred to as \"actual/actual\" or \"ACT/ACT.\" In practice, bonds can also use a combination of these two DCCs, with such possible DCCs as 30/ACT and ACT/360. In practical terms, the convention used will make very little difference in terms of interest earned. Double-check your bond indenture to be sure. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Confirm the interest rate and payment frequency on your bond. Your interest rate, also called the coupon rate, specifies the amount of interest you earn on the bond annually as a percentage of your par (or \"face\") value. The payment frequency signifies whether your bond pays interest once a year or more often. Bonds typically pay interest either annually or semi-annually (once or twice per year). [3] X Research source This information can be found within your bond indenture. For example, your bond might pay a 6% coupon rate twice per year. In this case, the annual interest rate would be 6% divided by the number of payments within the year. Thus, a 6% bond that pays interest twice per year would effectively pay 3% of the par value for each of the two payments during the year, or 6% total."

Generally, if your bond is actual/actual, you will actually count the days. If your bond is 30/360, you would use those numbers for each month or year that has passed. [4] X Research source Let's say you have a 30/360 bond, and exactly two months have passed since your latest payment. You would simply multiply 2 x 30 and use 60 days in your calculations, regardless of how many days there actually were in the elapsed months."

[5] X Research source This will be stated clearly on your bond indenture. Note that the par value may be more or less than what you actually paid for the bond originally. Market price is affected by the existing rate environment and the bond issuer's creditworthiness. [6] X Research source Bonds are often valued at $1000. That would be the par value even if you paid slightly more or less for it."

It's simpler than it looks: A = P ∗ C F ∗ D T {\\displaystyle A=P*{\\frac {C}{F}}*{\\frac {D}{T}}} [7] X Research source \"A\" is the accrued interest earned. This is the figure you are solving for. \"P\" is the par value of the bond. \"C\" is the annual coupon rate or interest rate. For our purposes it should be expressed as a decimal. Simply take the interest rate shown in the bond indenture and divide by 100 to produce the decimal equivalent. For example, a 6% rate would be expressed as 0.06 (6/100). \"F\" is the payment frequency (or number of payments per year). This would be 2 for semi-annual payments or 1 for annual ones. \"D\" is the number of days since your latest coupon payment. \"T\" is the total number of days in a payment period. This would be 360 for annual payments and 180 for semi-annual ones."

The total days in the payment period is 180, because payments are made twice per year (360/2=180).
