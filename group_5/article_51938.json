      "content": "The correct answer is “being outdated and uncool.” Director Clavell will pose the question: “Tell me, what does cheugy mean?” You’ll get three options to choose from: “Something super cool”; “Being outdated and uncool”; and “It’s a really chewy gumball.” [1] X Research source Sorry, gumball enthusiasts—“cheugy” means “being outdated and uncool,” and is a reference to a TikTok trend from 2021. [2] X Research source While answering correctly will raise your friendship level with Director Clavell, you can still receive his gift (a Big Nugget) later on in the game if you answer incorrectly."

      "content": "Conversation #2: Faculty Members The next time you chat with Director Clavell, he’ll offer a slightly different question: “Which of our faculty members has made the most favorable impression on you?” From there, choose the faculty member that you like the most; no matter which teacher you pick (including Director Clavell himself), your friendship level with the Director will grow. [3] X Research source Answering “Director Clavell” to this question won’t earn you extra friendship with him."

      "content": "“Cheugy” took the world by storm in 2021 thanks to TikTok. TikToker Hallie Cain posted a video where she discussed different vibes and aesthetics that could be placed in the “cheugy” category, with cheugy referring to out-of-style things. [8] X Research source The concept of “cheugy” exists in a realm of its own—it doesn’t qualify as “uncool,” but it doesn’t fall into “basic” territory, either. [9] X Research source Mrs. George from the Mean Girls movies totally channels “cheugy” energy—she’s missing the trends despite overcompensating and trying to be “cool.” The word cheugy is commonly associated with “girlboss” culture. [10] X Research source The word “girlboss” encapsulates women with dominant, confident, and self-assured energy. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The word “cheugy” was created by a teenager in 2013. Back when she was 15 in 2013, Gaby Rasson (a high schooler at the time) crafted the word “cheugy” to fill a vocabulary gap that no existing word seemed capable of filling. As she introduced the term to her friend group, it began to spread and gain traction, where it eventually popped up on UrbanDictionary in late 2018. [12] X Research source"
