      "content": "Understand the purpose of a life estate. A life estate usually refers to a transaction related to property, such as a home, where the homeowner sells or gives the property to their children (or someone else) but maintains the right to live in the house until they die. The person who sells their home but maintains a life interest is referred to as the “life tenant.” The person(s) who will receive the house upon the death of the life tenant is called the \"remainderman.\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the benefits of a life estate.",
      "content": "Examine the benefits of a life estate. There are several reasons why a person may create a life estate. These include: The homeowner wants to avoid probate for their children. By creating a life estate, the property avoids probate and the remainderman immediately becomes the owner of the property upon the life tenant’s death. The property receives a step-up in basis. This means that when the government calculates capital gains taxes, value is calculated from the date of death, not from the date the original party acquired the property. Typically, there will be a greater increase in value from the date the property was acquired and therefore the tax owed on a property when sold would be much higher. By establishing a life estate, a parent could significantly reduce the amount of capital gains that a child has to pay. [2] X Research source A life estate may also be useful to qualify for medical assistance such as Medicaid, which limits the amount of assets you can own if you want support to pay a nursing home. The legal rules involving Medicaid are very complicated and you should contact a trust and estates attorney or an elder law attorney to assist you in making this determination. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider the drawbacks of a life estate. Before entering into a life estate, it is important for you to understand and weigh the drawbacks of a life estate against any potential benefits. These drawbacks may include: Selling property subject to a life estate is very difficult. While you maintain the right to live in the home, when you enter a life estate, you give up your right to sell or mortgage your home without the consent of all remaindermen. If the remaindermen refuse to agree to a sale, you are unable to sell the property. [4] X Research source A remainderman’s legal problems could impact the property. Since the remainderman has a legal interest in the property, if they run into financial trouble, a lien could be placed on the property while the life tenant is still alive. While the claims may impact the property, a life tenant cannot be forced to leave the property. [5] X Research source A life estate may impact your ability to receive medical assistance to pay for nursing home care or in-home care. If you grant a life estate, you may be restricted or ineligible from receiving government assistance through Medicaid for up to five years. [6] X Research source"

For example, you are remarried but you ultimately want the property to go to your children, not the relatives of your new spouse. You can grant your spouse a life estate in the property and upon the spouse’s death, the property would pass directly to your children. Your will must clearly state that the property goes to one party for the rest of their life then is transferred to another when the first beneficiary dies. This should create a life estate. You should speak with an attorney to make sure that the will and the life estate language meets your state’s legal requirements for a life estate. [8] X Research source"
