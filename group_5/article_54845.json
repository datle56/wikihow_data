      "title": "Write reviews that earn helpful votes (hearts).",
      "content": "Write reviews that earn helpful votes (hearts). When an Amazon customer ranks your review as helpful, it improves your reviewer rank. The higher your reviewer rank, the better your chances are of getting noticed by Amazon's Vine program recruiters. To get more hearts on your reviews, include the sort of product information that you would have liked to know before buying the product. Tell others how you use the product, what you like and don't like about it, and whether you feel the purchase was worth it overall. Even if your reviews have a lot of helpfulness votes, there's no guarantee you'll receive an invite. Some Vine reviewers were invited with only a few helpfulness votes. [1] X Research source While you can no longer view your reviewer rank, you can see how many helpfulness votes your reviews have earned at the top of your Amazon profile (e.g., \"500 hearts\"). You'll also find all of your past reviews here."

      "title": "Review products regularly, but choose quality over quantity.",
      "content": "Review products regularly, but choose quality over quantity. Many Amazon Vine reviewers who've received the elusive invitation claim they didn't have tons of reviews before joining—just a few well-written ones with honest and unbiased opinions . Don't run through your past orders and leave single-sentence reviews in hopes of receiving an Amazon Vine invitation—just make sure the reviews you feel inspired to write are meaningful. [2] X Research source Because the Vine program emphasizes the timeliness of reviews, you may increase your likelihood of receiving an invitation by reviewing your purchases within a week or two of receiving them. Always make sure you have plenty of recent reviews so Amazon knows you're still reviewing."

    {
      "title": "Include photos and videos in your reviews.",
      "content": "Include photos and videos in your reviews. Many Vine reviewers noted that their reviews contained pictures of the products they purchased or videos of products in action. While Amazon hasn't confirmed or denied the value of multimedia reviews, photo and video reviews get a lot of views—another metric that is assumed to boost your review ranking."

    {
      "title": "Write book reviews.",
      "content": "Write book reviews. Another trick that hasn't been verified by Amazon is that users who write helpful reviews of ebooks, audiobooks, and physical books they've purchased tend to be invited to Vine. Some Vine reviewers were surprised to be invited to the exclusive program after writing only a few helpful book reviews and nothing more!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Review products that have no (or few) reviews.",
      "content": "Review products that have no (or few) reviews. Once you're invited to the Vine program, many of the products you'll be reviewing are brand new to the store and haven't been reviewed yet. If you show Amazon that you're willing to take a chance on products without reviews, they may take notice. Also, being a product's first or second reviewer can increase your chance of getting helpfulness votes."

    {
      "title": "Be a product expert.",
      "content": "Be a product expert. Do you often buy certain types of products and have some background knowledge to share? Maybe you're a skincare guru or know everything there is to know about soldering supplies. Leave plenty of reviews on products from the same category to establish yourself as an expert in that area. Many Vine reviewers on Reddit's /r/AmazonVine claim most of their reviews were for similar products when they finally received their invitations."

    {
      "title": "Don't offer medical advice.",
      "content": "Don't offer medical advice. Current Amazon Vine reviewers find that their reviews of medical products like supplements and vitamins are rejected by Amazon when they make medical promises or claims. To avoid disqualifying yourself before you're invited, keep your vitamin and supplement reviews focused on the facts. Instead of saying, \"These pills will cure your chronic headaches,\" say, \"These pills were easy to swallow, and my headaches no longer last as long.\""

      "title": "Fill out your Amazon profile.",
      "content": "Fill out your Amazon profile. While Amazon doesn't offer advice on this either way, uploading a picture to your Amazon profile, using a real name, and writing a brief bio may be helpful. If your profile is anonymous, Amazon customers may not find your reviews trustworthy, and Amazon may avoid sending you an invitation to Vine."

      "content": "Rate other reviews as helpful. If you read an Amazon review that helped you decide whether to buy a product, click the heart to rate the review as helpful.

      "content": "Don't bring the seller or shipping details into the review. When writing reviews, focus on the products, not the shopping experience, packaging, or other details. Your reviews should cover the products only, and save the packaging and shipping issues for your seller feedback ."

      "content": "Reviewers order free products. Active Amazon Vine members have a special list of products they can order from at no cost. The products available to Vine members vary by ranking—meaning that more prolific reviewers ultimately rise to the Silver and Gold tiers, awarding them access to higher-value products. To maintain Gold status, reviewers must review 100 items and at least 90% of their orders every 6-9 months. Silver members must review up to 50% of their free products. [6] X Research source"
