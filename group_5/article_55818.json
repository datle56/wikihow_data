You might be feeling like you’re not good at anything simply because you haven’t actually taken the time to sit down and identify your positive qualities. Get out a piece of paper or make a mental list in your head and list out all of the things you think you excel at or have a knack for. Even if you think it’s not that impressive of a skill, write it down! [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some examples of positive traits are things like being friendly, empathetic, a good listener, creative, responsible, and enthusiastic. Some skills you might excel at include working in a team, writing, organizing, resolving conflicts, and adapting to changes. If you don’t feel like you’re good at anything and are trying to apply for a job, one tip is to highlight your soft skills. These are things like listening skills, communication skills, and empathy."

If you find yourself struggling to think of something, it’s almost guaranteed that your friends and family members will have plenty of wonderful things to say about you. Ask them something like, “What do you think I’m good at?” or “What do you think my strengths are?” and take note of what they have to say. Sometimes an outsider’s perspective can reveal things about yourself you never thought of.

If you’re looking to discover your unique talents and skills, think about things like your past jobs, classes, or volunteer opportunities. Chances are you’ll be able to find at least a couple of things you excelled at while you were in those positions. This is also one way to look at the things that didn’t work and start making an effort to improve them. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, look through your past resumes to see what you wrote down for your skills.

Every person has a multitude of talents, and doing new things and taking the time to acquire new skills will be the key to uncovering more of your hidden strengths. For example, you might: Sign up for a course that interests you at your local community college. Watch video tutorials to learn a new hobby, such as drawing. Get a part-time job .

If you want to discover your true strengths and skills, take a chance and make an effort to help someone or teach them something you know. This can really help boost your confidence, and you’ll likely end up building great relationships with other people.

Look back through past performance reviews you’ve received, old assignments, or any other type of feedback you’ve received on things you’ve worked on. Not only will you be reminded of your strengths, but you might also discover potential skills that you can perfect through just a bit of work. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, an old performance review might reveal that you have really great interpersonal communication skills but can continue to improve your time management. Talk to others around you and get a second opinion on the feedback you’ve received. Feedback can be very subjective, so it never hurts to hear what others have to say about your strengths and areas that can be improved."

Discovering your strengths can also mean putting in effort to improve your current skills until they become a great asset to you. So if you have a skill or quality you want to improve, be sure to invest time and effort into getting better until you’re satisfied with your progress.

If you’re feeling stuck and don’t know what your strengths are, ask someone you know to teach you and introduce you to something new. You might just find something you excel at where you least expected it. [7] X Research source For example, ask your friends or family members to teach you a new skill or tell them about things you want to learn to see if they can help.

[8] X Research source You tell yourself things like, “I wish I were as pretty as her,” “Why can’t I do this as well as they did it?” and “I want their style.” Social media may also be a culprit in your feelings of self-doubt. It’s no secret that people tend to only boast about the highlights of their life, and you might find yourself constantly comparing your life to the glamorous things you see online.

If you feel like you’re not really good at anything, you might find yourself constantly ruminating on the mistakes you made in the past, your perceived “failures,” and the things that supposedly make you weaker compared to others. [9] X Research source These insecure feelings can also lead to you blaming yourself automatically when things go wrong even if the situation is totally out of your control. You might also find yourself often thinking about your regrets and saying things like, “I wish I had done that” or “I really should’ve taken the chance when I had it.” Remember: Your “mistakes” and “failures” can become learning opportunities.

[10] X Research source For example, even if you’re at a job you don’t like, low self-esteem might prevent you from going out and finding a better job because you automatically assume you won’t be good at it. Remember: It’s highly unlikely you’ll be perfect at something on your first try. One of the best things about trying new things is that you get to learn along the way and improve your skills."

When you fail to meet such unrealistic expectations, you can end up feeling disappointed and go on to judge yourself harshly by saying you’re not good at anything. [13] X Research source For example, entering a new job and expecting to pull off tasks perfectly right from day one is an unrealistic expectation.

It can definitely seem like something that’s easier said than done, but refraining from comparing yourself to others can do wonders in raising your self-esteem. One way to do this is to appreciate others rather than envy them. For example, instead of saying, “I wish I looked as good as them,” say, “They have a unique style that really works on them.” [21] X Research source Instead, compete against yourself and do some self-comparison. For example, compare your past and present self to see how much you’ve grown and changed. The only person you should compare yourself to is yourself! Take a break from social media . Seeing everyone’s posts on Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter can make it hard to stop comparing yourself, especially when they only post the best parts of their lives."

This can help you build a positive attitude as well as avoid making the same mistakes in the future. [22] X Research source For example, if you made a mistake at work, take responsibility for it, then review what happened to see what you can improve for next time. Also be sure to point out the things you did well. Even when you make a mistake, there are still things you likely did well that will continue to help you next time."

Instead of expecting yourself to automatically succeed and be the best, set realistic goals that take your current skills, available time, and resources into account. Most importantly, create actionable steps within these goals that will allow you to track your progress. [23] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source One tip is to set SMART goals which are specific, measurable, attainable (realistic), relevant, and time-bound. For example, consider this goal about writing a novel: Specific: I want to write a novel. Measurable: I’ll write at least 1,500 words a day for 3 months. Attainable: I’m on summer vacation, so I’ll have time to write each day. Relevant: I really enjoy reading and writing and have a good idea for a story.

Even if you haven’t reached your final goal yet, pausing every now and then to pat yourself on the back for improving can do wonders to raise your self-esteem and help motivate you to keep moving forward. [24] X Research source For example, when you’re working on a project, reward yourself with a break or treat when you complete each section to keep yourself motivated.

If you have low self-esteem or feel like you’re falling behind, it can be easy to get frustrated when things go wrong, and you might automatically turn to blame yourself. However, this kind of behavior can just end up lowering your confidence even more. Instead, take a step back when things get overwhelming, ask yourself, “Is there anything I can realistically do to change this?” and think about the situation logically . [25] X Research source One idea is to keep a journal where you can write down your feelings and experiences. This will give you an opportunity to review the situation again and work through your honest thoughts and feelings. Confide in others and ask for their advice when you’re having trouble. Sometimes an outside opinion can help you see the situation from another perspective."

If you find yourself automatically making self-derogatory comments or being overly critical toward yourself, stop and make an effort to change those negative thoughts into positive ones. [26] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use positive affirmations to raise your self-confidence. Tell yourself things like, “I am strong,” “I am capable,” and “I can do anything I set my mind to” every day to give yourself encouragement. Avoid automatically making assumptions about yourself and others. For example, don’t automatically assume that you won’t be good at something or that someone won’t like you.
