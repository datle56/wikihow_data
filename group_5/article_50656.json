      "title": "He'll be more likely to notice you if you have things in common.",
      "content": "He'll be more likely to notice you if you have things in common. He's not likely to just approach you randomly, but you can spark his interest if he starts seeing you around his favorite spots. This might take a little bit of research on your part, but a Pisces woman is always up to the task of digging into someone. Use your natural intuition to help guide you. For example, if he reads comic books, you might find out what shops he frequents and become a regular at the same places. You might get clues from his social media. You could also ask mutual friends about him and find out from them what some of his interests are."

      "title": "A Water-bearer is attracted to a woman who stands out from the crowd.",
      "content": "A Water-bearer is attracted to a woman who stands out from the crowd. As a Pisces woman, your wardrobe tends to be pretty bohemian—a look that suits an Aquarian man. He's typically more attracted to your mind, anyway, but you'll turn his eye if you're dressed unconventionally. T-shirts or hoodies that advertise your dedication to a particular cause are winners for him too—he'll love that you're committed to saving the world, because he is too. That bright striped sweater that you wear with everything, even if it clashes? He probably loves it just as much as you do because it's part of who you are."

      "title": "Aquarian men prefer to focus on friendship before romance.",
      "content": "Aquarian men prefer to focus on friendship before romance. As a Pisces woman, you love friends and tend to be quite skilled at making them. Your intuition leads you to understand better than most what people are looking for and how you can best support them. This skill works in your favor with an Aquarius guy, who tends to blend friendship and love together. Because both of you are at ease in cultivating friendships, it won't be at all difficult to start a relationship with him this way. Friendship also allows the two of you to get to know each other better without a lot of pressure."

      "title": "An Aquarius guy will swoon over your imagination.",
      "content": "An Aquarius guy will swoon over your imagination. All his life, he's probably felt that he'd never meet anyone who was as imaginative as him. But as a Daughter of Neptune, you're overflowing with dreams and imagination. If you start sharing your fantastical inner world, he'll realize he's finally met his match. [1] X Research source For example, you might tell him about your dream of one day buying a large tract of land where you and all of your friends can work and create together communally, living in tree houses connected by swinging bridges. He'll be entranced by your idealism, your love of your friends, and your dedication to helping others. You've likely often felt misunderstood when you talk about your dreams—perhaps others have mocked your fantasy world. You don't need to worry about that with this Aquarian. He's felt the same way, and the two you can bond over this like kindred spirits."

      "content": "As an Air sign, Aquarians are talkers who love active listeners. He's not just talking to hear himself talk—he wants a rapt audience hanging on his every word. As a Pisces woman, active listening is one of your strongest skills. He'll love how attentive you are and how well you understand his thoughts. [2] X Research source Ask him plenty of questions to encourage him to flesh out his ideas more for you. This also helps you learn more about him and how his mind works. It's likely you'll end up using some of his ideas for inspiration—don't hesitate to let him know! He'll be thrilled that you took something from his mind and expanded it into something new and different on your own."

      "title": "Aquarius guys take a lighthearted approach to relationships.",
      "content": "Aquarius guys take a lighthearted approach to relationships. Truth be told, he takes a pretty lighthearted approach to everything—but that's just part of his charm. As a Water sign, you tend to be pretty laid back and easygoing, so it's not a challenge for you to just sit back and enjoy the ride. Your easygoing nature also works well for him because he's not exactly the most organized and disciplined guy out there—he likes that you don't give him grief about it."

      "title": "Friends are really important to your typical Aquarius guy.",
      "content": "Friends are really important to your typical Aquarius guy. For an Aquarian, you might say that the way to his heart is through his friends. He's very devoted to them, so if you want to win him, you'll need to win them over as well. This isn't much of a challenge for you, as Pisces women know how to charm practically anyone they meet. Let him know that you want to get to know his friends—he'll be thrilled and he'll know that you're really interested in him. You might go on group outings together as well. That way, his friends will get to spend time with the two of you as a couple and see how wonderful the two of you are together."

      "content": "Both of you share core ideals and want to help people. An Aquarian marches to the beat of his own drummer—his ruling planet, Uranus, is known as the disruptor—but he is committed to making the world a better place. You're a good match in this way since, as a Pisces woman, you care so deeply for others and want to help them in any way you can. [3] X Research source As you chat, you're inevitably going to discover a particular cause that you both feel passionate about. Contact local organizers and find out how you can help! The two of you will feel great about doing something to better the world and you'll grow closer doing it together."

      "title": "An Aquarius guy often needs to do his own thing.",
      "content": "An Aquarius guy often needs to do his own thing. This is where he'll love that, as a Pisces, you need some alone time too. You're an introvert, so you're not really interested in dragging him to a million social functions he has no interest in. He's free to only do the things he wants to do and that suits him. If he starts to get a little withdrawn or irritated, that's a sure sign that he would rather be doing something else. Try not to take it personally (especially if you're just doing something alone together)—instead, just ask him what he wants to do. You might ask, \"Is there something else you'd rather be doing right now?\" Listen to his response and if it's something you can make happen, let him know that he should go do it."

      "title": "As a logical Air sign, romance doesn't come naturally to him.",
      "content": "As a logical Air sign, romance doesn't come naturally to him. Pisces is a very romantic sign, and you've probably dreamed of a handsome man sweeping you off your feet with candlelit dinners and moonlit walks. An Aquarius guy can certainly give you all of that, but you have to tell him first. A few well-placed hints can help him understand the kind of romance you're interested in. For example, you might suggest a stroll in the park one evening. As you reach for his hand, you might comment about how romantic it is and how happy it makes you. He'll get the message."

      "content": "As a couple, the two of you might tend to fall into a routine. There's comfort in your commonalities that can make the two of you a little complacent. You find yourself retreating into your own little private dream world. The only problem is your retreat can become monotonous after a while unless you do something to shake things up. This certainly isn't a dealbreaker issue. It can be as simple as visiting a new place or trying out a new art form. Even though you can be shy, Pisces, you might try enrolling the two of you in an improv class—it'll appeal to his zany sense of humor."
