      "content": "Spray a cleaning solution onto moldy areas of any surface. Grab a spray bottle with your chosen cleaning solution inside. Generously spray the entire area with the solution so that there’s a visible, even coating. Try not to completely saturate the area since that’ll leave a lot of excess liquid to clean up later. Aim to apply enough of the cleaning solution so that the area is visibly wet but not so much that puddles form. [1] X Research source For cleaning mold off of the ceiling , dip a rag or sponge in your solution and wipe it over the moldy spots. This prevents you from getting your cleaning solution into your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you’re using a baking soda paste, apply the paste directly onto the mold with a sponge or cloth. If you’re using a commercial cleaner, read the instructions carefully about how to apply it to the mold. Reader Poll: We asked 356 wikiHow readers which chemical solution they prefer to use to clean mold, and only 10% of them said 3% hydrogen peroxide. [Take Poll] While peroxide can be effective at removing mold, other cleaners may work better."

      "content": "Wipe smooth surfaces like tile, toilets, tubs, and sinks with a cleaning cloth. If you have mold growing in your bathtub , shower , basin , or on any tile , use a clean cloth or sponge to gently wipe away the cleaning solution. The mold should wipe away easily onto the cloth. [2] X Research source This also works if you have mold growing on your ceiling or drywall . If your walls or ceilings are painted, be a bit more gentle when wiping these surfaces to avoid damaging the paint. If you’re using vinegar, leave it to sit for 1 hour before wiping it away. This allows the mold adequate time to absorb the vinegar."

If you’ve got some particularly tough stains in your bathtub , shower , sink , or on tile walls or floors , use a cleaning brush to tackle them. Scrub the affected area vigorously until the mold comes away. [3] X Research source If you used vinegar, don’t scrub the area. Instead, allow the vinegar to just sit for 1 hour, and then wipe the mold away with a clean cloth. Have a dedicated scrubbing brush strictly for bathroom mold to prevent spreading the spores throughout your home. Avoid this type of harsh scrubbing on painted drywall or ceilings since the paint could be damaged."

      "content": "Scrub grout or caulking with a toothbrush. Move the toothbrush in a back-and-forth motion while applying firm pressure to scrub away the mold. Rinse the toothbrush under running water to remove any mold while you clean, as this prevents the mold spores from spreading throughout the bathroom. [4] X Research source Use a dedicated toothbrush for cleaning mold in the bathroom so that the spores don’t spread throughout your home. Another option is to use specialty grout scrubbers that are specifically made to fit in the tight space. A larger scrubbing brush will also work, but a toothbrush is the easiest to use in such small spaces."

[5] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you used a baking soda paste, wipe it away with a damp washcloth, sponge, or towel.

In that case, use a grout saw or something like a flathead screwdriver to dig into the grout or caulking and remove it . Apply the new grout or caulking and clean it regularly to prevent the mold from forming more stains.

Just pour the vinegar directly into a spray bottle to use it on most surfaces. However, if you’re cleaning mold from tile flooring , dilute the vinegar by adding equal parts water. [8] X Research source Although the smell can be unpleasant, it usually clears within 1-2 hours. Open a window or turn on a fan to help the smell disappear faster when you spray the vinegar. Avoid using vinegar on marble or gold-plated surfaces since it’ll likely damage them. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Borax is a natural fungicide and works wonders in getting rid of mold and preventing it from coming back. [11] X Research source Borax usually comes in powder form, so make sure it’s completely dissolved in the water before spraying any mold. Keep borax away from small children and pets, as it can be toxic if swallowed."

Combine 2 tbsp (34 g) of baking soda with 2 cups (473 mL) of water in a spray bottle and shake it vigorously until the baking soda has completely dissolved. [12] X Research source Alternatively, combine two parts baking soda with one part water and mix them in a bowl to create a thicker paste to spread over the mold. This is a good method if you have a particularly tough mold stain that needs a more thorough scrubbing."
