      "content": "Determine what kind of stud finder you have. Some stud finders are magnetic, so you will feel a pull when a stud is identified based on the presence of nails or wires running along the stud. Others measure changes in your wall width. These will signal the presence of a stud with a sound or flashing light. Magnetic stud finders can be less effective than other types of stud finders. This is because they do not discriminate between metals. A metal pipe that is nowhere near a stud will appear much the same to a magnetic stud finder as will a length of wire mounted on a stud. [2] X Research source Only use a stud finder that measures the changes in wall width if you have walls made of drywall. This is because drywall has a uniform width, which makes it easy for the stud finder. Plaster, on the other hand, often lacks uniform width, which can interfere with the stud finder."

      "title": "Calibrate the stud finder if necessary.",
      "content": "Calibrate the stud finder if necessary. Some models will require you to calibrate them before use. You do this by placing the stud finder against a section of wall where there is no stud and turning it on. The calibration process will take differing lengths of time depending on the model. Some models may calibrate in a few seconds while others may need closer to one minute. Generally the stud finder will indicate once it has finished calibrating or if you need to repeat the process. [3] X Research source Stud finders that require calibration will generally have a method of alerting you if you have placed the finder over a stud or other material that may interfere with the calibration process, such as metal. Simply move the stud finder to a different location and try again."

      "title": "Pay attention to which model of stud finder you have.",
      "content": "Pay attention to which model of stud finder you have. An edge-finding model will locate the edge of a stud. So if you have one of these, you will have to repeat the process from the other direction to find the other edge of the stud. You may also need to recalibrate the stud finder before making a second pass. A center-sensing model, on the other hand, will indicate where the center of the stud is. [4] X Research source If you have an edge-finding model, bear in mind that the width of studs can vary between 1.5 and 3.5 inches (3.8 and 8.9 cm) if your residence uses 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) lumber. [5] X Research source Other widths of lumber lead to different stud widths. Therefore, consider checking with a contractor or your landlord to determine how wide your studs are."

      "content": "Run the tool across the wall at the installation height for whatever you want to hang. Look for the indicator that tells you a stud has been located. Repeat this process several times at varying heights to confirm that you have found a stud. If you have the edge-finding model, mark where the beeping starts and stops to determine the width of the stud. Measure and mark 16 in (41 cm) increments across to find additional studs based on your baseboards. This is typical stud spacing. Older homes may have studs 24 inches (61 cm) apart. Use your stud finder to confirm that studs exist at these points."

      "content": "Find out if you have metal studs before drilling into them. Many apartment and office buildings use metal studs rather than wood ones. If this is the case for your residence or building, you'll need to use special fasteners. Most wood screws will not go through metal. [6] X Research source Use self-drilling sheet metal screws if you have metal studs. Or, drill a pilot hole, then use a drywall or wood screw that is just larger than the pilot hole."

      "title": "Check the trim.",
      "content": "Check the trim. Any kind of interior trim such as baseboard or crown molding is attached to studs. You can find where the studs are by looking for small dimples in the trim. These indentations are where the trim was nailed to the stud. The nail holes are filled with caulk and painted over after the trim is attached, but generally they remain visible if you look carefully enough. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a flashlight. Turn on a flashlight and set it on the floor so it shines up the wall. Look for little imperfections, like dimples, that run in a vertical line to identify the studs. This works best if your wall is smooth, rather than textured."

      "title": "Try the knock test.",
      "content": "Try the knock test. This requires you to knock lightly on the wall to see if you can hear whether a stud has been added. An area with no stud will produce a low, hollow sound. An area with a stud will produce a higher, more solid sound. Practice in areas where you know there are studs to train your ear."

      "title": "Drive a pin into the spot where you think the stud is located.",
      "content": "Drive a pin into the spot where you think the stud is located. If there is a stud there, the pin will stop when it makes contact with the wood. If there is no stud, you will encounter little resistance and the pin will go all the way into the wall. [8] X Research source If you don't find a stud the first time you use a pin, try the wire test. Fashion a coat hanger or other piece of long, thin, rigid wire into a right angle. Insert the wire into the hole you've made in the wall and spin it until it makes contact with a stud. [9] X Research source This way you won't have to knock multiple holes in your wall."

      "title": "Locate switches and outlets on your walls.",
      "content": "Locate switches and outlets on your walls. Most electrical boxes will be mounted on the edge of a stud. Turn off the power to that switch or outlet and remove the cover. You should then be able to see which side of the switch the stud is located on by looking for the mounting screws. If you can't, use the knock or pin test to determine the placement of the stud. Measure at least 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) away from the outlet or the electrical unit to find the center of the stud. Try the knock or pin test if you want to figure out the stud's width. Remember that studs will normally be located at 16 in (41 cm) intervals on either side of the outlet/switch. Similarly, studs surround windows and doors."

      "title": "Calculate stud positions by measuring from corner to corner.",
      "content": "Calculate stud positions by measuring from corner to corner. Because studs tend to be 16 in (41 cm) apart, you can measure in from any corner to figure out where to find studs. Remember that not all walls are divisible by 16 in (41 cm) exactly, so there may be some studs that show up in a distance that is less than 16 in (41 cm) from the previous or next stud."

      "title": "Try a strong magnet or magnetic stud finder.",
      "content": "Try a strong magnet or magnetic stud finder. An electronic stud finder that measures changes in the depth of the wall will not work on plaster. But a magnetic stud finder or particularly strong magnet can indicate where the wood lath has been nailed onto the stud. Similarly, you can use a metal-sensing stud finder to locate the nails that hold the lath onto the stud. Simply turn on the stud finder and run it both vertically and horizontally along the wall. A metal detector can also show you where the lath has been nailed to the stud. [10] X Research source If you use any of these methods remember to find multiple studs and measure the distance between them to make sure that you haven't found a metal pipe or wire that isn't attached to the stud."

      "title": "Try the knock test instead of the pin test.",
      "content": "Try the knock test instead of the pin test. The knock test will still work for plaster. Knock on the wall to see if a stud is present. An area with no stud will produce a low, hollow sound, while an area with a stud will produce a higher, more solid sound. While you can find studs in drywall by driving a pin through the wall to see if it hits the stud, plaster is generally too tough for a pin to penetrate. A pin also won't go through the wood lath in any case. Using switches and outlets to find studs will also work. Any electrical switch or outlet will be mounted on a stud. Turn off the electricity to the switch or outlet and remove the plastic cover to see on which side of the stud the switch or outlet is mounted by looking for the screws."

      "content": "Use wood lath to hold lighter items. Hanging items on a plaster wall can be easier than hanging them on drywall because plaster is applied to an interior layer of wood lath. Lath is generally strong enough to handle any item weighing less than 10–15 pounds (4.5–6.8 kg). But for heavier items like television sets you'll still need to find at least one stud.

      "content": "Hang heavy items using a wall anchor. You may not need to worry about studs if you use a strong enough wall anchor. Some wall anchors are strong enough to hold several hundred pounds, whether on drywall or plaster. Always remember to read instructions carefully before hanging anything on a wall anchor to avoid serious damage to your wall. [12] X Research source"
