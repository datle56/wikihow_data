      "content": "“Om shanti om” is a Sanskrit phrase that means peace in body or mind. This chant is often used to open or close yoga or meditative practices. The mantra reminds you that you’re at peace no matter where you are—that your mind, body, and spirit are connected. Many say “om shanti om” before and after starting a yoga flow or meditation to align their energy and remember that peace is their priority. “Shanti” directly translates to “peace,” while “om” means the “whole world.” [1] X Research source “Om shanti om” can also be chanted as “om shanti, shanti, shanti.” Traditionally, the word “shanti” is always chanted 3 times after “om” to represent the 3 levels of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and sleeping. To pronounce “shanti,” draw out the “a” as you would in the word “father,” and press your tongue against your teeth when you make the “t” sound."

The sound creates a vibration in your throat and on your lips, creating energy. [3] X Research source"
