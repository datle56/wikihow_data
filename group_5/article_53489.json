You can also put your arms into it, and pump them forward or upward slightly every time you take a step. In the \"Electric Boogie\" video, you can see that the dancers are really pumping their arms, almost as if they were doing the \"Running Man\" with them; it's up to you how much you want to get into it!

You'll be taking your next step with your left foot, so you should keep the weight on the right foot. You can also clap your hands whenever you tap your feet to add some flair to this dance move. Congratulations -- you have just completed a grapevine to the right! The grapevine consists of the moves set out in Steps 1-4. If you want to simplify this dance and aren't ready for the grapevine, instead of weaving one foot behind the other, you can instead simply step the right foot to the right, step your left foot to the right to meet your right foot, tap it, and repeat. So you would do a step-tap, step-tap, instead of the grapevine. If this is what you choose, then you should also do this move on the left side."
