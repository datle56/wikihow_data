      "content": "Pedialyte offers more electrolytes than Gatorade. Electrolytes are minerals that support bodily functions like fluid regulation, muscle function, and pH balance; you lose electrolytes when you sweat, so it’s important to replace them quickly to prevent dehydration. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Compared to Gatorade, Pedialyte contains significantly greater sodium, potassium, chloride, and zinc (electrolytes).

      "content": "Pedialyte has significantly less sugar than Gatorade. Gatorade contains a high amount of sugar to increase fuel mid-workout. One 12-ounce (0.35L) serving of Gatorade’s Thirst Quencher contains 21 grams (0.74 oz) of sugar, while one 12-ounce (0.35L) serving of Pedialyte Classic has approximately 9 grams (0.32 oz) of sugar. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source The American Heart Association recommends a daily sugar intake of 24 grams (0.85 oz) for women and 36 grams (1.3 oz) for men, so avoid drinking Gatorade regularly: one bottle of Gatorade’s Thirst Quencher has 48 grams (1.7 oz) of sugar.

      "content": "Select Pedialyte if you're sick. Pedialyte replaces fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea, and it’s a better option than Gatorade because it contains less sugar. Sugar makes stomach flu symptoms worse because it pulls excess water into the gut, disrupting the gastrointestinal tract. [11] X Research source To cope with a stomach flu , make sure to drink enough fluids and eat bland foods (bananas, rice, apples, toast). One 12-ounce (0.35L) serving of Pedialyte Classic provides 25% of the Daily Value (DV) of zinc, which increases water absorption and reduces diarrhea.

For non-athletes, it’s just another sugary drink; only choose Gatorade to replenish electrolytes during high-intensity exercise. [14] X Research source As a general rule, drink Gatorade one hour into your workout; if you’re outside (or a heavy sweater), you may want to reach for it every 30-45 minutes instead.

[16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Although electrolyte drinks aren’t scientifically-proven hangover cures , they can reduce common symptoms like headaches and nausea. Pedialyte is a better option than Gatorade because it carries twice the amount of electrolytes to fight dehydration and feel better faster. [17] X Research source If you don’t have Pedialyte and want to avoid excess sugar, drink coconut water instead. It’s full of electrolytes and low in calories and sugar, making it a perfect natural alternative. [18] X Research source"

Pedialyte is an excellent option to treat illness and hangovers, while Gatorade is only the preferred option when it comes to exercise.
