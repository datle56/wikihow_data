      "content": "Be yourself. When you want to impress a guy, you might feel like you have to dress up or go out of your way to seem cool. However, the right guy for you will be interested in the real you. Don’t worry about pretending to be someone you’re not. Take photos as you are so your crush gets to know you. If you wore sweats all day Saturday, don’t change into something fancier just to take a few snaps. Go ahead and snap yourself in sweats! Similarly, it’s okay to snap yourself hanging out at home on a Friday. Don’t pretend like you’re going out if you don't."

      "content": "Highlight your eyes if you’re wearing makeup for the Snap. You don’t need makeup to take perfect snaps, especially if you’re using a filter. If you like wearing makeup, be careful how you apply it. In general, it’s best to play up your eyes for snaps because they’ll draw in the guy you like. However, keep the makeup on your cheeks and lips subtle so your eyes really shine. If you prefer, it’s okay to go with a bold lip and subtle eyes. However, highlighting your eyes typically makes your face look more alluring in selfies."

      "title": "Look at the camera so it seems like you’re looking at him.",
      "content": "Look at the camera so it seems like you’re looking at him. You want to look your best, so it’s understandable that you’d be looking at the screen when you snap your photo. However, this can make people think you’re focused on yourself, not them. Instead, look directly into the camera so it seems like you’re staring at them. [2] X Research source It’s okay to take several snaps to get the right look. Try changing the lighting, background, and angle."

      "content": "Try filters to add a fun vibe. Filters are one of Snapchat’s most popular features, and you likely already have your favorites. It’s totally okay to send your crush filtered snaps. Go for filters that could start a conversation! For example, use a hair-dye filter and ask “should I dye my hair this color?” Or, pick a funny filter and see what he says. Sending him something funny is a great way to break the ice. [3] X Expert Source Hardy Jean Dating Coach Expert Interview. 10 June 2022."

      "title": "Snap what you’re doing.",
      "content": "Snap what you’re doing. Photos of you are great, but taking pictures of what you’re doing can be a great way to continue the conversation. These photos show off your personality and interests — plus they’re a convenient option for times when you don’t feel like taking a selfie. For instance, you might take a snap of you holding your favorite coffee drink, hiking a trail, or cooking dinner. For more general tips, see our guide on how to flirt with a guy ."

      "content": "Use your story to show him what you’re up to without being obvious. You probably want your crush to see how amazing and cool you are, and your story is the place to do it. Think about all of the things you want your crush to know about you. Then, slowly incorporate this list into your snap stories. [4] X Research source For instance, you might snap yourself baking, playing your guitar, hanging out with friends, going hiking, or playing with your dog. It’s okay if you repeat some activities. It’s unlikely that he’ll see every story. Just rotate them out so you’re not snapping about the same thing several times in a row."

      "content": "Add a flirty caption to a cute selfie. A flirty caption might help him think of you as more than just a friend. Pick a short, vague caption that suggests you’re thinking about someone special. Just keep in mind that it may get attention from more than just your crush. Here are some examples: “Tired of that single life” “Wondering if my crush thinks about me”"

      "content": "Get his attention with an inside joke or follow-up to a conversation. Subtly let your crush know you’re thinking about him by referencing something only he will understand. Use an inside joke that you share or play off the last conversation you had with him. Take a photo or write a caption that includes a hint just for him. As an example, let’s say you both like The Office and have an inside joke of doing Jim’s shrug to the camera. You could video snap yourself doing the classic shrug. If your last conversation was about the newest superhero movie, you might snap your reaction to the movie or a pic of you wearing a shirt that features your favorite superhero."

Then, incorporate them into your Snapchat stories. Try to use things that you’re mutually interested in to have an engaging conversation about it. Here are some ideas: Take a photo of yourself with your dog if your crush likes dogs. Snap yourself at a sporting event you know they like. Show off your musical instrument if they like music. Snap yourself reading if they’re into books."

      "content": "Limit yourself to sending 1 snap at a time. You might be tempted to send your crush several chats in a row. However, it might feel overwhelming for him if he gets a bunch of snaps at once. Wait for him to reply to a snap before you send another one."

      "content": "Send him a unique snap that’s different from your story. You may be tempted to send him your story directly to make sure he saw it. However, he might feel confused if you send him a direct snap that’s the same as your story. For example, let’s say your story is about you trying a new restaurant. You might send him a snap of just the dessert with a caption that reads, “I think you would like this!”"

If he responds, keep the conversation going by asking follow-up questions and answering any questions he might have. You might send a video to playfully suggest you want to see more of him or to show him how much fun you're having at the moment. You might send a comment without a picture if you want to ask a question or want to continue a conversation that started with an exchange of snaps."

To make things easier, go to the \"Discover\" section and look for an article that you know will interest him. It could be related to something he's studied at school or an interest he has. Click the button to send him the article with a short comment telling him why. Hopefully, he'll respond back. For example, you might send him an article about his favorite sports team with a comment that says, \"Didn't know if you've seen this yet.\" Similarly, let's say you see an article about his favorite band releasing a new single. You might send it over with a note that says, \"A new song? What did you think of it?\" If he recently gave a presentation about global warming, you might send an article about climate change with a comment that says, \"This made me think of your presentation\""

Once you and the guy have been chatting back and forth for a bit, you might want to take the conversation to the real world. When you're ready, offer him your number and suggest that he texts you. As another option, you might just invite him to hang out in person. If you're sending your number, you might say, \"I'm going to be off Wi-Fi for a few hours, so text will work better if you want a faster reply,\" or \"Here's my number if you want to switch to text.\" If you want to hang out, you might say, \"I'm going to grab a burger after school tomorrow. Wanna go?\" or \"My friend's band is playing at the coffee shop tomorrow. Wanna come and keep me company?\" Don’t exchange snaps all day every day, especially on the early stage of your relationship. It is only on the dates that you can really get to know each other. [7] X Expert Source Hardy Jean Dating Coach Expert Interview. 10 June 2022.
