Reference the following chart for any baking or cooking recipes that are created by US-based chefs. [1] X Research source If you live in America, your measuring tools are likely set to US standards. If you live in the UK, however, your measuring tools are probably Imperial. Imperial measuring tools are a little bit bigger than US tools—the difference isn’t very noticeable in small amounts, but can make a big difference with larger measurements (like quarts or gallons).
