      "content": "Pull out the old tape roll if you’re refilling the tape dispenser. Lay your packing tape dispenser flat on a table with the wheel facing up. Then, hold down the dispenser with one hand and use your other to grab the underside of the tape. Simply pull up on the tape to remove it from the wheel. [1] X Research source For dispensers without a handle : Look for the thin plastic clasp inside the roll. Place your hands on either side of the clasp and pull up to separate the roll into 2 halves. Then, pull out the old tape. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Locate the end of your roll of tape . On most new rolls of tape, the end is clearly marked with a piece of paper. If you’re loading a used roll of tape, run a fingernail back and forth around the tape to feel for a slight ridge. Then, pull out ¼ to ½ inches (0.6-1.3 cm) of tape and fold it back under itself to create a tab that marks the end of the roll. [3] X Research source Alternatively, place a toothpick, paperclip, sticky note, or another small, flat object at the end of the tape to clearly mark the end."

      "content": "Push the tape onto the wheel with the sticky side facing down. Lay the dispenser down on a flat, stable surface. Then, simply push the roll of tape onto the wheel, making sure the sticky side faces down and the non-adhesive side faces up. Roll the tape so the end of the roll faces the roller and cutting blade. [4] X Research source For dispensers without a handle : Pull apart the thin plastic clasp inside the roll to separate the dispenser into 2 halves. Spread the 2 halves apart, slide the tape roll inside, then push the clasp back together. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread the end of the tape between the roller and the metal gate.",
      "content": "Thread the end of the tape between the roller and the metal gate. On most packing tape dispensers, there is a piece that rolls below the serrated blade. Below the roller is a metal gate or flap that covers the gap between the roller. Just push down on the gate to open the gap and pull the tape through it. [6] X Research source If the metal gate doesn’t automatically close, push it back up to cover the gap again and hold the tape in place. Double-check that the sticky part of the tape faces down. If it doesn’t, take the tape off the wheel and flip it over. Otherwise, the tape will stick to the roller. For dispensers without a handle : Most dispensers simply have 2 prongs on either side of the dispenser just below the serrated blade. Just thread the tape between the prongs and the blade."

      "title": "Lift the tape up so it reaches the edges of the serrated blade.",
      "content": "Lift the tape up so it reaches the edges of the serrated blade. Simply pull the tape up and over the roller towards the metal edges of the serrated blade above it. Keep pulling the tape so it’s about 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) above the blade. Then, push the tape down against the plastic or metal sheet above the blade to make a neat, even cut. [7] X Research source Keep the end of the tape out so it dangles between the roller and the blade. Some tape dispensers do not have a sheet above the blade. In this case, simply press the tape down against the blade to cut it. The serrated blade is sharp, so keep your fingers away from it. When you’re not using the tape dispenser, put the plastic protector over the metal blade."

      "content": "Test the dispenser’s tension by rolling out a small section of tape. To practice using your tape dispenser, push the dispenser onto the side of a box with the blade facing the cardboard. Then, pull the dispenser across the box to unwind the tape. When you’re ready to cut it, lift the handle of the dispenser up to press the tape against the plastic or metal sheet above the blade. [8] X Research source Use an old cardboard box to get the hang of using the dispenser and to make any tension adjustments."

      "content": "Tighten the dial on the wheel clockwise if the tape comes out too fast. Look for the knob or dial in the middle of the wheel; this adjusts the tension of the dispenser. If the tension isn’t tight enough, the tape might unravel quickly and loosely stick to your boxes. So, just turn the dial clockwise, or to the right, to tighten the tension. [9] X Research source If the tension dial is too loose, you might also use more tape than you need. Most tape dispensers without a handle do not have an adjustment knob."

      "content": "Loosen the nut counterclockwise if the tape is too tight to unwind. If you have to pull really hard to get the tape to unravel from the dispenser, the dial’s tension might be too tight. Just twist the dial in the middle of the wheel counterclockwise, or to the left, to loosen it and relieve the tension. [10] X Research source Too much tension might also cause the tape to roll unevenly over your box. Keep tightening and loosening the dial until the tape rolls smoothly and easily from the dispenser."
