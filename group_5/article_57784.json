Millennials often use this term in a humorous way to poke fun at themselves for successfully completing adult tasks, like calling the doctor’s office to make an appointment, or setting up auto-pay so all their bills get paid on time. [1] X Research source The term may also be a nod to the fact that members of the millennial generation tend to reach adult milestones (such as having children or getting married) a bit later in life than earlier generations did. [2] X Research source “I wanted to go out and have fun, but I spent the whole weekend doing laundry, grocery shopping, and cleaning the apartment before the work week. Adulting is so hard!” “I’ve totally been adulting lately. I started meal prepping, so I have home cooked food for dinner every night of the week. No more frozen meals or takeout for me!”"
