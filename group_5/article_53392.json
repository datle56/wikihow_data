      "content": "Pull your hair into a simple half ponytail for an easy look. Brush your hair out to detangle straight hair or finger-comb curly hair to get rid of any knots. Section off the top half of your hair by starting right above your ears and pulling all of the hair up to the crown of your head. Make sure both sides are even – the tail end of a rat tail comb can help you achieve a straight part. Secure the half ponytail at the base with a clear hair elastic. [1] X Research source For a sleek look, pull the half ponytail up and secure it firmly. For a messy, natural vibe, gather and secure the top half of your hair loosely. Pull down a few face-framing tendrils to soften the look even more. You can accomplish this look with chin-length, medium, and long hair."

      "content": "Twist your hair into a messy half bun for a quick, cute style. Section off the top half of your hair and hold it securely at your crown with one hand. Twist the hair loosely into a bun and twist an elastic around the bun to hold it in place. Then, use bobby pins to shape and neaten the topknot in the front and back. Finish the look with a light misting of hairspray. [2] X Research source For more volume and texture, use a texturing spray at the roots before sectioning the hair. You can also tease the hair gently at the sides to create more volume and a messier look. Create this look if you have medium to long hair."

      "content": "Try tousled half-up basic braids for a boho vibe. Section off your hair on one side by gathering hair from the top of your ears to your temples. Loosely braid the section of hair to the end and secure it at the back of your head with bobby pins or a barrette. Be sure to tuck the ends so they're hidden. Then, do the same thing for the other side. Spritz the look with hairspray. You can also drape the braids loosely and secure them right above the nape of your neck for a softer style. Pull down face-framing tendrils and tease gently at the crown if you want to add some volume. Weave flowers or greenery into your braids to create the ultimate boho look. You'll need medium to long hair for this style."

      "content": "Secure a tiny half ponytail high on your crown for a flirty style. Using a teasing brush or a fine-toothed comb, tease your hair at the crown to create volume. Then, place your thumbs at your temples and pull them to the back of your head to section off the top quarter of your hair. Gather the hair at the top of your head in a ponytail and loosely secure it with a clear elastic. Let the hair in the ponytail hang softly around your head for a super cute, voluminous look. [3] X Research source Tease the lengths of the ponytail and the rest of your hair lightly for more volume. Create this look with chin-length, medium, or long hair."

      "content": "Create a loosely twisted or braided halo for a natural look. Grab the hair from the top of your ears to your temples on each side to create 2 sections. For twists, rotate each section of hair loosely and pin them in place or use a barrette to secure the twists at the back of your head. For braids, separate each of the 2 sections into three pieces, then braid. Use a pin or a barrette to pin the braids in place or secure them at the back of your head. Let the ends of the twists or braids hang down loosely in the back with the rest of your hair. [4] X Research source Secure the twists lower down on the back of your head to create an even softer look. Tease the hair at the crown and on the sides and spritz hairspray over your style to lock it in place. Pulling down face-framing tendrils will soften the look even more. You can achieve this look with chin-length, medium, and long hair."

      "content": "Create half double French braids for a polished look. Curl your hair into loose waves unless you already have curly hair. Section off the top part of your hair, starting at the top of your ears. Then, split the top section in half down the middle. French braid each side, stopping when you reach the back of your head so the rest of the hair hangs loose. Secure each braid individually with a clear elastic at the back of your head. [5] X Research source This style looks great with curly or wavy hair, which tends to look more voluminous than straight hair. You can make the French braids tight for a sleeker look or loose for a softer look. This style works best for medium to long hair."

      "content": "Style a half-twist fishtail braid for an elegant look. Curl your hair loosely for soft, pretty volume. Grab the hair on one side from the top of your ears to your temples, twist it to the back of your head, and pin it temporarily in place. Then, twist the other side the same way, unpin the first side, and secure the twists at the back of your head with a clear elastic. The hair starting at the elastic will be hanging loosely. Gather that loose hair, create a fishtail braid, and secure it at the end with another elastic. [6] X Research source Pull the twists and fishtail braid gently to loosen the hair if you want a softer, more “undone” look. If using a heated tool, be sure to apply a heat protectant product to your hair before curling. Create this look with medium to long hair."

      "content": "Make a sleek half bun for a put-together style. Place your thumbs right above your ears and pull them to the back of your head until they meet to gather the top half of your hair. Hold the hair securely with one hand and use your free hand to smooth down the front and top so that it looks sleek and flat. Twist the hair into a bun and twist a clear elastic around the bun to hold it in place. Use bobby pins to shape and neaten the bun and to hide the elastic, if needed. [7] X Research source If you have very thick hair, you’d likely need to secure your hair in a ponytail with an elastic first, and then twist the hair into a bun, followed by another elastic. Mist your style with hairspray to keep it in place all day. Apply smoothing serum to your hair before pulling it into a bun for the smoothest look. Achieve this style with medium to long hair."
