      "content": "Poor AirPods sound quality in Zoom is a common complaint. When you pair your AirPods with Windows, Windows creates two devices—one for Headphones mode, and one for Headset mode. The Headphones or Stereo option supports stereo audio and sounds great, but doesn't allow you to use the microphone built in to your AirPods. The Headset (or Hands-Free AG Audio ) option does let you use your AirPods mic, but the audio quality is poor—it's actually \"telephone\" quality. This is a limitation of Bluetooth on Windows, unfortunately. The best workaround is to use your AirPods in Headphones mode and using your computer or webcam's built-in microphone for speaking. We'll show you how to set this up."

There are two options to choose from, and each has pros and cons: The Headset (or Hands-Free AG Audio ) option allows you to use the microphone built in to your AirPods. The drawback is that the audio quality for this mode is \"telephone quality,\" which most people think sounds really bad compared to stereo quality. The Headphones or Stereo option will sound great, but you'll need to use your computer or webcam's built-in microphone instead of the one in your AirPods. This is the best option for good sound quality, but it means you'll need to stay at your computer when you want to talk.
