      "content": "Start with a title or description of the map. Google Maps may not necessarily give you a specific title for the map, so you'll typically have to make this up on your own. The title should be descriptive of what the map shows. Place a period after your title. Location example: Map of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Route example: Directions for Driving from Nashville, TN to Santa Rosa Beach, FL."

Place a comma after the name of the source, then provide the year the map was produced. Place a comma after the year.

Rather than copying this URL, simply use the site's root URL. The reader can search for the specific content on their own. Place a period after the URL.

MLA in-text citations are based on the first element listed in the entry in your \"Works Cited.\" Typically, this is the author's name. In this case, it will be a title or description of the map you produced with Google Maps. Use the first few words of that title, in quotation marks, to direct your readers to the entry in your \"Works Cited.\" [3] X Research source Example: (\"Directions for Driving\")"

Instead, type an adequate description of the map. Put your description in square brackets to indicate that it is a description, not a title. Use sentence-case, capitalizing only the first word and any proper nouns in your description. Place a period outside the closing bracket. [6] X Research source Example: Google (n.d.).

The libraries at the University of Texas, Arlington have a different citation method for Google Maps that places the description first and uses the date you produced the map as the publishing date. Present this alternative to your instructor or supervisor and see which one they prefer. Example: [Google Maps directions for driving from Nashville, TN to Santa Rosa Beach, FL]. (23 August 2018).

Alternatively, you could also use a shortened version of the title or description in your parenthetical.

However, it's a good idea to ask your instructor or supervisor if they would prefer a shortened URL, to keep it from junking up your references. Place a period at the end of the URL to close your citation.
