Take turns grabbing 1 domino from the middle of the table and adding it to your hand. Stand your dominoes up in front of you so only you can see them. Move the leftover tiles to the side to form the “chicken yard.” [2] X Research source Depending on the number of players, each person should have: 21 dominoes in a 2-player game 14 dominoes in a 3-player-game 10 dominoes for a 4-player game 8 dominoes for a 5-player game 7 dominoes for a 6-player game"

That player goes first by setting the domino in the middle of the table immediately. [3] X Research source If no one has the highest double domino, take turns drawing dominoes from the chicken yard. As soon as someone draws the double domino, they play it face-up in the middle of the table to start the game."

Whenever you play a double domino, lay it so the long edge is against the matching short end of a domino already on the table. Say “Chickie,” followed by the number on the domino so players know what you set down. Players can only play a domino that has a matching side to the chicken foot until 3 more dominoes are connecting to it. [7] X Research source When you play dominoes to a double, place 1 sticking straight out from the long side and 2 diagonally at the corners so it looks like a chicken’s foot. Even if players have dominoes that can be played somewhere else, they have to wait until the chicken foot is finished. Try playing a double when someone only has 1 domino left in their hand so they’re less likely to go out on their turn."
