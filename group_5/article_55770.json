You get to specifically curate all the items in your capsule wardrobe so you can combine them into a variety of outfits. While that number of items you keep isn’t a hard limit, it helps limit your options so you don’t spend as much time choosing what to wear. You can either put your other clothes in storage for the time being or donate them if you want to be minimalistic.

      "content": "Include 2–4 blazers or cardigans for layered looks. If you’re aiming for a chic or professional look, throw on a blazer or sweater to make your outfit look even more complete. Choose a few neutral colors or accent pieces and see how well they match with the other tops you’ve picked out for your wardrobe. Save about 2–4 options so you can mix it up every day and create new looks on the fly. [4] X Research source If you live in a colder area, save room for 1–2 jackets or coats in your wardrobe for additional layering and warmth. [5] X Research source A cardigan over a T-shirt works well for a chilly summer night or a brisk winter day. Wear a bright blazer over a neutral-colored blouse for a professional look that makes you stand out."

      "content": "Try to add in 6 different bottoms. You can get a lot of mileage out of your tops just by changing the bottoms you’re wearing. For example, a T-shirt can pair well with some classic jeans for a casual style, or you can make it a little more fashionable by tucking it into a pencil skirt. Choose bottoms that make you feel the most confident and fit your body. Even with just 5 or 6 different bottoms, you can get a variety of looks.

Keep anything that you normally wear underneath your main outfits in a separate drawer and feel free to keep as many pieces as you feel comfortable having. Plain white T-shirts, tank tops, or cami tops can also be considered undergarments if you only wear them under your clothes. If you wear them on their own as an outfit, then you should include them in your count."

You won’t wear sleepwear, workout attire, and upscale outfits as regularly, but you should still keep them in your closet. Leave these options out of your capsule wardrobe, but make sure you only wear them while you’re doing the activity that they’re intended for. If you end up wearing yoga pants or sweatpants while you run errands rather than when you’re relaxing or working out, then you should count it as one of the pieces in your wardrobe.

As you’re going through your closet, try your clothes on and check yourself out in the mirror. If the clothes fit you snugly but not too tight and you think you look good wearing them, then keep them for your wardrobe. Keep in mind what types of activities you do every day when you’re picking your clothes. For example, if you work in an office, you’ll need more dressier options, like blouses and button-ups, than leisurewear."

      "content": "Choose high-quality materials that can take regular wear and tear. You’ll be cycling through the same clothes throughout the season, so low-quality fast-fashion styles that only last for a season won’t hold up very well. Try to stick with sustainable, natural fabrics, like cotton or wool, rather than synthetics like polyester or rayon. Pay close attention to the stitching in the fabric too since loose threads, crooked seams, and messy hems could be signs that the garments are of lower quality. [10] X Research source Many fast-fashion items are cheap and trendy while higher-quality items will be a little more pricey. Focus on the quality of your garments rather than the quantity."

      "content": "Opt for neutral colors so you can mix and match outfits easier. Since you won’t have as many options to choose from when you’re selecting outfits, most of the clothes in your wardrobe need to match or complement one another. Try to keep the main clothes in your wardrobe simple colors, such as black, white, grey, beige, and khaki. That way, you can pretty much wear any combination of clothes and still look stylish. [12] X Research source Other neutral options include cream, dark brown, and dark blue denim."

Even though you want most of your items to follow a similar color palette, wearing something bright makes your outfit stand out and feels a little less repetitive. Colors like yellows, reds, oranges, and light blues work really well, but choose whatever makes you feel the most confident. [13] X Research source"

Instead, think about how versatile the items you already own could be when you pair them with a different piece of clothing. It’s alright if you still have some fast-fashion pieces that you want to include, but avoid filling your capsule wardrobe with them entirely. Try to pair your favorite items in fun and interesting ways so you can save your money to upgrade to higher-quality items later on. [14] X Research source For example, you can style a T-shirt by layering a jacket over it, tucking it into a skirt, or wearing it with a pair of pants."

If you live somewhere that goes through all 4 seasons, then you can definitely make 4 different capsule wardrobes. At the end of the season, go through your wardrobe and see if there are any pieces you want to carry over into the next season. Store any clothes that you don’t plan on wearing in a tote bin or under your bed so they’re not taking up space in your closet before adding in your other pieces. [15] X Research source For example, if you’re transitioning from winter to summer, you may put all your sweaters and thick pants in storage to make room for short-sleeved blouses and shorts."

It can be really easy to get caught up in the latest fashion trends and buy the hot new items, but capsule wardrobes help you appreciate what you already have.
