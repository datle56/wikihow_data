      "content": "Add concealer to your blemishes but not your under eyes. Highlighting involves putting concealer underneath your eyes. Add your normal shade of concealer to blemishes on your cheeks, forehead, and nose, but don’t cover your under eyes. Multiple layers of concealer under your eyes can look unnatural and cause creasing. [2] X Research source Don’t go too heavy on the concealer, since you’ll be adding more later. Try not to mix powders and liquids. If you are using a powder contour, use a powder concealer. If you are using a liquid contour, use a liquid concealer."
