      "content": "Disconnect your Xbox 360 from all input and output sources. Your console should be completely free of any wires or attachments, including external storage, HDMI/audio cables, and the charging cable. If there is a disk in the console, eject it and place it somewhere safe before disconnecting your console."

      "content": "Pry off the faceplate. Insert your finger into the USB port section, which is to the right of the power button, and pull the faceplate toward you. You can be relatively firm while doing this—the Xbox 360 doesn't have fragile, touch-sensitive electronics behind the faceplate like later models do."

      "title": "Release the end grilles.",
      "content": "Release the end grilles. These are the grey lattices on the left and right ends of the Xbox 360 case. You can pry loose the grilles in one of two ways: Poke a large, bent paperclip through each of the holes in the top row of ventilation spaces on the Xbox 360's casing, prying up each time. This will unhook the clips holding the grille. Insert a flathead screwdriver into the space where the grille meets the console case, then work the screwdriver around the grille, prying up as you go. This is less time-consuming than the above method, but runs the risk of breaking the clips that hold the grille in place. If you have a hard drive on your Xbox 360, first remove it."

There are four clips on the front of your Xbox 360 that hold the top half and the bottom half of the case together; pull the top of a clip toward you while holding the bottom of the clip to release them. These clips are in the following locations: One on either side of the disk tray One to the right of the power button One on the far-right side of the front of the Xbox 360"

Place your hand inside the space on the right where the grille used to be and apply upward and downward pressure to the connected halves of the casing while inserting the flathead screwdriver into the small slots on the back. In total, there are seven small slots along the back of the console."

Use your Torx screwdriver for this; if you see a screw that won't fit your screwdriver, don't try to unscrew it—it isn't necessary for disassembly. There are six total screws in the metal part of the case that you'll need to remove: Two on the right side Two on the left side One in each of the indented circles in the middle Make sure you place the screws in a plastic bag or a similarly safe place."
