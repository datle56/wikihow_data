      "content": "A glitch can be preventing your router from working properly. Restarting it can help. To power cycle your router, unplug it from the power source for about 1 minute, then plug it back in. If you have a separate modem, disconnect all cables from both the modem and router, wait a full minute, then plug everything back in. [1] X Research source *Rule out router/modem compatibility (if they are separate) by unplugging both of them, waiting a few minutes, then only plugging in the modem. Once the lights on your modem aren't blinking anymore, plug in your router and wait about 10 minutes to see if an orange light is blinking. If the light is blinking, you most likely have an incompatible pair of devices and should contact your ISP."

      "content": "Your router light also flashes orange when it's updating. If your router is set to update its firmware automatically, the light will flash orange during the update process, and the router will reboot itself. It might take around 15 minutes for the update to start and finish. If you haven't updated it recently, you'll want to check if there are updates. Although these are usually automatic, you can also log into your router's admin dashboard , go to Maintenance > Router Upgrade > Check . [2] X Research source"
