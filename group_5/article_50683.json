      "content": "Always allow your opponent to attack first. If you are seen, you can claim you were defending yourself. If the authorities believe you, your opponent will you be the one who gets in trouble. If your opponent refuses to strike first, just walk away. Expect to be in serious trouble if you hurt your opponent, even when they started it. Many schools have a zero-tolerance policy on violence, and will suspend or expel both kids involved in a fight."

      "title": "Remember that when you are on school property, laws are stricter.",
      "content": "Remember that when you are on school property, laws are stricter. You aren't protected by the same constitutional rights that normally apply when you are at home. Some schools call the police for even the most minor fights or other public displays of anger like punching lockers or throwing things. In some states, the same laws apply on or off school grounds, if there is proof that the fight began at school. You will be in trouble with the school, and the police as well."

      "title": "Avoid bringing anything to school that even looks like a weapon.",
      "content": "Avoid bringing anything to school that even looks like a weapon. When weapons are involved, violence escalates immediately and can quickly get of control. Every year, at least 7 percent of American high school students are threatened or injured by another student carrying a weapon. Because of this, laws about guns and other weapons have become increasingly strict over the years. Federal law requires public schools to expel any student who brings a firearm to school for at least one year. [1] X Research source More than half the students who are expelled in the US each year were expelled for bringing a weapon to school. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Think about witnesses.",
      "content": "Think about witnesses. Be sure to have some of your friends around to back up your side of the story. Never get drawn into a fight if the only witnesses are your opponent's friends. Avoid places where a teacher is likely to see you. Appoint a lookout to let you know if someone is coming."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be aware of your surroundings.",
      "content": "Be aware of your surroundings. You can avoid a lot of trouble if you only hang out with your friends in open, well lit areas where plenty of people are likely to walk by. Notice which places bullies or gangs are most likely to hang out – like a certain park, bathroom, or parking lot – so you can avoid them. Avoid taking shortcut through dark or isolated areas, especially by yourself. Be sure your parents and friends know your usual schedule, so if you are attacked someone will notice that you aren't where you're supposed to be. Don't be distracted by your phone if you are walking alone, and don't wear headphones. Be alert to all the sights and sounds around you."

      "title": "Avoid dangerous situations.",
      "content": "Avoid dangerous situations. In one study, nearly 20 percent of students reported being bullied at school. Avoiding trouble doesn't mean you are weak, it just means you are smart. Avoiding a fight in the first place is the best way to avoid getting into trouble. Try to avoid being in situations where you will be alone with a bully – walk home with a friend, and eat lunch with a group. [3] X Research source Don't take the bait. Sometimes if you ignore a bully, they will get bored and leave you alone. It's usually best to speak up and answer a bully. If a bully thinks you are weak, he or she will try to take advantage of it by being even more aggressive."

    {
      "title": "Try to calm down your opponent.",
      "content": "Try to calm down your opponent. If someone is threatening you with violence, they are probably already on edge and pumped full of adrenaline. Fighting back might make them even angrier, which will make the situation even worse. Learn to control your own temper, so you won't lose control when you feel threatened. Take deep breaths to help you relax. If you find yourself alone with a violent person, sometimes it helps to just agree with them until they calm down. You don't have to actually agree with them – just tell them what they want to hear. If someone is taunting you, distract them by saying something like, “Is that the bell?” or “I think that was my phone.” Then calmly walk away. If a bully is being really persistent and won't let you leave, tell them you will meet them after school. You don't need to actually fight them, you are just trying to buy yourself some time."

    {
      "title": "Give them what they want.",
      "content": "Give them what they want. In some situations, it's best to just hand over your homework or lunch money to avoid being hurt. Experts almost always recommend giving a mugger your wallet right away, to avoid a violent situation. Tell your teacher or a someone in the office what happened, so they know you actually did your homework. Tell a parent or guardian when this happens, so they can make sure it doesn't happen again."

    {
      "title": "Have a failsafe response ready.",
      "content": "Have a failsafe response ready. To stay out of trouble, plan in advance how you will handle a confrontation if it happens. When a bully is screaming at you, you're less likely to freeze up and go blank if you already know exactly what you are going to say. [4] X Research source Interrupt them. Say something like, “Sorry, I need to make a phone call,” and walk away before they can stop you. Offer to continue the conversation after class – they may have forgotten you and moved on to something else by then. If you know you can pull it off, smile and act amused. The last thing a bully wants is to be embarrassed in front of his friends."

    {
      "title": "Take control of the conversation.",
      "content": "Take control of the conversation. You can avoid trouble at school if you learn to take charge of a dangerous situation before it gets out of control. You may be able to calm your opponent down if you can figure out their underlying motive for harassing you. In some cases, you may be able to find another way to work things out that doesn't involve fighting. [5] X Research source Every time the bully asks a question, reply by asking her to explain herself. (“Why do you believe that?” or “What makes you think I did that?”) Be careful not to lose your temper or come across as sarcastic, as this will only make them angrier."

    {
      "title": "Talk to someone.",
      "content": "Talk to someone. If you're being bullied, you are not alone. Talk to your friends about the problem, and get their advice. You'll probably find that many of them have had to deal with the same thing in the past. You can avoid getting into trouble at school by asking them what they did to resolve the situation. One out of every 5 high school students in the US reported being bullied at school in 2013, and 1 in every 6 has been bullied online. Five percent of US students missed a day or more of school because they did not feel safe from a bully."

    {
      "title": "Report them.",
      "content": "Report them. In instances where bullying may lead to physical harm, always tell a parent or a teacher. Bullying is a serious problem – there have been numerous occasions where bullying has resulted in severe injury and even death. You can avoid getting into trouble if the school knows you aren't the one causing the problem. [6] X Research source Allowing a bully to get away with it will just encourage them to become more violent. Parents and teachers will be able to come up with a plan to fix the problem without letting the bully know that you are the one who told on them."

    {
      "title": "Know how to get to cover.",
      "content": "Know how to get to cover. Cover can be anything that offers you momentary safety. Be aware of your surroundings, and don't allow yourself to be boxed into a corner. Cover can be distance – if you can remove yourself from the situation, your attacker can't get to you. Plan your escape route in advance. Cover can also be a physical barrier, like getting to a bathroom or supply closet and locking your attacker out."

    {
      "title": "Learn basic self defense moves.",
      "content": "Learn basic self defense moves. The best way to avoid getting into trouble is to remove yourself from a fight before it happens. But if you are attacked by a violent person and can't get away, you will need to defend yourself as best you can. You can't really learn these moves without practicing them, so sign up for self defense classes before trying them in person. [7] X Research source Make a fist and swing upward, hitting your opponent's nose squarely with the heel of your hand. The upward movement carries a lot of force, and is easier to pull off than a boxing-style punch. Kick your attacker's knee by using your foot in a horizontal stomping motion. Be sure to take aim first, and strike suddenly before they expect it. Use the instep of your foot or your knee with as much force as possible to connect with your opponent's groin with an swift, upward motion. Alternate your strikes between face and body – when your opponent goes to protect one vulnerable area, they will leave another area open to attack."

    {
      "title": "Avoid being overconfident.",
      "content": "Avoid being overconfident. Even if you have been taking self defense classes and doing well, never assume you will win the fight. There are too many things that can go wrong, and you can never predict the outcome. If you let the situation get out of control, you are far more likely to get caught and get into trouble. If you underestimate your opponent he or she may catch you off-guard, and hurt you. You are far more likely to get caught if you are reckless – you won't pay enough attention to your surroundings and witnesses."
