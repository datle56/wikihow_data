Every angle has an initial side, which is the ray that falls on the x-axis, and a terminal side, which is the angle’s other ray. [1] X Research source The reference angle is the small angle formed by a given angle’s terminal side and the x-axis. [2] X Research source Note : Reference angles are always positive and less than or equal to 90°. A ray is a straight line with 1 endpoint."

The coordinate plane, or the intersection between the x-axis and y-axis, is split into 4 quadrants that span from 0° to 360° (or 0 to 2𝛑, if the angle is in radians). Look at the angle given to you and determine which quadrant it lies in based on its value. [3] X Research source Quadrant 1 : Angles are between 0° to 90° or 0 to 𝛑/2. Quadrant 2 : Angles are between 90° to 180° or 𝛑/2 to 𝛑. Quadrant 3 : Angles are between 180° to 270° or 𝛑 to 3𝛑/2. Quadrant 4 : Angles are between 270° to 360° or 3𝛑/2 to 2𝛑.

[4] X Research source For example , find the reference angle θ 1 {\\displaystyle {\\theta }^{1}} if your given angle is θ {\\displaystyle {\\theta }} = 40°. 40° is in the first quadrant, so the reference angle θ 1 {\\displaystyle {\\theta }^{1}} is also 40°."

Sometimes, you have to find the reference angle for a given angle that’s less than 0 or greater than 360° (if it’s in radians, less than 0 or greater than 2𝛑). Finding the reference angle is still possible; you just first have to find its corresponding angle that’s between 0° and 360° (or between 0 and 2𝛑, if the angle is in radians). [8] X Research source If the angle is negative , keep adding 360° until it is between 0° and 360°. If the angle is in radians, keep adding 2𝛑 until it is between 0 and 2𝛑. If the angle is greater than 360° , keep subtracting 360° until it is between 0° and 360°. If the angle is in radians, subtract 2𝛑 until it is between 0 and 2𝛑. For example : If the given angle is -210°, add 360°. -210° + 360° = 150°. If the given angle is 545°, subtract 360°. 545° - 360° = 185°. If the given angle is -11𝛑/6, add 2𝛑. -11𝛑/6 + 12𝛑/6 = 𝛑/6."

When finding the sine, cosine, tangent, or other trigonometric function of an angle, the value is the same for the given angle and the reference angle. This comes in handy when the given angle is an uncommon angle but the reference angle is an angle you already know the answer to, like 30° or 45°. [11] X Research source For instance, you might be asked to find the value of sine 210°. You likely don’t know the answer off the top of your head, but you can easily determine that the reference angle of 210° is 30°. Sine 30° is ½, so sine 210° is -½. Note : The sine might be different for the given and reference angle. Each trig function is positive or negative, depending on the quadrant the angle is in: Quadrant 1 : All functions are positive. Quadrant 2 : Only sine is positive. Quadrant 3 : Only tangent is positive. Quadrant 4 : Only cosine is positive."
