      "title": "Ask your friend a “He’s a ten but…” question.",
      "content": "Ask your friend a “He’s a ten but…” question. This game is based on the 1 to 10 dating scale, where you rate a person based on their looks and overall attractiveness. When someone starts with the prompt “he’s a [insert number] but…” they follow it up with a trait or behavior that could make that person more or less attractive. “He’s a 6 but he eats pizza with a knife and fork.” “He’s a 10 but he screams at his parents.” “He’s a 2 but he always opens the door for you.” If “he” doesn’t fit your friend group, you can change the pronouns to whatever you’d like. All of these prompts can easily be turned into “she’s a 10 but” or “they’re a ten but” questions."

You: “He’s a 2 but he always celebrates your accomplishments.” Your friend: “I love that, he’s a 7.” You: “He’s a 5 but every gift he gives you is his favorite color.” Your friend: “He’s definitely a 3. He doesn’t sound very thoughtful at all.” You: “He’s a 10 but he’s absolutely obsessed with golf.” Your friend: “I don’t like golf, I’d say he’s a 4.”"

      "content": "Your friend asks you a question in return. The best part about this game is learning about how you and your friends would change someone’s attractiveness rating based on a random fact about them. Use questions from the list above or create your own to personalize them to your and your friends’ preferences. This game works best when you have 2 or more people—that way everyone can give their rating based on the trait, behavior, or scenario you give them.
