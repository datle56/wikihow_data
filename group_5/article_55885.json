      "title": "Go to the Honningbrew Meadery.",
      "content": "Go to the Honningbrew Meadery. After the Honningbrew Meadery has been poisoned during the first part of the “Dampened Spirits” quest, Sabjorn, the owner, will be arrested and a person named Mallus Maccius will be put in charge. Go to the Honningbrew Meadery by walking at least a minute directly south from the city of Whiterun. The Honningbrew Meadery is a large wooden house situated beside a river."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to Mallus Maccius.",
      "content": "Talk to Mallus Maccius. Enter the Meadery through its large main doors at the front and inside you’ll find the new owner, Mallus Maccius. He’s a pale-skinned man with long brown hair and shadowed eyes. Approach him and press the designated “Speak” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to talk to him. He will then say a short talk on what he will do with the meadery. Afterwards, he will give you Sabjorn’s dresser key."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter Sabjorn’s room.",
      "content": "Enter Sabjorn’s room. Enter the room just behind where Mallus Maccius is standing, and turn right to find a staircase that leads to the second floor of the meadery. Once you’re on the second floor, walk along the hallway and you’ll find a door at the end of it. Go through this door to find Sabjorn’s room. If you already reached this area without talking to Mallus Maccius first, you’ll find the door locked. The dresser key that Mallus gives to you unlocks this door to Sabjorn’s room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a letter inside the room.",
      "content": "Look for a letter inside the room. On the right side of the door you entered through you’ll find a wooden table. Approach the table to find some leftover food on a plate, some bottles of draught, and a letter on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discover Sabjorn’s silent partner.",
      "content": "Discover Sabjorn’s silent partner. Approach the table and press the designated “Read” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to read the letter. You’ll find that the letter came from Maven Black-Briar, which is Sabjorn’s silent partner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the letter.",
      "content": "Keep the letter. Once you’re done reading the letter, press the designated “Steal” button on your game controller as prompted on the game screen to add the letter on your item list. This will also complete this quest objective."
