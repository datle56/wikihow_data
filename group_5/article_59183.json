Then, disconnect the wires using the following steps: Remove the plate covering the wire connections on the bottom of the disposal using a screwdriver. Disconnect the exposed wires by untwisting the wire nuts. Re-cap the wires that hook back into the wall and set them aside for later."

Unlock it by turning the nut connecting it to the disposal with a wrench, pliers, or channel locks. [3] X Research source There’s often PVC glue holding this nut tight, so you may need to use a fair bit of force to unlock the pipe."

      "content": "Remove the garbage disposal with a hex key or screwdriver. Look at how the top of the disposal is connected to the drain. Locate the round hook openings sticking out of the mounting assembly holding it in place. Use a hex key, snap ring insert, or a flat-head screwdriver to pull those hook openings counterclockwise. Once it starts to loosen up, use your hands to fully unscrew the disposal and pull it down. [5] X Research source This is probably where you’ll need to use the most elbow grease. Forcing the hook openings counterclockwise can take a lot of energy. Make sure to hold the underside of the garbage disposal with your hand while removing it. They are very heavy! You can put a box under the disposal to keep it from falling down and denting the cabinet if you’d like."

If you’re installing a new disposal and it’s the same brand as the old one, leave the mounting ring where it is—you can reuse it. Otherwise, remove the mounting assembly by loosening the three mounting screws that hold the upper and lower rings together. Remove the ring that is in a groove on the sink sleeve and then remove the sink sleeve, flange, and fiber gasket. [6] X Research source The mounting assembly refers to the large ring around the underside of the sink’s drain that holds the garbage disposal up.

The rope must be long enough to go around the circumference of the drain, but it doesn’t need to be super thick. Place it around the lip of the drain and then set the drain into the sink opening. Press the drain down firmly and wipe away excess putty. [9] X Research source Unless you’re installing a brand new sink , use your old drain. Use a solid amount of force to compress the plumber’s putty and put the drain in place, but don’t put all of your weight on it. If you do, you could crack the rim of the sink or the countertop."

Make sure you turn the water off at the supply lines before you get started. Purchase the same garbage disposal you had before just to keep things simple.

Use straight pipes and a T-fitting to connect both drains into one line and route the drainpipes into the main drain. If there isn’t a second drain, connect the tailpiece to the side of the disposal and use a flexible length of PVC to hook up the p-trap underneath it. Then, run a pipe from the p-trap to the drainpipe in the wall. [18] X Research source So long as the p-trap drops below the drain pipe in the wall, you should be good. Dry fit the pieces together at first just so you have a sense for how the pipes go together. Connect the pipes using PVC glue on both the outside of the pipe and inside of the fitting. PVC glue will melt the material a little to give a strong weld."
