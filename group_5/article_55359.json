It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to pick one side or the other, but instead come to a nuanced conclusion between them. [1] X Research source For example, if two loved ones are fighting with each other, seeing a grey feather can mean you need to help them reconnect, instead of picking sides."

Freedom comes with responsibilities, which can sometimes make you feel trapped. If you’re feeling bogged down by your chores, think about why you have them. If you’re tired of constantly cleaning your home, think instead about the freedom that having a home comes with. Seeing a grey feather doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re experiencing freedom.
