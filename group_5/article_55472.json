      "content": "A good height for coat racks is 5 ft (1.5 m). However, you can hang a coat rack lower if you want it to be more easily reachable for people of all heights, such as kids. Just make sure it’s still high enough to keep your longest coats and jackets from touching the ground. [1] X Research source For example, in public places, coat racks are often 4 ft (1.2 m) high."

      "content": "On a wall near a door. An entryway wall near your front door is a great place! Or, hang a coat rack on a wall in your bedroom near the door, which could be a good option if you share your home and want to keep all your coats in your room. [2] X Research source If you don’t want to hang a coat rack on a wall, get some over-the-door hooks and slide them over the top edge of your bedroom door. This is a super simple way to add some hooks for hanging coats to your room!"

      "title": "Start by marking the location of the rack’s screw holes on the wall.",
      "content": "Start by marking the location of the rack’s screw holes on the wall. Measure the distance between the 2 holes on the coat rack using a tape measure. Measure the same distance apart on your wall where you want to hang the coat rack and make a small pencil mark at each end of the tape measure. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Screw the rack into wall studs if possible. Check whether there are studs behind the wall with a stud finder. Turn it on and move it over the wall where you’re hanging the coat rack. When it beeps, there is a stud behind the drywall there. Use a level to make sure the tape measure is horizontally level across your wall before you make the marks. Otherwise, your coat rack is going to be crooked! [5] X Research source Another way to mark the holes is to hold the coat rack against the wall where you want it, check that it’s level, then push a screw firmly through each screw hole into the wall to make small indentations where the screws go."

      "title": "Drill holes where the screws will go before you hang the coat rack.",
      "content": "Drill holes where the screws will go before you hang the coat rack. Choose a drill bit that’s slightly smaller in diameter than the coat rack’s mounting screws and attach it to an electric drill. Carefully drill straight into the wall where each mark you made for the screw holes is. [6] X Research source After you drill the first hole, line up the coat rack’s first hole with it and double-check that the second hole still lines up with your second mark."

      "content": "Screw the coat rack into the wall. If the screw holes have studs behind them, screw the coat rack directly into the studs. If the wall is just drywall, push drywall anchors into the holes first, then screw the coat rack into the anchors. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Screw it into drywall fasteners. Select drywall fasteners that are slightly bigger than the coat hook’s mounting screws and a drill bit that’s about the same size as the drywall fasteners. Hold the hook against the wall and make 2 marks where the mounting holes are. Drill a hole through the wall at each mark and push the drywall fasteners into the holes. Screw the hook into the drywall fastener with the mounting screw. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Use double-sided adhesive strips. Stick 2-3 double-sided adhesive strips at regular intervals on the backside of the coat rack. [9] X Research source Press the coat rack firmly against a wall or another flat surface and hold it there for at least 30 seconds. Let the adhesive set for at least 1 hour before using the coat rack. [10] X Research source For example, use heavy-duty 3M Command Strips for this. Keep in mind that this might not work if your coat rack is really heavy or if you use weak adhesive strips. Adhesive strip packaging usually states how much weight is recommended for the strips."

      "title": "Yes, they can.",
      "content": "Yes, they can. Even the least heavy-duty Command Hooks can hold at least 7.5 lb (3.4 kg). Most coats don’t weigh more than that, so you can go ahead and stick Command Hooks to your wall or another surface, such as the back of a door, to use as coat hooks! [11] X Research source Get brushed nickel Command Hooks for classier coat hooks."

      "content": "One idea is to make a hanging coat rack out of wooden hangers. Cut 1 wooden arm of each coat hanger off, just to 1 side of the hook. Screw the hangers to a wooden board with the cut sides flat against the board and the remaining arms facing upwards, so the hooks are facing downwards. Mount the board on any wall, just as you would a store-bought coat rack. [13] X Research source Feel free to turn the coat hangers in different directions to give your DIY coat rack a funky artistic look!"

      "content": "Another idea is to use a curtain rod and clip rings. Fasten the curtain rod’s mounting brackets to your wall wherever you want your coat rack to be. Slide some clip rings over the rod and place it into the mounting brackets on the wall. Then, clip your coats to the rings whenever you want to hang them up! [14] X Research source As an alternative to clip rings, hang S-shaped hardware hooks over the curtain rod and use them like regular coat hooks."
