[8] X Research source Garage door openers come with a few different colors for their “Learn” buttons—red, yellow, green, and purple. Keep in mind that over time, red buttons can look orange, and purple buttons may appear brown. [9] X Research source While current Chamberlain garage door remotes are compatible with nearly all doors produced after 1993, some older remotes may have more limited compatibility. If your garage door opener isn’t compatible with your remote, you may want to purchase a newer model ."
