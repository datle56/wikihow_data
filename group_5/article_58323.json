[1] X Research source You need at least four players to play Cards Against Humanity. There's no upper limit to how many people can play, but it's most fun with 6–8 players. If you don't already own Cards Against Humanity, you can find a deck here . You can also play the game online."

      "title": "Play the first black card.",
      "content": "Play the first black card. The official rules say that the \"person who most recently pooped\" is the first \"Card Czar.\" (This might give you an idea of what the game will be like.) If you prefer, the person with the next upcoming birthday can go first instead. That player starts the round by turning over the top card in the black \"questions\" stack. Read the card aloud and leave it face up on the table. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Have each other player choose a white answer card.",
      "content": "Have each other player choose a white answer card. The Card Czar waits while each other player chooses one card from their hand. The goal is to pick the funniest answer to the black question card, or the answer the Card Czar will like most. Put the selected white cards in a face down pile. [3] X Research source If the black card says \"Pick 2,\" choose two white cards from your hand. Keep them in the order the Czar should read them."

    {
      "title": "Shuffle",
      "content": "Shuffle and read aloud the answer cards. Now the Card Czar picks up the white answer cards and shuffles them, so no one knows who put down which card. Reread the black answer card, then read the white cards one by one, putting them face up on the table. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose the best answer.",
      "content": "Choose the best answer. The Card Czar chooses their favorite answer to the question. The player who played the winning card gets one \"Awesome Point.\" The easiest way to track points is to give the black question card to the winning player. [5] X Research source All players can talk while the Card Czar is deciding, and try to influence the decision. Set aside all the white cards from that round into a discard pile. The Card Czar's \"favorite\" card could be the funniest option, the one that makes the most sense to them, the one that's most appropriate for the category, and so on."

      "title": "Start the next round.",
      "content": "Start the next round. Each player draws back up to ten white cards. The person sitting to the Card Czar's left becomes the Czar for the next round, picking a new black card. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can appoint whoever won the last round as the new Czar. This doesn't work well if there's a newcomer in the group, since it's harder to win rounds if you don't know the Czar's style of humor."

      "title": "Play until you're sick of it.",
      "content": "Play until you're sick of it. This is a casual, non-competitive game, and people usually play until they get tired of it. If you want a more defined end point, play until one player gets five points (or 7–10 for a longer game). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins. [7] X Research source One fun way to end the game is to use the \"haiku\" black card for the final round. You don't need to find the actual card: it just says \"Make a haiku.\" The other players each choose three cards from their hand to use as an answer. Some players stop drawing new cards when they announce the end, but keep playing until they run out of cards. This leads to (even more) absurd nonsense answers. Remember: CaH is a \"party\" game, and the goal is to just have the funniest combinations of cards with friends."

      "content": "Dump your hands. The game tends to get less interesting when players are stuck with a bunch of cards they don't like. Some playgroups like to add one of these rules to prevent that situation: Anyone can spend a point to discard any number of cards and draw back up to ten. [9] X Research source Everyone can discard any number of cards and draw up to ten when the haiku card is played (before answering). The first player to reach 3 points wins. Deal out new hands to start the next game."

      "title": "Vote on the best answer.",
      "content": "Vote on the best answer. Instead of taking turns judging the answers, have everyone play an answer card every round. Players then vote on the winner. This works well if you are playing with strangers, who would have trouble choosing cards targeted for a specific person. Alternatively, if you want to avoid ties, take turns eliminating cards until only one is left."
