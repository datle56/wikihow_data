Choose who you want as your teammate or pick a player at random to pair up with for the rest of the game. Sit at a table so you’re across from your teammate. [1] X Research source One team is traditionally known as North and South , while the other team is East and West . Bridge may be a little complicated for young kids, so play with people who are at least 8 or older."

      "content": "Shuffle and deal 13 cards to each player. Choose a player at random to be the first dealer. Shuffle a deck of cards thoroughly and deal them out one at a time to all the players. Players can look at their own hands, but they can’t look at anyone else’s (even their teammates). [2] X Research source The cards in each suit from highest to lowest rank are Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2."

      "content": "Bid a suit and the number of tricks the team can win. The dealer gets the chance to make the opening bid for the game. The first bidder chooses a suit they want as the trump suit , which becomes the most powerful suit for the round. A trick is when each player plays a card from their hand, and there are 13 total tricks per round. A team is required to win 6 tricks during the round, so the bidder then says how many additional tricks they think their team will win. [3] X Research source Example: If a player bids Spades 2, they’re saying they think their team can win a total of 8 tricks if Spades are the trump suit. Players may also choose to bid No Trump , which means no suit will be the most powerful. Typically, it’s best to choose a trump suit that you’re long in, meaning you have 4 or more of that suit in your hand. We’ll cover more strategies later on."

      "content": "Make a bid higher than the last player or pass. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, the other players take turns placing bids going clockwise around the table. A legal bid either has to be a higher-ranked suit or a larger number of tricks. From highest to lowest rank, the suits are No Trump, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs. If a player does not want to bid, they can pass instead. [4] X Research source Example: If the first bidder opened with 3 Clubs, the next player must bid 3 Diamonds or higher. When you pass, you may still have an opportunity to come back in and make another bid. Instead of making a bid, a player can double the bid before them. This means they think their team can win with the bid suit and number, and they’ll earn double the points at the end of the round. After a bid is doubled, the next player may redouble to earn 4 times the points at the end of the round."

If players don’t have any cards in the lead suit, then they can play any other card they want from their hand. [8] X Research source Playing a trump card instead of the lead suit is known as ruffing . Playing a card that’s not the lead or trump suit is known as sluffing . If you’re the declarer, remember to choose a card from the dummy hand to add to each trick."

If no one played a trump card, then the highest card in the lead suit wins. The winning player takes all the cards from the trick and places them in a face-down pile in front of them. [9] X Research source Example: Trump is Diamonds. If the cards played were 10 of Clubs (lead), 9 of Clubs, Jack of Clubs, and 4 of Clubs, the player who put down the Jack is the winner. Example: Trump is Clubs. If the cards played were 4 of Diamonds (lead), Ace of diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, and 2 of Clubs, the 2 of Clubs would win because it’s the trump suit."

Typically, holding 15 or more HCP means you have a strong hand. If you only have 2 cards of a suit in your hand, it’s called a doubleton and adds 1 point to your HCP. If you only have 1 card of a suit, it’s considered a singleton and adds 2 points to the HCP. If you have no cards of a suit, it’s called a void and gives you 3 points on your HCP."
