You need to know the procedure for the state where you want to get a new license. Starting in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security implemented a phased roll-out of the REAL ID Act, including Enhanced Driver's Licenses. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source As a result of this law, some states have heightened the document requirements for issuance of driver's licenses.

Based on your conversation with the licensing agency and whether your state has moved to Enhanced Driver's licenses, you will need to gather the information needed to successfully change your name on your driver's license. You may not need all of these documents, but they are the most commonly requested ones. Order a certified copy of your birth certificate from the vital records office of the state where you were born. Expect to pay $15 to $25 for this document.

If you reverted to your birth name after the divorce, you will need a copy of the court order restoring your birth name. These documents will be on file with the court clerk in the county where you filed the marriage and divorce. You may have to pay a small copy fee and postage. [5] X Research source You will need proof of your home address. You can use bank statements, utility bills, mortgage or rental documents, and other official documents that show your name (married or single) and address. Finally, you will need to show proof of your citizenship. Your old unexpired driver's license and new Social Security card will usually be enough. If you were not born in this country, you will need to produce your Green Card showing that you are a permanent resident of the United States.

Most agencies operate on a first-come, first served basis, so arrive as close as you can to opening time. Bring all the required documents with you, including your updated Social Security card. In many smaller towns and counties, the agency may only be open on certain days. Call ahead if you are not sure about the operating hours. If you have a current, unexpired license, even if from another state, it is unlikely you will have to take a driving test or written test. That is completely at the discretion of the agency."

[9] X Research source If you have clothing or headdress standards for your religion, discuss it with the examiner. However, your face cannot be obscured. Some states don't mind a neutral natural smile, but will not allow a big grin. Ask the clerk what type of expression you should have. [10] X Research source"

Some agencies, especially those in smaller towns and counties will not be able to accept payment by credit or debit card. A few states will make and laminate your new license on-site. Most will mail it to you in about a week. In most states you can also update your registration to vote at the same time."
