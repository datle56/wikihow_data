      "title": "When a Taurus is serious about you, he'll probably want to be exclusive.",
      "content": "When a Taurus is serious about you, he'll probably want to be exclusive. If you feel comfortable, ask him directly whether or not he wants to see other people. If his feelings are involved, he may want to take his time and consider his wording carefully, but if not, he's likely to be blunt. Luckily, if you pack up the courage and ask, you can expect a Taurus man to be honest and not evade the question. If he’s not interested in being exclusive, this may mean he’s not taking your relationship seriously. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Taurus men understand the importance of romance. Consider whether or not he has a history of organizing thoughtful dates, special outings, and quality time. Though this sign absolutely enjoys evenings on the couch, a Taurus will usually sprinkle in an exciting, well-planned evening here and there for a partner he's serious about. [4] X Research source Reflect on your last five or so times seeing one another. Did any of these meetups include meaningful activities that you enjoy, like rollerblading, a nice meal, or a beautiful hike?

      "title": "A Taurus man loves to show he cares through little gifts.",
      "content": "A Taurus man loves to show he cares through little gifts. Take note of the gifts he's given you. Giving thoughtful, personal, or sensory pleasing gifts is one of the most heartfelt ways he can imagine showing someone he cares. If he rarely gives you thoughtful gifts, this could be a sign that he isn’t taking your relationship seriously. [5] X Research source Gifting you something as simple as a flower from his morning walk could speak volumes. Picking up your favorite snack could be another way he shows he cares."

      "content": "If he's romantically invested, he'll be touched by any gift you think to give him. To get a read on where the two of you are at, give the Taurus man in your life a thoughtful gift, or something pleasing to the senses. [6] X Research source Gift him a cozy blanket, a sweet-smelling candle, or something you know he enjoys, like a board game. If you feel comfortable, ask him how he feels about your gift. As mentioned, you can expect honesty from a Taurus man! If he’s emotionally invested in your relationship, he’ll likely be excited about your gift. If he expresses confusion or a less-than-thrilled response, this might hint that he isn’t too serious about you. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "For a Taurus man, memorizing his crush’s little quirks, stories, and personal details comes naturally. Ask yourself how well he knows you. Try to recall the last time he remembered something that took you by surprise. On the other hand, make a mental note of how often you feel you have to remind him of things you’ve already mentioned about yourself. If you feel like you’re constantly reminding him about important details of your relationship, this could be a sign that he’s not emotionally invested in you. [8] X Research source If a Taurus man really cares about you, he’ll remember things like your birthday, your astrological sign, your favorite breakfast food, your next big event at work, your sibling's names, or your favorite character to play in Mario Kart, etc."

      "title": "Taurus men can be extremely traditional, sometimes taking it slow in the bedroom.",
      "content": "Taurus men can be extremely traditional, sometimes taking it slow in the bedroom. Consider how early on in the relationship sex and physical intimacy were his main points of focus. If a Taurus man has a crush, he might choose to wait a bit before he includes this part of the relationship. On the other hand, a Taurus who rushes into physical intimacy may not be as serious about the long term. So often, this information can get twisted. People might feel they need to wait on physical intimacy in order to have a chance with certain men, like the Taurus. But this is absolutely untrue! You should never feel like your choices to participate or to not participate in physical intimacy will cause your relationship's success or downfall. Rather, after the fact, his choices might just signal how he's viewed the relationship from its start."

      "content": "A Taurus man loves a well-organized routine, and who he shifts it around for says a lot. Even if his plans are to lay around all afternoon binge-watching a new tv show, a Taurus man probably wants that penciled in to his day planner. Take a moment to reflect on how much he's been willing to shift his schedule for you in the past and how much time and energy he's put towards getting to see you at all. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Ask yourself: what would happen if I asked him to join me in a fun bonding activity during the middle of the week? Would he be enthusiastic and try to make it work, or would he avoid the interaction? If he would prefer to avoid it, there’s a chance that he’s not interested in anything serious with you. Consider whether he's ever shifted his schedule or skipped something he planned to do alone in order to see you. Then, consider whether you've done the same for him, and if so, how often? Think about your meeting places. If he's only open to spots near him, this could be a sign that he isn't taking the relationship seriously."

      "content": "A little jealousy is typical for a Taurus man in a relationship. Though this sign is often super chilled out, they can kick up a ruckus when they feel protective of someone they like. [11] X Research source It's not healthy for a partner or potential partner to be jealous to the point of controlling, but a little bit of concern can be a sign of a Taurus' emotional investment. [12] X Research source Look for little signs of jealousy. For instance, if you're locked in conversation with someone else, he might come over and put his arm around you."

      "content": "A Taurus man will seek out things, activities, and people that provide him comfort. Think about your role in his life and what he asks of you. When a relationship makes one person feel like they're providing all of the emotional and physical support to someone who doesn't care enough to return the favor, it can be super draining, or even painful. Try to reflect a bit on your relationship's balance. [13] X Research source Write down your top three needs or desires in the relationship and assign each a rating of one through ten, depending on how fulfilled you feel in each area. Keep track of how often your meetups are more about him than you. Whether it be physical intimacy, talking about his problems, or even helping him with a task, really think about how much he's asking of you versus providing for you."

      "content": "This sign isn't super likely to use their partners, but a Taurus who's not yet over his ex might be an exception. Taurus men are notorious for being in relationships for the long haul, and for this reason, they can sometimes stay caught up in feelings for old partners even long after the relationship ends. This could possibly lead a Taurus man to seek out a new flame for physical or emotional comfort even while he's still invested in a previous partner. [14] X Research source Pay attention to how much he talks about his previous partner. If you feel like you've heard everything there is to know about his past relationship, that might mean he's still hung up. On the other hand, if you've asked about his past partners and received nothing in return, this might be a sign too. If he refuses to say a peep about a past love even when pressed, that can be a sign of unresolved feelings. Keep note of any gifts he may be keeping from his past relationship. If you feel like his apartment is filled with sweatshirts, sentimental items, and sweet notes all from a past relationship, this could be a sign he's not over his ex."

Though Taurus men are much more likely to seek out long term relationships than casual hookups, if his choices consistently make you feel underappreciated, then you may want to ditch your hope that he'll suddenly change.

      "content": "To understand how a Taurus feels, pay attention to his actions, not his words. If the two of you have been meeting up for weeks and he hasn't said a word about his romantic intentions, this isn't necessarily unusual. One of this sign's most exciting qualities is their ability to truly commit to their partners -- but they won't do so until they're sure. If you really like him, your relationship may be worth some patience upfront so that you can give him a bit of time to think.
