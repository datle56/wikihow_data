      "content": "Wash your brass item with soap and water. Before you try to remove the tarnish from your brass piece, give the surface a good wash with mild dish soap and warm water. That will remove any dirt and oil that's built up on the surface, making it easier for the ketchup to penetrate the tarnish on the brass. Use your fingers or a microfiber cloth to scrub the brass. However, don't use anything abrasive, or you could scratch the surface."

      "title": "Place the piece into a shallow bowl.",
      "content": "Place the piece into a shallow bowl. If you have brass jewelry or a small, decorative brass item that you'd like to clean, it's probably easiest to just soak it in ketchup. To get started, find a small, shallow bowl that will easily hold the object, and place the object inside. [1] X Research source If you can, try to use a bowl that's not much larger than the item you're cleaning. If you use a very large bowl, you'll likely need to use a lot more ketchup to cover the object."

      "title": "Squirt in enough ketchup to completely cover the item.",
      "content": "Squirt in enough ketchup to completely cover the item. Grab a bottle of regular ketchup and pour it into the bowl. Make sure to add enough so the entire object is submerged in the ketchup. If you need to, roll the item around to make sure the ketchup gets into all of the crevices on the piece. [2] X Research source To clean a hollow object like a cup or a thimble, you may want to pour or rub a little of the ketchup inside the item before you coat the outside. That way, you can be sure the inside is evenly covered as well. If you'd prefer to use less ketchup, squirt a little of the condiment onto the object you're cleaning, then use your fingers or a cloth to spread it completely over the object."

      "title": "Let it sit for 15 minutes to an hour.",
      "content": "Let it sit for 15 minutes to an hour. Once you've covered the object in ketchup, sit back and relax for a while! After about 15 minutes, check the item by wiping away the ketchup from a small section. If the tarnish is gone, take the object out of the ketchup. If it needs a little more time, replace the object, and continue checking it every 15 minutes or so until the tarnish is gone. [3] X Research source It should take about half an hour for the ketchup to break down a moderate amount of tarnish, but heavier tarnish might require an hour or even 2 hours. On the other hand, the ketchup might remove very light tarnish after 15 minutes or so."

Add a couple of drops of mild dish soap, then lather the soap over the item to remove any ketchup that might be left. If you need to, lightly rub away any dried ketchup with a microfiber cloth or a soft toothbrush.When you're finished, rinse the soap away completely. [4] X Research source Be sure to thoroughly wash away the ketchup or it might leave a sticky residue on your object."

To make sure that doesn't happen, use a soft cloth to dry and polish the object. First, wipe down the entire surface of the piece to remove any excess water. Then, use a dry corner of the cloth and rub the brass in a circular motion to make it look shiny and bright! [5] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. If you'd like to help protect your item against future tarnishing, add a few drops of mineral oil or linseed oil to your cloth, then rub the oil onto the surface of the object."

Scrub lightly to remove any dirt and oil buildup from the surface of the brass. Mild dish detergent is great for gently cleaning brass. Don't use anything abrasive like steel wool or a rough cloth, or you could scratch the brass."

      "content": "Pour some ketchup into a small bowl. If you're cleaning a larger brass item, like a brass bed, or a piece that can't be easily removed, like a doorknob or a light fixture, it's best to apply the ketchup to the item when you're cleaning it. However, this will be easier if you pour the ketchup out into a container first. [6] X Research source A shallow bowl or an old takeout container will work best for this, since it will be easy to dip the ketchup out of the container as you're cleaning."

To spread the ketchup onto the item you're cleaning, use a soft cloth, an old toothbrush, or even just your fingers if you don't mind getting messy. It doesn't take much ketchup, so you only need to apply a thin, even coating over the entire surface. [7] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Green Cleaning Expert Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. If you apply too much ketchup, it might drip off of the item. If that happens, wipe the ketchup immediately so it doesn't become dry or stain anything. For very large pieces, like brass furniture, it may be easiest to work in smaller sections. Try using an old toothbrush to get the ketchup into any little nooks and crannies on the object."

The length of time you'll need to leave it on depends on how tough the tarnish is. After about 15 minutes, wipe away a little of the ketchup and check whether the brass looks bright and shiny. If the tarnish is completely gone, you can begin rinsing off the ketchup. However, if the object still looks tarnished, let it sit a little longer.
