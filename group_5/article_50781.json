      "content": "Find out when your parents are returning home. To prevent your parents from walking in on you, try to figure out their schedule before they leave. Ask them about their plans in a casual way so they don’t suspect anything (and randomly drop in to check on you). You could ask, “I’m having trouble with my homework. When can you come back to help me?” or “What time are you coming back? I want to finish my project before dinner.”"

      "content": "Call your parents if they’re already gone. If your parents already left the house, call or text them to see when they plan to return. Bring up the topic naturally by asking questions about dinner or chores, or simply tell them to give you a call when they’re heading home. You might ask, “What time should I have my chores done before you get back?” or “When will you be home for dinner?” Alternatively, ask your parents for a favor. You might say, “When are you coming home? We’re out of milk, so I wanted to know if you could pick it up on the way back.” Or, slip in the question by suggesting plans together. You can say, \"Oh, we can go out for ice cream if you'll be back before the shop closes up!\""

      "content": "If you get caught by your parents, explain that nudity is natural.

Being nude is a way for you to appreciate your body and boost your self-esteem! If your parents disagree with you, acknowledge their opinion and remain calm so you can maintain a two-way discussion. Remind them that you don’t take issue with the ways that they choose to unwind, and that they should be considerate of yours."
