      "content": "Get a t-shirt. This style works best with baggy t-shirts, but you can use a fitted one too. You will be modifying your t-shirt to have a slit in the side that starts at the bottom hem."

      "title": "Decide how far up the sides you want the slit to go.",
      "content": "Decide how far up the sides you want the slit to go. You can have the slit go up just past the hem for a subtle look, or even further for something more boho-chic. Half-way up is a great look for this. [1] X Research source Place a pin where you want the slit to end, or mark it with a pen. Only do one side of the shirt for now."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the side of the shirt up to that point.",
      "content": "Cut the side of the shirt up to that point. Set the shirt down onto a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles. Use sharp, fabric scissors to cut along the seam to where you want the slit to end. [2] X Research source Don't cut the other side of the shirt just yet."

    {
      "title": "Fold the shirt in half, then cut the other side.",
      "content": "Fold the shirt in half, then cut the other side. Use the seam you just cut as a guide for the second seam. Unfold the shirt when you are down."

      "title": "Gently tug on the corners of the shirt.",
      "content": "Gently tug on the corners of the shirt. The bottom of your shirt will have four corners: two on the front, and two on the back. Gently tug on each of these corners. This will help stretch the hem out and cause the raw edges to curve inward. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal the cut seams, if desired.",
      "content": "Seal the cut seams, if desired. T-shirt material doesn't fray, so you don't have to worry about hemming it. The side seams can unravel, however. If you are worried about this, you can seal them with a drop of fabric glue or a few stitches with a needle and thread."

    {
      "title": "Get a baggy t-shirt.",
      "content": "Get a baggy t-shirt. You will be cutting the sides of this shirt into a fringe, then tying them together. This will give the shirt a boho look as well as make it more fitted. A tight-fitting shirt is not recommended for this, as it may end up too tight."

    {
      "title": "Cut the sleeves, hem, and/or collar off, if desired.",
      "content": "Cut the sleeves, hem, and/or collar off, if desired. You don't have to do this, but it will give your shirt more character. While you can always save this step for last, it is much easier to do it now. Be careful of how much you cut off, however. It is easier to cut more off than to add fabric back. Listed below are some cutting ideas: Cut the collar off to complete the rugged look. Follow the original hem, or cut it lower on the front to create a scoop neck. Cut the entire bottom hem off if you need the shirt to be longer. [4] X Research source Cut the sleeves off to make this a tank top. Be sure to cut along the original seam; you don't want that left on the shirt. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the shirt apart at the side seams. Start cutting at the bottom hem and finish cutting at the armpit. For a neater finish, turn the shirt inside out and cut out the entire seam. Make sure that you turn it right-side out when you are done. If you want to turn this into a tank top, cut the sleeves off as well. Make sure that you cut off the entire seam."

[6] X Research source Make sure that you are cutting through both layers of fabric, otherwise the next step won't work."

Work your way up the shirt until you reach the armpit. Repeat this step for the back. If the tassels are too short, try tugging on them first. If that doesn't help, cut them longer."
