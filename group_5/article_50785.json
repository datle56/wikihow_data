      "content": "Aerobic exercise keeps your circulatory and respiratory systems fit. Your circulatory and respiratory systems deliver oxygen and nutrients throughout your body as well as remove waste. Keeping these systems fit and functioning requires cardiovascular exercise that raises your heart rate, such as walking, running, or swimming. Spend 20-30 minutes on this kind of exercise every day. [1] X Research source Do this exercise in addition to your regular physical activity. For example, even if you spend several hours gardening, you still want to make time for a 20-minute walk or some other exercise. The best way to maintain this habit is to do something you enjoy doing. If you like playing soccer, join a community league and do drills on the days you don't have a game. Swimming is perhaps the best all-around workout. It's low impact, so it's great if you have painful or stiff joints.

      "content": "Fit muscles can perform repeated contractions for a longer period. Doing more repetitions with lighter weights helps build your muscular endurance. Start with a weight that makes your muscles feel tired after 10-12 repetitions. Learn and use the correct form for weight lifting exercises so you can do them properly. This ensures you get the full benefit and also lessens the risk of injury.

Lighter weights build endurance, but it takes fewer repetitions with heavier weights to increase the strength in your muscles. Start with the lowest weight that exhausts your muscles after 2 to 5 repetitions and gradually increase it.

You can typically maintain physical fitness with 2 or 3 sessions a week. You can start by adding weights to bodyweight exercises that you already know how to do, such as squats and lunges.

Once you've learned a few poses, you can use them as warmup or cool-down stretches after exercise as well. Breathe freely and deeply through stretches. If you feel any pain or tension, stop.

Studies show a Mediterranean diet might be the healthiest eating style. [9] X Research source Portion control is also important. Some foods you can eat without having to worry about the quantity. But in general, get in the habit of putting healthy portions on your plate and not returning for seconds. Eat fast food and sugary foods and drinks in moderation.

Your urine is a good indication of your hydration level—if it's a dark yellow or amber color, you need more water. Always drink water before, during, and after a workout to help recover the water your body loses through sweat. Keep a bottle of water with you so you always have some handy. This will make it easier to remember to take small sips of water throughout the day."

      "content": "A good night's sleep helps restore energy and repair damage. A consistent sleep pattern will really help boost your physical health. Start winding down about an hour before you plan to go to bed—turn off the screens and read a book or listen to relaxing music. Try to go to bed at around the same time every night and wake up at around the same time every morning. This helps your body's circadian rhythm adjust so when it's time to go to bed, you'll actually be tired. [13] X Research source Keep the room where you sleep quiet and dark. Having a light or the TV on makes it harder to go to sleep and fall into a deep sleep. If you're having a hard time going to sleep, get up and do something else for a few minutes until you feel tired. Tossing and turning in bed will only make things worse. Talk to your doctor if you have a recurring problem falling to sleep. They might recommend a sleep aid to help."
