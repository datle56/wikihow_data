      "content": "Find out what kind of person the Bible says is a good person. (Psalm 73:28) . . .\"But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, To declare all your works.\" They would have a close relationship with God. Psalm 37:27 . . .\"Turn away from what is bad and do what is good, And so reside to time indefinite.\" They would not be involved in anything that is displeasing in God's eyes. (Psalm 119:97) . . .\"How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.\" They read the Bible with understanding and they stick closely to all of the principles of the Bible. (1 Corinthians 15:33) . . .\"Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.\" They would encourage you to do what God says all the time and will be willing to correct a friend at times if needed. (1 John 3:18) . . .\"Little children, let us love, neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.\" They show Godly love to all with out reserve. (James 1:23-25) . . .\"23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself, and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is. 25 But he who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in [it], this [man], because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, will be happy in his doing [it].\" They use the bible like a mirror to assess themselves regularly. If adjustment is needed they use scriptures to adjust their thinking and based on them they change what is needed to be changed."

      "content": "Knowing when we are ready to marry is vital. Since this varies from one individual to another, the Scriptures do not stipulate an age. They do show, however, that it is better to wait until we are “past the bloom of youth,” when strong sexual impulses can distort good judgment. (1 Corinthians 7:36) . . .\"But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, if that is past the bloom of youth, and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry.\""
