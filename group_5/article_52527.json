      "content": "Consider whether or not to remove any control knobs. The knobs on the television may jut into the body of the wooden console depending on your television’s model. Since the goal is to empty the console to make room for a fish tank, you may have to remove a knob or two; however, if they are all to one side, consider leaving them in place and devoting that cramped end of the box to any ugly, external pieces of the aquarium that need to be included in the setup (ex. the air pump)."

      "content": "Buy the necessary aquarium components. Using the TVs internal measurements, buy an aquarium and any additional components necessary including a filter, air pump, overhead light, and tubing. Make sure the tank that is wider and slightly taller than the screen. Be especially careful to leave room between the top of the aquarium and the lid of the console for an overhead light, which your fish and plants will need if they’re going to be enclosed in a dark box. Place the air pump inside the cabinet to suppress the noise. However, it can be mounted outside if there is not enough room. If you don’t have space to fit an overhead light inside the console, consider getting a remote ballast light instead. If your TV console won't fit a standard tank size, you can have one custom-built to fit ."

Alternatively, you can remove the existing top and replace it with a flip lid made from a new piece of wood stained to match the old paneling. Replace the back of the TV."

Cycle the tank before adding fish. This is an absolute must if you want your fish to live for more than a week or two. To humanely cycle the tank, do a fishless cycle ."
