      "content": "Use commentary! Buy a microphone, good or not, it's better than nothing! Can you think of any gamer who has over 100k subscribers (and particularly does gaming videos) who doesn't speak in his/her videos?"

      "content": "Avoid annoying laughter. Go to laughing school, after you pass, you may continue to the next step. But seriously, practice a regular laugh - not something over the roof that is straight out bizarre and loud. Something pretty medium noise level genuine laugh."

      "title": "Make good quality videos.",
      "content": "Make good quality videos. Download a good recording software such as Hypercam, Fraps, Bandicam, or Camtasia. If you are looking for a free recorder that accepts voice and face cam, try Ezvid."

      "title": "No dirt houses or any other unappealing homes.",
      "content": "No dirt houses or any other unappealing homes. In Minecraft, do not build a horrible house (except if you're just kidding around). Expand your house. Make traps. Maybe trap a friend to cause a hilarious reaction."

      "title": "Get a friend or co-op with someone!",
      "content": "Get a friend or co-op with someone! A buddy will support you and not make you feel alone and worried. Make sure it's a good friend, or you might get worried, freak out, hyperventilation, or completely uncomfortable."

      "title": "Don't tell bad jokes.",
      "content": "Don't tell bad jokes. You can tell jokes that are meant to be bad jokes, though. So if you tell a bad joke, hope the audience thinks that you're kidding around. Speak funnily after that and they would. Do that after every joke. Every joke is meant to be a joke."

      "title": "Overreact over creepers.",
      "content": "Overreact over creepers. Be funny when a creeper is around. He blew up your house? Do a stupid crying, whining noise to emphasize it."

      "title": "Don't use huge words.",
      "content": "Don't use huge words. The audience of people who may be watching you will not understand the vocabulary you are giving them, so stay with mainstream words."

    {
      "title": "Don't repeat yourself.",
      "content": "Don't repeat yourself. Repeating yourself isn't really interesting, as all your content will look the same, it will definitely decrease popularity level. Be sure to be confident in your videos and speak clearly to the microphone so the people watching can understand and you yourself could when you go back and edit the video."
