      "content": "Cycle every day. Training and experience are the foundations of any sport, and for a professional cyclist, this means making lots of miles on the road. On average, you should train at least 2 hours a day for 6 days a week if you want to become a professional cyclist. If the weather is too cold to cycle outside, train on a stationary bike in a gym or at home. Training for pro cycling usually takes up about 4 to 6 hours a day, though sometimes that might include time spent at the gym doing weights and building strength."

      "content": "Increase your power by using tools and adding resistance. Pro cyclists need to be able to chug up a hill even when the end of a race is near and their body is already tired. Work on increasing your power so that you can cope with situations like these. Add resistance to your cycling sessions and use a heart rate monitor or cycling compute to ensure that you are staying within your target heart rate zone. Some good ways to add resistance include: [1] X Research source Riding up a hill Riding into the wind Changing to a larger gear"

Not only will this help you develop the skills and strength that you need to succeed, but it will help you help get your name out there in the community. You'll have the head start you need and friends in all the right places. You'll have to start young in general though, as the US has rules stipulating age for cyclists in some races."

Sometimes you can find a good coach through your cycling club, but you can also look through the classifieds in cycling magazines. A good coach can help you break your own time records, build your endurance and speed, and improve your technique when racing against others. An experienced coach can also give you advice about the best nutrition for endurance sports and advise you on the best equipment."

You could specialize in downhill, enduro, or cross country if you are a mountain bike racer.

      "content": "Ensure that you have a flexible job to support your cycling. It is difficult to make money as a pro cyclist, but some people manage to do so for a while. Pro teams usually only pay for equipment and travel. Even the payout for major races is actually pretty low. Choose a flexible job that will work with your training and race schedule. Teaching is a profession that may lend itself to cycling, since you'll have summers off, which is when most of the season takes place. You might also consider working in a bike shop so that you can interact with other people who love the sport."

      "content": "Find a sponsor. Though professional cyclists train extremely hard (like all other professional sports) the financial rewards associated with winning are much lower than those in professional baseball, football, basketball or ice hockey. As such, sponsorship is an important part of becoming a professional cyclist as the amount of cash available will determine the quality of equipment, coaching, and medical care you will have. Though sponsors usually don't donate as much cash in the amateur leagues as they do for professional cyclists, having a sponsor can make a difference in covering the costs of equipment, training, and travel. It's difficult to do, but worth trying all the same."
