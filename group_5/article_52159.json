[7] X Research source While you’re at look, look for other parts of the machine that could use a wipe down, like the spout, mug tray or the area around the brewing chamber. [8] X Research source You can clean most of the exterior of the Keurig by simply wiping it down with warm water."

Submerge the reservoir in the soap solution and gently go over the interior with a sponge or clean cloth. Concentrate on the small port and mesh screen at the bottom of the reservoir where the buildup is likely to be heaviest. [9] X Research source For especially heavy stains or buildup, allow the reservoir to soak in the soap solution for 10-15 minutes before scrubbing. Don’t forget to go over the underside of the lid as well."
