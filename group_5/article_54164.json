      "content": "Connect the male end of the extension cable to the device that is furthest away. The male ends of both the standard and extension cables are interchangeable. USB extension cables are typically suitable to support connections that are 9.8 feet (3 m) or less in distance. Extension cables come with single and multiple USB port support, depending on your need."

      "content": "Run your standard USB cable between your peripheral device and the extender's receiver. Take the other end of the Ethernet cable and plug it into the receiver's converted port. USB extenders are generally able to support distances of up to 164 feet (50 m). The length depends on the length of Ethernet cable that you use. Ethernet cables can transfer data further distances than typical USB cables without having the data transfer deteriorate."

      "content": "Set permissions on all of your devices. Allow the USB signal to access all the devices that require it. Wireless USB connections allow multiple wireless devices in a close proximity to network and use a device connected directly to the wireless transmitter. These typically support distances of 9.8 feet (3 m) but can be extended beyond that. It is not recommended to exceed 32.8 feet (10 m)."
