      "content": "Make sure your base is strong. Before you start tiling, it's important to make sure that the surface the tile is going on to is strong and stable. This is extremely important that this base is structurally sound, otherwise you will soon find cracks in your tile work....and if it's really bad your whole floor or wall could come falling down under the weight! Check your subfloor, cabinets, or wall frame, depending on what you're tiling. [1] X Research source Look for signs of mold or rot and try place weight on the boards. If they bow or seem unsteady, they might need to be replaced or reinforced."

      "content": "Install cement board. [2] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020. You will need to install cement board or a similar product (like a tile backer) before laying down the tiles. Do not use plywood. Cement board will help waterproof your structure and it will also be much more resistant to warping, which helps to prevent cracks. [3] X Research source Score the cement board and then snap it cut out the pieces that you need. Screw it down along the edges (every couple inches) and also at the center (3-4 evenly spaced locations should do). Make sure to stagger the joints between different rows of the cement board. This will prevent large cracks from appearing over time. If attaching the cement board to a subfloor, you will need to apply mortar before lying down each panel, and then screwing it into place. Use the method described later in the article for mortaring the tiles."

      "content": "Check for level as you go. Use a carpenter's level to check that the cement board is flat in all directions. You should also continue to check for level as you go through the various layers of the tiling project. If the cement board is not level, you can adjust it with shims from below."

      "title": "Create the guide lines.",
      "content": "Create the guide lines. Walls in a room are often not square or straight, and ceilings are notorious for being uneven. Use a snap chalk line, a carpenter's level, and a measuring tape to mark some truly straight lines for your tiles to follow. Measure the halfway point on each wall (or edge of a wall, if that's what you're tiling), and then snap a chalk line between opposite sides. Measure to see if the intersections at the middle of the room are square. If not, adjust. You can use this as a base to measure and draw other straight lines and perfect corners in the room. [5] X Research source You only need to actually mark the corners or outside edges of where the tiles will go, not mark every row."

      "content": "Dry fit the tiles to test your pattern. Once you've figured out where your tiles are going to go, dry fit the tiles until you're comfortable with how the pattern looks and how all the tiles should fit together. This is very important if you're using different tiles in a pattern or tiles of a different size. [6] X Research source You'll also want to plan where you want to start the tiles, so that the edges look nice. Some tiles will almost certainly need to be cut to fit at the edges, so plan where you want the tiles to start so that the cut, edge tiles look nice and balanced."

      "content": "Prepare your mortar. Mix up some thin set mortar according to the manufacturer's instructions for the brand you buy. Generally, you'll have a powder to which you add water. You want the texture of the mortar to be like that of peanut butter. Add the water in slowly and mix as you go, so that you don't get too much water in the mix. You'll also want to let it \"slake\" or rest after you do the initial mixing. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes and then mix it up again. It's now ready to use."

      "title": "Spread your mortar.",
      "content": "Spread your mortar. Spread mortar in a small area where you will begin to work. Only work with a roughly 2'x3' area at a time. You do not want the mortar to have time to set before you can lay your tile. Using a notched trowel (different sizes may be needed, 3/8\" is a good starting point), spread the mortar between sections that you marked with the chalk line. If the mortar rises up between the tiles (to be flush or nearly flush with the tile surface), that means it's too thick or that the ridges need to be shorter. The mortar should be covering the entire tile, if you lift it up after placing it. [7] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 1 July 2020. If when you lift up the tiles you see only lines of mortar on the tile, then the mortar has dried out too much or the bed is too thin and the height of the ridges must be increased. If using tile sheets, use a trowel with smaller notches. This will keep the mortar from coming up through the gaps between the tiles."

Leave gaps of 1/8\" where the edge of the tile meets up with the wall or floor. This is to allow room for expansion and movement, as the material naturally changes with its environment. This gap can be covered with grout, molding, or shoe tile."
