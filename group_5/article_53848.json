      "content": "Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Eating fruits and vegetables will provide your body with the nutrients it needs and, because they are relatively low in calories, you will get to enjoy eating higher volumes of food than you would if you were eating high-fat foods. This will leave you feeling more satisfied.

      "content": "Don't forget protein. Protein is extremely important because it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time, which will prevent you from overeating. Protein also requires more energy to digest than carbohydrates, which means you are burning more calories. Meat and fish are excellent sources of protein. You can also get protein from eggs, lentils, beans, cheese, yogurt, whole nuts and nut butters."

      "content": "Know the difference between good and bad fats. It's good to consume a moderate amount of polyunsaturated fat, which is found in things like nuts, olive oil, avocados, and fatty fishes. Limit your consumption of saturated fats, which are found in meat and dairy products, by choosing low-fat options.

      "content": "Cut out processed foods. Anything that is made with chemicals or refined ingredients is considered a processed food. This includes everything from white bread to bacon to potato chips. Overly processed foods are bad for you because they are typically high in calories, bad fats, salt, and sugar, but low in fiber, vitamins, and nutrients. This means you will not feel satisfied for very long, so you will continue to consume more and more calories. Processed foods can also be addictive. It might be hard to cut them out at first, but once you get used to eating real food, you'll be glad you did."

      "title": "Watch out for sugary drinks.",
      "content": "Watch out for sugary drinks. If you're drinking soda, juice, or sweetened coffee, you are probably consuming extra calories. The body doesn't process these liquid calories the same way it does with solid food, so you will probably feel just as hungry after drinking them. Diet sodas are not helpful for weight loss either. Studies have shown that people who drink diet soda regularly are more likely to gain weight than people who don't.

      "content": "Sip on water. In addition to keeping your body hydrated, drinking water can also help you eat less. Your body can sometimes mistake thirst for hunger, so the next time you think you feel hungry between meals, see if you feel satisfied after a bit of water.

      "content": "Don't skip meals. Skipping meals can cause your metabolism to slow down and it can also cause you to overeat because you will be very hungry by the time you do allow yourself to eat. Eating small snacks between meals is helpful for some people. If this helps prevent you from overeating at meals, go for it! For the best results, try a protein-packed snack that is 200 calories or less."

      "content": "Stop eating when you're full. Many people will eat as much food as there happens to be on their plate, without stopping to think if they are still hungry. Start being more mindful by stopping yourself after you've finished half of your food and asking yourself if you are satisfied or still hungry. Don't deprive yourself of more food if you are still hungry, but stop eating if you realize you are not.

It might be hard to recognize at first, but the next time you reach for a snack between meals, ask yourself if you are feeling angry, lonely, or tired.

You will have much more success in losing weight if healthy eating habits become a regular habit that you don't have to think about. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try thinking more about the healthy foods that you will add into your diet than the bad foods you will eliminate. Also, try to find healthy foods that you genuinely enjoy eating. If you do both of these things, you may not even crave unhealthy foods anymore. Instead of depriving yourself of the foods you love, allow yourself a little indulgence once in awhile. In fact, deprivation can lead to overeating, so it may be healthier to give in to your cravings every so often. This means you can still eat chocolate or bacon, as long as it's in moderation."
