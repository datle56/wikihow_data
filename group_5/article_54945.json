When spraying the repellent, pay special attention to corners and dark, moist areas. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove clutter and debris. Declutter and deep clean your house, especially areas like your basement, to remove tight spaces in which daddy long legs could hide. Get rid of any unnecessary boxes or papers and dust everything down to get rid of cobwebs. Decluttering also removes hiding spots for other insects which daddy long legs eat. If they don’t have a food source, they won’t infest your home. [6] X Research source Daddy long legs often seek shelter in homes during extremely hot or cold weather. They’re often found in basements and crawl spaces or any other area with low light and moisture. They can also fit into tight areas, so check the corners of your walls and behind any boxes or storage areas. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Daddy long legs have long, spindly legs and round bodies.",
      "content": "Daddy long legs have long, spindly legs and round bodies. Sometimes known as harvestmen, daddy long legs are 8-legged arachnids, but they’re not actually spiders. They belong to the Opilione order while spiders are Araneae. However, they’re often mistaken for cellar spiders due to their similar appearance. Here are some ways to tell if you’re dealing with daddy long legs or spiders: [12] X Research source Legs: Daddy long legs have extremely long, thin legs that can be several times the length of their body. Each leg usually has 7 segments. Body shape: Daddy long legs have a small, round body consisting of the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Unlike spiders, they do not have a distinct waist or narrow connection between their body parts. Instead, the body appears as a single segment. Coloration: Daddy long legs are typically brown, gray, or have a pale yellowish color to help them blend in with their surroundings. Eyes: Daddy long legs have 2 eyes that are small, simple, and located on top of their cephalothorax. They do not have the specialized vision spiders possess. Venom production: Daddy long legs do not produce venom and are not harmful to humans. Spiders, on the other hand, do possess venom glands and can be harmful to humans depending on the species. Silk production: Daddy long legs do not possess silk-producing spinnerets, while true spiders do. Antennae: Some daddy long leg species have long, whip-like antennae that extend from their heads."
