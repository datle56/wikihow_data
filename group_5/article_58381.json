      "content": "Give 10 small objects to each player to keep track of their level. You can use coins, poker chips, paper clips, or anything you have on hand! [1] X Research source You can also use a notepad and a pencil to keep track of everyone’s level. Munchkin Deluxe: Set out the game board and have each player pick a colored standee. Place each player’s standee on the level “1” space on the board."

      "title": "Separate the Door cards and the Treasure cards.",
      "content": "Separate the Door cards and the Treasure cards. Every deck comes with 2 separate card types: the Door cards and the Treasure cards. Make sure these are separated, then shuffle each deck and put them into 2 piles face down. [2] X Research source Set the cards in the center of your group so everyone can grab them. Munchkin Deluxe: Place the Door and Treasure decks on their respective card spaces on the board. Place any discarded cards in the space directly below each deck."

    {
      "title": "Pick up 4 cards from each deck.",
      "content": "Pick up 4 cards from each deck. Have every player grab 4 Door cards and 4 Treasure cards. It doesn’t matter who starts, but you can roll a die to decide if you want to! [3] X Research source If you have an older version of the game, the rules might tell you to pick out 2 cards from each deck instead of 4. That’s fine, and the rest of the rules are all still the same."

    {
      "title": "Put down a Race card and a Class card to create your character.",
      "content": "Put down a Race card and a Class card to create your character. Pick a Race card and a Class card from your hand and place them face-up on the table. This will cause them to be in play. Every card has its own strengths and weaknesses, so pick out the ones you want carefully. [4] X Research source You may be an elf thief who gains levels for helping and backstabbing players. You can also be a halfling wizard who charms monsters and gains their treasure without fighting them. If you have a half-breed or super munchkin card, you can put down 2 Race cards and 2 Class cards at the same time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set out any Item cards you have.",
      "content": "Set out any Item cards you have. Your Item cards give your character weapons and objects to use during battle. Check the bottom of your Item card to see how many “hands” you need to hold it. You can only use 2 “hands” worth of small items and 1 “hand” worth of big items at one time. [5] X Research source You can put down any items you have right now, or you can save them for later. It’s up to you! Similarly, if you have an Item that says “Headgear,” you can’t equip more than 2 “Headgear” Items (unless your Race card or another Item card says otherwise). Cards set on the table in front of you (or Items that you’re “carrying”) are “in-play” while cards in your hand are “not in play.”"

      "content": "Draw a Door card face up to “Kick Open (or Down) The Door”. To decide who goes first, roll the dice. On your turn, you’ll either pull a monster card, a Curse, or a card that does something good. If it’s a monster, you must fight it. [6] X Research source Curse Card: These immediately apply to the player who drew them. Follow the instructions on the card. Some Curses are discarded, while others give you a penalty later in the game or have a continuing effect. Keep these cards until you can get rid of them or the penalty takes effect. Any other card: Keep it in your hand or play it right away. You might get an Item card or a boost to use for your character."

      "content": "Begin combat if you drew a monster card. Your combat strength is determined by your character’s level plus all the modifiers on any cards you have in play (check the numbers at the top of each card). If your level and modifiers are higher than the monster’s level at the top of their card, you win! [7] X Research source Make sure you read the instructions on your monster card carefully. Some monsters can be “bribed” with Gold or Items to let you go. When you do this, you don’t go up a level."

If you drew anything from the Door card pile that wasn’t a monster, you have 2 options: you can “Look For Trouble” by playing a monster from your hand to fight, or you can “Loot The Room” by grabbing a second card from the Door deck face-down and putting it in your hand. [8] X Research source You should only play a monster card if you know you can defeat the monster! Otherwise, you could lose levels."

Ask the other players to add their combat strength to yours. You can offer the helper any Items you’re currently carrying or a few of the Treasure cards your monster will give you once you defeat them. [9] X Research source You can also offer to play any cards you legally can, like a “Go Up a Level” card, for the other player. Only one player can help you defeat a monster. If a player refuses to help, ask another one until they all turn you down or someone decides to help. If you both successfully defeat the monster, discard it, draw the number of Treasures written on the card, and follow any special instructions. You level up, but your helper does not."

Check the bottom of the monster card to see how much treasure they were holding, then draw that amount of Treasure cards from the deck. [10] X Research source Munchkin Deluxe: Move your standee to the next level space on the board."

If you run away, you don’t get any levels, collect any Treasure, and you can’t Loot The Room. [11] X Research source 5 or higher: You escape successfully. Read the card to make sure there are no negative effects from running away and discard it. 5 or lower: Check the “Bad Stuff” on the monster card under to see what happens to you. This can vary from losing Items to Death. If you die, you lose all your Items. You keep your Class(es), Level(s), Race(s), etc. Lay out your hand face-up and starting with the highest-level player, each player chooses one card. After everyone gets 1 card, the rest of your hand is discarded. Dead players cannot receive any cards, level up, or win the game. On your next turn, draw 4 cards from each deck face-down, play any cards you can, and take your turn as normal."

If you have more than 5 cards in your hand, play enough cards to get you to 5 or fewer. If you can’t (or don’t want to) reduce the number of cards in your hand, give the excess cards to the player with the lowest Level. [12] X Research source If players are tied for the lowest Level, divide the cards as evenly as possible among them (but it’s up to you who gets which cards). Try to hand off any low-level items that aren’t worth much Gold or any Items that you don’t want to keep for your own character. If you’re the lowest-level player, just discard your extra cards.

You can also add a monster from your hand to the combat with a Wandering Monster card. [14] X Research source The goal is to stop the other players from reaching level 10—at all costs! If you’re a Thief, you can also backstab the other player in combat. If the monster a player is fighting is labeled “Undead,” it means you can play any Undead monster from your hand into combat without using a Wandering Monster card."

[16] X Research source If you sell Items for 1,100 Gold Pieces, the excess Gold Pieces don’t get carried over or collected by you. However, if you sell Items for 2,000 Gold Pieces, you go up 2 levels. You can only have 2 “hands” of items and 1 Big Item at a time (unless another card says otherwise).

Any Item you receive from a trade must stay in play on the table in front of you."
