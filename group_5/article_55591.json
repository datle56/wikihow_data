Always check your cat for bite marks before determining that the shoulder is broken. If you find a bite wound, wash it with saline water and disinfect it before putting a bandage over it.

      "content": "Take your cat to the vet as quickly as possible. Shoulder injuries need urgent attention. While not life-threatening, your cat will be in severe pain and need relief. A shock powerful enough to break bones may have caused other damage that is not immediately obvious, such as internal bleeding, which can be fatal. Most shoulder breaks will require surgery to repair and immobilize the joint. Your goal should be to stabilize your cat so that you can take her to the vet as soon as possible. [5] X Research source Compound fractures require surgery within eight hours. If there is bone sticking out from your cat’s fur, then she has sustained a compound, or open, fracture.

Go to source This is relatively rare. Most closed fractures should be treated within two to four days, but as shoulder fractures are rare without associated trauma, you should try to get your cat in sooner.

Go to source Treatment will depend on where the fracture is located. If the joint is fractured, it will need to be repaired to prevent poor healing and early arthritis. This may be done with orthopedic wire, screws, or a combination of both. If the shoulder blade is fractured, then your cat may need only to rest for one to two months. If you cannot immediately take your cat to the vet, you should call to receive instructions.

Dressing (covering with a clean cloth or gauze) is necessary for a compound fracture, but you should not try to bandage your cat’s shoulder in order to immobilize it, whether the fracture is open or closed. Immobilizing shoulders is very difficult, and your injured cat is unlikely to be in a cooperative mood. The struggles during bandaging will likely do more harm than any good the bandage might do.

Most shoulder breaks will take at least eight weeks to heal, though young cats may heal more quickly. Your cat will likely need to be confined to cage rest for at least a month, and usually for the full eight weeks.

After that, choose tinned meats rich in protein to promote faster healing. Avoid jelly and gravy based cat foods, which are lower in protein, and which may upset your cat’s stomach. Also be sure to cut back the amount of food your cat gets each day to prevent weight gain during cage rest. Giving her the same amount of food may cause her to gain weight."

Some exercises you can do at home include: [21] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source Range of motion therapy — For the first month after injury, you will want to flex and extend the joints of the injured leg to maintain joint health. Ask your vet to show you how. The goal is to exercise the joint without pain, so at first, these movements will be small. As your cat heals, you will be able to move the injured limb more and more. Massage therapy — After the first week, when most of the inflammation has subsided, massage the skin and muscles around the injured bone to prevent the build-up of scar tissue and to reduce pain. Your vet will recommend how frequently to massage your cat."
