While this isn't a great long-term solution, it'll allow you to keep using your iPhone as you work toward fixing the Home button. But if your iPhone uses Touch ID, you're probably wondering how to unlock it if the Home button isn't working. It's easier than you'd think: Press the side or top button to wake the screen. Swipe up on the locked screen to display your notifications. Tap a notification to bring up the Touch ID screen. Tap Use Passcode and enter your passcode ."

If your iPhone opens to the Home screen, this will be easy without a working Home button—just open the Settings app and tap Accessibility in the third group of settings. But if your iPhone opens to the app you were using last, there's a trick to get there: First, if you've set up Siri to respond to \"Hey Siri,\" just say, \"Hey Siri, open Accessibility Settings.\" If that didn't work, swipe down from the top, type settings into the search field, tap Settings , and then tap Accessibility . If that didn't work, open Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, then: Tap the Accessibility icon—it's the outline of a person inside a circle.

In a well-lit room, closely inspect the Home button at different angles and look for anything unusual. If your Home button is visibly cracked, it's unlikely you'll get it working again. Set up a service with Apple to have your phone repaired. On newer iPhones with Home buttons, the button doesn't click—it only registers touch. The \"clicking\" feel is due to haptic touch. Pressing too hard on an iPhone 7 or later Home button can easily break it, and these buttons are not replaceable."

      "content": "This quick trick has helped some people fix their broken Home buttons. While the success of this fix is purely anecdotal, there's no harm in giving it a try: Unlock your iPhone and open a default app, such as Messages or Notes. Press and hold the Power button (top or side button) until the \"Slide to power off\" slider appears. Press and hold the Home button. If the Home button still works, the \"Slide to power off\" slider should disappear in about 5 seconds, and the app you were using should have force-closed. To check, unlock your screen and see if the app you were using is still open. If it is, try repeating the calibration a few more times to see if you get different results. If recalibrating never closes the app, this method won't work for you."

[4] X Research source Before bringing your iPhone in for repair, make sure to back up your data . Your iPhone will be reset to its original factory settings during repair. If you're handy with tools and don't mind voiding your warranty, you may be able to replace the Home button yourself. However, there is a catch—because Home buttons on iPhone SE and other iPhones with Touch ID are paired to the motherboard, you can only use a specially-made universal-style Home button, and Touch ID will no longer work.
