Conversations on Hinge also do not include read receipts. Other apps like Tinder and OKCupid allow you to purchase read receipts as an add-on."

Whenever you are typing, the other user will see the same three dots that messaging apps like iMessage display. If someone is typing, they likely read the last message."
