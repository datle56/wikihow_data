      "content": "Remove or replace any metal in the area that is not rust-resistant. To keep the rust from appearing again, you need to identify the cause(s) of the rust and address it. This could be a metal railing or item on the painted surface that is not rust resistant, a light fixture that is not rust resistant, or another object attached to the painted surface made of iron or steel. Look for any metal items that could be causing the rust and remove them or replace them so they are rust resistant. [5] X Research source Though a fixture may be made of materials that are rust-resistant, like aluminum or brass, the screws, bolts, or other fasteners may not be rust-resistant. They can then cause rust to appear. Check the screws and bolts to ensure they are resistant to rust or caulk and seal these open areas."

You should look for any rusted nails in the painted surface and replace them with new nails. Use a nail punch to countersink the nails so they are ⅛” below the surface. This will prevent the nails from retaining moisture from the air outside and rusting. You can then fill any holes in the painted surface with putty to prevent water from getting into the painted surface. Make sure the painted surface is smooth and rust free before you paint over it."
