      "content": "Select a small litter box with low sides that your kitten can enter. Full-sized litter boxes are often too high or intimidating for kittens, so choose a kitten-sized litter box or tray with low sides. [2] X Research source Start with an uncovered box or tray, which suits most kittens, but note that you may need to cover it if your kitten ends up preferring more privacy, or tends to kick or dig enthusiastically. As your kitten grows, you’ll need to give them a larger box. Always ensure your cat has enough space to turn around inside the both without touching the sides."

      "content": "Make sure you have a litter box for each cat. Certified dog & cat trainer Russell Harstein says “you should have at least one litter box per cat, plus one [extra] box.” Certified feline behavior specialist Molly Devoss adds, “If you have a large home, put out a few boxes so the kitten [can] make it back to [a] box.” Also, place a box on each floor of your home, and check that another cat hasn’t already “claimed” the box or is guarding it. Cats like having their own private place to eliminate."

      "content": "Fill the box with fine-grained, unscented litter. Most cats naturally prefer 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) of sand or sand-like litter , as it emulates their habitat in the wild. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source That said, every cat has their own preferences, so experiment or offer multiple boxes with different litters. Keep the following factors in mind as you make your choice: Avoid clumping litters until the cat is about 4 months old. Clumping litter can cause intestinal blockage if ingested—and kittens love to ingest just about anything. [4] X Research source Also avoid litter made with chemicals or fragrances, which can irritate your cat or be toxic if ingested. Err on the side of all-natural litters. Select a litter that is widely available. Some cats become accustomed to a specific litter and may not recognize the tray as a toilet unless it contains their usual litter."

      "content": "Place the box somewhere quiet but easily accessible. Kittens and cats need peace and privacy, but also don’t want to work too hard to find or use their litter boxes. The ideal litter box location is easily accessible, offers plenty of privacy, doesn’t feel enclosed, and is free from sudden noises that could frighten a kitten. [5] X Research source Try placing the box in a roomy bathroom or another fairly disused room of the house. That said, kittens also prefer their boxes to be somewhere they spend plenty of time themselves, and where they can often see it."

      "title": "Place the kitten in the litter box a half-hour after feeding.",
      "content": "Place the kitten in the litter box a half-hour after feeding. Kittens often need to evacuate about 20-30 minutes after being fed. When the time comes, litter train your kitten by placing them in the box itself and let them spend a few minutes there, even if they don't go to the bathroom the first time. Certified feline training and behavior specialist Molly Devoss says, “Kittens inherit the urge to use a litter box so there shouldn’t be much house training needed.” That said, some kittens will need to be placed in the litter box repeatedly until they figure it out. Avoid attempting to \"show\" the kitten the digging motion that cats use to bury their waste as it may frighten them. [6] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source And avoid hovering, as cats dislike distractions when it’s time to do their business."

      "title": "Use praise for good behaviors, and interrupt undesired behaviors.",
      "content": "Use praise for good behaviors, and interrupt undesired behaviors. As the kitten grows used to the litter box and starts using it as their toilet, praise them each time they go by petting them and making comforting sounds. If they start their business outside the box, interrupt it with a whistle or a cheerful tone, then place them in the box. [7] X Research source Always avoid punishment. Kittens don’t respond well to forceful or frightening behaviors. If your kitten has an accident, let them sniff the mess, then gently lift them and put them in the box, so they know where to go next time."

      "content": "Consider confining the kitten to a single room for a few weeks. Certified Feline Training and Behavior Specialist Molly Devoss says to “confine the kitten to [the litter box’s room] until he gets used to using the box regularly.” When you first introduce a kitten to your home, consider keeping them in the same room as the box for 2-3 weeks. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source This can help them acclimate to their new environment, gives them easy access to their litter box, and can help minimize or confine accident areas. Keep the litter box and the kitten’s food and bedding at opposite ends of the confinement area. Cats don’t like doing their business near where they eat and drink. You may want to confine the kitten to an area without carpet to make accidents easier to clean if they do occur."

To maintain the litter box, scoop the waste out of the box, place it in a small baggie, close the bag, and dispose of it in the garbage. If you don't change the litter, the kitten may find a cleaner place, like the carpet, to do their business.

If you find that your kitten is using the dirt in your potted plants for a toilet, you may need to remove them or cover the dirt with foil during litter training. Kittens instinctively bury their waste, so they may be attracted to dirt or sandy areas."

      "content": "Move the litter box or rearrange the room. Kittens and cats can be quite finicky. If your kitten refuses to use the box, move it to a different room, or simply rearrange it inside the same room, and keep trying for another week or two. Find somewhere quieter and with a comfortable temperature, or somewhere nearer where the kitten usually spends their time. If it becomes necessary to move the box, do it gradually—a few feet at a time every few days—to keep the kitten comfortable and prevent confusion. Or, use a pheromone diffuser to make your cat calm and comfortable enough to use the box."

      "content": "Try a different litter box or different litter. It may be that your kitten simply doesn’t like the box, or the litter. Get a larger box with a different shape, or try a different type of litter, like pellets or clay. Or, fill the box a little less full of litter. Also, clean the box more frequently. Or, if you already keep it spotless, consider leaving small amounts of waste to remind your cat that they should eliminate in the box. Transition a kitten from an uncovered to a covered box by removing the door."
