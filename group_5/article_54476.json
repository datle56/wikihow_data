      "content": "Follow the recommended calorie intake for your age group. Try to approximate how many calories you eat and drink on a daily basis. Depending on your age and sex, you might need to make some adjustments in your diet. Before making any changes, search online to determine the estimated calorie requirements for your age group. [1] X Research source For instance, men need anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 calories each day, while women need about 1,600 to 2,400. Check here to see what your recommended calorie intake is: https://www.fda.gov/media/112972/download . If you're underweight with a BMI under 18.5, consume the number of calories based on your current rather than your ideal weight. Otherwise, you'll be at risk of refeeding syndrome, which causes a disturbance in mineral balance that could be dangerous. You can increase your food intake more once your condition is stable.

      "content": "Add at least 8 servings of starchy grains to your diet. Try to eat lots of bread, rice, and pasta on a daily and weekly basis. If you’re female, try including 7-8 servings of grains into your daily calorie intake. If you’re male, aim to eat at least 10 servings per day. [3] X Research source A sandwich gives you 2 servings of grain, while ½ cup (92.5 g) of brown rice is 1 serving. Sandwiches, subs, and any other bread-heavy meals are great options for your diet. Try preparing main dishes with pasta, like spaghetti or lasagna."

      "title": "Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis.",
      "content": "Eat 5 servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. Snack on a variety of produce to boost your vitamin and mineral levels. Include these foods in both meals and snacks, so your diet can become more well-rounded with different nutrients. As you tweak your diet, opt for fruits and vegetables that are in season, since they’ll be easier to find and purchase from grocery stores. [4] X Research source One serving of fruit is about the size of your fist, while 1 serving of vegetable juice is about ½ cup (118 mL). Red produce, like tomatoes and watermelon, is full of lycopene, which helps protect your body from serious illness. Leafy green vegetables, like kale and spinach, are loaded with zeaxanthin and lutein, which helps prevent certain eye diseases. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Snack on 6-8 servings of protein each day.",
      "content": "Snack on 6-8 servings of protein each day. Opt for chicken, beef, pork, and a variety of other meat dishes to increase your protein intake. If you’re on the lookout for meat-free sources of protein, try adding nuts, eggs, and beans to your diet instead. As you prepare your meals and snacks, note that women need about 6 servings of protein per day, while men need up to 8. [6] X Research source A single serving of beef is 3 oz (85 g), while a single serving of cooked black kidney beans is ½ cup (30 g). Jerky is a great way to snack on protein on-the-go. Peanut butter is an easy but effective way to add protein to a person’s diet. Look for granola bars and other snacks that are naturally high in protein."

To help nourish your body, make sure that you’re eating and drinking foods that are high in calcium, as well as other vitamins and minerals. Try to pick up a variety of cheeses and yogurts, so you have plenty of options to choose from. [7] X Research source A single serving of low-fat or fat-free yogurt is 6 fluid ounces (180 mL), while 1 serving of low-fat milk is 1 cup (240 mL).

If you’re fixing a creamier dish, add 4 tablespoon (59.1 ml) (7.8 g) of skimmed milk powder to a dish of mashed potatoes, custard, pudding, or creamy soup. If you’d just like to increase the calorie count of a dish, try adding an extra spoonful of sugar or honey into various hot drinks, glazed vegetables, and cereal.

If your doctor recommends this option, visit your local drugstore to pick up the pills that you need. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If malnutrition is confirmed, a doctor will likely perform bloodwork to check for deficiencies, such as CBC, glucose, lipid panel, kidney panel, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and iron.

Ask a doctor if a feeding tube would be the most efficient way to combat malnutrition. If you can’t swallow effectively or correctly, allow the doctors to install a feeding tube through your nose or directly into your stomach. If the malnutrition situation is severe, this type of treatment might be the best option.

While body weight can fluctuate due to different factors, take note of any unintended weight loss that occurs over a short period of time. If you lose at least 5-10% of your body weight in between 3 to 6 months, you can safely assume that you’re malnourished. [18] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Note that it’s important to identify the underlying cause of any sudden weight loss. Talk with your doctor if you’ve lost weight suddenly without trying. Don’t mistake weight loss with your own efforts to get fit.
