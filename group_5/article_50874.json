Some men argue that having a beard trims their hygiene routine in half, mainly because they only have to touch up their beard every now and then. With this, some argue that having a beard is also more cost-effective because razors don’t need to be purchased as often. Although you may not need to shave every day, dermatologists still recommend washing your face and beard every day.

      "content": "Clean-shaven is ideal if you're going for a polished or preppy look. This style means no facial whatsoever—that means no beard, mustache, or stubble. Many men (and their partners) prefer this look because it keeps their skin soft and smooth. If you have sensitive, dry, or acne-prone skin, a clean-shaven look may be best for you because it removes an extra cause of irritation (facial hair). You may also look quite a bit younger if you go with the clean-shaven look."

While every man grows a beard for personal reasons, the thought process can be narrowed down to 2 things: appearances and health. Some men choose to grow a beard because they believe it’s manlier or suits their overall look better, whereas others follow the trend because it’s ideal for their skin. Historically, beards were extremely popular in the 1880s, with most men rocking facial hair. The trend dipped off by the 1900s; however, in recent years, it has gained a resurgence thanks to social media trends and rugged movie stars rocking awesome beards. [12] X Research source"
