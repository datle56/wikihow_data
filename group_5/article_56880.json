      "content": "Place a glass bowl in the water, and bring the water to a boil. Be sure the glass bowl floats. The bowl should not touch the bottom of the pot. If the bowl doesn't float, remove it from the water and set a round baking rack on the bottom of the pot. Then place the bowl back in the water."

      "title": "Turn the pot’s lid upside down and fill it with ice.",
      "content": "Turn the pot’s lid upside down and fill it with ice . When hot steam from the boiling water hits the cold lid, it’ll create the condensation you need for the distillation process."

      "title": "Keep boiling the water in your pot.",
      "content": "Keep boiling the water in your pot. As the water continues to boil, it will cause steam to rise and condense on the pot's lid. The condensation will drip into the bowl. Allow the distillation process to continue until you have enough distilled water in the bowl for your needs."

      "content": "Yes, distilled water is safe to drink. Distilled water doesn’t contain the calcium or magnesium that you’d get from regular tap water. However, drinking distilled water typically won’t result in mineral deficiencies, because most people will get enough minerals from their diet. [1] X Research source The biggest difference you’ll notice in drinking distilled water is the taste. The lack of minerals might make distilled water taste blander than tap water. In some cases, it might be more beneficial to drink distilled water if the tap water is unsafe."
