      "title": "Develop strong, healthy communication with your parents.",
      "content": "Develop strong, healthy communication with your parents. Because of your past, it's easy to slip back into old patterns. Build a relationship in which you communicate with each other adult-to-adult. This likely involves sitting down with your parents and explaining that even though you're moving back in with them (or not moving out), you are still a growing adult and expect to be treated that way. [2] X Research source If things get too tense, simply say, \"I'm feeling overwhelmed and need some privacy.\" Then, you can continue the conversation once you've had a chance to decompress. You might also come up with a safe word or hand signal that either you or your parents can use when you're overwhelmed in the moment and need some time to yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respect your parents' privacy.",
      "content": "Respect your parents' privacy. Remember that your parents have boundaries too. Pay attention to their needs and wants and go along with what they say. It can help to think of your parents as adult roommates—they need their space as much as you do. After all, they've sacrificed quiet moments and personal space that they once had to themselves. [3] X Research source For example, you might agree to stay with a friend so they can have the house to themselves at least one night a week. When in doubt, follow their lead. For example, if they keep their bedroom door closed, you might keep yours closed as well."

    {
      "title": "Let your parents know your plans when you go out.",
      "content": "Let your parents know your plans when you go out. Tell your parents about your general routine from the outset so they always have at least a vague idea of where you're going to be and what you're going to be doing. Let them know that they can get in touch with you on your mobile phone if they need you for anything. [4] X Research source It's also helpful to call or text and ask if they need anything if you're going out. For example, if you're headed to the grocery store, you might ask if you can pick anything up for them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss potential houseguests in advance.",
      "content": "Discuss potential houseguests in advance. If you're planning on having someone over, avoid conflict with your parents by letting them know at least a few days before. This gives you time to talk about boundaries and what your parents consider to be appropriate behavior. [5] X Research source For example, if your parents aren't okay with your significant other spending the night, don't push it. Accept that they've set that boundary. If you want to spend the night with your significant other, you can go to their place or plan a weekend trip out of town with them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a space for yourself.",
      "content": "Create a space for yourself. You likely have your own room, but you also want to make sure that it's your private space and your parents will leave you alone when you're there. If you work remotely, you might also want to carve out a separate space where you can work without being bothered. [6] X Research source For example, you might let your parents know that when the door to your room is closed, they should knock before entering."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a plan to move out on your own.",
      "content": "Make a plan to move out on your own. Set realistic personal, professional, and financial goals —then stick to them! Don't worry if it ends up taking you more time than you originally intended. As long as you're making steady progress, you're fine. [7] X Research source Share your plans with your parents and give them updates on your progress. Think of them as partners—they're helping you out and have a vested interest in your success."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay for your own expenses.",
      "content": "Pay for your own expenses. Most adult children who live with their parents pay something toward the household bills. Even if your parents aren't making you pay rent, you can still buy your own groceries and contribute toward utilities and other household expenses. Set down with your parents to create a budget and talk about what you can afford. [8] X Research source If you don't yet have a job when you move in, revisit this budget once you've found something. Take it upon yourself to bring it up—it shows your parents that you're being responsible. Even if you and your parents have agreed that you should be saving up for a deposit or down payment, you can still contribute something to cover the cost you add by living there."

    {
      "title": "Respect the house and your parents' possessions.",
      "content": "Respect the house and your parents' possessions. Your parents' boundaries likely also relate to the way they expect you to behave in their house. They might want you to take your shoes off when you enter or only eat in the kitchen or dining room. When you respect these rules, it shows your parents that you're mature enough to eventually start living on your own and that you don't expect them to take care of you anymore. [9] X Research source If you, your children, or your friends damage something in the house, apologize sincerely to your parents and make plans to repair or replace it (at your own expense) as soon as possible."

      "title": "Help out your parents with household chores.",
      "content": "Help out your parents with household chores. Take care of your own responsibilities, including doing your own laundry and cleaning up after yourself. In addition, helping to clean the common areas of the house and doing various chores without being asked shows your parents that you aren't taking advantage of them and that you're capable of living on your own. [10] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. For example, if you see that the trash can is getting full, you might take the trash out and replace the liner rather than shoving it down or leaving it for someone else to do. Vacuuming or sweeping and mopping the kitchen and living areas also shows your parents that you respect them and want to be helpful and responsible. Be consistent with whatever you do. For example, if you decide to vacuum the living room once, go ahead and plan to do it once a week."

      "title": "Show your appreciation for your parents' help.",
      "content": "Show your appreciation for your parents' help. Regardless of the circumstances that caused you to remain living with your parents, a little appreciation goes a long way. Doing special things for them from time to time shows that you're grateful that they've gone out of their way to accommodate you and your needs. [11] X Research source For example, you might make them dinner once or twice a week and buy them a nice bottle of wine to share. You might also give them a date night out with movie tickets and a gift card to their favorite restaurant."

      "title": "Make your own decisions without parental input.",
      "content": "Make your own decisions without parental input. Just because you've moved back home with your parents doesn't mean that they're in charge of your life. The more decisions you can make on your own, the more independent you'll feel and be. Building confidence in your decision-making abilities will help you out in the long run. [12] X Research source For example, if you're separated from your spouse and have a child, work out child care with your spouse rather than with your parents. This doesn't mean you can't ask your parents for advice! But when you talk to them, already have a decision made—then you can ask what they think of your decision, rather than what they think you should do."

      "title": "Spend most of your time outside of the house.",
      "content": "Spend most of your time outside of the house. Take walks around the neighborhood, go to a park, or visit the library every day. You'll feel more independent if you spend most of your time out on your own instead of in your parents' environment. Being out of their home also gives you the time and space to think freely. [13] X Expert Source Kirsten Thompson, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. This is especially important if you work remotely, or if your parents are retired or also work remotely. You need time apart from each other to keep your relationship healthy."

      "title": "Go out with your friends on a regular basis.",
      "content": "Go out with your friends on a regular basis. If you've recently moved back in with your folks after living on your own, you might feel awkward about hanging out with your friends who are living on their own—don't! There are plenty of people who move back in with their parents, for lots of reasons, and there's no reason to feel awkward or embarrassed about it. [14] X Research source Keeping up with your own life will help you feel more independent and as though you're living your own life, even if you are living with your parents. Friends are also important for emotional support, especially if you're going through a difficult time after having to move back in with your parents."

      "title": "Provide adequate care for any children you have.",
      "content": "Provide adequate care for any children you have. If you have kids, talk with your parents about the role they want to have in your kids' lives and how much time they want to spend with them. Even if your parents are retired, don't just assume they're going to be free babysitters. While they might be more than willing to help out, remember that they've already done the job of raising kids—and might not want to start over again. [15] X Research source Set boundaries for your kids as well. Let them know about any rules your parents have and provide areas where they can do homework or play quietly and be out of the way."
