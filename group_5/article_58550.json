      "content": "Apps like Tinder and Bumble are great for meeting someone new. Currently, there aren’t any trustworthy or notable dating apps created just for pregnant women, but you can still find plenty of success on the usual sites with some savvy navigating. Just be sure to check out your match’s social media to get an idea of who they are and be liberal with the block button to filter out the creeps. [1] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Tinder : Perhaps the most-used dating app, this one is great for the sheer number of matches you may get. But since it’s the most popular, it might also have the most duds. Bumble : Another popular app, this one lets female users send the first message, making it much easier to tailor your matches and decide who to talk to, which is handy when looking for an open-minded partner. eHarmony : Users on this site are typically looking for something long-term, making it ideal for pregnant women who want a partner who’s ready to commit. AdultFriendFinder : This site has some of the most diverse and open-minded users, many of whom are perfectly okay with a pregnant partner. Match : A well-established site, this service tends to prioritize its users’ safety, making it ideal for pregnant women. CoffeeMeetsBagel : This is a site where matches are served to female users, who then choose whether or not they want to move forward with the match, meaning it gives women the power to tailor their own experiences. Silver Singles : This site is for older users, who tend to have more experience and therefore. may be more receptive to a pregnant partner. Because of the age demographic, many users are already parents themselves, and may be more understanding of your situation.

      "content": "Reveal only as much info as you're comfortable with on your profile. Don’t feel pressured to include your pregnancy in your bio. Just as with any other user, your privacy is your right, and you don’t have to divulge any sensitive information that you don’t want to. [2] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Plus, advertising that you’re pregnant straight away might attract some unsavory characters, like fetishists or people looking to harass or lecture single moms. It’s important to protect your peace! When writing your bio , include anything you want a potential match to know about yourself, like your personality, interests, and what sort of partner you’re looking for. If you don’t want to reveal your pregnancy in your profile, be sure to use pictures of yourself pre-pregnancy, or before you’ve started to show. Narrow your dating pool to partners who are more likely to be open-minded about your pregnancy by including something like, “Looking for someone who likes kids,” or, “Going to be a mom someday!”"

      "content": "Prioritize your safety, and don’t hesitate to dip for any reason. When using dating apps, whether you’re pregnant or not, make safety and comfort your top concern. Meet in a public place, like a coffee shop, and let a trusted friend know where you’re going and when you expect to be back. If you meet someone from an app, trust your instincts, and if the vibe feels off, don’t hesitate to excuse yourself or to call a trusted friend to come get you. [3] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Also, call your friend partway through the date to check in, and let your date know early on that your friend is expecting a check-in. It’s just a routine safety measure, and any reasonable date won’t have any objections. In addition, plan your own transportation, and don’t rely on your date for a ride. Take your own car, ask a friend to drive, or check the bus schedule beforehand. In a pinch, notify an employee at the venue that you’re feeling uncomfortable on your date; many employees are trained or generally willing to lend a hand."

      "content": "Ask yourself what you’re looking for in a date to avoid disappointment. Some soon-to-be moms are looking for someone to settle down and raise their child with, while others just want to have a little fun before they become a full-time mom. [4] X Research source Whatever the reason, take a moment to think about your own motivations for putting yourself out there. Identifying those reasons for yourself will help you know what to expect, and also help you set a game-plan for when things get rolling. For example, if you’re just looking for fun, you might be very casual or open about the fact that you’re pregnant. If you’re looking for a long-term partner, you might want to be a bit more strategic with your cards in order to find a man who’s up to the task."

      "title": "Let your date know you’re pregnant sooner rather than later.",
      "content": "Let your date know you’re pregnant sooner rather than later. Fill them in on your situation before things get serious. Some pregnant women wait until after the first or even second date to reveal that they’re expecting. [5] X Research source Others let their match know before they meet for the first time, or even as soon as they feel that their match is potential date material. Whenever you tell them is your choice, but it’s best to let them know before things get serious. After all, they’re going to find out when you start to show (or sooner), and filling them in early helps weed out the duds and saves you some time. When the time comes, say something like, “I’ve really liked getting to know you, and now I feel comfortable telling you something about myself.” Communicate clearly so that your date understands the situation. Also consider telling them how far along you are, and if you have any short- or long-term plans. Letting them know you’re prepared might help them absorb the information more easily."

      "content": "Be ready for unexpected mood swings or bodily changes. You probably already know that pregnancy comes with a hefty helping of changes. During your date, you might experience anything from sudden nausea, lower-back pressure, heartburn, or gas. [6] X Research source Bring along some pregnancy-safe medication, like Tums to take in a pinch, and don’t be afraid to excuse yourself to the bathroom if you need a moment. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Pregnancy hormones might also affect your emotions during your date, so it’s a good idea to take things slow and mentally review the date afterward or talk it through with a friend to take stock of your feelings. Go ahead and dress up for your date! Try to choose clothes that are comfortable and make you feel good. Looser tops are great for hiding a baby bump."

[8] X Research source In order to build a real relationship, you might have to answer them as best you can. Stay patient and courteous, but don’t be afraid to draw the line. If any question makes you feel uneasy or uncomfortable, answer with something like, “Sorry, I understand that’s something you want to know, but I’m not feeling up to answering it. Maybe we circle back to that later?”"

      "content": "Feel free to take things to the bedroom if it feels right. Pregnant women can have sex without any significant risk to their developing baby—your child is protected by both your internal organs and plenty of amniotic fluid, and pregnancy sex isn’t a serious concern when it comes to miscarrying. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If it feels right, go for it! If it doesn’t, that’s your choice, too. While you can’t get pregnant again while you’re already pregnant, it’s still a good idea to use a condom and practice safe sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Avoid having sex while pregnant if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding, are leaking amniotic fluid, or are experiencing any other unusual pains or sensations. Consult a doctor immediately if any of these apply."
