      "content": "Understand the relationship between inches and millimeters. One inch is internationally accepted as being equivalent to 25.4 millimeters. [2] X Research source Written as an equation, this relationship is represented as: 1 in = 25.4 mm This official, standardized measurement has been set on international records since 1959. Both inches and millimeters are units of measurement. Inches belong to the English system of measurement, while millimeters belong to the metric system of measurement. While inches are used in the United States, you will often need to convert this unit of measurement to one belonging to the metric system (like millimeters) for scientific purposes. Conversely, there are 0.0393700787402 inches in one millimeter. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Multiply this measurement by 25 .4. You need to multiply the current inches measurement by the ratio of millimeters to inches, or 25.4 mm / 1 in. The inches value in this ratio needs to be placed in the denominator since it will have to cancel out the inches value in your original measurement. Once all the inches are canceled out, the millimeters will be the only remaining unit of measurement. Example: 7 in * (25.4 mm / 1 in) = 177.8 mm * (in/in) = 177.8 mm"

If your original measurement is 12 inches or below, you can use one of these rulers to measure the same distance in millimeters. Note that the millimeter marks on a ruler are all the small dashes in between the larger centimeter measurements. There should be 10 mm per 1 cm."
