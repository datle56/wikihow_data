      "content": "It takes 6 to 12 sessions to get rid of a tattoo with laser removal. The exact number of sessions depends on a number of factors, including things like the size and color of the tattoo and its placement on your body. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some tattoos may go away after only 2 or 3 sessions, while others may take more than 12. Your removal technician will make an estimate of how many sessions you need during your initial consultation. Sometimes, their estimate can change after 2 or 3 sessions depending on how the tattoo removal progresses."

      "title": "The age of the tattoo",
      "content": "The age of the tattoo Older tattoos are easier to remove than newer ones. Old tattoos are often faded and less sharp than new ones because your immune system has been slowly removing ink particles over the years. The ink molecules may have also broken down from age and sun exposure. This makes it easier for lasers to break down the ink and fade the tattoo . [2] X Research source New tattoos with most or all of the original ink intact take more treatments to remove. If the tattoo is very recent, you may not be eligible for laser removal until every layer of skin has fully healed."

      "title": "The tattoo’s placement on your body",
      "content": "The tattoo’s placement on your body Tattoos on fattier areas near your heart are easier to laser away than those on bony extremities, like your lower limbs, hands, or feet. This is because your white blood cells pick up shattered ink particles from the laser and filter them out of your body through your lymphatic and vascular systems. [3] X Research source This happens faster in areas like your head, neck, and upper torso because your lymphatic and vascular systems are stronger there than in other parts of the body."

    {
      "title": "The ink color and type",
      "content": "The ink color and type Black and dark gray inks are the easiest to remove because they absorb the most light from the lasers (pure black ink can perfectly absorb a white laser wavelength (1064 nm), making it the most efficient to remove). Lighter colors like red, orange, yellow, and pink are the next easiest to remove with a 532 nm laser and take about the same number of sessions as black ink. [4] X Research source Blue, green, and purple require a 694 nm or 755 nm laser and respond more slowly, resulting in more sessions. White and flesh tones are also tricky and may be impossible to 100% remove. Ink made with simple compounds breaks down more easily than ink with additives for brightness or shine. The darker and less vivid the ink, the fewer sessions you’ll need. Tip: When you’re choosing a laser removal studio, make sure they have a range of lasers available to treat all of the colors of your tattoo."

      "title": "The size of the tattoo",
      "content": "The size of the tattoo The bigger the tattoo, the longer it will take to remove. [5] X Research source Small tattoos fade more quickly than something like a sleeve or massive back piece because there’s less ink to break down. In some cases, a tiny tattoo (just a few square inches) may take fewer than 6 sessions. An extra large tattoo might not be fully zapped in one session, meaning you’ll need two appointments just to give it one treatment. However, you can schedule these appointments fairly close together compared to the recommended 6-8 weeks between regular treatments."

    {
      "title": "Past touchups",
      "content": "Past touchups If you’ve had your tattoo touched up or covered with a new design, that means there’s more ink in your skin for the lasers to break up, which takes more laser sessions to remove. The shading and design of your tattoo can play a role, too. If some parts of your tat have more layers of ink than others, it’ll fade unevenly (with the darker sections needing more treatments to fully get rid of)."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Professionals often use more ink and apply it at a consistently deep level in your skin, and may have access to more ink colors that are harder to laser away. [7] X Research source Amateurs, on the other hand, typically use less ink and deposit it at varying depths. This means it usually takes fewer treatments to remove them."

      "title": "Scarring",
      "content": "Scarring If there’s any scar tissue within your tattoo, those areas will be harder to laser away and will take more sessions to remove. [8] X Research source Scarring might be caused by an amateur tattoo artist using poor technique, too many touchups or coverups, or an injury to the skin."

      "title": "Your skin tone",
      "content": "Your skin tone It takes more sessions to remove tattoos from darker skin than from lighter skin. Since light skin has less melanin, it will reflect most of the laser instead of absorbing it. This means the technician can be more aggressive with the laser since there’s a lower risk of skin discoloration. Folks with dark skin need a less aggressive laser to avoid side effects, so it takes more sessions overall. [9] X Research source The laser is also more effective when there’s high contrast between your skin and the tattoo ink. It seems counterintuitive, but very pale people with dark tattoos are actually the easiest to treat. If you have a medium skin tone, you may experience temporary hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) after removal. This is typically reversible if you follow your aftercare instructions. Folks with dark skin may experience temporary hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin). Hypopigmentation takes longer to heal than hyperpigmentation, but will eventually go away with proper aftercare."

      "content": "The strength of your immune system The healthier you are, the faster your tattoo will fade. Folks with compromised immune systems (from medical conditions, certain medications like oral steroids, or treatments like chemotherapy) filter out the broken down ink less efficiently, meaning it takes more sessions to remove a tattoo. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source People who smoke or have a sedentary lifestyle also usually require more sessions for full removal. Tip: Give your immune system a boost before and during your removal treatment by quitting smoking , staying hydrated, and exercising regularly. This will help make your sessions more efficient and fade the tattoo faster. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Aftercare compliance If you take care of your tattoo carefully according to your removal technician’s instructions, you’ll likely need fewer sessions to get rid of it. Aftercare helps your skin heal from the lasers and preps you for your next session. [12] X Research source The guidelines may vary slightly based on your specific tattoo, skin, and the type of laser used, but you can generally expect the following: [13] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Avoid sun exposure when possible and apply sunscreen every 2 hours if you have to be outdoors with the tattoo uncovered (use SPF 30+ with zinc oxide for the best results). Be careful not to bang or scrape the area on anything, and resist the urge to scratch, pick, rub, or peel the site. Clean the area daily by taking a shower and allowing the water to wash over the tattoo (no scrubbing). Apply a healing moisturizer like Aquaphor (or whatever your technician recommends) 2-3 times a day. Keep the tattoo covered in loose gauze after applying your moisturizer for about a week. Don’t swim or use a hot tub until your skin heals, and hold off an exercise that makes you perspire for at least 2-7 days."
