The 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3.2 mm) tubing should bend easily around the pencil. You will need enough coiled tubing to stretch across the top of the can, plus about an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) of straight tubing on each side."

Then, bend them again so that they reach below the base of the can. When you're done, you should have a coiled section of tubing in the middle over your candle that stretches downward into two opposite-facing \"jets\" on either side of the can."

If these coals don't have a steady supply of oxygen, they won't be able to burn well. Allow ventilation by drilling or punching a series of holes in a half-circle pattern along the edge of the can's lid. These ventilation holes should ideally be about 2 ⁄ 5 inch (1.0 cm) in diameter."

Starting from this point, wrap the tubing into five coils 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter. Wind the remaining length of the tubing into about 15 coils 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.

Insert 1 6 inches (15 cm) copper pipe with a diameter of 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) through the cable clamp connector so that the tubing protrudes a few centimeters below the hole in the junction box.

Place the dowel rod and skewer inside the copper pipe in the metal junction box so that the skewer points up. The skewer and dowel rod will act as the \"piston\" when the engine is running. To make the motion of the piston easier to see, you might want to attach a small paper \"flag\" to the top. [2] X Research source"

Remove the junction box assembly from the small upper can and fill the upper can with water, allowing it to drain into the copper coil until the can is about 2/3 full of water. Check all connectors for leaks and ensure all seals are tight. Secure the lids of both cans by tapping them with a hammer. Replace the junction box in its spot above the small upper can."

      "title": "Run the engine!",
      "content": "Run the engine! Crumple up pieces of newspaper and place them in the space enclosed by mesh at the bottom of the engine. When the charcoal has caught fire, allow the briquettes to burn for about 20-30 minutes. As they heat the water in the coil, steam should begin to build up in the upper can. When this steam reaches sufficient pressure, it will push the dowel and skewer piston upwards. [3] X Research source Once sufficient pressure has been released, the piston will be pulled back down by gravity. Trim pieces off of the skewer as needed to reduce the weight of the piston - the lighter it is, the more frequently it will \"pop\" up. Try to whittle the skewer down to a weight such that the piston \"runs\" at a constant clip. You can speed up the burning process by using a hair dryer to blow through the ventilation holes."

      "title": "Be safe.",
      "content": "Be safe. It probably goes without saying that this DIY steam engine requires careful handling and operation. Never run the steam engine indoors. Never run it around flammable material like dry leaves or overhanging trees. Only run it on a tough, non-flammable surface like concrete. If you're working with children, ensure an adult is present to supervise at all times. Do not children or teenagers approach the engine while the charcoal is burning. If you're ever not sure how hot the engine is, assume that it's too hot to touch. Also, be sure that the steam is able to escape from the upper \"boiler\". If the piston becomes stuck for some reason, pressure can build up inside the small can. In a worst case scenario, this can cause the can to explode, which can be very dangerous."
