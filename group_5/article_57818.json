It's normal to occasionally skip a beat, but if your pulse has an irregular rhythm for the whole 30 seconds, especially if it is very fast and/or you are over 65, you might have a condition called atrial fibrillation.

Fitness trackers that fit onto your wrist (and don't connect to any other sensors on your body) are pretty good at measuring your resting heart rate. But they tend to be less accurate above 100 beats per minute, and very inaccurate over 130 bpm. If you use one of these trackers and feel like you've pushed yourself past your limit, stop and check your pulse by hand instead of trusting the display.

In general, certain technologies are better than others: [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Monitors with a strap that wraps around your chest are the most accurate. This is the only type of fitness tracker recommended for cardiac patients. (Note that some older models have trouble working near electrical devices.)
