      "content": "Find a new job that correlates with your skills through online job sites. Don’t assume you need to do the same job as the position you lost. If you lost your job because it was obsolete, it will be very hard to find the same job again. If you’re unlikely to find new employment in your old field, look for a new type of job. Look on websites like Monster, LinkedIn, or Indeed, and search for jobs that differ from your previous work. Think of ways in which you can apply skills you already have to a new line of work. For example, if you worked in a factory, your job may have been taken over by an automated machine. But, if you gained administrative skills at your factory job, you could find a way to channel those into a job in a new field."
