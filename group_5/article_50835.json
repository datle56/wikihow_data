      "content": "Keep to yourself at school functions. If you have to go to school functions, like a pep rally or assembly, sit by yourself if you can. Sit at the back of the room if possible. You may want to put on headphones and listen to music, read a book, or play on your phone. [1] X Research source If you can, try to get out of going to school functions.

      "content": "Sit alone at lunch. Lunch is one of the most common times during the school day where people socialize. However, if you want to be a loner, you should sit alone if you can. Try sitting at a table by yourself or on the floor, if your school allows that. If you cannot sit in an area by yourself, sit at the end of a table with people you don't know. Find solitary activities to do during lunch. For example, you can draw, read, or listen to music. If your school will allow it, go to the library or a teacher's classroom where you can eat lunch alone. If your school has open lunch, you can go up town to restaurants and other places to eat lunch or you can go home if you live close to the school."

If your teacher makes you participate with others, do what you have to do well in the class. Play basketball or volleyball on the team, but don't go out of your way to talk to people. If your teacher will allow you to, sit on the bleachers or off to the side whenever you can."

      "content": "Avoid starting conversations with people. Loners keep to themselves and don’t go out of their way to talk to other students. This means you wouldn’t go up to someone and start talking to them, or join in a conversation when you’re in a group. Instead, you should keep to yourself.

You may consider getting a tutor through the Boys and Girls Club or with a local college kid who can teach you a skill.
