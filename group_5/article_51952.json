Along the way, you have run-ins with either Team Magma (Ruby) or Team Aqua (Sapphire), villainous organizations that are hoping to wake up a certain Legendary Pokémon (Groudon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire).

After returning to Birch’s lab, the Professor upgrades your Pokédex to National level—in other words, it catalogs all Gen 1 and 2 Pokémon (in addition to Gen 3). [8] X Research source The main catch is that you have to trade with other Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen users to get the other Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokémon that aren’t already available in the game."
