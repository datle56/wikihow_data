      "content": "Fake Airpods may have flawed or low-quality packaging. Genuine Apple product packaging features premium printing, sharp text, and a precise, secure fit. In contrast, a counterfeit Fake AirPods Max box may have blurry text, misaligned graphics, a loose and sloppy fit, missing words, typos, etc. Authentic AirPods must say “AirPods Max” on the side of the box. Additionally, examine the headphones themselves for any obvious defects, including misaligned seams, uneven stitching, or cheap-feeling materials. To identify inconsistencies, compare the physical product against official Apple images and descriptions."

      "content": "Feel the buttons for sturdy build quality. The true test for identifying genuine AirPods Max headphones is the feel and responsiveness of the buttons. Authentic AirPods Max have metal pairing buttons that provide a smooth, solid click and no audible sound when pressed. In contrast, counterfeit models often have buttons that make noise and feel stiff, with limited button travel. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Authentic Airpods Max will have a small hole in the speaker housing.",
      "content": "Authentic Airpods Max will have a small hole in the speaker housing. Removing the magnetic ear cushion from your headphones will expose a small hole at the top of the speaker housing, as well as flush-mount screws securing the housing in place. This hole allows you to detach the headband. [3] X Research source The headband on genuine headphones should never break, unlike fake ones that aren’t likely to hold up. Authentic APM headbands have metal ends. Counterfeit products may employ flush-mounted screws, but these screws often require a larger screwdriver bit for removal. Additionally, there is typically no access hole to detach the headband. Additionally, the speaker portion inside the housing should have thick, legible letters indicating which speaker is left and right. (Fake ones are often written in thin letters.) Fake Max AirPods may have their sound diffuser holes placed too close together, while an authentic pair’s are placed further away from each other."

      "content": "Check to make sure the charging port LED is flush to the surface. The charging ports on counterfeit units often have distorted material surrounding them, which alters the direction of light, particularly when the ear cup is made of plastic instead of metal. On counterfeit units, the indicator LED is frequently either recessed or protruding, rather than flush with the surface. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Authentic Airpods Max will have metal speaker housings.",
      "content": "Authentic Airpods Max will have metal speaker housings. Real APMs typically feature metal housings, while counterfeit ones usually have plastic bodies. One of the easiest ways to spot a counterfeit is the use of plastic components, as all the shiny parts on authentic APMs are made of metal that will feel cool to the touch. [5] X Research source The plastic parts on fakes are more prone to breaking. Furthermore, the headband on real APMs is crafted from highly flexible plastic that should never snap—if the headband breaks, it's a clear indication that the product is not genuine."

      "content": "The price of authentic Airpods Max usually runs around $550. Fake APM's are typically found at a fraction of that cost, and you may see them priced as low as $250 on third-party marketplaces like Facebook, Temu, and AliExpress. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Request a return or refund from the seller.",
      "content": "Request a return or refund from the seller. If you bought a pair of fake APMs, then you didn’t purchase them through Apple. You will need to contact the seller and request a return for a refund. If you don’t hear back from the seller, then contact the website or marketplace directly. For example, if you bought the APMs on eBay, you will need to reach out to eBay and explain the issue. If the marketplace is unable to help you, reach out to your bank. Each bank is different, but beginning a claim on a counterfeit product can usually get things moving in order to get your money back."
