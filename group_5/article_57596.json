      "content": "Create a local area network (LAN) in your home or office. This involves connecting computers, printers, modems, and other devices. To create a LAN, you should have at least 2 computers. Use network interface cards (NICs) to build the connection for your LAN. NICs are hardware that you can insert into the motherboards of your computers to add ports that will allow you to establish your network. Insert a crossover cable into the ports of the network interface cards. This cable allows your computers to communicate. Connect modems, printers and other devices to the computers to complete your network."

If you are a company creating an intranet, you may choose to hire a web designer or select a team from your management pool to design your intranet. Decide what type of information you want to include on your intranet. Some common options include an organizational chart, a staff directory, wiki pages, a calendar, frequently used and shared documents, and a message board. Draw out the sequence of your intranet pages on paper, including the homepage and the order of the pages as you want them presented in the menu on your intranet site. Design a menu representing the major pages on your intranet. The menu should appear on each page to allow users to navigate from page to page and back to the homepage. Make sure the menu links to all of your pages."
