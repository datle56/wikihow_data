You could ask your father, uncle, grandfather, male teacher, or a male guidance counselor. Instead of having the conversation with a male figure, you could ask them to connect you with a female they know who would be willing to talk with you about this, like a coworker or neighbor."

Have the conversation in a place where you feel comfortable, like at home, in your guidance counselor's office, or in a doctor's office."
