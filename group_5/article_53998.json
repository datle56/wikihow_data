There is some debate on whether or not Error Code 1001 ever existed on Roblox. Some users claim the error code was removed in 2013; others claim it never existed and point to the Start Survey Game on Roblox as a culprit. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "First a vague blog post, then perpetuated on TikTok as a scary warning. In early 2022, someone posted on the Roblox Rise of Nations Wiki that they kept encountering a 1001 error message, and had no idea what it was. In early August of 2023, TikToker @grotyneverdies2 picked up the error and made mock-ups of it with a \"Possible Raid Warning\" header, but stated that the error disappeared in 2013. The error also implies that Roblox can sense other devices on your network. [2] X Research source Some screenshots of the error are from another horror game on Roblox called \"Start Survey.\" The point of this game is to scare the player, and this fake error code can be alarming."

      "content": "People like to speculate what the error would look like if it still existed. Since the error message was removed in 2013, people like to speculate now what the error would look like nowadays, and create more mock-ups that are similar to @grotyneverdies2's creation. Fear is a powerful motivation and that's why this fake error message is still circulating!"
