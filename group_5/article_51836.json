      "content": "Chaotic Neutral is one of the nine Character Alignments from D&D. A character’s Alignment System represents their moral and ethical outlook on life, the universe, and everything in between. It’s to create “ideals” for characters to live up to in roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons. [1] X Research source A neutral character is neither good nor evil. Their actions and behaviors are meant to benefit only them. However, they may not engage in evil acts like murder. On the other hand, good characters strive to help society, and evil characters will go to any lengths to get what they want. The Character Alignment system is popular amongst many successful novelists, playwrights, screenwriters, and video game designers because it helps create complex fictional characters. [2] X Research source Popular characters: Captain Jack Sparrow, Deadpool, Catwoman, Hulk, Loki, Zuko from Avatar, Vegeta from Dragonball Z, and Harley Quinn."

      "content": "Chaotic Neutral characters strive for absolute freedom and individuality. The next time you watch TV, pay attention to the character that plays by their own rules. They often go against the status quo, which refers to society’s current social structure of values, and strive to fulfill their agenda—even if it means ruining their relationships. [3] X Research source These characters have one thing on their mind: their freedom and individuality. Loki, the God of Mischief in the MCU, is an excellent representation of a Chaotic Neutral character. He uses trickery and mischief to get away with whatever he wants. Whether that means working for Thanos or going against him, he decides how the current situation will help him succeed. [4] X Research source What separates Loki from being “Evil” is that he has moments where he helps those he cares about, like his brother Thor."

      "content": "A Character Alignment chart is a cross-shaped axis. Picture a cross or a lowercase “t” shape. The vertical line determines how good or evil someone is, while the horizontal line represents how well a character can play by the rules or not. A Chaotic Neutral character is at the center of the Alignment chart, where both lines meet because they’re neither good nor evil and make their own rules. [5] X Research source In comparison, a Chaotic Evil character would be someone who ranks low on both the vertical line and horizontal lines. [6] X Research source"
