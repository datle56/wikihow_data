      "content": "Check to see whether she's willing to kiss other girls. Before you try to persuade the girl to kiss you, be sure your advances are appreciated, so don't be too aggressive. If the girl is into women/girls she will likely be open to kissing other ladies; however, if she is simply curious, open to new experiences, and loves to experiment, you may have a chance, but be gentle in your approach and show signals of interest."

      "content": "Freshen your breath. Try to keep your breath fresh at all times—no one enjoys kissing someone who has bad breath. Breath spray, chewing gum, or a box of mints are all useful items to have on hand. [1] X Research source You should also soften your lips with lip balm (not sticky, thick lip gloss!) before kissing."

      "title": "Ask if your partner is comfortable with kissing.",
      "content": "Ask if your partner is comfortable with kissing. Don't try to force it. When the time is right, the best kisses are those that occur organically. If you aren't sure if your partner wants to kiss, you can simply ask or say, “Hey, wanna make out?” If you’re less certain, try something like “I’d really like to kiss you right now. Is that okay?” If they agree, you could try asking if it’s okay to go further. For example, “Can I touch you here?” [2] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 2438 wikiHow readers who've kissed girls, and only 8% of them agreed that the best sign she wants to kiss you is when she gently touches you. [Take Poll] Asking directly is a much better way to know for sure than just trying to read her body language."

      "title": "Make eye contact.",
      "content": "Make eye contact. To signify that you're ready for some action, meet your kissing partner's eyes and give them a small smile. Before you start kissing, you can rest your head against your kissing partner's, place your hand on their face, touch their leg, or even give them a short peck on the lips. This helps to establish a connection and makes your partner more willing to kiss you; if you swoop in without notice, the kissing session may be unpleasant."

      "title": "Start off slowly and be gentle.",
      "content": "Start off slowly and be gentle. Doing things slowly, especially in the beginning and when changing positions, is the greatest approach to avoid head-butting, elbowing, and clanking teeth. You can introduce more intense kissing techniques as time goes on, but they can only be sustained for so long. Always slow down to a comfortable pace. [3] X Research source Start with a kiss on the lips, then glide your tongue into your partner's mouth slowly as they do the same."

      "title": "Keep things light.",
      "content": "Keep things light. This isn't a movie where everything is perfectly arranged! You're both human, and no matter how many directions you read, there will be awkward moments. If something embarrassing occurs, quickly diffuse the situation with some light laughs or a soft push. Making out is about having a good time as much as it is about being turned on."

      "title": "Keep your hands busy.",
      "content": "Keep your hands busy. This isn't to say you should aggressively grope your kissing partner whenever you get the chance. If you don't keep your hands properly planted on your lap, you'll be more comfortable kissing. Try to explore your kissing partner's body after you're comfortable, especially if you're sitting down — as long as you're both happy with it. Simply move your hands every now and again to avoid becoming caught in the same old dull position. Cupping their face, stroking their waist, or holding hands are all good options. [4] X Research source You can run your fingers through your partner's hair from front to back, all the way down to their neck if they have short hair. You can also tuck a stray strand of hair behind their ear."

      "title": "Take breaks.",
      "content": "Take breaks. If you wish to take a break or stop kissing, move away from your partner slowly while giving them one last passionate kiss. You don't have to come to an abrupt conclusion. When you begin to feel exhausted or realize that you must go soon, begin carefully distancing yourself from the scenario. Don't feel bad about it. Everyone needs a break now and then. Taking a break from kissing is entirely acceptable, and it may even assist you in getting back into the kissing mindset. If you're exhausted but don't want to stop kissing yet, just take a breather, slow down your kissing pace, or don't be ashamed to ask for a glass of water."

      "title": "Tell the girl how much you enjoyed it.",
      "content": "Tell the girl how much you enjoyed it. Tell your kissing partner how much you enjoyed it. Giving your significant other a big hug, one last kiss, or a big smile or \"I love kissing you\". If you truly mean it, even \"I can't get enough of you\" will do. So that it can happen again, your special someone should feel confident and pleased about what just happened."
