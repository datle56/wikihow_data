    {
      "title": "Peter",
      "content": "Peter Peter (originally named Simon in Greek) was given the name Peter (meaning “rock”) by Jesus. He was considered the leader of the 12 apostles; he was the main spokesman for them, authored two epistles of the New Testament, and traveled as far as Babylon to do evangelistic and missionary work among the Jews. As a person, Peter was loyal, adventurous, and chivalrous but also impulsive and prone to fits of anger. He denied Jesus three times before his crucifixion, but through repentance, regained his honor and spent the rest of his life as a fervent apostle and believer. All in all, Peter is a very flawed, realistic, human figure in the Bible who always persevered and picked himself up from his failures and mistakes. [1] X Research source Role in the apostles: Leader and spokesman; part of Jesus’ inner circle. Profession: Peter was a fisherman in Bethsaida and Capernaum with his brother and fellow apostle, Andrew. How did he die? Peter was martyred and crucified upside down in Rome (he did not feel he was worthy of being crucified upright like Jesus). Apostolic symbol: An upside down cross beneath a pair of crossed keys."

    {
      "title": "Andrew",
      "content": "Andrew Andrew was Peter’s brother and was the one that introduced Peter to Jesus. In fact, Andrew’s primary role was introducing new followers to Jesus to help spread his teachings. He was seen as a sidekick or somewhat lesser known apostle next to his brother Peter, but remained loyal and optimistic instead of becoming jealous or resentful. He preached as far away as Scythia (modern Iran), Greece, and Asia Minor. [2] X Research source Role in the apostles: Introducing others to Jesus. Profession: Andrew was a fisherman in Bethsaida and Capernaum with his brother and fellow apostle, Peter. How did he die? Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross in Patras, Greece for converting the Governor Aepeas’ wife to Christianity. He requested an X-shaped cross since he didn’t feel worthy being crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus. Apostolic symbols: St. Andrew's Cross or a cross of two fish."

    {
      "title": "James",
      "content": "James James, son of Zebedee, was the brother of fellow apostle John. In fact, his name doesn’t appear alone apart from John’s at any point in the New Testament, and they were considered an inseparable pair. The New Testament doesn’t say much about James, but he was considered courageous, forgiving, and faithful despite “living in the shadow” of his brother. He preached throughout Jerusalem and Judea. [3] X Research source Role in the apostles: Part of Jesus’ inner circle. Profession: James was a fisherman in Bethsaida with his brother and fellow apostle, John. How did he die? James was beheaded by King Herod of Judea in AD 44 and was the first of the apostles to become a martyr. Apostolic symbol: Three seashells, symbolizing his pilgrimage by sea."
    },
    {
      "title": "John",
      "content": "John John was the brother of James and was one of the most prominent apostles because of his ambition and closeness to Jesus (he was known as “the Beloved Disciple”). He appears numerous times in the New Testament, wrote the Gospels of John I, John II, John III, and Revelation, and preached as far as Asia Minor. He and James came from a wealthy family (their father had hired servants aiding his fishing business) and John may have seen himself as above the other apostles at first. He was known to be quick-tempered and fast to act in his early years before cooling down over time. He worked very closely with Peter in his apostolic work. [4] X Research source Role in the apostles: Part of Jesus’ inner circle. Profession: John was a fisherman in Bethsaida with his brother and fellow apostle, James. How did he die? Natural causes in old age. [5] X Research source Apostolic symbol: A chalice with a snake in it. It’s said that God spared him from an assassination attempt when he drank from a poisoned chalice."

    {
      "title": "Philip",
      "content": "Philip Not much is known about Philip compared to some of the other apostles. While mentioned as an apostle in the first three Gospels, his actions and personality don’t come through clearly until the Gospel of John. He had a strong missionary instinct and preached as far as Samaria and Caesarea in Israel. He was known for being kind yet pessimistic, often wanting and willing to do the right thing but not always believing it was possible. [6] X Research source He is sometimes confused with St. Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven deacons of the early church. [7] X Research source Role in the apostles: Philip didn’t have a specific role, but was the one who introduced Jesus to Bartholomew (Nathaniel) and helped deliver miraculous fish and loaves alongside Jesus. Profession: He was most likely a fisherman from Bethsaida, but his precise occupation is unknown. How did he die? It’s unclear how Philip died. Some sources say he died of natural causes while others say he was crucified in Hierapolis. [8] X Research source Others say he was hanged and requested to be wrapped in papyrus rather than linen since he didn’t believe his body was worthy of the same treatment as Jesus’. [9] X Research source Apostolic symbol: A basket symbolizing his part in the feeding of 5,000 people. Those that believe he was crucified also acknowledge the tall cross symbol."

      "title": "Bartholomew (Nathanael)",
      "content": "Bartholomew (Nathanael) Though Bartholomew is the name included in apostle lists in the Bible, it’s believed his actual name was Nathanael, with Bartholomew being a family name (meaning “son of Tolmai”). This is because Nathanael is mentioned more in the New Testament and appears to be called by Jesus alongside Philip in the accounts by John. There’s not much information about him in the New Testament, but it’s believed Bartholomew was the only apostle to come from nobility or royal blood (his father, Tolmai, being King of Geshur). He was an adventurous missionary who traveled as far as Phrygia, Hierapolis, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, and even India, where some believe he died. He is considered the founder and martyr of the Armenian Church. [10] X Research source Role in the apostles: Bartholomew had no official role, but was known as a great researcher and scholar of Scripture and the prophets. Profession: Unknown, although he’s said to have been a scholar of the law. How did he die? It’s believed he was flayed alive with knives as a martyr for Jesus in India. Other sources say he died in Armenia. [11] X Research source Apostolic symbol: Three parallel knives symbolizing his cause of death."

      "title": "Matthew (Levi)",
      "content": "Matthew (Levi) Matthew lived in Capernaum and little is known about him outside of his job as a publican, or public tax collector. It’s believed his second name, Levi, may have been given to him by Jesus, but it was common for men to have two names at the time (both of his mean “gift from God”). The fact that Jesus called a tax collector was to be an apostle was shocking; they were known for taking advantage of others’ money unjustly and were regarded as borderline criminals by many Jewish men who believed tax money should go only to the church and God. The lesson we learn from Matthew is that anyone is capable of reform and following the teachings of Christ. [12] X Research source Role in the apostles: Matthew didn’t have a specific role, but was the first to write out the teachings of Jesus in the Hebrew language in the Gospels of Matthew. Profession: Matthew was a publican (a tax collector), a position that made him relatively reviled by most of society since many publicans were unjust. How did he die? It’s unknown for certain, but many believe he was martyred in Ethiopia, where he did missionary work. Apostolic symbol: Three bags of money representing his work as a tax collector before Jesus called him."

    {
      "title": "Thomas",
      "content": "Thomas Thomas Didymus (his Greek name) is mentioned most in John’s Gospels, though little is known for sure about him. Thomas did not see Jesus right away after the Resurrection and was highly skeptical about it; he refused to believe it until he could see and touch Jesus’ wounds himself (John 20:25), earning him the nickname Doubting Thomas. He was a pessimistic but courageous and loyal man. After seeing Jesus alive again, he exclaimed “My Lord and my God,” making him the first to explicitly state Jesus’ divinity. [13] X Research source Role in the apostles: Thomas had no special role, although he traveled widely to preach in places like Parthia, Persia, and India. Profession: Unknown, but he may have been a carpenter or tradesman. How did he die? It’s believed Thomas was martyred and killed with a spear near Madras, India. Apostolic symbol: An image of spears, stones, and arrows."

    {
      "title": "James the Lesser (Son of Alphaeus)",
      "content": "James the Lesser (Son of Alphaeus) Compared to the other apostles, there’s very little written about James the Lesser (or the Younger). He was believed to be the brother of fellow apostle Jude, though some historians think he was Matthew’s brother. A lesser-known disciple, he preached in Palestine and Egypt and contributed the Epistle of James to the New Testament. As a personality, he was known to be fiery and strong-willed. [14] X Research source He may be called “the Lesser” for his young age when he joined the apostles, for his short stature, or simply to distinguish him from James, son of Zebedee, who was in Jesus’ inner circle. Role in the apostles: James the Lesser had no specific role or duty. Profession: Unknown. How did he die? It’s believed James the Lesser was martyred, but exactly how is unknown. He may have been stoned or bludgeoned to death in Jerusalem or crucified in Egypt. [15] X Research source Apostolic symbol: He is depicted in art by a club, referencing one possible death. In other representations, his symbol is the saw (some believe his body was sawed into pieces following his death)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Jude (Thaddeus)",
      "content": "Jude (Thaddeus) Jude is known by three other names in various Gospels—Thaddeus, Lebbeus, and Judas the Zealot (it’s suspected the shortening to Jude was to avoid confusion with Judas Iscariot, Jesus’ betrayer). His defining characteristic was his intense belief that the Chosen People (those of Jewish faith) should rule the world with Jesus as their king. However, his interactions with Jesus show that no amount of power can replace the love of God. Jude preached and healed in many areas, including Edessa, Assyria, and Persia. Role in the apostles: No specific role. Profession: Unknown. How did he die? Jude died by arrow as a martyr in Ararat (the supposed resting place of Noah’s Ark). Apostolic symbol: The ship (Jude was thought to be a fisherman as he traveled by sea on his missionary work)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Simon the Zealot (or the Cananaean)",
      "content": "Simon the Zealot (or the Cananaean) Very little is known about Simon in the New Testament besides his affiliation with the Zealots, a Jewish Nationalist party who staunchly opposed Roman rule (this also led to tension with Matthew, a tax collector for the Romans). Though he began his apostleship filled with hatred and a lack of sympathy for anyone who compromised with Rome, he eventually absorbed the teachings of Jesus and learned to share love with his fellow man (even Matthew). [16] X Research source Role in the apostles: No specific role. Profession: He was most likely a fisherman. How did he die? It’s not known for certain, but it’s believed he was martyred and died by crucifixion. Apostolic symbol: A fish lying on top of a Bible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Judas Iscariot",
      "content": "Judas Iscariot Judas is infamous for betraying Jesus to the Romans and being one of the most mysterious apostles. The cause of the betrayal is debated; some accounts describe Judas being possessed by Satan, while others say it was in exchange for 30 pieces of silver or because he was angry Jesus would not rule as a Jewish Nationalist (a similar anger that Simon and Jude felt at first). Judas identified Jesus to his arrestors with a kiss, calling him “master.” Judas was known to steal money from the apostles’ funds and was the only Judean of the whole group (the rest were Galileans). [17] X Research source Role in the apostles: Treasurer and one of the more outspoken leaders. Profession: Unknown. How did he die? Racked with remorse for his betrayal, Judas is believed to have hanged himself or thrown himself down onto jagged ground. Apostolic symbol: A money purse with silver falling out of it or a hangman’s noose."

      "title": "Jesus considered Peter, James, and John as part of his inner circle.",
      "content": "Jesus considered Peter, James, and John as part of his inner circle. While there was no official hierarchy among the apostles, Peter is often considered the leader and spokesman of the apostles (after Jesus). [18] X Research source Jesus also had a closer relationship to Peter, James, and John than to the rest. He spent more time with them and they witnessed more Biblical events than the other apostles did. John is even known specifically as the “disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23), indicating an especially close connection. [19] X Research source Events that these 3 apostles witnessed without the other 9 include the raising of Jairus’s daughter (Mark 5:37, Luke 8:51), the Transfiguration of Jesus (Mark 9, Matthew 17, Luke 9), and Jesus being arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mark 14:33, Matthew 26:37). [20] X Research source The two sets of brothers—Peter and Andrew, and James and John—were the first four apostles that Jesus called. [21] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "After Jesus ascended, the apostles chose Matthias to replace Judas.",
      "content": "After Jesus ascended, the apostles chose Matthias to replace Judas. Matthias was known as a godly man who witnessed a lot of Jesus’ work on earth before his crucifixion and helped the apostles spread his teachings after his death. While it wasn’t necessary to maintain 12 apostles, 12 is a fairly symbolic number representing the 12 tribes of Israel. [22] X Research source Replacing Judas also shows that God can turn evil into good. Though Judas’ deeds were wrong, it eventually led to the 12 apostles traveling the world to spread Jesus’ teachings."
    },
    {
      "title": "In the Bible, an apostle is someone Jesus chose to spread his teachings.",
      "content": "In the Bible, an apostle is someone Jesus chose to spread his teachings. The word “apostle” comes from the Greek apostolos , which means “person sent.” The apostles received Jesus’ special teaching and training and were sometimes sent on specific missions to spread the word of the Messiah. [23] X Research source While the title of apostle is usually reserved for the 12 followers Jesus chose, there is some debate over the exact definition of apostle and whether there were more than 12. For example, in the book of Acts, it’s implied that to be an apostle, you must have received a commission from Jesus as well as been an eyewitness to his Resurrection. However, some early Christian writers apply the term “apostle” to people in stories taking place after the New Testament."

    {
      "title": "Disciples were followers of Jesus, while apostles were sent to teach others.",
      "content": "Disciples were followers of Jesus, while apostles were sent to teach others. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but a disciple is technically only someone who follows, studies, and learns from a teacher or master (in this case, Jesus). The 12 apostles were first disciples before Jesus chose to make them apostles and enlist them to help him heal, teach, and preach to others. [24] X Research source In other words, all apostles are also disciples, but not all disciples are apostles."
