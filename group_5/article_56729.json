      "content": "Figure out your starting weight to determine your goals. Start off by weighing yourself so you can track your progress. How many pounds do you want to lose? Keep in mind that an average person in middle, high school loses 2 pounds per week maximum . Once you've figured out your target weight and how many pounds you'd like to lose, figure out how long you have to lose the pounds, and start thinking about specific goals. Your goals need to be (1) specific; (2) attainable (doable); and (3) forgiving (less than perfect). [1] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source In other words, \"lose weight\" is not a good goal because it's not specific. \"lose 30 lbs in 10 days\" is not a good goal because it's not attainable. \"Exercise for 3 hours every day\" is not a good goal because it's not forgiving. You want your goals to be something like, \"Exercise 5 days a week, with the goal of losing 2 lbs a week.\" That leaves a little wiggle room to keep you on track."

Do it for a week and you may end up breaking down, binging on everything in sight. Would low-carb be easier? How about just cutting out desserts? Picking up a vegetarian diet? Science is starting to suggest that eating right and exercise isn't everything. It's also about how your body is made up. Put two people on the same diet and they're going to have different results.

An example of an exercise schedule could be \"Monday: 30 min. cardio, 10 min. stretching/yoga, 20 min. strength/toning exercises; Tuesday: 20 min. light cardio and walking; Wednesday: rest; Thursday: 20 min. light cardio and walking, 20 min. strength training; Friday: 20 min stretching/yoga, 30 min. cardio.

When your friend is sitting there, eating a salad and some fruit and about to go for a walk, you'll be less likely to chow down on half a pizza and then take a nap. What's more, you'll have someone to bond with over the woes of weight loss. Practically everyone is \"dieting\" in some form or another nowadays. Just ask your friends who'd like to lose a few pounds with you and watch their arms shoot up. You are not alone in your battle, that's for sure."

What's more, it can curb hunger, too, keeping your stomach full. Always stay hydrated (and less hungry!) with water and take 5-10 minute breaks in between each routine to keep from exhausting yourself early and to prevent possible vomiting if you push yourself too hard. Stay away from sugary drinks that just spike your insulin and are full of empty calories. This includes juices and fancy coffee drinks – not just sodas. And while diet soda is technically better for you, you may see that you lose more weight when that diet soda gets replaced with water."

Anything that comes in a bag shouldn't be part of your dieting plan. Raw and fresh is the way to go to lose weight – processed foods have had their nutrients zapped out of them and are just full of sugars and salts that your body doesn't need. In fact, most processed goods have something in them that technically your body doesn't even recognize. It's all foreign junk that isn't good for you. To replace that urge to munch on chips or cookies, instead go for a handful of nuts or berries you can munch on. Sometimes it's just the urge to chew that needs to sated, not eating itself."

Your body will go into starvation mode and will start eating away nutrients in your fat. Then when you eat again, you will gain more weight because your body latches onto what you did give it and refuses to let go. This will just leave you with more fat than before. Breakfast in the morning keeps your metabolism going throughout the day, and gives you energy for school, work, and better food and exercise choices.

Once you've starved your body, it learns to adapt. Then when you feed it again, it can essentially stay in starvation mode, fearing the worst will happen again.

Here are a few tips to make eating less easier: Try to use smaller plates to make your food look bigger. Science says blue plates are better for less hunger, too. Eat slowly and savor your food. For every bite, try to chew for 5 seconds, then swallow, wait 3 seconds and drink a sip of water. Confusing? It's not. It's the 5-3-D. Try to eat protein at every meal. Chicken, steak, and beef should be about the size of a deck of cards. Eating more protein keeps you fuller for longer, resisting that urge to snack on something you shouldn't be snacking on."

Some dark chocolate, a sugary fruit, a few pretzels, or even a glass of red wine. Putting everything you love off-limits is a recipe for disaster. You have to have something to keep you going. Many people believe in calorie cycling. That's the idea where some days you eat a lot and some days you eat a little to keep your body guessing. Others choose one day a week where they eat whatever they want and the other six days they follow a stringent plan and ultimately this keeps them on track longer. So it's not all \"cheating.\" Some of it is actually a good idea."

      "content": "Eat more, smaller meals. 5 meals, instead of 3? It almost sounds too good to be true. But research says that eating often stabilizes your metabolism and keeps you from bingeing later on. That's right. So have breakfast, a morning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner. All small, of course. It's about eating more often , not about eating more in general. If you do want to implement the \"eat more often\" idea of dieting, make sure your meals are actually getting smaller, otherwise you'll just feel like you're dieting when you're really not."

Whether it's your school, work, or social schedule that is taking up all your time, you need to always make time to exercise. And if you say you don't \"have time,\" you're likely not making cutbacks where you can. It's a matter of making exercise a priority above the other things you have to do. Even if it's just 15 minutes, it counts. Not only should you be making time to exercise, but you should be making time to eat right, too. What's this mean? It means setting time aside to go grocery shopping, to pack your own lunches, and to cook at home. Restaurants are some of the biggest culprits when it comes to foiling a strong diet plan. And besides, cooking is easier on your budget, too."

When you're a full-fledged adult in the workforce, no one is putting up flyers and posting tryouts for a practically infinite number of activities. So take advantage of it! Sign up for something, even if you're not great at it, it will be an awesome (mandatory) workout (that you can't really get out of). Alright, so not everyone can handle a school sport. A decent alternative? Marching band. You laugh now, but it's not easy holding up an instrument and walking around in the summer sun for hours at a time. And as for your lung capacity? Won't be a problem. So if you're more musically inclined, this could be the route to go."
