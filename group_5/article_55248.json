      "title": "Keep your hair healthy.",
      "content": "Keep your hair healthy. Hair should be trimmed every once in a while, and kept looking shiny, frizz-free, and healthy. Not greasy--that's gross. Do cute styles like braiding your bangs, create a messy bun with your bangs out, do a poof with your bangs, scrunch your hair, try a French braid. The possibilities are endless. Your hair needs to look cute and clean. Straight long highlighted hair with side bangs is ideal, however, there are lots of popular girls who prefer their hair curly. Buy hair accessories like bobby pins, hair clips, hair bands, and Beret's. Bottom line, see what styles in hair are trending in your school and try them out."

      "content": "Put on a little make-up. Soft foundation, some concealer, a bit of face powder, light eye shadow, mascaras, eyeliners, lip glosses. Start your own trends in make-up. People will like that you look nice as well as be you being a nice person, so don't go too heavy on the make-up."

      "title": "Wear trendy clothes.",
      "content": "Wear trendy clothes. This is probably the most important factor. If you're trying to be popular, gradually wear what is \"popular\" (and what makes you feel confident) as you climb your way up. If you want, start a trend at your school. When you choose your clothes, make sure they're durable and can last a long time. It is not worth spending your money on a flimsy shirt. Popular brands vary from school to school, so it might be worth finding out what's popular in your school first (from talking about clothes to keeping an eye on branding) before you go into a big brand name store. Sometimes it's about the \"preppiness\" instead, with sporty brands, while at other schools, clothes are about being casual, unique and trendy. If you're creative enough, go to thrift shops and see what you can find. Make sure your outfit goes along with what you think is \"popular\"! Fashions include funky colors, cool patterns, and denim. If your school's popular kids are more trendy: Look for fashionable scarves, V-neck solid tops, skinny jeans, short shorts, miniskirts, pretty tank tops, bandeau bathing suit, V-neck sweaters, hoodies, jeggings, tights, sweats, Uggs, moccasins, knee length boots and canvas shoes. If you don't like any of these (meaning that you don't feel sociable and yourself in them), or if the popular girls don't wear them, it's okay to not wear them. As long as your outfit doesn't portray Dora The Explorer or any \"little-kid\" icon, it's totally cool. If your school is such that the popular kids are like the stereotypical cheerleader, buy some sporty branded things as well including cute undies to make you feel fabulous. It's a confidence booster for many. You should also invest in a cute purse, bikini, about five pairs of pajamas and a winter coat."

      "content": "Use other accessories. Popular kids will often wear whatever they think is cute or cool while following trends and putting their own spin on it (so they still feel comfortable and sociable in what they wear). That's the key! It's also good to have an iphone and/or a laptop with social media like Instagram or Snapchat. That way, you can socialize with others and keep up friendships! Also, try some flashy accessories. You know, the kind that everyone loves but is too shy to wear? It will make you seem confident and trendy."

      "content": "Take care of your nails. Long-ish, non-bitten nails are pretty. Solid nail polish color is preferred over different patterns on each hand. You can also do French nails."

      "title": "Remember that looking like a popular girl does not mean you'll be one and, you can be popular and dress any way at all.",
      "content": "Remember that looking like a popular girl does not mean you'll be one and, you can be popular and dress any way at all. Real friends will like you for how you act not how you look. A lot of these steps involve spending money on clothes, you don't have to spend money on clothes to be popular - any girl who is \"popular\" because it's obvious she's got a lot of money, might not be as popular as she thinks. People might hang out with her for what they can get from her. You don't have to wear makeup to be or look popular. You can be popular even if you have to wear the same clothes as everyone else because your school has a uniform."
