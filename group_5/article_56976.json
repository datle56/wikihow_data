      "content": "Take out a piece of lined paper. Wide-ruled lined paper will help you write each letter evenly and uniformly. It will also help to distinguish the difference in size of the upper case and the lower case letters. If you are teaching your child how to write the alphabet, interact with them as they write each letter. Once they finish writing the letter “A” and the letter “B”, for example, ask them about the differences between each letter. This will help your child remember each letter and start to get a sense of the different shapes of each letter.
