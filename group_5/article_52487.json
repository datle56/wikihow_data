For example, if you have to calculate how many moles go into 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, you'll get n = 74 g 37 g m o l {\\displaystyle n={\\frac {74g}{37{\\frac {g}{mol}}}}} , since you have 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, and the molar mass is 37 g m o l {\\displaystyle {\\frac {g}{mol}}} .

      "title": "Solve the equation and cancel out the units.",
      "content": "Solve the equation and cancel out the units. The unit grams is both in the numerator and denominator so that cancels out. Moles is in the denominator of the denominator, which leaves you with moles in the numerator. The final answer is n = 74 37 m o l = 2 m o l {\\displaystyle n={\\frac {74}{37}}mol=2mol} .
