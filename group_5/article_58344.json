      "title": "Number the squares from 1 to 4.",
      "content": "Number the squares from 1 to 4. The squares should be numbered clockwise starting with 1. This means the 1 and 3 squares will be diagonal from each other, as will the 2 and 4 squares. [2] X Research source Some people use the letters A, B, C, and D instead of numbers, while others use titles of royalty, such as Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a standard rubber playground ball if you have one.",
      "content": "Use a standard rubber playground ball if you have one. This is often called a kickball and is a rubber ball about 8.5 inches (22 cm) in diameter. If you don’t have a playground ball, use any ball that’s 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) and bounces at least 50% of the height from which it was thrown. [4] X Research source Australian players use 3 inches (7.6 cm) felted tennis balls to play Four Square."

      "title": "Make sure everyone agrees on the rules before you start playing.",
      "content": "Make sure everyone agrees on the rules before you start playing. As a \"playground game\" this game has spawned an incredible amount of local variations over the decades. If you’re playing by the standard rules, make sure everyone knows what exactly they are before starting. While often one school might have \"standard rules\" the new kid might think the \"standard rules\" are something else entirely. If you’re playing by variations, or if the server is allowed to make up rules during the game, make sure everyone is aware of this and agrees to it. Having everyone on the same page before the game starts will help prevent disputes during the game that could ruin the fun."

      "content": "Serve the ball from the highest-ranked square to the lowest. The server should bounce the ball once in their own square, then hit the ball so that it goes diagonally to the lowest-ranked square. The receiver can then hit the ball in any direction they choose. [6] X Research source Many people play Four Square so that the 4 square is the highest-ranked square, and therefore the server’s square. If this is the case, the server should stand in the 4 square and hit the ball towards the 1 square. Some people play the game so 1 is the highest-ranked square and 4 is the lowest. In this case, the serve would go from the 1 square towards the 4 square. The serve always goes in the same direction."

After the serve, the receiver should allow the ball to bounce one time in their square, then should hit it in whatever direction they choose. If they don’t hit the ball correctly or it goes out of bounds, that is a “fault,” and one fault is allowed per round. If the receiver misses the serve twice in a round, they are eliminated. [7] X Research source The round lasts until a player is eliminated."

The ball is considered “in play” after someone touches it but before it lands in another square, meaning players can hit the ball in the air. You must hit the ball before it bounces a second time. [8] X Research source If a player hits the line with the ball or hits the ball so it does not land in another player’s square, that player is out. [9] X Research source If a player hits a ball after it has landed in another player’s square, the person who hit the ball is out. This is called “poaching.” [10] X Research source"

If you have more than 4 players, a new player will move into the lowest-numbered square when a player is eliminated.

Whenever one player hits the ball to another square, they’ll jump out of their court and their partner will jump in. [14] X Research source When playing with 2 players per square, if one player is out then the team is out. If everyone agrees, however, you can adjust the rules to allow the other team member to continue playing until they are out."

When the round is over, the server must call the rules again or else it’s assumed there are no special rules. [17] X Research source A special rule might be something like 7-Up, in which each player who hits the ball has to call out a number one higher than the previous player. The player who hits on the number 7, or any number that ends in 7, must skip that number or they’ll be out. [18] X Research source Another rule the server might call could be Underhand, in which all of the hits must be made with the back of the hand. Players should keep their hands open and their palms facing up. [19] X Research source"
