You will want to devote the first column in your chart to the total number of units produced. Your quantities can increase by 1, such as 1,2,3,4 etc. or they can increase by larger increments, such as 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 etc. Fixed costs and variable costs. During production there are certain costs, such as rent, that are fixed. Other costs, such as the cost of materials or labor hours, are variable according to the quantity.
