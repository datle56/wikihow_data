If you are only asked to memorize through your 12's, select cell range C2:M12 and do menu Format Cells Fill light brown. By the way, you can easily expand the definitions of a and n and create a larger chart to access and learn from. Or, you can change the Step Value increment to 5 or 25 or 100, etc. It is very easy to remember your 20s and to count by 20s.

      "content": "Extra Credit (if you choose to do so) -- Create the Chart and Learn about Slope: Select Row 2 by selecting the Row# which is 2 at the left of the spreadsheet. Do menu Insert Rows. One row should be inserted. Select cell range A2:Z26 and then use the Ribbon or menu Chart and create a new Chart and select, All, Scattered, Smoothed Line Scattered for the chart type -- a new chart should appear atop your worksheet, so move it off to the right by grabbing with the mouse inside the chart border and dragging rightwards and up or down until it's located in a good spot. Select Row 2 again and do Edit Delete; Your new Chart should read the chart series reference down the right, for example, a=2, then below it a=3 ... all the way down to a=25. Double-click on the bottommost line (or plot series) of the chart and in the dialog box that appears set Line color to Red; Double-click on the topmost line (or plot series) of the chart and in the dialog box that appears set Line color to Black; notice that over in the series references, they are \"upside-down\" and that the top one for a=2 refers to the bottom red series line, and that the bottom one refers to the top series line for a=25. Reason that this is because 2 has less \"slope\" than the steeper \"slope\" for 25. Calculate actual slope with the formula (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). You have just created an {x, y} Cartesian Graph. Select cell AA1 and type Y, which pertains to all those columnar values. Format Cells Font Bold. Select cell B26 and type X, which pertains to those vertical values. Now the rightmost Y is actually point Y25 and the bottom X is point X25. You will learn to adjust the slope formula to the endpoints when you first study slope of lines, so we're going to change the formula to (Y25 - Y1)/(X25 - X1). Filling in the values of those data point references, we have Y25=50, Y1=2, X25 = 25 and X1=2. The formula thus becomes (50-2)/(25-2) or 48/23 = 2.087, which is slope m1, the slope of the red series line. For the black series line, Y25=625, Y1=25, X25=25 and X1=2, so the formula's values become (625-25)/(25-2), or 620/23 which equals 26.957 or slope m25. You can perform this division right in Excel by preceding it with an equals sign, somewhere off to the side. A slope m of 1 is a straight 45 ยบ diagonal from {X1, Y1} = {0, 0} through each pair of similar matching numbers, like {4, 4} or {25, 25). Then the formula become (25-0)/(25-0) = 1/1 and slope m=1. You can see that the product of a and n for the first 25 numbers produces a range of slopes from 2.087 up to 26.957, which is fairly steep. Your chart probably does not show how truly steep it is because it is not a square of 625 x 625 but is cut off so that it's only got a width of 30. If we were to change the horizontal axis by double-clicking on it and setting the Max to 625, you'd see how very steep a slope of nearly 27 actually is, and the lines would be all crowded together. That is why the lines \"fan out\" as they do, because their slopes m are different and the chart is foreshortened. In school, you may learn one formula for a line is y= mx + b or you may learn it as y= ax +b; m and a stand for the slope in either case. The slope is determined by (Y 2 - Y 1 )/(X 2 - 1 ), not by x*y or a*n. The true slopes of the topmost and bottom lines are accurately calculated."
