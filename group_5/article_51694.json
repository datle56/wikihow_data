      "content": "Remove the screws from the old lock on the inside of the door. Maclise explains that if you don’t see any screws, they’re probably covered. “Sometimes, they put these little caps over the screws, so it looks like it has no screws. But really, it's just these little metal caps. Sometimes you can get them off with your finger, but you may need to use screwdriver.” Remove all of the screws on the inside knob plate. If the screws are rusted because the door hasn’t been replaced in forever, Maclise suggests drilling the screws out with a screw extractor drill bit ."

      "title": "Acquire a lock of the same brand and size as your old lock.",
      "content": "Acquire a lock of the same brand and size as your old lock. After removing the knobs, measure the opening for the lock and the size of the metal cover (called a faceplate) to find your lock’s dimensions. Then, purchase a lock that’s the same brand and matches the size of those dimensions. This way, your new lock will perfectly fits the hole’s dimensions. [1] X Research source This used to be much more difficult, but door locks these days are usually standardized. The standard bore (the circular opening for the lock) is 2 1 ⁄ 8 inches (5.4 cm), while the standard faceplate width is 1 in (2.5 cm). If you buy the same brand, your new lock will 100% match your other locks, and you will most likely be able to install it using the existing holes. You should still be able to reuse the holes even if you get a different brand so long as the dimensions are identical, though. If you’re also replacing the deadbolt, buy a door knob and deadbolt set so you can use the same key."

      "content": "Remove the screws that secure the latch at the edge of the door. The latch is the actual part of the lock that retracts when you turn the knob. Maclise points out that you can remove all of the remaining screws on the side latch. Once the screws are out, slide out the latch from the opening in the side of the door."

      "title": "Slide the new latch into place.",
      "content": "Slide the new latch into place. Push the new latch into the opening on the edge of the door. Drive the new screws through the holes in the latch plate and into the door edge to secure the latch. [2] X Research source It’s best not to reuse your old screws, since they might be old and weaker than the new screws."

      "title": "Put the door lock together.",
      "content": "Put the door lock together. Maclise explains that everything slots together like puzzle pieces: “Put the new knob together in the reverse order you disassembled the old one. Put the latch in place, then put the knob in. Turn it 90-degrees to slide the knob over the pins and then it'll snap on.” With the knob in place, use the screws that came with the lock to secure everything in place. Drive screws into the holes on the inside door knob plate to finish putting the lock back together."

      "title": "Remove the old deadbolt faceplates.",
      "content": "Remove the old deadbolt faceplates. Remove the screws on the inside of the faceplate with a screwdriver. Either pull the interior faceplate straight out or rotate it counterclockwise to remove it. Then pull out or twist and remove the exterior plate. [3] X Research source If you are also replacing the doorknob, buy a replacement set that contains both a doorknob and a deadbolt. It’s a little tough to manage, but try to keep a hand on the exterior faceplate when you remove the interior portion. On some models, the exterior faceplate doesn't screw into place, so it can fall to the floor when you pull out the interior plate."

Remove the screws, then pull out the strike plate and bolt to finish uninstalling the old deadbolt.

      "content": "Get a new deadbolt set of the same dimensions or rekey the old one. Once you’ve removed the deadbolt, either pop out the cylinder housing from the exterior faceplate and rekey it as you would a knob lock. If you’ve lost the key, take the components to a locksmith to have a new key made. [5] X Research source Replace the entire deadbolt with a new one for an easier solution, if the lock is worn, or if you want a new look."

      "content": "Install the new deadbolt’s strike plate and bolt. If you’re replacing the entire lock, insert the bolt through the hole in the edge of the door where the old bolt fit. If your brand’s plate and bolt are separate components, place the new strike plate over the indentation on the side of the door where the old plate fit. [6] X Research source Drive the new screws through the strike plate and into the door to secure the new lock. Deadbolts only have 2 screws, so they're a lot easier to line up and install properly."

Thread the new screws through the screw holes in the interior plate, through the screw holes in the bolt, and into the exterior plate. Drive the screws until they’re tight to complete installation.

One brand’s kit usually doesn’t work for others, so check your lock’s brand and purchase a kit that matches it. [8] X Research source Read your kit’s instructions carefully, in case there are any minor differences specific to your brand. Pro Tip: It’s usually easier to just replace the entire door lock assembly than to rekey an existing lock. However, if you have a custom door lock or a non-standard door, rekeying the existing lock may be your only option."

      "title": "Remove the exterior door knob.",
      "content": "Remove the exterior door knob. Use the kit’s long, thin, wire-like tool to remove the knobs. If you prefer, Maclise recommends “putting a little pin or a straightened-out paper clip into the hole. And with the key turned 90 degrees, you just push it in there and the knob will pop right off.” Key Variation: If your lock doesn’t have a side poke hole, you’re better off replacing the whole lock. Your lock is probably complicated enough that it requires a locksmith to rekey."

Once you’ve removed the exterior lock face, look inside the knob and check for any sheets of plastic or metal that hold the lock cylinder in place. Slide them out if any are present, then put pressure on the key or pin. Pop out the lock cylinder from the back of the knob.

The new kit will come with colored or numbered pins, and its instructions will include a code. Use the kit’s tweezers to insert the pins into the plug’s slots so they match the code. [14] X Research source For example, the code might list the correct order as blue, red, red, blue, and yellow, starting from the side opposite the keyhole. Correctly installed pins will sit flush with the surface of the plug. They won’t stick out over their slots."
