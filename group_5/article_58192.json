If you have calcium stones, you'll need to avoid calcium and vitamin D supplements, limit your intake of calcium-rich foods to 2 to 3 daily servings, and avoid antacids that contain calcium. Note that people who have kidney stones once are at an increased risk of having them in the future. Kidney stones recur within 5 to 10 years in about 50% of people who have them once.
