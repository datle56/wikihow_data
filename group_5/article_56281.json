      "content": "Jupiter Libras are wise and just people who crave strong relationships. Libra, represented by the Scales, is associated with equality, fairness, and balance. When someone is born with Jupiter (the planet of expansion and learning) within Libra, they’ll feel an urge to fight for justice and peace wherever they go and become known as an excellent mediator. Libra is also the sign of relationships, meaning that Jupiter Libras expand their knowledge about the world and themselves through their partnerships. [1] X Research source Jupiter Libras are also charming individuals who enjoy luxurious things, are interested in learning new things, and take a flexible approach to life. Libra is an extroverted, friendly, detached air sign ruled by Venus that values equality and great relationships. It rules the 7th house (the house of partnerships). Jupiter symbolizes expansion, wisdom, luck, and soul searching. It’s also a lucky planet for those that have good timing and know how to jump on an opportunity. In Vedic astrology, Jupiter has animosity toward Libra’s ruler, Venus. However, a Jupiter in Libra placement is lucky since both planets are benefic (have favorable influences on people)."
