      "content": "Check to see if your kitchen is dishwasher ready. Look at all of the water fixtures to make sure you are able to add in a dishwasher. Most homes should be dishwasher ready with only an installation needed, which is usually done by the company the dishwasher is bought from. Old homes, however, may need some electrical work done to comply with new rules for new dishwashers. [2] X Research source Dishwashers now must be on their own dedicated circuit. A shut-off needs to be within four feet of the dishwasher. A GFCI breaker (protection from moisture and sparking) needs to be on the circuit breaker panel."

      "content": "Get a portable washer if there is no hook up. If there is no dishwasher hook up in your apartment, choose a portable dishwasher that can be hooked up to kitchen faucet. Once you are done using it, you can store it away in a closet or another area of the home. You can also choose to buy a small, countertop dishwasher, though it will provide less space for dishes. [3] X Research source Brands such as Kenmore, SPT, Whirlpool, and Danby offer portable dishwashers. SPT also offers countertop dishwashers."

      "content": "Measure the space intended for dishwasher. Dishwashers come in multiple sizes. You will need to pick out one that is appropriate for the size of your home or apartment. Take a tape measurer and measure the depth and width of the area you plan to install a dishwasher into. Write down the measurements, take them to a home improvement store, and ask which dishwasher will work for those measurements. [4] X Research source You can also look through online catalogs to see which dishwasher will work with your measurements."

      "title": "Decide between integrated or freestanding.",
      "content": "Decide between integrated or freestanding. Freestanding dishwashers are more common than integrated dishwashers. Freestanding dishwashers are more common because they can fit into any kitchen that has enough space for them. Integrated dishwashers are designed to be incorporated into built-in kitchens. Fully integrated dishwashers are hidden behind a cabinet door, and semi-integrated dishwashers are mostly covered, except for the control panel. [5] X Research source Freestanding dishwashers are a great choice because you have the option of taking them with you when you move. Integrated dishwashers are a good choice if you want the look of a streamlined kitchen."

      "title": "Choose between compact and standard.",
      "content": "Choose between compact and standard. Compact dishwashers are good for smaller spaces. They are typically 18 inches, which leaves extra room for storage. A standard dishwasher is typically 24 inches, and it is ideal for homes with families. [6] X Research source A compact dishwasher is a better choice if you live alone, or with one partner or roommate. A standard dishwasher is ideal if you or someone else will be cooking for a family of three people or more almost every night."

      "content": "Make sure it has all of the cycles you want. Modern dishwashers typically have more cycles rather other wash and dry. Think about what needs you will have when using the dishwasher, and what type of dishes you will be putting into the dishwasher. Look for dishwashers that meet your needs. A good dishwasher should have a delayed wash, rinse and hold, wash program, quick-wash, and sanitize cycle. A delayed wash cycle allows you to set a start time anywhere between one hour and twenty-four hours ahead of time. A rinse and hold cycle will rinse food off of a partial load of dishes to remove bacteria and bad smells without using detergent. A wash program allows you to choose a custom setting for things like fragile dishes and oven racks. A sanitize setting will kill 99.9% of bacteria."

      "content": "Consider stainless steel for the tub. [7] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. There are several options for materials for the interior tub of the dishwasher. Plastic tubs are common and found most often in affordable dishwashers. A gray or slate color is another option, and it is good at hiding stains. Stainless steel is a great choice because it resists stains and odors and transfers heat better than other materials, which makes for a faster dry. [8] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. A stainless steel tub is usually more expensive, but will usually last longer than a plastic tub. [9] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. Plastic tubs tend to warp with heat over time, which may cause leaks.

      "content": "Look for adjustable upper racks. Adjustable racks allow you to put together your washer in a way that best fits your needs. This would come in handy when you are washing particularly large items. Look for a height-adjustable rack with two quick-release clips. This allows you to move the rack even if there are dishes in it. A roller rack is another option, but you can only move it when the rack is empty. [11] X Research source Make sure to take a good look at the inside of the dishwasher before purchasing to see what type of racks are used."

      "content": "Get a quiet model. A noise is often a factor considered when buying a dishwasher. A loud dishwasher can be annoying in a kitchen where conversation is taking place. Check the decibel level if you are concerned about noise. A decibel level of 45 or under will be almost silent. A decibel level of 50 is equal to the volume of a normal conversation. 44 decibels is the ideal level. You can also add extra insulation around the washing tub, door, toe panel, and access controls to reduce noise. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Think about the details.",
      "content": "Think about the details. A basic dishwasher may be okay with you, but you should still consider what details you would like to have before purchasing. Details such as a child-safety lock, anti-flood protection, sensor wash, and detergent sensor may come in handy. Dishwashers that feature most or all of these details will likely be more expensive than your average dishwasher, however. [13] X Research source Anti-flood detection has two main settings. A float switch detects when water is at the bottom of the machine and stops it from filling further into the tub. An aqua-stop prevents flooding if the hose spills or leaks. The sensor wash detail determines how dirty the water is and adjusts the temperature and length of wash depending on that reading. A detergent sensor can prevent you from washing with too much detergent. The sensor releases as much detergent is needed for the wash."

      "content": "Choose the right dishwasher. You only need a dishwasher that has the capabilities you desire and that is within your price range. Different dishwashers have different features, so choose wisely, and make sure you don't spend your life's savings on a fancy dishwasher. A lot of extra sensors and details are great to have, but they are not necessary if you are on a budget. All you really need are places to put in your silverware, glasses, plates, and bowls. Be reasonable. [14] X Research source A good price for a new dishwasher is around 800 to 900 dollars."

      "content": "Check several appliance stores for brands and prices. Donâ€™t buy from the first place you look at dishwashers. Look at websites like Reviewed.com and Consumer Reports to see which models are best. Prices may vary depending on the store, and some stores may be having sales when other are not. Some different stores that sell dishwashers could be Home Depot, Lowe's, or even eBay. [15] X Research source Make sure that if you are ordering one, check to make sure everything works, such as the sliding rack."

      "title": "Buy during the right time of year.",
      "content": "Buy during the right time of year. Certain times of year are better for buying dishwashers. For example, dishwashers will often go on sale around the holidays and when new models are being unveiled. Any holiday weekend, September and October, January, and the end of the month are good times to look for a dishwasher. [16] X Research source September and October is a good time to look for a dishwasher because manufacturers unveil the new models during this time, so older models will often go on sale. The selection may be limited in January, but all of the remaining models from the previous year will often be discounted even more than they were during the holidays. Employees will often have a quota they have to fill by the end of the month, so the end of the month is a good time to negotiate price."
