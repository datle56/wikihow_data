      "content": "Add in the entrance and sketch vertical/horizontal lines crisscrossing the faces of the cubes. These will serve as guidelines for the windows and the entrance of the building. You can make them as large or as small as you’d like, with more width or length depending on how you want your building to look."

      "content": "Outline the image and put in more details if you want. You can also adjust lines that don't fit your taste. Erase the guidelines. You should outline your image BEFORE erasing, however, or you might confuse your windows with extraneous lines."
