Using Plexiglas, layout the shape of the model first with a regular marker. once the layout of the model is properly put down, go over the layout in permanent marker. Now you are ready to begin the building process. Begin to gather all necessary supplies for the model such as glue, the material used for the model itself, paint, and scenery pieces. Take time to carefully put the model together, so that you are sure that it is securely constructed, and strong."

LIM Linear Induction Motors are fairly easy to apply, and are often featured inside of the coaster's station. Most launched roller coasters are LIM roller coasters."
