The only time you might need to switch up products is if you’re visiting an area that’s a different climate from where you live.

      "content": "Use sample or travel size products. Packing full-size versions of your shampoo, face wash, and other toiletries takes up too much space in your bag. Instead, opt for sample or travel size products, so you don’t wind up taking more than you need of any product. [7] X Research source Many skincare, bath, and makeup companies provide free samples when you buy from them, so it’s a good idea to have a drawer in your vanity to keep them organized. That way, you can just go through the samples to find what you need before your trip. Many stores sell travel size versions of common toiletries, such as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and toothpaste, so you can buy smaller versions of the products you use."

      "content": "Consider sharing with travel companions. If you’re traveling with friends and family, you don’t all have to bring separate toiletries. Divide the products between your traveling companions to save space in your bag. For example, you might bring the toothpaste and body wash and your friend might pack the shampoo and conditioner. Just be sure that you bring enough of each item for every member of the party. A travel size tube of toothpaste isn’t going to be enough for a week long trip with 4 people."
