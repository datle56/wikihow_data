These special triangles appear frequently in geometry text books and on standardized tests like the SAT and the GRE. If you memorize the first 2 Pythagorean triples, in particular, you can save yourself a lot of time on these tests because you can immediately know the hypotenuse of one of these triangles just by looking at the side lengths! [8] X Research source The first Pythagorean triple is 3-4-5 (3 2 + 4 2 = 5 2 , 9 + 16 = 25). When you see a right triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, you can instantly be certain that the hypotenuse will be 5 without having to do any calculations. The ratio of a Pythagorean triple holds true even when the sides are multiplied by another number. For example a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8 will have a hypotenuse of 10 (6 2 + 8 2 = 10 2 , 36 + 64 = 100). The same holds true for 9-12-15 , and even 1.5-2-2.5 .

The ratio between the sides of this triangle is 1:1:Sqrt(2) , which means that the length of the legs are equal, and the length of the hypotenuse is simply the leg length multiplied by the square root of two.
