In general, the sites that have you fill out a lot of information before matching you with potential suitors are the ones that will lead you to a long-term commitment. Try sites like OkCupid, Match, and Plenty of Fish, and be sure to include that you’re looking for something serious. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Other sites like Tinder, Bumble, and Grindr are fine, but they only match you up based on age range and location. This tends to lead to more casual flings."

Ask around to see if your friends or family know anyone who’s single that you might be able to grab a drink with. You never know who you’ll meet through a mutual friend! [2] X Research source Going out with a friend of a friend is also safer than meeting up with a stranger. Since you know someone who knows them, you can be fairly certain that they are who they say they are."

      "content": "Men aged 28 to 33 are more likely to commit. This stage of life that they’re in is more conducive to settling down and getting married, so it’s a good age range to check out. If you find a guy who’s outside of that range, don’t worry—he might still value commitment! But, you have a much higher chance of finding a guy to settle down with if he’s in that range. [4] X Research source Studies also show that once men reach age 38, their commitment levels severely decrease. Again, it’s not impossible, but it is more unlikely."

[6] X Research source For instance, you’ll want to avoid talking about marriage or kids on the first few dates. Save the “What are we?” talk until you’ve been seeing each other for a few weeks (or even months). You may also want to take things slow physically, too. Having sex too quickly can make your man think you’re only in it for the hookup."

If he only calls you every other day to check in, then you shouldn’t call him more than that.
