Then, restore power to the thermostat and set it to “cool.” [9] X Research source Some HVAC companies recommend waiting 30 minutes to turn your thermostat back on to give the unit more time to reset the internal breaker. If turning it back on after 1 minute didn’t fix the issue, try the process again but wait 30 minutes this time. If your AC still doesn’t blow cold air or makes any strange noises, contact an HVAC technician to troubleshoot and fix your system."
