      "content": "I'm trying to scan a QR code, but my phone camera isn't recognizing it. First, try cleaning off your phone's camera lens. A dirty lens can interfere with your phone's ability to read the QR code. You should also make sure there's enough light, as your phone might not be able to read a QR code in a dark room. You can also try to move closer to the QR code or tap on the screen to focus the camera on the code. Lastly, make sure you're holding your camera still enough that it can read the code."
