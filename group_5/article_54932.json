      "title": "Figure out your skin type.",
      "content": "Figure out your skin type. Knowing if you have oily, normal, dry, or sensitive skin will determine what kind of product you should look for when buying a cleansing product from your local store or pharmacy. The main two categories of treatment are those with benzoyl peroxide, and those with salicylic acid. Products with these active ingredients can cause allergic reactions. If your skin reacts badly, stop using it. You can actually have more than one type, which is \"combination\". For example, your nose and forehead may be oily, but you may have dryness on your cheeks. Most acne-prone skin is actually \"sensitive\", as acne tends to react to products such as harsh soap, makeup, or fragrances. If in doubt, go with products designed for sensitive skin."

      "title": "For more sensitive skin, choose a product with salicylic acid.",
      "content": "For more sensitive skin, choose a product with salicylic acid. If you have sensitive skin that can dry out and be irritable it is best to go for a product with salicylic acid. Just check the ingredients on the package in the store to know which is which. Salicylic acid is more gentle to the skin, rarely causes redness and peeling, and works more slowly than the stronger alternatives. [1] X Research source Look out particularly for products that combine salicylic acid with glycolic acid. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use benzoyl peroxide.",
      "content": "Use benzoyl peroxide. If you don't have particularly sensitive skin that is not prone to drying out, seek out products that have benzoyl peroxide. This key ingredient breaks up the waxy clog so it loosens and comes out of the pore. This is the fastest working store-bought option, but it can be a little harsh on your skin. [3] X Research source The strength of the benzoyl peroxide usually ranges between 2.5 and 10%. This, combined with how long you leave the product on your skin, can influence any irritation you may experience. If your skin is sensitive, you can try a product at the lowest percentage and don't leave it on your skin too long. Benzoyl peroxide can be harsh on your skin, but it is also more effective than salicylic acid."

      "title": "Consider an alpha hydroxy acid product.",
      "content": "Consider an alpha hydroxy acid product. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) include glycolic acid and can be very effective at exfoliating your skin. You will find glycolic acid in daily exfoliators as well as chemical face peels. It dissolves and releases dead skin cells, which is an excellent way to tackle your blackheads. Use it in the same way you would a benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid product, and always read the instructions. AHAs can increase sensitivity to the sun, so be careful if you are going out in bright sunlight after using this treatment.

      "content": "Decide if you want to use a topical cream or face wash. Skin products are usually sold as either face washes or topical creams. A topical cream is usually left on longer, which means it has more time to work, but it is also more likely to irritate your skin. Follow the guidelines for the given product, and be especially careful if you have sensitive skin."

      "content": "Understand the limitations and risks of homemade treatments. There is little to no scientifically-backed support for most homemade treatments; support for these methods is mostly anecdotal, or based on personal accounts. These treatments may or may not work, and could potentially damage your skin. Talk to your doctor before attempting any homemade treatment. If you have particularly sensitive skin take extra care and use more diluted versions of these solutions. Stop if any of these irritate your skin."

      "content": "Try an egg white mask. It is thought that a proteins found in eggs may kill bacteria that causes acne. To make a face mask, separate an egg white from the yolk and, after patting dry your face, apply the egg white to your skin. You can use a cloth for this, if you use your fingers make sure they are clean and dry first. Once the first egg layer has dried, add another. Repeat this 3-5 times, always letting each layer dry first. Then wash it off and pat dry. [5] X Research source You can add a layer of tissue between each egg layer. Peel each layer off before you wash your face at the end. [6] X Research source Raw egg whites can grow salmonella.

      "content": "Use warmed honey. Honey has both antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties and may assist in healing wounds and skin infections. There is, however, no evidence that it has any affect on blackheads or acne. It is thought the stickiness may help it bind to the blackheads and remove them. Warm up some honey in a pan, or place a jar of honey in hot water. When the honey is hot to the touch, but there is no danger of you burning yourself, dab it onto your blackheads and let it dry for around ten minutes. Wash off your face with a damp cloth. You can leave this treatment on overnight, but make sure it has dried or you might wake up with your face stuck to your pillow!"

As with homemade treatments with natural ingredients, there is very little scientifically-backed evidence for the effectiveness and even the safety of homemade acne and blackhead treatments. You should talk with your doctor or dermatologist before attempting a homemade treatment â€” you could end up seriously damaging your skin, which could lead to far worse problems than a few blackheads."

      "content": "Make a boric powder solution. One recommended treatment is the application of highly diluted boric acid mixed with water. Boric is a mild acid that you can buy from the pharmacy. Mix one and a half cups of hot water with half a tablespoon of boric acid powder. Dip a face cloth into the solution and dab this onto your skin. You can leave this for fifteen or twenty minutes to work. There are no studies supporting the use of boric acid for acne. There is evidence to suggest that it does have antibacterial and antiviral properties; however it has not proven to be effective for acne. Although diluted formulations are known to be safe for abrasions and treating vaginal bacterial disease, boric acid if not diluted properly can cause severe skin and eye irritation. In addition, there are a few case reports of patients who used an ointment containing boric acid that caused an acne eruption.

      "content": "Use Iodine and Epsom Salts. This method is supposed to pull the plug of oil and dead skin out of your pore. Epsom Salts can be a good exfoliant. [10] X Research source Mix a teaspoon of Epsom Salts with four drops of Iodine in half a cup of hot water. Stir until all the salts have dissolved and the temperature has dropped a little. Once the solution is at a safe temperature, apply to your face with cotton balls and let it dry. Then wash off and pat your face dry. Again, there is no evidence that this method actually removes blackheads. If left on your skin for too long or overused, iodine can cause severe skin reactions, or may put you at risk for hyperthyroidism.

      "title": "Steam open your pores.",
      "content": "Steam open your pores. Before you think about squeezing or pulling them out, you need to really loosen the pores. Blackheads are very sticky and won't come out easily, but by loosening the pores you give yourself the best chance of success. An excellent way to do this is to carefully hold your face at least a foot above a bowl of steaming water for ten to fifteen minutes. Getting any closer can cause burns. Place a towel over your head so the steam can't escape. You will feel the steam beginning to loosen your pores. You can also soak a washcloth in hot water and lay it over your face."

It is easy to use and there is far less risk of damaging your skin than if you try to squeeze out a blackhead with your fingers. After cleansing your skin, place the loop over the blackhead and apply gentle pressure, then pull the tool down. The blackhead should pop out of your pore. [13] X Research source Do not press too hard. If the blackhead doesn't come out with gentle pressure, treat it with a topical cream. Pressing too hard may damage your skin. [14] X Research source Make sure you clean your skin and the tool after use to avoid the spread of bacteria and possibly clogging other pores. [15] X Research source"

It is only a temporary fix, but it could be exactly what you need in an emergency. [16] X Research source Combine occasional use of strips with a good cleaning and exfoliating regime. For the best results, it's a good idea to use a treatment cream for a few nights in a row to loosen your pores before you try using a blackhead strip. [17] X Research source"
