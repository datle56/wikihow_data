The line from home plate through the pitcher’s mound to second base should run east-northeast to keep the sun out of the pitcher’s eyes."

Measure the distance from the back of home plate to the front of the pitcher’s plate with a tape measurer. The pitcher’s plate is a rubber rectangle that is 24 in (610 mm) long. Align the middle of the pitcher’s plate with the middle of home plate. [1] X Research source"

Fill in the area around the pitcher’s plate with a mixture of clay, sand, and dirt until it is 10 in (254 mm) taller than home plate. Then, place the pitcher’s plate firmly on top of the dirt.
