      "content": "A kiss on the cheek can be romantic, but it depends on who it’s from. If a crush or single, eligible acquaintance kisses you on the cheek, there's a big chance they have feelings for you.

      "content": "A kiss on the cheek could be a friendly greeting. In many cultures, a quick peck on the cheek is a way of saying, “Hi! How are you? It’s been so long.” Think of it like a platonic hug or handshake, just a bit more personal. Relatives and friends (of the same and opposite sex) tend to do this in Europe and Asia. [3] X Research source In most countries, you kiss the right cheek first in greeting. Many people don’t end up actually touching the cheek they’re kissing with their lips. They do an air kiss, hovering over the cheek and making a quick kissing noise."
