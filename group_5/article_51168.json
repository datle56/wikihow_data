      "content": "Obtain some parent monsters. You can get a Ghazt by breeding an Entbrat and one triple-element monster. The best combination is Entbrat and T-Rox , as breeding these two monsters is the shortest wait time per breeding attempt. [1] X Research source This is also the best combination if you're trying to breed a Rare Ghazt, unless you already have a Ghazt. [2] X Research source Other monsters you can breed with Entbrat to potentially get a Ghazt are Bowgart , Clamble, and Pummel. There is about a 1% chance of successfully breeding a Ghazt. If you breed for a Ghazt 70 times, you have about a 50% chance of successfully breeding one. If you do 690 breeding attempts, you will have a 99.9% chance of getting at least one Ghazt. During a Breeding Bonanza, this chance is increased to 500% to 1000%. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Upgrade your Breeding Structures, if you wish. While not necessary, you can upgrade your Breeding Structures to reduce breeding times by 25%. You can upgrade your structure by spending 25 diamonds. You can also add Wishing Torches around your Breeding Structure to help increase the odds of a rare monster being bred. [5] X Research source Wishing Torches can be lit for 24 hours by paying 2 diamonds or be lit permanently by paying 100 diamonds."

A Ghazt egg is translucent purple and surrounded by orbs, similar to a Ghazt. [6] X Research source To get a Rare Ghazt, you'll need to wait until a breeding window opens up. There are some promotions and events where all Rares of a certain element are available. [7] X Research source"
