The kitchen comes with a stove, which is the cooking interface, and a refrigerator, which has 36 item slots like a chest. Only ingredients in your inventory, your fridge, or your mini-fridge (a furnishing item) can be used to cook items on the stove. You can also use the Cookout Kit to cook anywhere, which is unlocked at Foraging level 9. The Cookout Kit is made of 15 wood, 10 fiber, and 3 coal. Any Cookout Kits placed will disappear overnight."
