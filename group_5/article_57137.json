      "title": "If you’re always on his schedule, let him plan around you instead.",
      "content": "If you’re always on his schedule, let him plan around you instead. Don’t cancel plans with your friends or rush to get your work done so you two can hang out. Instead, tell him your schedule for the week, and then let him figure out when you two can hang. If he has to rearrange his life a little bit for you instead of the other way around, he’s going to appreciate just how much effort you’ve been putting into the relationship so far. [1] X Research source The same thing goes for texts and calls, too. If you feel like you’re always reaching out first, let him do it for once. He might just realize that he’s been slacking a bit in his communication efforts."

      "title": "He might feel like you’re obligated to do things for him.",
      "content": "He might feel like you’re obligated to do things for him. If that’s the case, take a week off. Don’t cook for him, don’t do his laundry, and don’t remind him about his appointments. When he confronts you about it, say something like, “Oh, that slipped my mind. I thought you were going to take care of that since it’s your responsibility.” [2] X Research source It’s fine to do favors for your partner every once in a while. It only becomes an issue when your boyfriend starts to expect (or even demand) them from you."

      "content": "Let him see just how much fun you’re having! Go out to eat or have a fun afternoon with your friends. If your boyfriend asks what you’re doing, tell him that you’re going out, and he probably won’t be able to reach you for a while.

[3] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. Thursday, September 30, 2021. Another good way to work your plans into conversation is by telling him you’re too busy to hang out.

      "title": "Your BF will get to scroll through your socials and see you having fun.",
      "content": "Your BF will get to scroll through your socials and see you having fun. This will help him realize how fun you are (and how hot you are, too).

      "content": "Make some changes in your appearance to draw attention to yourself. Color your hair, try out some new makeup (if you wear it), or go on a shopping spree.

      "content": "This can be a little risky, so use this technique with caution. If you’re out with your BF and he’s not really paying any attention to you, try going up to another guy and getting a little flirty. When your boyfriend notices, he might just be reminded that other guys are attracted to you, too. [6] X Expert Source Julia McCurley Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. Thursday, September 30, 2021. If your boyfriend has jealousy issues that you’ve talked about in the past, this probably isn’t the best option for you. Flirting with other people can be a deal breaker for some, and it’s not worth risking your relationship over."

      "title": "Tell your boyfriend that you’re feeling a little underappreciated.",
      "content": "Tell your boyfriend that you’re feeling a little underappreciated. It’s normal to fall into a bit of a routine in long-term relationships, and chances are, your boyfriend doesn’t even know that you’ve been feeling neglected or taken advantage of lately. If these methods aren’t working or you want to open up a dialogue, sit down with your boyfriend and talk things out together. [10] X Research source For instance, you might say, “I’m not sure if you realize it, but I do a lot for you in this relationship. Lately, I’ve been feeling like you don’t really appreciate it, and it’s getting me down.”"

[11] X Research source In some cases, people will put less effort into their relationship because there's an issue they aren't addressing.

      "content": "Unfortunately, there may come a point when it’s time to break up. If you and your boyfriend have talked about how you’re feeling (maybe even multiple times) and he’s still not able to change, it could spell disaster. You don’t need to make any rash decisions, but it’s something to think about—when one partner refuses to work on the relationship, the other partner is only going to get more and more resentful. [12] X Research source If you’re in a long-term relationship, consider seeing a couple’s counselor. They can help you articulate your feelings and express what you need to your boyfriend."
