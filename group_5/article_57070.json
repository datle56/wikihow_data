      "title": "Choose a heatproof container for your candles.",
      "content": "Choose a heatproof container for your candles. Choose a metal, ceramic, or glass vessel because they’ll hold up to the hot wax and heat from burning your candle the best. It could be a bowl, mug, cup, or any other solid container you have at home. You may even use a container from an old candle you recently burned. Just be sure to wash out any debris inside and dry the container off before using it. [1] X Research source To check if your container is heatproof, fill it with boiling water and let it sit for 2–3 minutes. Then, pour out the hot water and immediately fill the container with cold water. If the container cracks or gets damaged, then choose a different one for making your candle. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Melt soy wax flakes in a double boiler . Fill the bottom pot of your double boiler halfway with water and place it over high heat. Then, fill up your candle container twice with the wax flakes and pour them all into the top pot of your double boiler. Place the pot with the wax on top of the one with the water so the wax can melt without the risk of it burning. [3] X Research source Weigh the wax you’re using on a kitchen scale before melting it so you know how much you’re using. This will make mixing fragrances easier later on. Alternatively, you may use beeswax , which already has a natural honey scent. However, beeswax doesn’t hold additional fragrances as well as soy. Avoid using paraffin wax for making candles. Even though paraffin holds scent the best, it’s made from petroleum and can release chemicals and soot deposits into the air. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add essential oils to the wax when it reaches 185 °F (85 °C). Check the melted wax with a candy thermometer until the wax reaches the correct temperature. Once the wax is hot and ready, add about 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of your favorite essential oil for every 4 ounces (110 g) of wax to naturally scent your candles . Pour the oil into the melted wax and stir it together with a chopstick. [5] X Research source Commercial fragrance oils have stronger scents, so only use 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) for every 1 pound (450 g) of wax. Just be aware these oils may have synthetic compounds that are released into the air when you burn them. [6] X Research source If you want to dye your candle a different color, add 3–4 drops of candle dye at a time to the melted wax and fragrance. Dip a piece of white paper into the wax and let it dry to see how the color will turn out. [7] X Research source Avoid adding more fragrance to your candle because too much may prevent it from burning properly."

      "content": "Attach a wick to the bottom of your container with a wick sticker . Start with a wick that’s longer than the container height. Take the backing off of a wick sticker and place it onto the metal bottom of the wick. Place the wick’s metal piece centered in the bottom of your container, and press it down firmly so it stays in place. Lay a popsicle stick or pencil across the top of the container, and wrap the loose end of the wick around it so it doesn’t fall down. [8] X Research source If your container is larger than 3 1 ⁄ 2 inches (8.9 cm) in diameter, use multiple wicks to burn the candle evenly . Alternatively, dab some hot glue or melted wax onto the bottom of the wick instead of a sticker to attach it to your container. If you can’t easily reach the bottom of your container, then push the metal piece down using a pencil or chopstick so it adheres firmly."

Take the melted wax off of the heat and let it cool down so it sets properly inside of the container without leaving gaps. Check the temperature of the wax every few minutes with your thermometer. Once it cools to 135 °F (57 °C), slowly pour the melted wax into the container, leaving about 1 ⁄ 2 –1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) of space between the wax and lip. [9] X Research source Lay old newspapers down over your work surface so you can easily clean off the candle wax if you accidentally spill. Try adding natural scented ingredients to the candle after pouring it. You could add dried flowers, crushed herbs, cinnamon sticks, or cloves for added scents and decoration. [10] X Research source"

When the wax has dried and solidified, unwrap the end of the wick from the pencil or popsicle stick. Use a pair of scissors to cut the wick down to size so it burns properly. [11] X Research source Alternatively, use a wick trimmer , which is made specifically to reach into candle containers to cut the wick shorter."
