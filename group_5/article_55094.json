      "content": "Hot water dissolves the wax quickly. Fill a large pot with water and set it on the stove. Turn the heat to high and let the water boil. Set the apples in the water for just a few seconds, turning them around with a slotted spoon to remove the wax on all sides. Carefully remove the apples and set them on a clean towel. A quick dunk in boiling water won't affect the texture of your apple, though it may dull the color just a tad. Rest assured that the apple will still taste delicious! If you’re making candy apples, dry them with paper towels and let them cool for about 30 minutes before you dip them in the caramel or candy coating."

Soak your apples in the mixture for 5-10 minutes. With clean hands, scrub the apples to help dissolve the wax on all sides. Then, rinse the apples thoroughly with clean water. [1] X Research source As an alternative to plain white vinegar, use apple cider vinegar or lemon juice. A vinegar and water wash can remove 98% of bacteria on an apple."

      "content": "Remove the wax by hand. Carefully run a knife over the skin of the apple to scrape off the wax. Repeat the process around the entire apple. [5] X Research source A butter knife would be a good choice here since you're just scraping the skin, not cutting into the apple."
