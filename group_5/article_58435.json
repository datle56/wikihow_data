      "content": "Choose a fun, harmless dare and a friend to challenge. If you're giving the dare, pick something that will make your friends laugh and that someone wouldn't normally do. Choose dares that are easy to complete at first if you're playing with a new group of people. Then, choose one target from your friend group, but don’t choose someone who doesn’t want to play. [1] X Research source Don't pick a dare that's life-threatening or illegal to complete. Remember: if you lose the game, you have to do the dare yourself! Easy dares include switching shirts with a friend, hugging a stranger, or asking a random person if they have a banana. Medium dares include drawing a tattoo on them with a pen for the rest of the night, licking a table, or singing a song in a crowded area. Hard dares include getting a permanent tattoo, buying the next flight out of town, or eating out of the trash. Check out our list of dare ideas ."

      "content": "Ask your friend what the odds are they will complete the dare, e.g., 1 in 10. Use the question format, “What are the odds that you will…” followed by the dare. The person you're asking then responds with any number between 2 and 100. This number sets the upper limit for a range of numbers for the rest of the game. [2] X Research source For example , if you ask, “What are the odds that you will eat a spoonful of hot sauce?” and your friend responds, “1 in 20,” then they must select a number between that range later on."

      "content": "Count down and say a number in the given range at the same time. Look the other player directly in the eyes, and both start your countdown. After you say 1, state a number at the same time between the range of numbers that you set. Make sure you both say your numbers at the same time so neither of you can cheat. For instance , if the range is between 1 and 20, you both count down, “3...2...1…” and then say a number between 1 and 20."

      "title": "The targeted player must perform the dare if you both say the same number.",
      "content": "The targeted player must perform the dare if you both say the same number. The dare only has to be done if both players say the same number. If you were the person challenged to the dare, complete it as soon as you can. If you're the person who gave the dare, sit back and enjoy watching your friend do it! The dare must be completed as soon as possible. Optional rule: If the 2 numbers add up to the total range, do another countdown, but this time with the range cut in half. (E.g., if the range was 1-20 and the players say 13 and 7, which equals 20, do another countdown with the range 1-10.) If the dare involves something you cannot complete immediately, do it as soon as possible. For example, if the dare was to shave down to a mustache, you can complete it once you're at home."

Take turns picking the dares for one another. If you're playing with more than two players, make sure everyone has a chance to give and accept a dare. As the game goes on, increase the difficulty of the dares to raise the stakes. [3] X Research source The game is over once both people have completed a dare, but you can keep playing for as long as you like. The follow-up dare can’t be the same as the first dare. If you dare someone to do something that costs money, like ordering something crazy off a menu, you must pay the person back immediately."

Wear your shoes on the wrong feet for 10 minutes. Ask a stranger for a high five. Run a lap around the nearest building. Mime a dramatic scene, like a big battle. Chug an entire bottle of water. Attempt a cartwheel."

      "content": "The odds of saying the same number increase as the range decreases. If the second player says the odds are 1 in 5, then you have a 1 in 5 or 20% chance of saying the same number. To calculate this, we multiply the odds of both players together (⅕ x ⅕ = 1/25). But then, since there are 5 opportunities to say the same number out of 25 number combinations, the actual odds are still 5/25, or ⅕. Here are some more probabilities: [4] X Research source 1 in 5 = 0.20% 1 in 10 = 0.10% 1 in 20 = 0.05% 1 in 30 = 0.033% 1 in 40 = 0.025% 1 in 50 = 0.02% 1 in 60 = 0.016% 1 in 70 = 0.014% 1 in 80 = 0.0125% 1 in 90 = 0.011% 1 in 100 = 0.01%"

      "content": "Some numbers are more likely to be picked than others. All that probability assumes that humans can really pick random numbers, but the dirty secret is that we can’t! Not totally, at least. Each person is more likely to pick a certain number based on personal bias. Studies show that some numbers, like 7, are picked much more often than others when people are asked to randomly pick a number between 1 and 10. [5] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source That’s why it’s best to stay away from common, popular, or prime numbers like 7, 17, and 37. People seem to gravitate toward these naturally. Or, if you’re trying to get someone to do a dare, choose these numbers since the other player is more likely to pick them."
