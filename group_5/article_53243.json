For example, if you're making an Airbus A380 plane model, you would search up the dimensions of the plane, as this is the first step to finding the plane's scale."

      "content": "Take the reciprocal of the number you just had. So, after your division of 55/0.5, the answer is 110. Taking the reciprocal basically means putting 1 over it as a fraction. So, the reciprocal is 1/110. Now, instead of this being a fraction, just make it into a ratio, so, it is not 1/110 but 1:110."
