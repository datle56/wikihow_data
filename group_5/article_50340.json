      "content": "Write the recipient’s first and last name on the first line. In most cases, this will be enough to get the letter into the right hands. You can also include the person’s middle initial, if you happen to know it. If there’s any confusion about who the letter is intended for, it’s a good idea to use their full name.

Smith/ACME Innovations Inc.” [4] X Research source There’s no need to include any additional identifying information, such as the person’s official title or job description."

      "content": "Provide the PO Box number. Post office box addresses always begin with the words “PO Box” followed by the individual box number, usually a 2-5 digit number. The US Postal Service requests that senders leave out all punctuation when filling in PO Box addresses. For instance, write “PO Box,” not “P.O. Box.” [5] X Research source Many businesses (and some individuals) receive their mail at post office boxes rather than traditional street addresses, which means you’ll only ever address your mail to 1 or the other, never both. [6] X Research source PO Boxes work a little differently in every country. As a result, you might not have the same number of shipping options available to you when sending a letter or package internationally. [7] X Research source"

Keep in mind that your mail is being handled, sorted, and delivered by another person, who will need to be able to read it at a glance. Always print handwritten info. Cursive and other fancy scripts can be difficult to make out. [12] X Research source It may help to write in all capital letters if your penmanship tends to be rushed or messy. If you’re unsure whether your address will be legible to an unfamiliar eye, start over with a fresh envelope just to be on the safe side."

Make sure the stamp or label isn’t hiding either address, or any other delivery info. [14] X Research source Use a postage calculator to add up the cost of postage, or ask a clerk for assistance. [15] X Research source International mail may also require additional postage or customs forms. These forms must be completed and submitted online prior to shipping."

It’s especially important that you get numerical details right. [16] X Research source When you’re satisfied with your letter, slip it in the mailbox or take it down to the post office for delivery. The mail carrier may know what you meant if you make a typo like “Indianapolis, IN,” but if the PO Box number or zip code is off, the letter could end up somewhere else or fail to be delivered at all."
