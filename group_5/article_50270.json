You can find these boxes by clicking on \"Window\" from the very top of your screen and checking \"Character\" and \"Paragraph.\" [1] X Research source Font: lets you select different font names such as Arial and Times New Roman. Font Size: adjust the points of the font size to make the text bigger or smaller. Font Alignment: choose whether you want the text to be centered or flushed to the right or left.

You can no longer edit text if you \"Rasterize it.\" If you accidentally get this option, ignore it for now. If the text layer is selected, press Ctrl-T or Cmd-T to resize the text by hand, instead of having to choose new font sizes. [2] X Research source"

Vertical Type Tool: Allows you to write your words up and down, instead of left to right. Horizontal Type Mask Tool: This turns your text into a mask, which can be used for a variety of fun Photoshop tricks. Off the bat, it will basically map the layer beneath the text and use it to \"color in\" your type. Vertical Type Mask Tool: Works just like the Horizontal Type Mask, but writes letters up and down instead of left to right. [3] X Research source"

While you should experiment freely in the Blending Options menu, some key effects for good text include: [6] X Research source Bevel & Emboss: This will make the text 3D. It reassembles turning the lines of the text into 3D cylinders, like pipes. Stroke: This outlines your text with the line of a color, thickness, and texture you get to choose. The Overlays: These will change the color of your font, placing a gradient, pattern, or new color over the shape of the text. You can even lower the opacities of these overlays, allowing you to do some fun shading and blending. Drop Shadow: Puts a moveable, short shadow behind your text -- like there was a wall a foot or two behind it. You can change the angle, softness, and size of the shadow. [7] X Research source"
