      "content": "Take note if you hear a ‘popping’ noise when the injury happens. Most people state that they hear a popping noise when the ACL is injured. If you heard a ‘popping’ or ‘snapping’ noise when you experienced your injury, it is likely that your ACL has been at least partially torn. You should go to the doctor to get this diagnosis confirmed. [1] X Research source Though you will most likely be in pain, try to remember the exact sound your knee made. Describing the noise your knee made can actually help your doctor to diagnose your injury."

      "content": "Monitor any pain you feel. Injuring your knee, regardless of whether it is a partial tear or just a minor sprain, can really hurt. In particular, you will most likely feel a radiating or gnawing pain when trying to do any physical activity. When you suffer a partial tear of your ACL, the pain receptors in your knee get activated. This can lead to a moderate to severe pain."

      "content": "Keep track of any swelling that occurs. Swelling is your body’s way of repairing internal structures whenever it has suffered an injury. If you notice that your knee has become swollen after your accident, you have most likely suffered at least a partial tear. [2] X Research source Tjoumakaris FP, Donegan DJ, and Sekiya JK. Partial Tears of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: Diagnosis and Treatment. Am J Orthop. 2011; 40(2):92-97. You should also take note if your knee becomes swollen after any time you do a physical activity. While you may not have noticed the swelling right after your accident, swelling after physical activity is a definite sign that you knee has been injured and could be partially torn."

      "content": "Know the common causes of ACL injuries. An ACL injury almost always occurs when motion is involved. You may have suddenly changed direction in a basketball game, or you may have landed awkwardly while going off a jump on the ski slopes. If you think you may have partially torn your ACL, it is important to know the instances in which ACLs are generally injured. These instances include [5] X Research source Tjoumakaris FP, Donegan DJ, and Sekiya JK. Partial Tears of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: Diagnosis and Treatment. Am J Orthop. 2011; 40(2):92-97. : Suddenly changing direction. Suddenly stopping while you were in motion. Having a heavy force or pressure put on your knee, such as when colliding with someone in football. Jumping and landing incorrectly or awkwardly. Suddenly slowing down when running."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You are much more likely to get an ACL injury when: You engage in athletic sports that involve the active use of your legs. Sports that involve physical contact can also increase your chances of ACL injury. You experience muscular fatigue. Muscular fatigue can also make a person prone to ACL injury. Since the muscle works together with the bones, ligaments and tendons, exerting your muscles and making them tired can lead to a higher risk of injury. For example, a tired soccer player is more susceptible to ACL injury than an energetic player who has just started playing. You have a medical condition that causes you to have weak muscles or bones. For example, having weak and brittle bones, having ineffective development of your cartilage, or being obese can all increase your chances of an ACL tear."

While you may be able to use this article as a guide to help you figure out if you are injured, you still must go to the doctor to get a professional diagnosis. It would be bad to think that you are ok, only to put pressure on your knee and injure it further. Schedule an appointment for as soon as possible after the injury. If you can, you may also go to the hospital to deal with the injury right away."

      "content": "Be aware that there are three grades of ACL injury. [7] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source When your ACL gets injured, it is referred to as a sprain rather than a broken bone because it is a ligament (though it can feel as painful as breaking a bone). The term 'sprain' refers to more than just the stretching of the ligament, it is actually the classification the is used to refer to ligament injuries. There are three levels of ACL injury. A grade 1 ACL sprain involves mild injury to the ligament. It has been slightly stretched but not torn. It can still sustain the knee joint and will help the leg remain stable. A grade 2 ACL sprain is when the ligament is stretched beyond its capacity to the point it becomes loose. This is when the technical term “partial tear of the ACL” is used. This can mean that part of the ACL is torn but the majority of it is intact; or that one of the bundles is torn but the other is intact. In the former, surgery may not be required, but in the latter, it will likely be necessary. [8] X Expert Source Jonathan Frank, MD Sports Orthopedic Surgeon & Joint Preservation Specialist Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. A grade 3 ACL sprain makes the knee joint unstable and the ligament is completely torn apart."

This is the preferred test for figuring out if you have a partial ACL tear because it can show that you have a partial tear even when the rest of the ligaments and tendons in your knee are uninjured. A doctor will [9] X Research source Tjoumakaris FP, Donegan DJ, and Sekiya JK. Partial Tears of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament: Diagnosis and Treatment. Am J Orthop. 2011; 40(2):92-97. : Have you lie down on a table. Your doctor will first look at your uninjured knee to see how far your shin moves forward when your knee is bent. Your ACL keeps your shin from moving very far forward. Your doctor will then look at your injured knee and see how far your shin moves forward when the knee is bent. If it moves forward further than normal but your doctor can still feel resistance, it means that you have a partial tear. If there is no resistance, your ACL has been fully torn."

      "content": "Be prepared for the Pivot Shift test. This test is meant to determine how much pressure can be put on your injured knee before it becomes unstable. Your doctor will move your injured leg a little ways away from your body (this is called hip abduction). [10] X Research source Duthon VB, Barea C, Abrassart S, Fasel JH, Fritschy D, Menetrey J.

She will then: Straighten your leg while simultaneously press inward against the outer part of your knee and twist your leg outward. Doing this will show how well your ACL is functioning because it is a movement that only involves the ACL. Your leg will be slowly bent while continuous pressure is put on it. When your knee is bent at a 20 to 40° angle, your doctor will look at your shin bone. If the bone slides forward a bit it means that your ACL has been partially torn. If you have a partial tear, where the majority of the ACL is still intact for both bundles, then that pivot shift will be negative.

      "content": "Have an x-ray taken of your knee. While the ACL cannot be seen through an x-ray, your doctor can look for other evidence that you ACL has been partially torn. An x-ray of both knees is necessary to detect signs of injury such as fracture, improper alignment of the bony structures, and narrowing of the spaces between joints.

Unlike an x-ray, an MRI will help your doctor to examine your soft tissue structures in your knee, including your ACL. Your doctor will also look at your meniscus and other knee ligaments to make sure that they are not injured. Your doctor might also request an oblique coronal image if he or she is still not sure about the extent of your injury. This image will give the doctor a better view of your knee in addition to the MRI."

Luckily, most partial ACL tears do not require surgery. You will, however, have to protect your knee from further injury. The best way to do this is to wear a brace or cast that will keep your knee stabilized while it heals. Your doctor might give you crutches to use along with your brace. Crutches are used to keep you from putting pressure or too much weight on your knee while it heals."

You should sit with your knee elevated so that it can begin to repair itself. When you sit down, prop your knee up so that it is raised above your hip. If you are lying down, prop your knee and leg up so that it is above your heart and chest."

Write a bag of ice or an ice pack in a towel to keep the ice from directly touching your skin, as this could cause a burn. Keep the ice on your knee for 15 to 20 minutes for the best results. [14] X Research source Steckel H, Starman JS, Baums MH, Klinger HM, Schultz W, Fu FH.Anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament double bundle structure: a macroscopic evaluation. Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2007;17(4):387-392. Any amount of time shorter than 15 minutes will not do much to control swelling or pain. Keeping the ice on your knee for longer than 20 minutes may result in the ice burning your skin."

      "content": "Consider surgery as a last resort. If your ACL is fully torn, or if your tear falls between a partial and full tear, you may need surgery for the knee to be fully repaired. If this is the case, you will have to have a graft done to replace the torn ligament. The most common graft used is the tendon of the kneecap or hamstring. However, acquiring tendons from donor knee is also an option. Talk to your doctor about the best option for your specific case."
