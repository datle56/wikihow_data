      "content": "Spinning PokéStops and Gyms. There's no guarantee, but you'll likely get a Metal Coat from 7-day streaks. Just spinning regular, daily PokéStops and Gyms might not get you a Metal Coat. But getting your 7-day streak award has a higher chance of holding your upgrade. You'll get a bunch of rewards after 7 days, including an upgrade item. However, a Metal Coat is not guaranteed, so be prepared to get several 7-day streaks."

      "content": "Completing field research tasks. Certain research tasks reward a Metal Coat. However, you may not always have access to that research task. Tap the binoculars in the lower right corner and tap the Field tab to see your research tasks. The rewards for each task are displayed on the right side of the tile, so you'll know which ones to complete for a Metal Coat. If none of your current research tasks offer a Metal Coat, wait another day or spin more PokéStops to see if you have a new research task to complete."

Sometimes these gifts can contain the Metal Coat you're looking for! The more friends you have and the more gifts you get slightly increases the chance of getting a Metal Coat."
