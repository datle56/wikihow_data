      "content": "Scorpio is a highly intelligent sign that loves to learn. This is good news for a Gemini gal who knows a little bit about everything! Sprinkle facts and opinions about any topic at all into your conversation with a Scorpio guy. He’ll be fascinated by the breadth of your knowledge and curious about how your brain works. Cliché tricks like reading or journaling in public will catch a Scorpio’s eye. He’ll be dying to know what you’re working on. Pique his curiosity by dropping a really niche stat or fun fact, like how there was a town in Alaska that had a cat as mayor for 20 years. He’ll have to find out how you knew that."

      "content": "Scorpio men aren’t ones for small talk. He’d rather jump right into an esoteric discussion about subculture or learn about your upbringing than chat about the weather. Speak confidently about your passions and any rebellious or profound thoughts you have. His deep nature finds this kind of talk super alluring. A Scorpio guy definitely doesn’t fall for the “playing dumb” type. Let your brain shine and articulate your thoughts and feelings clearly. Don’t be afraid to get a little vulnerable in these chats. A Scorpio guy wants to be your emotional protector, and he’ll find a chance to fill that role attractive. Spark some philosophical talk with intriguing questions like “Does technology make us more unhappy?” or “What is consciousness?” (or just start with your opinion and watch how curious he gets about you). Reader Poll: We asked 610 wikiHow readers who've dated Scorpio men, and only 7% of them agreed that the best way to attract them is by being intelligent and analytical. [Take Poll] While philosophical discussions may interest your Scorpio, it’s much more important to be yourself and connect with him about things you both enjoy."

      "content": "Scorpios want to know what makes you special and different. Putting on airs or pretending to be someone else to impress him will backfire immediately.

      "content": "Let’s be real—Scorpio men love sex. A Gemini woman naturally has the flirty wit and humor to charm him, but it’s important to look the part too.

      "content": "A Scorpio guy is a natural loner. He’s drawn to your social butterfly energy but will hesitate to approach you in a big group setting. Ask him to come order a drink at the bar with you or step outside at a party so the two of you can get some 1-on-1 time away from the crowd. He’ll relish the chance to have you to himself for a moment. Encourage him to approach you by sitting alone at a café or standing off to the side at a party for a minute. He’ll be more confident when there are less people around you. A Scorpio guy wants all your attention and might get jealous or possessive because of your expansive social circles.

      "title": "A Scorpio man finds curiosity attractive.",
      "content": "A Scorpio man finds curiosity attractive. Lean into your inquisitive air sign nature and try to learn more about the bad boy of the zodiac. He knows that he’s deep and rarely understood, so an effort to get to know him will mean a lot. If you can find the beauty in his dark side, he’ll be yours. Lay off the personal questions if you sense he’s getting paranoid or suspicious of you. He’s very private and might get sensitive if you pry too far. A quick-witted Gemini is one of the few people that can keep up with a Scorpio’s turbulent emotions. Stay curious about his feelings so he feels secure and cared for. Try gentle questions that won’t force him to totally open up, like “If you could live anywhere, where would you live?” or “Who’s your favorite author of all time?”"

      "content": "A Scorpio man likes the challenge of piecing someone together. Geminis generally enjoy talking about themselves (a lot), so resist the urge to tell him your whole life story right away. Instead, give him a few puzzle pieces—a few interesting facts or stories about you—that’ll make him curious to know more about you. [6] X Research source Regardless of how much you tell him, make sure it’s true and not too exaggerated. He’ll be turned off by any hint of insincerity."

      "content": "Suspicious Scorpio might not trust you if you seem too eager. He’s a little paranoid and might think you’re up to something if you come across overly familiar or intrusive with him. Let him make the first move so he feels in control. It might take him a while to warm up to you, but if you catch his attention with a sharp look and a sparkling wit, it’s only a matter of time. Patience is critical when you’re dealing with a Scorpio man. He doesn’t come to any decision lightly and will take his time to consider if it’s emotionally worth it to pursue someone. As an effervescent air sign, his hesitation might seem strange to you at first. Remember that water signs like Scorpio are cautious folk and don’t want to risk any unnecessary ripples in their emotions."

      "content": "Scorpio men need quiet time to brood and ponder life’s meaning. This doesn’t always gel with a Gemini, the chattiest sign in the zodiac. Try reading next to each other, or snuggling up and watching a compelling documentary (he’ll take a deep doc over a rom-com any day). He’ll love that you’re physically near him and appreciate the mental space to decompress. When a Gemini likes someone, they’re prone to overtalking and might slip up and say inappropriate things or have Freudian slips. [7] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. It’s OK to slow your roll and relax in silence. You’re ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication.

      "content": "A Scorpio man will give you 100% of his focus when you’re around. He remembers lots of details about you, and expects the same attention and memory in return. Listen to him closely, especially when he’s talking about his emotions. If you can pick up on his feelings and secrets without him explicitly telling you, he’ll feel super validated and relaxed with you. It’s hard for a Gemini to give their undivided attention to one person. Remember that your reward will be an incredibly sensitive and attentive partner in return."

      "content": "Loyalty and trust are super important to a Scorpio guy. He’s naturally guarded and might be suspicious of your dualistic Gemini nature. Stand by him, keep his secrets, and be upfront and honest with him no matter what. A Scorpio guy can forgive many things, but he’ll never get over broken trust. He’ll judge your trustworthiness by how you treat other people too. Avoid unnecessary gossip about others around him or he might get paranoid that you talk about him too. Scorpio is a tense sign. He’ll relax around you if you can look him in the eye and be accountable and upfront. [8] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 8 December 2021."

      "content": "A Scorpio man is like a human lie detector. He’s very shrewd, cautious, and will comb through everything you say for traces of dishonesty. [9] X Expert Source Angel Eyedealism Astrologer & Performance Artist Expert Interview. 23 December 2021. Resist the Gemini urge to bend the truth or omit something to spare his feelings. He’d rather work through a problem than discover you were dishonest. Scorpios are the ultimate grudge holders. Lying to him one time can damage your relationship for good. If there’s something you can’t or don’t want to share with him, just say you’re not ready to talk about it. He’ll appreciate the honesty, and his curiosity about you will grow even more."

Make sure he’s the only guy you’re seeing to prevent a huge argument (and to keep him from just walking away).

A suspicious Scorpio might freak out if he spots Tinder on your phone screen, even if you’re not using it. A Scorpio man in love wants to be the only man you’ll ever cherish. He’ll be deeply hurt if he feels like he’s not the only man in your life. Scorpio is ruled by aggressive Mars and dark Pluto which, on a bad day, means he’ll destroy your relationship if he’s angry or hurt enough. It’s definitely worth it to avoid anything that might set him off."
