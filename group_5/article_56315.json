      "content": "Use a hot glue gun to make your ring 1 to 2 sizes smaller. To use a hot glue gun , load it with glue sticks and let it heat up. Using the glue gun, cover the inside of the band with hot glue. Let the glue cool and harden, making a clear ring adjuster that’s not visible outside the band. [1] X Research source For a more precise fit, squirt additional thin lines of hot glue inside your ring’s band. This method also works with silicone glue ."

      "content": "Wrap clear tape around your ring’s band to make it feel smaller. find the tape’s edge and pull off a piece roughly 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Start at one end of the tape and roll it into a tube with the sticky side out. Leave enough length at the end to wrap around your ring’s band. Once the tape is in a small tube, place it inside your ring on the bottom of the band. Use the extra length of tape, not in a tube, to secure it to the outside of the band. [2] X Research source Use clear tape or packing tape if possible so it’s not as noticeable when you put it on your ring. Clean your ring before you add the tape so it sticks better."

      "content": "Apply a quick-drying clear nail polish on the inside of the ring. For an invisible fix, use a bottle of clear nail polish top coat. Shake the bottle of top coat. Unscrew the lid and use the applicator brush to carefully swipe the polish onto the inside of your ring’s band. Apply a thin layer on the bottom of the band. Avoid getting any nail polish on the outside of the ring. Wait a few minutes for the nail polish to dry before putting on your ring to make sure it doesn’t smear. [3] X Research source If your ring is still sliding around on your finger, apply another clear coat layer on top of the first layer to give it more height. Use your fingers to wipe away any excess nail polish that gets on the sides of your ring, if necessary. Then, remove the nail polish from your skin with a dab of nail polish remover. If you need to remove the top coat from the ring, soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover and dab the ring until the nail polish comes off."

Plastic ring guards are transparent little tubes that slip onto your ring’s band to help keep it from moving around on your finger. Pick out a plastic ring guard in a size right for your specific ring and place the plastic tube onto your band by slipping it through the slit in the ring guard. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Loop clear fishing line around the ring to help keep it in place. Cut a strand of clear 30-pound monofilament fishing line at least 5 in (13 cm) long. String the clear fishing line through the ring and tie a knot near the edge of the band to keep it secure. Begin wrapping the fishing line through the band to create loops. Push the loops close together when they’re on the band as you go. Once you get to the other side of the band, tie another knot to secure the fishing line in place. [5] X Research source Pull the fishing line taut as you’re looping it through the band to make sure it stays on the ring tightly. This will also help you push the loops together more easily. If you need to remove the fishing line from the ring, cut the knots at the band and unravel it carefully."

If you think the plastic or fishing line solutions might be uncomfortable on your finger, pick out a piece of soft string or yarn at least 5 in (13 cm) long. Tie a knot onto the side of your band using the string or cloth and begin looping it through the band and pulling it tightly. This will create a soft cushion to help keep your ring from moving around. [6] X Research source Tie another knot at the other end of the band to keep the string or cloth in place. Use a soft cloth that’s less than 1 cm (0.39 in) wide to make looping it easier. Use scissors to cut the string or cloth off of the ring, if necessary."

      "content": "Use a tan rubber band under the ring to stop it from sliding. Take a standard rubber band and loop it around the base of your finger. [7] X Research source Don’t loop it too tightly, or you may cut off circulation. Then, slip the ring on over the looped rubber band. The rubber band fills the space between your finger and the ring. Use a smaller rubber band if you only need a slightly smaller ring."

      "content": "Ask your jeweler to add sizing beads to your ring. Sizing beads are made out of the same material as your ring and are added to the inside of the band to keep your ring from moving around on your finger. Two beads are soldered on in the lower left and lower right section of the band and can be smoothed out to be more comfortable. Sizing beads will resize your ring about a half size smaller. Contact your local jeweler to find out how much sizing beads would cost for your specific type of ring. For example, if your ring was made out of 14K gold, the beads that are attached would be made of 14K gold as well to match. Sizing beads can also be removed later on by your jeweler, if needed."

When you slide your finger into your ring, the metal ‘U’ shape will expand to hold your ring in place. Many people find these to be the most comfortable temporary option for resizing rings. The spring insert is usually silver, even if your ring is a different color or material."

      "content": "Get your ring professionally resized for a permanent solution. If your ring slides around constantly or is just clearly too large, the best thing to do is to get it resized. While this may be a little more expensive, resizing your ring will ensure that it’s comfortable and permanently fixed. To resize the ring, your jeweler will likely cut out a small section of the ring and rejoin it so it’s the right size. [8] X Research source Make sure you talk with your jeweler about how much smaller your ring needs to be and what your correct ring size is so they know exactly how to resize it."
