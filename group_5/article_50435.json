      "content": "This response will make it sound like you’re blowing her off. No one likes to get a “K” message, especially not from their S.O. If she just told you something funny or wrote out a big message, hit her with a “K” to leave her feeling irritated. [1] X Research source “Ok” and “Okay” work too!"

      "title": "Make her think that you’re totally uninterested in your convo.",
      "content": "Make her think that you’re totally uninterested in your convo. If your girlfriend just wrote out multiple texts or a huge paragraph, read the entire thing, then respond with “haha” or “nice.” [2] X Research source You could also try “lol” or “cool.”"

      "content": "Not responding is one of the most annoying things you could do. If you two are having a lively texting conversation, stop in the middle of it and just don’t reply. She’ll probably be annoyed and wonder why you stopped texting her or what you’re doing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Spamming her with pics instead of texts is sure to make her annoyed.",
      "content": "Spamming her with pics instead of texts is sure to make her annoyed. When she texts you, pick a funny photo out of your library and send that instead. If she questions it or asks why you sent that, pick another silly photo to send. Keep it up until she’s raging mad! You could also use funny gifs or short videos if you have them on hand. Or, try sending her a gif of the iMessage typing bubble. It will look like you’re crafting a long message, when in reality, you aren’t texting her back at all."

      "content": "Act like it’s a totally normal word to use in everyday sentences. Come up with something funny, like “glorb” or “grunkle.” Then, throw it into conversation and act totally normal when she texts back confused.

      "content": "Throw in some random hashtags that don’t really make sense. Hashtags make every sentence a little more exciting. Pick a random word in your text that you’d like to hashtag, then use it like it’s completely normal. “Hey, how’s it #going? I’m eating a #sandwich.” “Wanna watch a #movie later?” “I gotta go, I’m falling #asleep.”"

She’s sure to be confused, and she’ll probably be even more irritated if you decide not to explain what you’re doing. Try out other random emojis, like 😈, ✨, 🗿, 🅱️, 🦄."
