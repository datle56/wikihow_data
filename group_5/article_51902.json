You will get a message on the day scores are available telling you to check again later. This occurs if you took a makeup test or if the answer sheet was missing information.

Your score will reflect your college readiness. [9] X Research source The green area means you have met or exceeded the benchmark and are on track for college readiness. The test will show you the minimum score to meet the benchmark. Red or yellow means you have not hit the benchmark."

      "title": "Assess your score.",
      "content": "Assess your score. When you check your score, you can immediately determine if it is a bad, good, or excellent score. Your SAT score includes a national percentile ranking. This lets you know how many test takers you scored better than. The average 50th percentile score is 1060, so somewhere around that score is an average good score. [10] X Research source Anything above 1060 moves you from average towards excellent. For example, a score of 1190 puts you in the 73rd percentile, and a score of 1290 puts you in the 86th percentile. Some colleges have minimum SAT score requirements, which you can also use to determine whether your score is good enough or not."

      "title": "Determine your superscore.",
      "content": "Determine your superscore. Some colleges allow you to use a superscore. A superscore is the combination of your highest reading and math scores from different tests. For example, if you took the SAT on three different test dates, you can choose the two highest scores to make your total score. [11] X Research source To determine your superscore, look at all of your SAT test results on the college board website. Then, choose the highest reading score and the highest math score. Add them together. That is your superscore. Most colleges will look at a superscore, but some will not. Before you take the SAT multiple times to try for a superscore, make sure the colleges you are applying to allow this."
