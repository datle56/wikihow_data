      "content": "Measure the size of your doorknob. Often, front and back door locksets will be larger than interior locksets, and commercial locksets will be a bit different from residential ones. Knowing in advance which size you need will save you headaches later. Draw a tape measure from the latch edge of the door to the center of the doorknob or deadbolt lockset. Most contemporary locksets are either 2-3/8 inch (6cm) or 2-3/4 inch (6.5cm) diameter. The bolt or latch in many new locksets are adjustable for both, but make sure before leaving your hardware store to keep from having to backtrack. Older locksets may vary in size, but are generally smaller, requiring more extensive carpentry (and greater woodworking skills). If that's what you have, try checking vintage renovation stores for a \"new\" lockset. Tip: Determine which brand of lock you have. This is usually printed on the latch, but can also be found on the key — useful if the plate has been painted over, or is a leftover from an old doorknob set. You won't need an exact replacement of your old lock, but knowing the brand, style, setback, and features of the old lock will help ensure that your new lock looks, fits, and works as advertised.

If they are not visible, look along the edge for a hole, where they sometimes hide an allen bolt. If there are no holes or hidden screws, the plate is simply snapped in place — use a thin flathead screwdriver to gently pry off the cover, exposing the locking mechanism."

These are found on the inside half of the knob. Once both screws are removed, simply pull each half of the knob straight away from the door. Don't let the door close or you will either have to re-insert the half of the knob with the \"blade\" on it or use a screwdriver or butter knife to unlatch it."

[2] X Research source If your new lock is the same brand and model as the old one you may be able to keep your existing latch plate and strike plate. Hold the new plates up to the old and compare — if they're the same, it is better to leave the old ones in place if possible. Removing and replacing screws tends to weaken their hold in the door. If you can't get the new screws to bite, you may have to shove a small splinter of wood (or two) into the screw hole and snap them off flush with the edge of the door (toothpicks work well for this). Another alternative is to purchase longer screws, but make sure that the screw heads are identical to the ones provided by the manufacturer or they may not seat properly and cause problems."

[3] X Research source If the new latch has trouble staying put in its recess, fit the screws into the latch and then tighten down."

A couple of quick turns using your Allen wrench (or hex key — they're the same thing) should be able to loosen the deadbolt mechanism from the inside. Remove the inside cylinder and outside cylinder. If your deadbolt lock has decorative caps over the screws, use a punch and hammer to knock the caps off center and then grab them with pliers. Then use the Allen wrench to unscrew the mountings. You can also twist off these decorative caps using your finger. If they still won't budge, drill them out instead."
