If you wish to graph more than two dependent variables, follow the same format and add a dep3 variable. If you wish to graph only one dependent variable, only graph the first pair of x and y values (Example: plot(x, y1))."

If you wish to change the color of only one line enter set(p(x),’color’,’[Desired Color]’); into the command line. The x in p(x) is the number that corresponds to the order that the lines are plotted in (Example: y1 = p(1), y2 = p(2))."
