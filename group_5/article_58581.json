      "title": "Preppy refers to brightly colored, girly fashion.",
      "content": "Preppy refers to brightly colored, girly fashion. Gen Alpha’s definition of preppy is vastly different from the original meaning of the term. The preppy aesthetic no longer features sweater vests and pleated skirts. Instead, it emphasizes pink, other bright colors, smiley faces, and girly accessories like bows and ribbons. The style started as a TikTok trend and is very popular with young girls. [1] X Research source When you hear “preppy,” think of brands like Lululemon and Lily Pulitzer. Preppy can also sometimes be an indication of wealth. While one doesn’t have to be rich to be preppy, there is often a connection between the two because so many preppy brands and styles are expensive, especially for children and young teens."

      "title": "Preppy is mostly used as an adjective to describe someone’s style.",
      "content": "Preppy is mostly used as an adjective to describe someone’s style. For example, if you see someone wearing a bright pink skirt and carrying a Stanley cup, compliment their style by saying something like, “Wow, you look so preppy! I love your outfit.” Or, refer to yourself as preppy: “I’m absolutely obsessed with smiley faces, cowgirl boots, and the color pink. I’m so preppy!” While the new preppy aesthetic is generally targeted at preteen girls, ‘preppy’ can also refer to boys who use expensive hygiene products or put effort into their appearance. The masculine side of the preppy aesthetic is less fashion-focused than the feminine side. For example, “My brother spends hours on his skincare routine. He’s so preppy.” That being said, it’s perfectly fine for a boy to dress according to the preppy aesthetic if he wants to. But generally, clothing brands orient preppy clothing toward tween girls more than they do toward boys."

      "title": "Wear bright colors and patterns.",
      "content": "Wear bright colors and patterns. One of the key factors in achieving the new preppy aesthetic is dressing in vibrant colors, like hot pink and cyan. Bold patterns are also popular, like cheetah and leopard print and feminine florals. Prints featuring smiley faces, cowboy hats, hearts, and lightning bolts also play a large role in the preppy look. [2] X Research source Brand logos like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Prada are also popular, but don’t feel like you have to buy these products, especially if they’re out of your price range."

      "title": "Choose comfortable but feminine outfits.",
      "content": "Choose comfortable but feminine outfits. A lot of preppy fashion combines traditionally girly clothing with trendy athleisure wear. Opt for ruffled skirts in pastel colors, animal print, or floral print and shirts with bishop sleeves or lettuce edges for a more feminine look. Or, go for a cami, crop top, or baggy T-shirt with bike shorts, yoga pants, or sweatpants for a casual preppy style. [3] X Research source As for shoes, Nike Air Forces, Birkenstocks, and cowboy boots are very popular."

      "content": "Wear and carry trendy accessories. While you can be preppy without keeping up with all the latest trends, a lot of popular trends happen to fall under the preppy aesthetic. For example, Stanley cups are trendy in general, and they’re very popular with those who enjoy the preppy aesthetic. Charm bracelets and friendship bracelets , Evil Eye anklets , and heart-shaped sunglasses are also really trendy. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Craft a skincare routine that works for you. While many members of Gen Alpha are too young to wear a full face of makeup, a lot of people with the preppy aesthetic are obsessed with skincare, particularly from brands like Drunk Elephant. [5] X Research source Don’t feel like you have to go buy a ton of skincare products, but consider using one or two products that promote healthy skin, like a cleanser and a moisturizer."

      "content": "Listen to pop music. You can still be preppy without listening to pop music, but many preppy people enjoy trendy songs that are often played in TikTok videos. Think artists like Olivia Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, and The Weeknd. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Have an upbeat, positive attitude.",
      "content": "Have an upbeat, positive attitude. Living a preppy lifestyle is more than just wearing the “right” clothes. Try to be as kind and friendly as possible. Go out and meet new people and spend plenty of time with your friends by going to the beach or mall or just hanging out at your house. Don’t forget to post your adventures on TikTok!

      "title": "Preppy can be a compliment or an insult.",
      "content": "Preppy can be a compliment or an insult. It all depends on if you—or the person calling you preppy—like the aesthetic or not. If you’re a fan of bright colors and enjoy the preppy trend, the word has positive associations. If you don’t like the aesthetic, calling someone preppy or being called preppy would be considered an insult. For example, some people say those who dress preppy only care about clothing and trends that are popular on TikTok rather than finding their own style. If one of these people calls something preppy, they probably mean it negatively. On the other hand, if a girl who loves pink and smiley faces calls your shirt preppy, she probably likes it. Historically, the word “preppy” has often had negative connotations, as many people think those who have a preppy style are stuck up. Remember, don’t judge a book by its cover! Get to know someone before assuming what they’re like simply based on how they dress."

      "title": "Preppy was originally associated with prep school fashion.",
      "content": "Preppy was originally associated with prep school fashion. The old “preppy” describes people who attended prep schools or look and behave like prep school students or graduates. The style, which often featured items like polo shirts and sweater vests, was viewed as a status symbol for the wealthy. [8] X Research source This meaning of the term has been around since the early 1900s and has historically been tied to elite, Ivy-League preparatory schools. While the exact fashion changed over the decades, the overall understanding of the word “preppy” largely remained the same until recent years. In fact, this definition of preppy is still the meaning accepted by the dictionary and by Millennials, elder Gen Z’ers, and other older generations."

      "title": "The “new” preppy began as a TikTok trend.",
      "content": "The “new” preppy began as a TikTok trend. Like many Gen Z and Gen Alpha fashion trends, the new preppy aesthetic seems to have originated on TikTok. Content creators began posting videos wearing brightly colored fashion from brands like Lululemon and sporting the popular Stanley cup—both of which have become staples in the preppy aesthetic. Teen and preteen girls then quickly adopted the style for themselves. Some brands are even dedicated specifically to the new preppy style, like Dear Hannah Prep, a Texas boutique for girls that went viral on TikTok for their trendy, colorful fashion. It’s possible the new version of preppy is called such because it still has ties to wealth. Many trendy styles and products promoted on TikTok can be expensive, and being able to participate in all the trends may be a sign that someone has a wealthy background. This isn’t always the case, however."

      "content": "Videos from older generations caused the trend to go viral. Surprisingly, it wasn’t Gen Alpha that made the new version of preppy so well known—it was their parents. Many parents and older siblings of Gen Alpha started posting TikTok videos where they try to guess what different Gen Alpha slang terms mean. Millennials and other older generations were shocked to learn the definition of preppy had changed, leading to many viral videos and conversations about the new aesthetic. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Basic In slang, basic means something is boring, mainstream, or unoriginal. Some members of Gen Alpha think the preppy aesthetic is the equivalent of basic, although the term basic is used more by Millennials and some Gen Z. [10] X Research source For example, the stereotype of a “basic” girl is someone who wears Uggs, drinks pumpkin spice lattes, and takes lots of selfies. These things are all very mainstream, so people who enjoy them are sometimes called basic because other people think they’re unoriginal."

It’s the opposite of trendy and can also refer to something or someone who is trying too hard to be trendy or cool. Cheugy is mostly when discussing fashion or aesthetics. [11] X Research source For example, many members of Gen Alpha think Millennial fashion trends like side bangs and skinny jeans are unfashionable. They might say the style is cheugy."

      "content": "Waspy Waspy refers to anything relating to WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants), which is a term used to describe the wealthy, privileged upper class of America. These people are typically viewed as snobby, and they often dress in traditional preppy (or old money) clothing. Therefore, Gen Alpha may refer to those clothing aesthetics as waspy. [12] X Research source For example, if someone was wearing tailored trousers, a polo shirt, and a sweater vest, they might look waspy."

      "content": "Coquette Originally inspired by the controversial novel Lolita , the coquette aesthetic focuses on hyper-feminine fashion that incorporates elements of youth and girlhood. Those with this aesthetic often wear pink and pastels, lace, florals, pearls, and bows. [15] X Research source This trend has sparked controversy due to its association with Lolita and the sexualization of young girls. As younger generations, like Gen Alpha, have adopted the style, however, it has become notably less sexual and more focused on femininity."
