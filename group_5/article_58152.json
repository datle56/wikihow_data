      "content": "Select what kind of watercolors to buy. Watercolor paints are available in either tubes or shallow pans. Choosing tubes enables you to customize your collection a bit more, while pans usually come with an array of pre-selected colors. Invest in mediocre quality watercolors. Cheap watercolors will become chalky and their color will be less colorful. [1] X Research source Watercolor paints are delineated by property: some are transparent and others are opaque. Transparent colors allow you to see the white of the paper, giving the paint strokes a luminescent quality. Opaque colors can also be quite vivid, but they have a tendency to look dull since they block the light from coming through the paper. [2] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Art Teacher & Painter Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. Almost all watercolor paint containers have a square on the packaging that will tell you how transparent the paint is. A completely black square means opaque paint. A square filled halfway with black is semi-opaque paint. A square with a white filling is translucent paint. [3] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Art Teacher & Painter Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. Watercolor paints may also be either non-staining or staining. Non-staining paints stay on the surface of the watercolor paper, making them easy to lift or blend with other non-staining paints. Staining paints seep into the paper permanently and they're more difficult to blend with non-staining paints."

You'll probably want a basic set that includes the following primary colors: New Gamboge, Hansa Yellow Medium, Pyrrol Scarlet, Quinacridone Rose, French Ultramarine Blue, Phthalo Blue (GS), and Quinacridone Burnt Orange. [4] X Research source Once you learn how to work with these fundamental colors, experiment with other paints."

      "title": "Select your brushes.",
      "content": "Select your brushes. You'll want to pick up a handful of sizes, ranging from number 5 round to number 10 round. They should have a nice point in order to hold paint easily. You might also buy a large flat brush, 1/2” or larger. This has a long straight edge which is useful for doing washes or applying a base layer of paint. Some artists will tell you to invest in good brushes right away while others recommend starting with inexpensive brushes until you decide if you want to stick with watercolors. With this confusing advice in mind, choose brushes according to your budget and your own desire to watercolor paint. Be sure to look for “watercolor” brushes, which have soft bristles. Hard bristled “oil” brushes won't work."

      "title": "Buy watercolor paper.",
      "content": "Buy watercolor paper. There's no going around this one if you want paintings that won't warp or bubble when you start to work. Printer paper will not work because it is too thin to contain the watercolors. Watercolor paper is heavy and slightly textured. It's made to withstand the application of a considerable amount of water and paint. Watercolor paper comes in three different textures: hot-pressed, which has a slick surface, cold-pressed, which has a medium surface, and rough, which has a bumpy surface. You'll also want to choose a thicker, heavier paper when starting out."

      "title": "Look for a board.",
      "content": "Look for a board. When starting out, this can be as simple as a sturdy piece of cardboard propped up against a wall or board. If you're purchasing a board, choose a wood, plexiglass or foam board to which you can affix your watercolor paper. You may also want to buy an easel to hold the board upright while you paint. This is a matter of personal preference, as some people like to paint on a flat surface, while others like painting at an angle."

      "title": "Set up your painting workspace.",
      "content": "Set up your painting workspace. This should be a comfortable space that you'd like to spend time in. Choose an area that gets a lot of natural light. If you'll be working in the evening or don't have access to very good light, you may want to set up a strong desk lamp. [6] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Art Teacher & Painter Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. Look for a bulb or lamp with full-spectrum lighting. This will keep your lighting from being being too warm, making it difficult to paint accurately. Also, make sure your lampshade is pure white. This will keep your lighting more natural."

Keep them close to your painting, but give yourself enough room to maneuver comfortably. [7] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Art Teacher & Painter Expert Interview. 2 July 2019. If you're right handed, set up your palettes, brushes, and water containers on the right side of the desk, with the paper towels and other equipment on the left side. Reverse this if you are left handed. Lay your brushes flat on a paper towel when you're not using them. Never leave brushes sitting in your water containers. They won't stay clean and you can ruin the tips of your brushes."

      "content": "Set up your paper. Tape your watercolor paper to your board using masking tape and set it in the middle of the table. Tilt your desk upward, if possible, or raise the back of the board by placing a block underneath it to give you a good angle. You can lightly sketch your subject or landscape onto the paper with a light pencil. Many artists like to paint without a guide, but it can be useful when starting out. Keep erasers nearby to correct mistakes."

      "content": "Choose colors to use in your painting. Pick a red, a yellow, and a blue to use as your primary colors. These colors will be mixed and blended to create some of other colors you'll use when painting, giving it a nice coherence. You can then choose other special colors to make each painting unique. Many artists use the same three primary colors in all of their work."

      "title": "Understand how to use warm and cool colors.",
      "content": "Understand how to use warm and cool colors. Warm colors, such as red, orange, and yellow, tend to look as though they are moving forward on the paper. Cool colors, such as blue, purple and green, appear to be receding. Complementary colors that appear opposite each other on the color wheel, such as yellow and purple, appear to advance in equal measure when they are next to each other - in other words, they seem to fight for attention."

      "title": "Learn how to mix a puddle.",
      "content": "Learn how to mix a puddle. Pick a color of paint and dab a drop or two in your mixing tray. A round brush, size 8, is excellent for beginners. Do not use the flat brush pictured. Dip your brush in water and mix the brush into the paint in your tray. If you're using additional colors, create two more paint puddles in two separate mixing trays. Be sure to wash out your brush between puddles. Don't use too much water. Start with just a little, then add more if necessary. It's more difficult to achieve a richer color by adding more paint than it is to dilute a color by adding a little water. However, use more water for large spaces, such as the sky. Watercolor is done in layers, so if your area dries too light, add another layer of color. Fill your palette with the different colors you are using. Squeeze just a bit of each color into the individual palette wells."

      "title": "Practice mixing colors.",
      "content": "Practice mixing colors. This way, you'll understand how they work together. Having the ability to mix and layer colors so precisely is part of what makes watercolor so unique. The first few times you mix colors, you may be surprised at the outcome. Watercolor paint dries several shades lighter than it appears when it is still wet. Keep this in mind when you're figuring out how to make a color lighter or darker. Try not to overmix your colors. They don't need to be totally blended. One brushstroke may contain distinct gradations of color, rather than a solid blend. That's part of the beauty of watercolor."

      "title": "Load your brush with paint.",
      "content": "Load your brush with paint. To fully load it, slide your brush through your paint puddle so that it gets completely saturated. Lift the brush and slide it across the rim of your mixing tray to remove the paint drip. Otherwise, slide it across the rim several times so that the brush isn't so saturated with paint. You may want to blot after loading your brush. To do this, simply touch it to a paper towel to remove some of the excess paint. You can also blot lightly or blot well."
