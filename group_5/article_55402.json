      "content": "In a well-draining patch of soil. Red clover isn’t super picky, so the location doesn’t matter too much. Before you plant, hand pull all the weeds and make sure the soil is well-draining. You can check on the soil by looking at it after rainfall—if there are standing puddles of water, choose a different location. [3] X Research source If you’ve never planted something in the location before, tilling the soil is a good idea. Red clover will grow in most light conditions, so you don’t have to worry too much about sunlight."
