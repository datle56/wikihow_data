      "content": "Take lactase pills before you eat dairy to eliminate symptoms. Lactase pills provide your body with enough helpful enzymes to digest lactose so you don’t feel as much discomfort. Right before eating a meal that includes dairy, take one of these lactase pills so it has time to start digesting. This pill will break down the lactose so you can enjoy your meal without any pain. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Purchase lactase pills from your local pharmacy. Use lactase powder if you aren’t able to swallow pills easily. Mix a dose of the lactase powder with a drink before you eat. Be sure to take a lactase pill before you eat, as it won’t be as effective if you take it after you eat dairy. Talk to your doctor before taking lactase pills if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding since they could have adverse effects."

      "content": "Use antacids if eating dairy gives you gas or stomach cramps. Make sure the antacid you use contains simethicone, which is a chemical that helps neutralize gasses. Take the antacid right after you consume dairy products or start feeling symptoms. As the antacids start working, your stomach should feel better, and you’ll be able to burp up gas easier.

      "content": "Take probiotic supplements or eat probiotic foods to aid digestion. Probiotics are natural bacteria and enzymes that help aid your intestines with digestion. Look for a daily probiotic and take it at the same time each day for the best effects. As an alternative, eat more probiotic foods like sourdough bread, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut. As the probiotics grow in your digestive tract, you may have less severe symptoms from dairy products. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Purchase probiotics from your local pharmacy or drugstore. A food like yogurt is rich in probiotics, but it also contains lactose. Try a serving of yogurt and wait 24 hours to see if the lactose affects you. Probiotics take 2–3 weeks to build up and help more with long-term care. Help them to grow by eating lots of prebiotic foods, such as asparagus, banana, honey, and legumes, which have fibers that feed the probiotics.

      "content": "Cut back on dairy if you don’t want to eliminate it. Rather than a full serving of dairy, try having a quarter or half-portion instead so you don’t have to digest as much lactose.
