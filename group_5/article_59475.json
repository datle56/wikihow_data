    {
      "title": "A response is not needed in this context.",
      "content": "A response is not needed in this context. The person you’re texting is giving you their approval, so take it and leave it! Their 👍 is most likely a good sign and they are just agreeing with what you’re saying. [1] X Research source Say you asked a friend if they wanted to meet for lunch. Your friend may say “yes” by sending you a 👍 ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respond back with “Awesome” or don’t respond at all.",
      "content": "Respond back with “Awesome” or don’t respond at all. They’re letting you know that they got your text and all’s well! The 👍 in this context is a form of approval and recognition. [2] X Research source Let’s say you’re texting a friend about the homework that’s due tomorrow. Your friend may ask you if you have a copy of the assignment, and when you send it, they might send you the 👍 to let you know they got it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the text alone to let the conversation end on a high note.",
      "content": "Leave the text alone to let the conversation end on a high note. This use of the 👍 most likely means the text conversation is over—in a good way! The sender is thanking you for something, whether it be a picture or a thoughtful response. Either way, there’s no need to respond back as this is their way of letting you know they’re grateful. [3] X Research source Maybe a friend reaches out to ask you if you have a picture you took of them. You may say, “Sure thing!” and send the picture their way. By replying with a 👍, your friend is thanking you for sending the picture."
    },
    {
      "title": "React with a simple 😊 back.",
      "content": "React with a simple 😊 back. They’re letting you know that they approve of what you’re saying. Maybe they react to a text you sent by hitting that like or thumbs up button, or they send a separate 👍. Either way, they agree with you! [4] X Research source Perhaps you’re in a group chat and there’s a heavy debate going on about whether pancakes or waffles are superior. When you state your opinion, one of your friends might send a 👍 to let you know they stand on your side."
    },
    {
      "title": "In this case, you could send them an 🙄 in return.",
      "content": "In this case, you could send them an 🙄 in return. A thumbs up emoji can actually be passive-aggressive in certain contexts. If you’re texting someone and expecting a thoughtful reply or a detailed response and they send you a 👍 instead, they might be annoyed. [5] X Research source Let’s say you come home to a dirty apartment, even though you asked your roommate to clean up their mess. You text them asking them to please be more mindful of keeping the space clean, and all you get back from them is a 👍. In this case, they might be annoyed and sending a 👍 as a passive-aggressive way of letting you know it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Respond back with an excited “Thank you!”",
      "content": "Respond back with an excited “Thank you!” The 👍 can be used as a gesture for approval, and the sender is letting you know they approve of whatever you’re doing. You can let the conversation fade after your thanks, or keep it going if you have more to tell them. [6] X Research source Maybe you’re redecorating your living room and are sending pictures to your partner while they’re out. You just moved the couch and want to get their approval before you move to the next step. You snap a picture of its new location and send it their way. They reply with a simple 👍 to let you know they like the new placement."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send them a 😀 to share the excitement.",
      "content": "Send them a 😀 to share the excitement. A 👍 can mean a rushed nod of approval. If someone doesn’t have enough time to express how awesome something you sent them is, they may reply with a quick emoji until they can type a text. [7] X Research source Perhaps you’re an artist working on your latest sketch. You want to get your friend’s opinion but know they’re busy. By sending you a 👍 in response to a picture of your art, your friend is letting you know they think it’s epic but don’t have time to type you a long text back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip out of the text conversation in response.",
      "content": "Dip out of the text conversation in response. Two 👍s can be used as a way to tell you to go away—a passive-aggressive reply to whatever you sent. Maybe you’re in an argument with a friend or are trying to win over a sour colleague. Either way, they are upset and have sent you the emoji to tell you they just want to be alone. [8] X Research source Emoticons are all up to interpretation, which is why they are so fun to use but can also lead to misunderstandings . If you’re in a heated discussion with someone and they send you a 👍, maybe leave the text thread to avoid hostility."

      "title": "Let the sender know you appreciate them with a “Thank you!”",
      "content": "Let the sender know you appreciate them with a “Thank you!” They’re letting you know that they think you’re doing a great job, so take the encouragement and keep doing you!

      "title": "Let them know when you’ll get started with the task.",
      "content": "Let them know when you’ll get started with the task. A 👍 is a universal sign of approval, so it can be used to give you the “A-okay” to get started on a project. They are giving you the go-ahead by sending you a 👍. You can either respond with more details or not reply at all. [10] X Research source Maybe you’re texting a coworker and asking them if they are ready to move on to the next stage in a project. If they text you a 👍, it means they are ready for you to get working!"
