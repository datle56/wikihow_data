      "content": "Try a modern mullet to dip your toes into a mullet hairstyle. The “modern mullet” is kind of like a Mullet Lite—you still get the layers and choppiness of a traditional mullet, but the style is less noticeable (and can be worn professionally). When you get your haircut, ask for short layers in the front with a gradual, soft transition to the layers in the back. The result is an easy, effortless hairstyle that can be worn in multiple settings. To style your modern mullet, use a mousse or curl cream to bring out your natural hair texture."

      "content": "Add curly bangs to emphasize your mullet. Who says people with curly hair can’t have bangs?! Ask your stylist to pull some of your hair over your forehead and use scissors to point cut your bangs. That way, they’ll fall effortlessly over your forehead and complement your short mullet layers in the front. The best way to style curly bangs is to use duckbill clips while they’re wet. Wash your hair and add a gel or a mousse , then clip your bangs into place while they dry."

      "content": "Get rid of excess hair by adding an undercut to your style. If you have thick, long hair that gets heavy, ask your stylist for an undercut along with your mullet. Typically, your stylist will lift up the bottom 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair and trim them off with a razor. Then, you can cut the rest of your locks into a mullet shape. [2] X Research source To style your mullet, use a gel (for thick hair) or a mousse (for fine hair) to bring out your natural curl pattern. Your undercut will likely grow out faster than the rest of your hair. You can trim your undercut at home , or you can set up a standing appointment with your hairstylist every few weeks for a trim."
