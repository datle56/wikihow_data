      "content": "Reversed The Reversed Nine of Wands card has similar implications to its Upright counterpart; once again, it suggests that you’re going through a rough period in your life and feeling exhausted. However, the difference is that Reversed Nine of Wands is also a sign this exhaustion may stem from stubbornness and a refusal to accept the karmic lessons that the universe is trying to teach you. Tip: Reflect on the challenges life has been throwing your way recently, and look for any recurring themes that you may have dealt with before. Is there a lesson to be learned? This may be the karmic lesson that the universe wants you to recognize. When you reject a karmic lesson, the universe just keeps sending it back. So, once you figure out what kind of message the universe is sending, try to accept and learn from it. Be gentle with yourself as well. Dealing with burnout and exhaustion is a much smoother process when you take care of yourself and treat yourself compassionately!"
