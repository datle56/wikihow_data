      "content": "Download a torrent client. Torrent files are opened in a torrent client, and don't actually contain the file you want. Instead, it points you to other users who are sharing that file. The torrent client manages connections and downloads the file for you. It's always important to download a legitimate torrent client to keep your computer safe. Popular torrent clients include: [1] X Research source qBittorrent (Windows, Mac, and Linux) - qbittorrent.org Deluge (Windows, Mac, Linux) - deluge-torrent.org Transmission (Mac and Linux) - tansmissionbt.com uTorrent (Windows and Mac) - utorrent.com"

Be aware that if you're installing uTorrent, it will try to install extra software during installation. Read each screen carefully and decline any extra offers. qBittorrent, Deluge, and Transmission do not come bundled with additional adware. Ubuntu and Fedora may come with Transmission already installed. Your new torrent client will associate itself with the .torrent file type. Torrent files will open automatically when you double-click them now."

      "title": "Configure your torrent client.",
      "content": "Configure your torrent client. Before you start downloading torrents, there are a few tweaks that you'll likely want to make in your new client's Settings menu. Start your torrent client and open the Options or Preferences menu. You can usually find this in the \"Tools\" menu. Click the \"Downloads\" option and set the folder where you want finished files to be saved. Once the file is done downloading, it will be moved to this folder. Making sure where the files are being downloaded to is one of the best ways to keep yourself safe when using torrents. Click the \"Speed\" or \"Bandwidth\" option and set your rate limits. Most people will want to leave the Download limit set to \"0\", which means Unlimited. The torrent client will use as much bandwidth available to download the file. If you share your internet, or want to be able to stream video while downloading, you might want to put a limit. Set your Upload limit to 80% or less of your maximum upload speed. When your upload bandwidth is maxed out, the rest of your internet usage will suffer. Click the \"Connection\" option and confirm that the \"Use UPnP\" box is checked. This will give you the most possible connections and the highest speed."

      "title": "Know how torrent files work.",
      "content": "Know how torrent files work. Torrents are a method of sending files from one user to another over the internet. A torrent file \"points\" to a file that is being shared by other users with the same torrent file. When you load a torrent file into your torrent client, it will connect to others that are sharing the file. You can connect to many computers at once, grabbing small chunks of the final file from each. This makes torrenting one of the most efficient ways to share files, as there is no need to host the file on any central server. Each user simply connects to other users and downloads the file directly from other computers. [2] X Research source The torrent file itself does not contain any part of the actual file you will be downloading. It simply acts as a pointer.

      "content": "Visit a torrent tracking site. Torrent trackers are listing services for torrent files. They will tell you how many people are sharing the torrent file. They also provide the torrent file to load into your client. Because of their dubious legality, torrent sites change on a regular basis. Oftentimes, the site will keep the same name but change domains. It is highly recommended that you use an ad-blocking extension when visiting torrent trackers. Some of the more popular public torrent trackers include: Pirate Bay Kickass Torrents RARBG IsoHunt EZTV (TV only) YTS/YIFY (Movies only)"

      "content": "Examine the number of Seeders and Leechers. Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Leechers are users who do not yet have the complete file and are still downloading it. If there are more leechers than seeders, it may take longer to download the file. This is because there isn't enough bandwidth to go around. Most trackers will display both numbers in the search results list. Their columns may be abbreviated \"S\" and \"L\". [3] X Research source If a torrent has 0 seeders, you may not be able to download the entire file."

This is a good way to make sure that you aren't downloading a virus, and that the file is good quality. Some trackers will have a rating system as well that you can use to see if the torrent is worth your time and bandwidth. Checking the comments and details is especially important for videos. This will help you see if the encoding is good, as well as what kind of language options there are. Higher-quality videos are typically larger size than regular or low-quality videos."
