      "content": "Buy a car from a dealership. A transfer of ownership takes place whenever a car changes registered owners. [1] X Research source One of the most common ways this takes place is when you buy a car from a dealership. Before you buy the car, it is owned by the dealership or the manufacturer. Once you purchase the vehicle, title needs to be transferred into your name. When you buy a car from a dealership, they will make this transfer for you. All you need to do is show a valid driver license. [2] X Research source Therefore, if you buy a car from a dealer, getting title in your name is as easy as completing the purchase."

      "content": "Buy a car from a private seller. A lot of cars are bought from private sellers. Private sellers are people selling a car that are not associated with any dealership. For example, if you buy a car from your neighbor, you are buying from a private seller. When you buy a car from a private seller, you will pay the seller a certain sum of cash (or you will exchange property) in exchange for the vehicle. The seller will have to provide you with certain documents (e.g., bill of sale), signatures, and certifications. Each state will have different requirements.

Each state that requires these reports will handle them differently. For example, if you live in Washington, the buyer will have to get an emissions testing report if they live in certain counties. [8] X Research source In California, however, the seller is responsible for obtaining a smog certification prior to transferring ownership to you.
