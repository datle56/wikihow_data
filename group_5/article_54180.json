      "content": "If anything is blocking the camera, Face ID won't work. Obstructions can lead to random \"Move camera a little lower\" or \"Move camera a little higher\" errors, even if your face is perfectly framed. Check for poor-fitting phone cases and screen protectors, as well as dust, debris, and smudges on the lens. [1] X Research source Even if you don't see anything on the camera lens, use a dry, soft, lint-free cloth to clean the area . A microfiber eyeglass-cleaning cloth is perfect for the job."

      "content": "A few gentle smacks can fix the \"Move iPhone lower\" error. Using your hand (not another object), smack downward on the top of your iPhone a few times, then try aligning your face in the Face ID frame again. While this isn’t an official fix from Apple, it's one of the most popular fixes on user forums!"

      "content": "If your face mask is too close to your eyes, you'll be asked to move your iPhone. If you've set up the Face ID with a Mask feature, it can be a little picky with your mask's positioning. If your mask is pretty close to the bottoms of your eyes, lower it a small amount so your eyes are more visible. You shouldn't need to completely remove the mask or compromise its ability to protect you—just pull the top down away from your eyes for long enough to unlock your iPhone. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "While Face ID works with most eyeglasses, some may block infrared light.",
      "content": "While Face ID works with most eyeglasses, some may block infrared light. Because the TrueDepth camera uses infrared light to detect your face and facial position, light-reflecting glasses (especially sunglasses) may throw off the sensors, making your camera think your face is not properly aligned in the frame. Taking off your glasses can fix this error."

      "title": "Your iPhone should be at arm's length or closer.",
      "content": "Your iPhone should be at arm's length or closer. If you're seeing \"Move the camera a little lower\" when your arm is fully extended or lying on a flat surface, you may be too far from the camera. To avoid Face ID errors, your iPhone camera should be no more than 10 inches (25 cm) to 20 inches (51 cm) from your face."
