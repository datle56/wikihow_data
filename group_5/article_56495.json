      "content": "A Scorpio guy likes to observe someone he likes. He's usually pretty private, so he wants to rack up a lot of observation time before he makes his move. If you start noticing that everywhere you go, he shows up somewhere on the fringes, there's a good chance he likes you . [2] X Research source This is an especially strong sign if you know he's going out of his way to be there. For example, if you go to school together and he has class on the other end of campus, odds are good he's into you if he starts showing up outside your classroom. Are you seeing him in places you've never seen him before? He's probably there because of you. For example, if he starts showing up regularly at the local café where you work even though he doesn't drink coffee, you might be drawing him there."

      "content": "Scorpio men are known for their penetrating gaze. If he's staring at you, you'll feel it. Even if he's shy and looks away as soon as you turn in his direction, you can be sure he likes you if he always seems to be watching you. [3] X Research source The Scorpio stare is legendary in astrology circles for its intensity. If he's particularly dark and mysterious, it might even be intimidating. When you meet his gaze, you might feel as though he can see through to the depths of your soul. [4] X Research source Always be attentive to a Scorpio's body language .

      "title": "Scorpios typically only start conversations if they want to talk to you.",
      "content": "Scorpios typically only start conversations if they want to talk to you . It's just not like your typical Scorpio guy to bound up to anyone and start a conversation. This guy hates small talk and just isn't interesting in talking for the sake of talking. So if he comes up to you and starts a conversation? He probably likes you. [6] X Research source Even if the conversation itself doesn't seem that important to you, rest assured that he's paying close attention to your answer. If he's a typical Scorpio, he'll remember it and analyze it for every possible meaning later."

      "title": "Scorpios only ask questions if they're genuinely interested.",
      "content": "Scorpios only ask questions if they're genuinely interested . Does he ask you deep, probing questions? When you answer, does he follow up with even more questions? There's no doubt he's into you and wants to get to know you as much as he can. [7] X Research source Scorpios are usually pretty private, but if he really likes you, he'll respond in kind and tell you some personal things about himself as well."

      "title": "Scorpios naturally express their affection physically.",
      "content": "Scorpios naturally express their affection physically. Once you start interacting with the guy, don't be surprised if it seems like he can't keep his hands off of you. Even if he's not saying anything flirtatious , he might massage your shoulders or rest his arm on your leg. [8] X Research source If you're ever uncomfortable with anything he says or does, just let him know. Scorpions are pretty private themselves, and they're typically really good about respecting boundaries. If he's not, blame the guy (he's a jerk), not the zodiac."

      "title": "Scorpios only spend time with people they like.",
      "content": "Scorpios only spend time with people they like . Scorpios are typically introverted and would prefer to do things alone. He's not asking you just to be nice. If he wants your company, it's a pretty big deal. [9] X Research source This doesn't just mean asking you out on a date. If he asks you to do anything with him, that's a pretty good indication that he likes you. For example, if you're talking about an upcoming exam you both have and he asks if you want to study with him, he probably likes you."

      "title": "Scorpios have a reputation for enjoying dark occult things.",
      "content": "Scorpios have a reputation for enjoying dark occult things. It might sound oddly specific, but for a lot of Scorpio guys, this is actually a really big deal. When he gets to the point that he wants to share his darker side with you, he's developed a serious thing for you. [10] X Research source It's just as likely he's asking because there's a significant potential for cuddling while watching a scary movie—especially if you're easily startled. Either way, it's safe to say he's into you."

      "title": "Scorpions are normally super private, so opening up to you is a big deal.",
      "content": "Scorpions are normally super private, so opening up to you is a big deal. The typical Scorpio doesn't want to make himself vulnerable to just anybody. If he confides in you, that means he trusts you and is fairly certain you won't hurt him. [11] X Research source Pay attention to how he tells the story so you'll know the best way to respond. For example, he might be telling you a pretty funny embarrassing story—but if he's not laughing, try to hold back your own laughter (or at least express some empathy first)."

      "title": "Scorpios are known for having the strongest memories in the zodiac.",
      "content": "Scorpios are known for having the strongest memories in the zodiac. If he really likes you , he'll make a conscious effort to remember everything about you. So don't be surprised if he brings up something you said off-handedly 3 weeks ago. [12] X Research source For example, suppose you tell him you're nervous about an upcoming test in school or presentation at work. If you see him soon after and he immediately asks you how it went, that's a strong sign he likes you."

      "content": "The typical Scorpio has a competitive streak and wants to be on top. Scorpios tend to be pretty possessive (this can be a good or bad thing), so if he likes you, he wants to be #1 in your eyes. If you start talking about someone else, he'll go out of his way to prove to you that he's really your best choice. [13] X Research source For example, if he's around while you're flirting with another guy, he might bring up ways in which he's better than the other guy or knows you better. He might also become extra flirty or find ways to distract you from the other guy so that you pay attention to him instead. Since Scorpios are very emotional, they tend to get easily attached.

If people are giving you a hard time, he'll step in and put a stop to it. [15] X Research source For example, if you have a class together and you give a wrong answer that causes other classmates to laugh at you, he might point out how it was an easy mistake that anyone could've made and they're wrong to make fun of you. This also means that if you had a bad day and come to him to vent your frustrations, you can count on him to listen and help you make things right or offer words of encouragement if that's what you need."
