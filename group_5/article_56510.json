      "content": "L+ratio is a reply used to call out someone who made an unpopular post. The “l” stands for loss , while “ratio” refers to a reply that gets more likes and traffic than the original post. People tend to drop “l+ratio” comments in response to people who have made very controversial or otherwise unpopular posts (or posts that will soon become unpopular or controversial once they get more traffic). Users often add other silly comments to the end of the phrase using the “+” sign, like “unfollowed” or “you fell off” (you aren’t as successful as you were before). Person A: “Pineapple belongs on pizza” Person B: “L+ratio+unfollowed+unsubscribed” The term ratio can also refer to a post with more replies than likes or reposts (which typically indicates that a post is unpopular). A post can be considered “ratioed” if the scale of comments to likes goes beyond 1:1. The more comments (or likes on a comment) there are compared to likes/reposts of the original post, the larger the ratio is."

      "content": "Use “l+ratio” to respond to an unpopular or controversial post. Maybe someone posted an opinion that was borderline offensive, or someone posted a “hot” take that not many people agree with—a snarky “l+ratio” comment can be a great way to put them in their place. Person A: “To be honest, I kind of like wearing wet socks” Person B: “L+ratio+unfollowed+blocked+get help” Person A: “Why does everyone think [insert celebrity] is hot? I don’t see it” Person B: “L+ratio+don’t care+didn’t ask+cope+cry about it+stay mad+get a life+touch grass” Some people include the word “bozo” in their “l + ratio” comment to pack an extra punch (e.g., “l + bozo + ratio)."

      "content": "The “l+ratio” trend began in the early 2020s. While the individual terms “L” and “ratio” have existed since the 2010s, it wasn’t until the early 2020s that users started combining the terms into a clever insult. The term has deep ties to meme culture, and plenty of netizens have used “l+ratio”-style replies to caption pics and gifs. Although it first gained popularity on Reddit, the term has since spread to other social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter/X. [1] X Research source Some celebrities have even used the term, like rapper Lil Nas X, who once tweeted “Met gala was great last night until Frank Ocean came over to me and said ‘L + Ratio’ + youngboy better.’ Nonetheless a good night.” [2] X Research source (YoungBoy is another popular rapper.)"
