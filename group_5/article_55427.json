Allow 1 foot (about 30.5 cm) on each side. It will shrink with extensive hammering, and you'll need the excess on the ends for hammering in nails."

      "content": "Select a copper sheet that is as thin as possible but still works for your job. The thinner the copper sheeting, the easier it will accept the indentations of your hammer. For ease of hammering, choose a 24-gauge thickness for your copper sheeting. This can also be called 16 oz. or .021 inches (about .05 cm)."

You want the copper sheeting to be as flat and flush against the plywood as possible. This will give you the most control over your ability to hammer and indent the copper sheeting."
