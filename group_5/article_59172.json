Grab the broken end of the key with the tweezers and pull it straight out. [1] X Research source Alternatively, try the same method with a pair of scissors."

      "content": "Use a sewing, safety, or bobby pin to pry the key out. Spray the keyhole with lubricant. Insert a pin into a space between the key and the keyhole. Try to get the tip of the pin into a groove or notch in the key and pry the key out of the hole. [2] X Research source If you can’t get enough leverage, use a pair of pliers to bend the tip of your pin and use the tip to grab the side of the key. [3] X Research source Once the key is partially out of the lock, use a pair of tweezers or pliers to grab the end and pull it all the way out. Alternatively, use a paper clip or a sewing needle. You can also a fish hook. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Insert a screw in the keyhole, turn it slightly, then pull the key out. Apply a lubricant or graphite powder to the inside of the keyhole. Grab a thin screw and place the pointed end in a space between the key and the edge of the keyhole. Screw it in a little bit until the threads catch on the key, then pull the key out. [5] X Research source If the broken end is sticking out, use the tip of the screw to pry the key out of the hole."

      "title": "Use 2 kitchen or utility knifes to pry the key out of the hole.",
      "content": "Use 2 kitchen or utility knifes to pry the key out of the hole. Spray the keyhole with a lubricant or graphite powder. Slot a kitchen or utility knife between the key and the edge of the keyhole. Slot the other knife in the space on the other side of the key. Gently rotate both knives to pull the broken key out of the keyhole. [6] X Research source Make sure to wear work gloves and work slowly so the knives don’t slip. Once the key is poking out of the lock, use a pair of tweezers or pliers to pull it all the way out."

      "title": "Push a melted hot glue stick against the key and pull it out.",
      "content": "Push a melted hot glue stick against the key and pull it out. Use a lighter to melt the end of the hot glue stick . Once the tip is melted, press it gently onto the end of the broken key. Wait for 1 to 2 minutes so the glue dries, then slowly pull the stick straight back. The key should come out with it. [7] X Research source Alternatively, apply super glue to the end of the key head, clean the edges with a paper towel, then hold the key back together. Let it dry completely, then pull the key out. [8] X Research source Try to avoid getting glue inside the lock mechanism. If you do get glue inside, you may need to call a locksmith."

Use needle nose pliers to grab the broken end of the key that’s sticking out. Pull the key straight out. [9] X Research source If the key is really far into the lock, Master locksmith Shawn Fago says to use “really thin needle nose pliers, almost like scissors or surgical tools, to grab onto the key and pull it out.”"

Slide the broken side of the blade into the space between the lock and the key, twist it slightly, and pull the key and the blade out. [10] X Research source Jigsaw blades are made of a brittle metal, which makes them easy to break with a pair of pliers. Cover one end of the blade with duct tape so you have a safe handle to grab onto. Alternatively, try using a barbeque skewer or a bicycle spoke. If the key comes partially out, just grip the end with needle-nose pliers and finish removing the key the rest of the way."

      "title": "Drill into the side of the key and pry it out of the lock.",
      "content": "Drill into the side of the key and pry it out of the lock. This method works best if the key is visible. Insert a drill with bit that’s about the width of the key in the exposed side of the key. Drill a small hole into the key. Insert the bit, a paperclip, or another small long object into the hole and pry the key out. [11] X Research source Make sure not to drill into the lock."

      "title": "Use a strong magnet to grab onto the end of the broken key.",
      "content": "Use a strong magnet to grab onto the end of the broken key. Most modern keys are made of brass, aluminum, or nickel silver. [12] X Research source If your key is made of aluminum, you can use a very strong magnet to pull it out. Just spray the keyhole with a lubricant like WD-40, place the magnet onto the end of the broken key, and pull it straight out. Brass isn’t magnetic. [13] X Research source Nickel is magnetic, but silver isn’t. [14] X Research source Depending on the composition of your key, a magnet might not attract to it. If your key doesn’t pull out with a magnet, try a different method to remove it."

      "content": "Slide a key extractor tool into the lock, turn it, and pull the key out. Spray a silicone lubricant or graphite powder into the keyhole. Master locksmith Shawn Fago says to insert the small hook tool (with the hook facing upward) as far as possible into the lock along one of the grooves on the side of the key. Then, “pull straight out and the key should come out.” If the hook tool doesn’t work, try the spiral style tool. Instead of twisting the tool toward the key, spin the tool’s handle several times before pulling it straight out. If the keyhole is in between the locked and unlocked positions, use needle nose pliers to reach inside the hole and turn it into either position."

[15] X Research source Insert a screwdriver into the center hole in the latch assembly. Push towards the door latch, wiggling back and forth until the door pops open. [16] X Research source If your door handle doesn’t have any visible screws, you may have to twist the plate underneath it to expose the screws. [17] X Research source If the key is stuck in your car , motorcycle, or a padlock and won’t come out with the other methods, it might be best to call a professional to help instead."
