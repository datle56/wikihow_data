      "title": "Try a louver system if you have an overhanging roof.",
      "content": "Try a louver system if you have an overhanging roof. These metal sheets have divots in them that collect water and direct it away from your home. Attach these directly to the siding of your house just underneath your roof, then watch as the rain droplets get pushed out and away from your foundation. [1] X Research source These systems are nice because they can’t clog up with leaves or debris like classic gutters do. They’re also unique to the shape of your home, so you can make them fit any way you’d like. However, they can make puddles around your house if you aren’t careful."

      "title": "Use drip edges if your home is still in the construction phase.",
      "content": "Use drip edges if your home is still in the construction phase. These flat sheets of metal sit under your shingles to fling rain water out and away from your house. Slide these long pieces of metal under the first row of shingles on your home, then attach them with nails and roofing cement. [2] X Research source The materials for a drip edge are usually pretty cheap, but the cost of labor can vary greatly. Drip edges can be a little tough to install if your house is already fully built. However, you can hire a professional to do it for you. You can use drip edges in addition to gutters if you already have them, or you can use them as a replacement. Drip edges also help seal any gaps in your roof so small animals can’t get cozy in your attic."

      "title": "Divert your water with a rain chain if you have a grassy area nearby.",
      "content": "Divert your water with a rain chain if you have a grassy area nearby. Rain chains can be made of copper or aluminum, and they’re usually long, chain-like structures as tall as your home. Hook a metal rain chain onto the side of your home where the water collects the most. As it rains, the water will run down the chain and into the grassy or planted area at the end of the chain. [3] X Research source Rain chains usually cost about $40 to $50 depending on which metal you choose. [4] X Research source If you have a large roof, you may need more than one rain chain. If you get a lot of freezing weather, stay away from rain chains. The heavy ice can do damage to your gutters."

      "title": "French drains are perfect if your home sits in a dip or a valley.",
      "content": "French drains are perfect if your home sits in a dip or a valley. These long stone pathways will carry the water out and away from your home’s foundation. Dig a trench on a slope away from your home, then line it with drainage fabric, fill it with stone, and lay a perforated pipe. [5] X Research source The price of a French drain varies, but it usually costs between $2,000 and $3,000 for a full installation. You may need a professional to help with installation. French drains must be installed properly—they are very unlikely to get blocked then. Otherwise, they won’t work. You can disguise French drains with gravel and plants so they add to your yard instead of taking away from it."

      "title": "This system works best if you have an overhang around your whole house.",
      "content": "This system works best if you have an overhang around your whole house. Spend an afternoon figuring out where the water naturally runs off your roof and onto the ground. Dig a trench around all 4 sides of your home that’s 18 inches (46 cm) wide and 8 inches (20 cm) deep, then fill it with non-woven geotextile fabric and crushed stone for an attractive way to collect water. [6] X Research source The costs for a drip path vary greatly depending on the size of your home and your chosen materials. The stones and fabric will collect the water so that it doesn’t damage your foundation. However, the path must be installed correctly to ensure it absorbs enough water. Otherwise, you could do damage to your home. You can also add small plants or shrubs to the path to make it look more attractive."

      "title": "Try grading if you have a large plot of land to work with.",
      "content": "Try grading if you have a large plot of land to work with. Use a rototiller to make sure that the land around your home drops 1 in (2.5 cm) for every 1 ft (0.30 m) around your house. This will carry the water away from your home and foundation. [7] X Research source The price of grading depends on your contractor and the size of your yard. Typically, you should expect to spend around $2,500. [8] X Research source Grading is hard to do on your own, and you may need a professional to ensure that it’s done properly. Grading can tear up a lot of your landscape, so don’t go for this option if you’re attached to your yard."

      "title": "Channel drains work best on flat surfaces, like driveways, walkways, or concrete paths.",
      "content": "Channel drains work best on flat surfaces, like driveways, walkways, or concrete paths. These metal grates sit in the divots near your home to collect water as it runs off your property. Situate the drain at a diagonal, then pour concrete around it to keep it in place. Attach a pipe under the ground to carry the standing water away from your home. [9] X Research source Channel drain materials are pretty cheap (usually around $300), but the installation costs can vary. You can attach a channel drain to a French drain to carry the water away easily. Channel drains may need a professional installation if you aren’t comfortable installing pipes underground on your own."

      "title": "If you don’t have overhangs on your roof, built-in gutters are an option.",
      "content": "If you don’t have overhangs on your roof, built-in gutters are an option. These gutters sit flush with your roof and don’t have openings for leaf litter or debris to get in. Attach the gutters to your roof and make sure they’re flush with the surface of your home. [10] X Research source The materials for built-in gutters usually cost around $50 per square foot. [11] X Research source Always get an experienced roofer to install built-in gutters. They take a little more installation than normal gutters do, so they need an expert. Built-in gutters can also be tough to maintain. If you decide to go this route, prepare to spend extra money on them throughout the years."

      "content": "Use this garden in conjunction with another gutter replacement. Pick a spot in your yard that’s on a downward slope or at the bottom of a hill. Fill the area with wetland plants that will soak up water as your rain runoff rolls down the hill. [12] X Research source Typical rain gardens are connected to a downspout, but you can divert a drip path, a rain chain, or a french drain to them instead. The price of a rain garden depends on how large of an area you’re working with and how many plants you purchase. It’s super important that your rain garden is on a downward slope so that the water doesn't run back into your foundation. The plants you need depend on the area that you live in. In general, swamp and wetland plants do well in rain gardens, while desert plants do not."
