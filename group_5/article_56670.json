      "content": "Yes, wearing socks with loafers is not only acceptable but stylish. While the sockless look has been extremely popular for a while, wearing socks with your loafers is also fashionable. Additionally, many feel it’s more appropriate to wear socks with loafers for more formal occasions, like weddings and funerals. [1] X Research source Besides being stylish, socks help keep your feet warm and dry in cold or wet weather. Going sockless is usually a seasonal question, so most people wear socks in colder months, no matter what shoes they wear."

      "content": "Wear socks with your loafers to keep your feet dry. Feet have more than 250,000 sweat glands. [4] X Research source Not wearing socks can make your feet sweaty and damp, a perfect environment for fungus and bacteria to thrive. Keep your feet dry by wearing socks made of natural fibers that help wick that sweat away from your skin. [5] X Research source Wearing socks also helps prevent smelly feet and shoes by limiting bacterial growth. [6] X Research source If you don’t wear some kind of socks, your shoes absorb the sweat from your feet, making it more likely that bacteria will grow and cause an odor that’s often difficult to get out. One way to freshen up shoes is to allow them to dry completely in front of a fan or in the sun."

      "content": "Wear thin dress socks with loafers for dressy and casual outfits. Loafers straddle the line between dressy and casual, so they work with many types of outfits. Thinner dress socks and trouser socks are the most appropriate options to wear with formalwear or even a nice pair of slacks. [7] X Research source Women also wear loafers with casual skirts and dresses but usually don’t wear them with more formal outfits unless wearing a menswear-styled look."

      "content": "Wear no-show socks for a more casual sockless look. For more casual outfits, go with no-show socks instead of foregoing socks. No-show socks are best for casual outfits with shorts, jeans, or khakis. [8] X Research source No-show socks are usually acceptable when wearing casual fabrics like linen and cotton. [9] X Research source Taller socks are also acceptable for casual styles, but always wear socks with dressier outfits."

      "content": "Avoid bulky wool or athletic socks when wearing loafers. Loafers tend to fit more like a dress shoe than a casual shoe. Bulky socks bunch out of the shoe or make it feel tight and uncomfortable. Save athletic socks for the gym and thick wool for cozy boots."

      "content": "Wear neutral socks with more ornate loafers. Basic black, beige, or grey socks allow two-tone, crocodile, or boldly colored loafers to be the star of the show. When choosing a neutral color, it’s usually best to match your socks to your trousers. This doesn’t mean they have to match exactly, though—coordinating and contrasting colors also work well.

If you’re wearing less flashy (but still cool!) loafers, a boldly colored or patterned sock adds a little pizzazz to your outfit…even when you’re wearing a suit. In fact, wearing colorful socks is a long-standing tradition in menswear that looks great with vintage and modern styles for both men and women. [11] X Research source Wear colorful socks in unusual solid colors like yellow, two-color stripes, or patterns like argyle. Avoid wearing loafers and white socks with dressier outfits.

      "content": "Wear tall socks for menswear styles. While slouchy socks are acceptable for feminine styles, it’s more fashionable to pull socks up for men’s styles. In fact, the best men’s dress socks are designed to hit above the calf so they stay up all day. [13] X Research source This is even true when you're wearing rolled pants or pants that hit at the ankles. There are several different sock lengths, including ankle, quarter crew, crew, mid-calf, knee-high, and thigh-high socks. Women often wear shorts or a casual skirt with loafers with or without tights and slightly slouchy crew socks. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Pair dressy loafers with dressy or casual outfits. Dressier leather loafers look good with both casual and dressy outfits. Choose black leather loafers for dressier suits. Loafers made of suede or canvas are more casual and look good with casual styles like shorts, jeans, or khakis. [15] X Research source Tassel Loafers: Tassel loafers are the most casual loafer style and have two tassels that hang from the top of the shoe. They look great with jeans or chinos. Belgian Loafers: Belgian loafers are slightly more formal than the tassel loafers. The main difference between the two styles is that Belgian loafers have a small bow on the top of the shoe instead of tassels. Wear them with chinos, corduroy, and flannel pants. Penny Loafers: This style is the most versatile loafer since it goes with a wide range of outfits, from casual suits to jeans. The penny loafer gets its name from the slit on the top of the shoe where the wearer can place a penny. More casual penny loafers made of canvas are perfect with shorts. Gucci or Horsebit Loafers: The most formal loafers, this style features a metal bar on the top of the shoe that’s meant to look like a horse’s bit. While not formal enough for a black or white tie event, black horsebit loafers go perfectly with any business suit."

      "content": "Wear loafers during all four seasons. Loafers are most commonly thought of as summer shoes. But because loafers are so versatile, they go well with both summer and winter outfits. Suede loafers go well with cosy sweaters and corduroy pants. [16] X Research source Loafers with thicker rubber soles are good for cold weather because they offer extra protection from the elements."
