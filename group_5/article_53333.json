      "content": "Sell an old bulky TV online locally for good money. If you’ve got an old cathode-ray TV (aka a CRT TV) with a big, heavy backside, it’s worth good money if it works. Newer TVs don’t have the input ports (or proper image quality) for retro gaming systems, so old school gaming enthusiasts will buy your ancient TV in heartbeat. List the item on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace and the offers will roll in. [7] X Research source If your TV is in good condition and you have the remote, you can easily get $200-300 for it. There are actually a ton of used flat screen TVs on the market and TVs are one of the few products out there that get cheaper every year, so flat screens don’t tend to resale for very much.

A lot of big retailers, including Amazon, BestBuy, and Target, will buy back TVs and other electronics if you’re buying a new one.

Especially if your TV is older, set the price low. Remember, the goal is to get rid of it."
