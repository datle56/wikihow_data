      "content": "Use a rod with finials if your tapestry has a rod pocket. Most modern tapestries will come with a rod pocket along the top edge. In this case you can use a rod, which will look a bit like a curtain rod. This is a simple and straightforward method for hanging tapestries. [1] X Research source Brackets can be added to the wall from which to hang the rod. Keep in mind that this method will result in your tapestry hanging away from the wall, with the distance depending on your particular brackets. If you want you tapestry to hang flush with the wall, try another method. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Obtain a rod, finials and wall brackets.",
      "content": "Obtain a rod, finials and wall brackets. Choose a rod with decorative finials that will fit in with the room’s existing decor. Although there are rods made specifically for tapestries, you can also use normal curtain rods. However, you must make sure the rod fits inside the pocket of the tapestry. The necessary rod diameter depends upon the weight of the tapestry and the length depends on the width of the tapestry. A 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch diameter rod will hold an average or large size tapestry anywhere from 2 to 10 lbs. The rod should be long enough so that the rod finials extend beyond the edges of the tapestry with the brackets meeting the edges of the tapestry. This will allow the tapestry to slightly shadow the brackets giving more focus to the finials than the brackets. The wall brackets should stick out from the wall a little so that the tapestry will hang at least ½ inch (1 cm) away from the wall. This will prevent moisture build-up."

However, you can hang the tapestry however you wish so it fits in with the rest of your room. You may have to hang the tapestry a bit higher if hanging over a sofa or if you have very high walls."

      "title": "Iron the tapestry if needed.",
      "content": "Iron the tapestry if needed. Prior to hanging your tapestry, ironing may be needed to remove creases. Use a low to medium iron to test first and iron on the back of the tapestry. If creases do not come out by ironing the back, then use a dye-free bed sheet and place over the front of the tapestry to iron. You may need to increase the temperature of the iron and use some steam to remove the creases but always test in a corner of the tapestry first."

[3] X Expert Source Gino Colucci Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 14 January 2021. Drill holes spaced so that the brackets sit just outside the width of the tapestry. Use a level to make sure these holes are even so that your tapestry does not end up crooked. Tapestries do not always need to be hung on wall studs. In most cases you can simply use drywall screws and hang the tapestry wherever you like. If you do not have a level you can also measure from the ceiling down to where you would like to hang the tapestry. Make sure that the distance from the ceiling to the hole is the same on both sides."

Catch at least two warp threads (the underlying straight threads) with each stitch so that it is strong enough to support the tapestry. Use thread that is the same color as a dominant color of your tapestry so that it won’t be noticeable. Make sure you sew the strip so that it sticks up along the middle. This will make room for the rod so that your tapestry lies straight when the rod is inserted. Be very careful that your strip is straight, even if your tapestry does not have a straight edge. If your strip is not sewn straight, the tapestry will hang crooked as well."

The width of the Velcro will depend on the width and weight of the tapestry you are using. Velcro comes in widths between ½ inch (1.25 cm) and 4 inches (10 cm). The longer and heavier your tapestry is, the wider Velcro you should use to support it."

Make sure you sew over at least two warp threads with each stitch so that it is strong enough for hanging. Make sure the thread is the same color as one of the dominant colors in your tapestry so that it blends in. You can also machine stitch the Velcro to a canvas strip first and then hand stitch the strip to the tapestry in the same way.

You can make a wooden frame using four thin pieces of wood cut to the desired lengths and widths and gluing or screwing them together. Use corner brackets to increase the stability of the frame. You can also use a piece of painted plywood as your backing. Simply cut the piece to the size you desire for your background. The frame should be at least one inch (2.5 cm) wider on each side than your tapestry but you can use any border size you think looks appropriate. You can also use foam core for your background instead of plywood or a wooden frame. Foam core is particularly easy to stitch through and thus makes an ideal base, but it is not suitable for heavy tapestries. Rather use a foam core only for smaller sized tapestries."

Ensure that the piece of material is at least 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) long on each side so that you can fold it over the edges easily. Use wood staples to staple the material onto the frame. If you want to use a lightweight material such as silk as your border then you should stretch it over a sturdy canvas or other material. This way the canvas underneath will provide support but you can also create the look you desire. You can also use a middle layer of soft cotton flannel in between."

Make sure the stitches cross at least two warp stitches each time. Pick a color thread that matches the dominant color on the tapestry so that you cannot see the stitches from the front. Sew along the edges as well as in other areas to fully support the weight of the tapestry. You can also combine the frame and Velcro methods by stitching Velcro to the frame and tapestry instead.

Make sure the stitches are straight even if the tapestry end is not perfectly straight or else you will end of with a crooked tapestry.
