      "content": "A simple “just checking in!” text can improve an isolated sick person’s morale. Whether it’s a cold or something severe, knowing that others care about how you're doing is extremely comforting (especially if they’re cooped up all alone). Ask the sick person how they’re doing or tell them you’re thinking of them to give them a little boost. “Hey there! I’m thinking about you and hope you’re feeling better!” “Get well soon! Keeping you in my thoughts 💭” “How are you feeling today? I hope you get well soon!”"

      "content": "This classic message works great for someone with a light illness. Send this when someone has a cold, allergies, or just a little sniffle to encourage them to take care of themselves. Try personalizing it with humor or inside jokes you share with the person—it makes your message seem more sincere and meaningful. “I’m gonna need you to recover ASAP so we can have another beach day soon!” “Feel better soon! That’s an order, not a suggestion 😉” “Get well soon! (Seriously, I’m dreading working a double shift without you!)”"

      "content": "A helping hand means a lot when someone's illness interrupts their day-to-day life. Offer to do them a favor, bring them a meal, or just ask if there’s anything you can do so they can rest up. This is a nice text to send whether the person has a cold or something more serious and long-term. [1] X Research source “Don’t worry about shoveling this week, me and my snowblower have you covered!” “I’m at the grocery store now, is there anything I can grab for you?” “Let me know if there’s anything I can do for you while you recover!”"

      "title": "Let them know you’re looking forward to seeing them back on their feet.",
      "content": "Let them know you’re looking forward to seeing them back on their feet. Personalize your text to fit your relationship—maybe you usually see the sick person at school, work, or a social club. This works great for friends and family as well as acquaintances you might not know as well. “Looking forward to passing you notes during math class again soon!” “Can’t wait to bump into you in the break room again! ☕” “I need you back at the dog park to help me supervise my fur baby asap!”"

It can relax your muscles, boost your immune system, and release endorphins. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Jokes are great for friends or family with a mild illness, but something more sincere is better for acquaintances or the severely sick. “I see karma finally got you for teasing me last week! 😝” “I guess your dance moves aren’t the only thing that’s sick anymore.” “Wow, you didn’t have to catch a cold just to get out of lunch with me! Lol”"

      "title": "Make a lighthearted comment about all the free time they have now.",
      "content": "Make a lighthearted comment about all the free time they have now. This works best for people who just have a light cold, especially if they’re normally super busy. Keep it humorous since a sick person probably doesn’t view their time off as real “down time.” Try: “You better be caught up on Succession when you get back to work! 📺” “I bet you’ll feel so refreshed after all these naps 💤” “Ugh you get to take part in my favorite hobby: laying down!”"

      "content": "Sick people often feel pressured to return to work or social activities ASAP. Let them know it’s OK to take as much time as they need to recover before resuming their day-to-day activities. They’ll feel healthier for it, and avoid getting others sick too! Send them things like: “Take as much time as you need to feel better, we’ll cover your meetings.” “No rush on getting those assignments in. Focus on your health!” “No pressure to make it to David’s party this weekend. Rest up!”"

      "content": "Let the sick person know their presence is missed. This is a nice thing to say whether they’re a coworker, friend, classmate, or just an acquaintance you’re used to seeing around. Get specific and personalize it to fit your relationship—a little humor here goes a long way. “I can’t make it through another professional development session without you to make faces at!” “Geometry class is not the same without you. I’m actually learning something! 😵” “Jen’s party last night was fun. Would’ve been better if you were there though!”"

      "content": "A phone or video call is perfect for an isolated sick person. Text them to see if they’re free or have the energy for a phone call or video chat (depending on their energy level and comfort, they may or may not be up for it). You can even plan workshops, classes, or self-care activities all from the comfort of their own home.

      "content": "Sometimes, a sympathetic text is the most comforting thing to send. This is especially true when you’re not sure what to say or the person’s illness is more severe than a cold or the flu. Tell them you’re sorry they feel bad and let them know you’re thinking about them. “I just heard about your diagnosis. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.” “I’m sorry you’re so sick! Sending good vibes your way 🌟” “I’m so sorry you’re still feeling ill. I’m thinking of you!”"

      "title": "When someone has a serious illness, praise for their resilience means a lot.",
      "content": "When someone has a serious illness, praise for their resilience means a lot. It’s easy to feel defeated or hopeless when you’re very sick, and rustling up a positive attitude seems almost impossible. Let them know you see and admire their strength—your encouragement goes a long way! “Your optimism throughout this whole thing has been so admirable!” “You’re handling this so well. I would be such a wreck if it were me.” “You’ve been so brave ever since your diagnosis. I really look up to you.” While this is an encouraging thing to say, it might also put pressure on the sick person to act strong. Let them know it’s OK to have bad days too!"

      "content": "Sick people have a wide range of emotional reactions to their illness. They might feel frustrated, depressed , angry , or pessimistic.

      "content": "If you or the sick person is religious, a spiritual text can be comforting. Let them know you’re praying for their recovery or reassure them that God is watching out for them. This is more common for mild or serious illnesses, but use your judgment and faith to decide if it’s appropriate to send. “God is looking after you!” “I’m keeping you in my prayers 🙏” “Keep the faith and trust that God will guide you through this.”"

      "content": "When someone is seriously ill, tell them how much they mean to you. In situations like these, be straightforward and speak from the heart. Tell the sick person how they’ve inspired you, taught you something, or impacted your life. Keep your tone positive to lift their spirits. [5] X Research source “You’re the best friend I’ve ever had. You’ve helped me in more ways than I can count and I love you so much.” “I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I didn’t have you to look up to. You’re so strong, smart, and kind. I’m with you no matter what ❤️” “I’m not sure what to say, but I want you to know you’re such an important part of my life. I’ll never forget how you helped me through my lowest lows. I’m keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.”"
