If you’re working a single crochet stitch, skip the yarn over. If you’re working a triple crochet stitch, loop the yarn over the hook twice before you work the stitch. [1] X Research source"

Then, work the stitch as you normally would. Yarn over the hook and pull through 2 loops, then yarn over again and pull through 2 again. Repeat as many times as needed to complete the stitch. For example, if you are working a double crochet increase, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull through 2. Then, yarn over again, and pull through 2 again. To finish the increase stitch, yarn over 1 more time and pull through 2 one last time. [2] X Research source For a single crochet increase, yarn over the hook and pull through 2. Then, yarn over the hook and pull through 2 one more time to complete the stitch."

After you finish 1 increase, you may work another into the same space or work additional increases in other spaces in the same way. Repeat the same process to do this.

[3] X Research source However, some stitches require yarning over before you insert the hook into the stitch space. Begin the increase stitch as you normally would. [4] X Research source For example, loop the yarn over the hook 1 time for a half-double or double crochet stitch or 2 times for a triple crochet stitch."

Insert your hook into this space to work a stitch into it and create a 1 stitch increase at the beginning of the row. Work the stitch as you normally would. For example, if you’re adding a single crochet stitch to the row, insert the hook into the stitch, and then loop the yarn over the hook, and pull through 1 stitch. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 to complete the stitch. [5] X Research source To do a half-double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook before you insert it, then insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over again and pull through 1.

This is the same whether you’re working a single, double, half-double, or triple crochet stitch. Then, pull through 1 to pull up a loop. The number of loops on your hook at this point will depend on the type of increase stitch you’re working.
