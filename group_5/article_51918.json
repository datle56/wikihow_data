      "content": "When the user uses too much detergent, the suds will leak through the overflow tube. After overflow you may see what looks like plain water on your floor; suds will usually disappear after a few minutes. On front loaders in particular, use High Efficiency detergent to reduce sudsing."

      "content": "Sometimes you will find that the pressure switch hose has come off the air dome. When this happens, the washer won't stop filling and this will cause a leak. [5] X Research source Check operation of pressure switch. This switch tells the system that there is water in the tub and allows it to proceed to agitate. The switch itself is behind control panel but you can lightly blow into the hose leading up to it. Remove hose from side of tub and see if you can get the switch to flip by softly blowing into the hose. If power is on and timer is set to fill, it might begin to agitate at this point, so keep your hands away from the motor and pulley assembly. If it does try to agitate the switch is functional. It is best to check this while unplugged, then reassemble and try the unit. Check the hose for blockage, especially where hose connects to tank, lint from clothes can clog this causing overfilling."
