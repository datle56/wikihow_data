      "content": "Find out what frequency you want. For Wi-Fi you are using 2.45GHz = 2,450,000,000Hz). This is needed because this determines the length of your antenna."

      "title": "Choose a good conductor.",
      "content": "Choose a good conductor. For the example we can use a copper wire and a piece of copper plating. Also you will need a co-axial cable (75 ohm is better than 50 ohm, for Wi-Fi 50 ohm is better than 75 ohm)."

      "title": "Work out the length you need the wire to be.",
      "content": "Work out the length you need the wire to be. This is done by using the frequency value from step 1 to find the wavelength of the signal. To do this you simply need to divide the speed of light (c = 299 792 458 m/s) by the frequency (f). In the case of 2.45GHz the wavelength is 12.236 centimeter (4.8 in). Usually monopole antennas are quarter-wavelength structures, so the length of the wire should be 12.236/4 = 3.0509cm"

      "content": "Cut the wire a little bigger than you need, about 6.5 centimeter (2.6 in) or so for a half-wave dipole antenna. Cut about 3.2 centimeter (1.3 in) for a quarter-wave monopole. This way you can pare it back based on performance (and \"tune\" if needed) ."

      "content": "This is basically used to form a theoretical mirror image of the antenna. Simply use the copper plate that you picked up earlier. It should be at least half a wavelength square."
