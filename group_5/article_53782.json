      "content": "Use shears or a knife to cut the best pampas stems from your garden. Leave a few inches left to grow new pampas grass later in the season. The stems are hardy, thick, and sharp, so make sure to wear long sleeves and protective gloves . Use sharp, sturdy tools to cut through the stems easily. [1] X Research source Choose tall stems with full plumes for styling flexibility. The amount you cut depends on how many you need for your decor (3-5 plumes fills a vase nicely). Cut stems in late August or September when the pampas is in its first full bloom. Do it on a dry afternoon after the morning dew has dried. [2] X Research source Make sure there’s no wildlife, like rodents or snakes, sheltering in your pampas patch before you start cutting. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use sharp shears to cut the stems down and remove extra foliage. First, give your fresh cut stems a good shake to get rid of loose plumage. [4] X Research source Then snip your stems to whichever lengths you need for your decor—consider longer stalks for floor vases and shorter ones for centerpieces or wreaths. [5] X Research source After trimming, cut off any extra leaves or growths on the stem so it’s smooth. This will give your dried pampas a sleek look once it’s dried. Trim stems that are going into the same vase to slightly different lengths to add dimension and styling flexibility. Keep your gardening gloves on while you trim and prune. Those stems are sharp!"

      "content": "Use string, wire, or a rubber band to tie your pampas stems together. Any material you have on hand will work. Make multiple “bouquets” or bundles of about 3 or 4 stems each, depending on how many stems you’re drying. [6] X Research source Some people leave their stems separate for better air circulation while they dry. Either method works, but hanging individual stems takes up more space."

      "title": "Hang your bundles from hangers, hooks, or branches to dry them.",
      "content": "Hang your bundles from hangers, hooks, or branches to dry them . Use string, wire, dental floss, or any material you have to hang up your bundles. Choose a space like a shed, garage, basement, or closet that’s warm, dry, and has good air circulation. [7] X Research source Keep the pampas bundles upside down to preserve their shape and color for longer."

      "title": "Remove loose leaves and fluff up the plumage with your fingers.",
      "content": "Remove loose leaves and fluff up the plumage with your fingers. Style and shape the plumes however you like, being careful not to rustle the plant too hard and cause more plumage to fall off. Make sure to do this before spraying the pampas (it’ll be harder to shape afterward). [8] X Research source Make small adjustments if you want a vertical, thin looking plume. Fluff more and bend the stalk if you want a more natural droop."

      "title": "Spray the plumes all over to preserve them and prevent shedding.",
      "content": "Spray the plumes all over to preserve them and prevent shedding. Any inexpensive hair spray will work—spray thoroughly to eliminate shedding and keep the shape of your plumes full. This is extra important if you plan on placing pampas in a high-traffic area, like hallways or on doors. Alternatively, apply plant sealant spray in place of hair spray. Dried and sprayed pampas rarely sheds when it’s undisturbed. Shedding happens when the stems are moved or there’s a breeze from doors closing, fans, or foot traffic."

      "title": "Showcase your pampas in vases or wreaths anywhere in your home.",
      "content": "Showcase your pampas in vases or wreaths anywhere in your home. Stick to one color of pampas per vase and include 3 to 5 stems. If you like, accent the vase with something simple like a burlap ribbon (pampas grass is bold on its own and doesn’t need much decorating). [9] X Research source Place pampas vases against warm, muted walls for a beautiful, rustic look. If your plumes need more volume, tape several together by the stems and style them like they’re one big piece. [10] X Research source Keep dried pampas decor away from direct sunlight, humidity, and pets to extend its life."
