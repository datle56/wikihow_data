      "content": "Take some thought on raising quail. Quail are small and fairly easy birds to look after but do need time for feeding, refilling water containers, cleaning the cage, checking up daily, and collecting eggs. You may also encounter many problems while raising quail for the first time."

      "content": "Find a space in your yard or on your balcony where you can hang a quail cage. Clear the space underneath in which to place straw. This will help you to collect and remove waste. [1] X Research source You can also decide whether to house your quail in a different sort of housing like a rabbit hutch or something alike. However, the cage above is set up in a way to prevent diseases since quail waste is high in ammonia."

      "content": "Purchase a long, narrow cage and hang it from an overhang on your house, garage or balcony. Choose somewhere that has access to light, but is blocked from strong winds. Most quail cages are built of open mesh wire, since the birds need shelter, but plenty of air. They should be housed away from predators including pets and the room shouldn't have any disturbances."

      "title": "Hang some lights around the cage.",
      "content": "Hang some lights around the cage. This will allow you to increase egg production in the fall and winter months. The birds need 15 hours of light per day to produce eggs but any more and they will get stressed from lack of sleep. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide if you want to buy mating birds or hatching eggs. A mature bird can cost around $5, while you can get 50 eggs for about $20. Along with the eggs you'll have to prepare to spend a lot of time caring for a bunch of chicks and you will also have to purchase some extra equipment. If it's your first time raising quail you might want to purchase some mature birds instead of hatching chicks."

      "title": "Decide how many birds you need based on your egg consumption.",
      "content": "Decide how many birds you need based on your egg consumption. Figure out your weekly chicken egg consumption. It takes five quail eggs to equal one chicken egg and your mature females should lay one egg every day. [3] X Research source Plan to get one female bird (through hatching eggs or pairs of mating birds) for each chicken egg you eat. Quail eggs can be consumed like chicken eggs; however, it requires more birds to produce the same amount."

      "title": "Look for a good egg-laying breed.",
      "content": "Look for a good egg-laying breed. Coturnix are highly recommended birds to keep. They aren't just good egg producers but they can also be kept as meat and are really easy to look after. If you're looking for quail that lay bigger eggs you should go for the jumbo Coturnix. [4] X Research source Coturnix quail are also known as Japanese quail. You'll also get different coloured Coturnix quail such as the tuxedo quail which is a white and brown colour. Coturnix usually start laying at 6-8 weeks when they mature. From then on they will lay 1 egg every day. If you're not sure about Coturnix you can buy other popular breeds such as the Scaled Quail, Gambel's Quail, or the Bobwhite Quail. However, Coturnix quail is the recommended starter breed."

      "content": "Buy at least two females for every male, but keep males separated. A preponderance of females will ensure plenty of egg production in your flock. At the same time, you'll probably only be able to house one male in each cage; if two or more males are kept in a single cage, the dominant male may attempt to kill all other males to ensure that only he will be able to mate with the female quails."

Chick starter provides more nutrients for your chick which is what they need, and when they get older they do not require this diet anymore. You can purchase some turkey starter or some chicken starter and grind them up into smaller grains so that the quail chicks can eat it. Any feed that is high in protein should be alright."
