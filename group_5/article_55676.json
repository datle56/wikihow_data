      "title": "Sit in a chair with a hard back and no armrests.",
      "content": "Sit in a chair with a hard back and no armrests. When you start learning to play the guitar , it's important to practice in a seated position. Before you can duckwalk across the stage while ripping a solo, you've got to learn to hold the guitar comfortably without struggling to reach the frets and the strings. The best way to do this is to learn to hold the guitar from a seated position in an appropriate chair. You can sit with your feet flat, your legs crossed or with your feet on a footrest. Just make sure you have good posture, and that you're comfortable, Adams recommends. Sit far forward on the chair, so your back isn't touching the backrest and your butt is right on the edge of the seat. Keep your back very straight. [1] X Research source Guitar stools are available at most music stores, and they're perfect for practicing. They're also rather expensive. If you want one, go for it, but practicing in your own kitchen chair should be fine. Just avoid the couch, the La-Z-Boy, and other soft recliners, which will build bad posture and bad guitar habits."

      "title": "Orient the guitar with the low E string on the top.",
      "content": "Orient the guitar with the low E string on the top. When held correctly, the biggest string on the guitar (the low E string) should be closest to the ceiling, and the skinniest string (the high E string) facing toward the floor. The body of the guitar–the part with the strings and the sound hole–is on the side of your dominant hand, which is the hand you write with. The neck–the long, skinny, fretted part of the guitar–is on your non-dominant side. Your dominant hand is your “strumming hand” or your “picking hand.\" This hand plucks the guitar strings and creates the sound. While it might seem more comfortable to use that hand for fretting, it's much easier in the long run to learn this way. [2] X Research source Your non-dominant hand is your “fretting hand,\" used to press the strings onto the fretboard and create the individual notes. If you're left-handed and playing a right-handed guitar (or vice versa), your fretting hand is your dominant hand, and your strumming hand is your non-dominant hand. If you are left-handed and have a right-handed guitar, you can have a luthier convert the guitar to a left-hand instrument for about $160 to $200 (acoustic) and $80 to $130 (electric). [3] X Research source The easiest way to learn to play guitar as a left-hander is to get a left-handed guitar . Holding one is a mirror image of how a right-handed player holds a guitar."

      "title": "Balance the base of the guitar on your thigh.",
      "content": "Balance the base of the guitar on your thigh. When you pick up the guitar in a seated position, put the leg on your dominant side forward slightly, bending your knee so it forms a right angle with your foot flat on the floor. Shift your other foot back slightly to make it comfortable. Keep your back straight. Balance the tail or base of the guitar–the end opposite the tuning pegs–on the thigh of your dominant side. Some dreadnought-style acoustic guitars have a nice cutout that fits nicely on your other thigh, helping to orient the guitar properly. Take some time to feel out your guitar and seat it comfortably on your lap. When it’s balanced properly, you don’t have to hold it up with your hands."

      "title": "Tilt the neck up at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Tilt the neck up at a 45-degree angle. Properly held, the neck of the guitar is at a 45-degree angle to the floor (not parallel) when the guitar is resting on your lap. Holding the instrument this way is sometimes called “classical style,” but it’s the best and most comfortable way to learn, whether you plan on playing classical guitar , folk, or rock ‘n’ roll. [4] X Research source Some guitar teachers don’t require that you hold the guitar this way. Once you get comfortable, you can hold the guitar however you like. For the beginner, though, it's much easier to access the fretboard. If your guitar teacher teaches you to play with the neck of the guitar parallel to the ground, try out playing in the classical style to see which you like better."

      "title": "Secure the guitar’s body with your dominant elbow and forearm.",
      "content": "Secure the guitar’s body with your dominant elbow and forearm. Keep the guitar tight to your body, with the back touching your torso. Face the fretboard and the strings forward, not tilted back toward you, so you can see them better. To make sure you're not hugging too tightly, practice strumming , letting your hand fall comfortably, about an inch below the sound-hole of an acoustic guitar , or even with the pick-ups on an electric guitar . Your hand placement in relation to the sound hole will affect the sound. Adams says if you play over the sound hole, it will create a gentler sound that adds ambiance. If you play back towards the soundboard and the saddle, it will create a harsher, tighter sound. You should think of this less as “holding” a guitar and more as letting the guitar rest comfortably on your lap while you play. The less you “hold” it, the easier it is to play."

      "content": "Keep your back as straight as possible. The most important part of holding a guitar properly is maintaining a straight back and keeping the guitar perpendicular to the ground. It's easy to slide into a slouch, tilting the guitar back so you can see the fretboard, but this is a fast train to poor technique and sloppy playing. If you want to hold it properly, keep your back straight. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use an adjustable strap to hold the guitar while standing.",
      "content": "Use an adjustable strap to hold the guitar while standing. If you're ready to take your guitar skills onto the stage, it's common to support the guitar using a guitar strap . Many different styles and arrangements are available, from wrap-around mariachi-style straps to tight banjo-style straps , but the most common varieties are relatively basic and easy to use. Look for a strap of good quality cloth or leather with an adjustable length to allow you the freedom to find a height that works best for you. [6] X Research source Make sure your guitar is outfitted with strap pegs before you buy a strap, or consider having them installed at the guitar shop. You'll need at least one strap peg at the base of most guitars to make a strap work. Most guitars will come with them pre-installed."

      "title": "Attach the strap securely to the guitar.",
      "content": "Attach the strap securely to the guitar. How you attach the strap will vary depending on whether you've got one or two strap pegs. Many acoustic guitars will only have one peg, while electric guitars commonly have two. Slip the base peg through the tab on the end of the strap, then install the peg closer to the neck. To strap an acoustic guitar with one peg, insert the skinny end of the strap around the head, under the strings where they attach to the tuning pegs. Some straps won't come with this, but you can use a shoestring inserted through the peg hole on the skinny end of the strap to make do in a pinch. If your acoustic comes with two pegs already, just attach the strap to both pegs at the top and bottom of the guitar body. To strap an electric guitar, insert the pegs through the tabs on each end of the strap. Some straps will come with a variety of different tabs to allow multiple lengths. Start tight and loosen up if necessary. Some guitar strap assemblies come with a strap-enforcement peg or clip on the base of the guitar, which will help hold the strap securely in place. These are usually simple plastic clips that will fit over the peg and keep the end of the strap from slipping off."

      "title": "Adjust the guitar strap to a comfortable height.",
      "content": "Adjust the guitar strap to a comfortable height. Sling the strap over the shoulder of your fretting hand, and feel where the guitar falls. Adjust the strap shorter or longer by sliding the buckle up or down to position the bottom of the guitar even with your hip on your dominant side. Tilt the neck as high or low as you like as long as the elbow of your fret hand doesn’t bend more than 90 degrees. Move the elbow of your strumming arm slightly in front of your body. Keep your back straight. Err on the side of keeping the strap short. You don’t want to have the guitar too low, or you’ll struggle to play with your strumming hand. Likewise, if the guitar is too high, it can be tiring to hold your arms up that high to play. The length of the guitar strap has a lot to do with your playing style. Some players want the guitar as high as possible to allow easy access to the fretboard, while rockers want it as low as possible, because it looks awesome. There's no right way. This is especially useful if you've got an input jack on the bottom of your guitar that gets loose over time. You can keep the cable from slipping out and falling all the way to the ground. Tip: Loop your guitar cable through the strap before plugging it in to keep it out of your way. Insert the cable between the base peg and the strap, from the back to the front of the guitar, and plug it in. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Balance the neck between your thumb and forefinger. When you hold the guitar properly, you don’t have to use your fretting hand for support. The guitar remains in place because you rest it on the thigh of your dominant side and hold it to your body with the elbow on that side. To keep the guitar steady, form a \"V\" shape with the thumb and forefinger of your fretting hand, and use that hand to balance the neck of the guitar. “You don't have to kill the guitar neck when you're holding it. You can hold it down gently, especially when you're just learning…there's not a lot of pressure that has to be applied,” Adams advises."

      "title": "Place your thumb on the middle of the back of the guitar neck.",
      "content": "Place your thumb on the middle of the back of the guitar neck. Try to line your thumb up with the second finger. This alignment helps you press the strings more firmly. [8] X Research source If you're learning properly, your fretting thumb should remain on the back of the neck, and your other fingers arched over the fretboard. Some guitar teachers put a small piece of tape just behind the third fret on the neck of the guitar to indicate where you should place your thumb as a beginner. Be careful not to wrap your thumb around the guitar neck. As you play the lower-pitched strings, your thumb may shift toward the edge of the neck. This is fine if you aren’t curling your thumb around the edge to grip the guitar. [9] X Research source Alternatively, guitar wizards from Hendrix to John Fahey have broken this rule with abandon, incorporating the wrapped thumb to great effect. If you've got long fingers, you can get away with it. Follow your guitar teacher's instructions if you're taking lessons, or experiment to see what works best for you."

      "title": "Keep your wrist straight as you grasp the guitar neck.",
      "content": "Keep your wrist straight as you grasp the guitar neck. There can be a very slight bend as long as you don’t arch your wrist out or cave it in at a sharp 90-degree angle. Generally, your wrist should be straight, relaxed, and aligned with your arm. [10] X Research source Practice holding this position as you play. Your wrist may bend slightly as you move it along the neck. This is fine as long as you keep it relaxed and basically straight. The proper playing position helps you avoid developing pain in your wrist. A guitarist with bigger hands may find it more comfortable to shift their wrist up slightly to accommodate their larger palm and longer fingers."

      "content": "Gently curve the fingers of your dominant hand to make a loose fist. Rest your thumb alongside your forefinger. The tip of your thumb will hit near the top knuckle of your forefinger. Keep the rest of your fingers loosely curved as you play. Holding your hand in a tight fist can limit your movements and tire out your arm muscles more quickly, so you won’t be able to play as well or as long."

      "title": "Grasp the pick in a relaxed grip between your thumb and forefinger.",
      "content": "Grasp the pick in a relaxed grip between your thumb and forefinger. Position the guitar pick so the tip extends from the side of your thumb, pointing toward your fingertips. Use just enough pressure to keep the pick from falling out of your hand as you play the guitar . Keeping your grip light helps your arm relax, which allows you to play more fluidly. [11] X Research source Start out holding the pick near the tip for better control. As you get more comfortable, try different positions to find out which you like best. Different pick grips include shifting the thumb further up on the finger so the thumb joint and the top finger joint are roughly parallel or holding it pinched between the pads of the thumb and forefinger."
