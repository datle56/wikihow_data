      "title": "Look for oak trees with brown leaves and insects around them.",
      "content": "Look for oak trees with brown leaves and insects around them. Developing insects will cause the leaves to turn brown and wither. Since galls are so difficult to see, try and spot leaves that have browned to check for wasp and mite activity. Another way to look out for oak mites is to see if there are small insects hovering around an oak tree. Swarms can be a few feet off the ground or as high as 20–30 feet (6.1–9.1 m) in the air. [1] X Research source If the brown leaves have a crusty edge to them, it’s a sign that mite activity could be present. You’ll start to see these swarms in September, but they are around during sunsets throughout the summer as well."

      "title": "Stay away from oak trees at the end of summer.",
      "content": "Stay away from oak trees at the end of summer. As summer turns into fall, the galls where the young oak mites eat the wasp larvae break open and release the mites into the air. A stiff breeze can also blow the mites off the tree, at which point they can get into your clothing and start biting you. Towards the end of summer, the mite population can be very large, with as many as 300,000 mites falling from each tree every day. [2] X Research source If possible, wear tight clothing when working outside to keep the mites away from your skin. Bites primarily occur on a person’s upper body or wherever clothing is loose. You can also wear a hooded jacket to cover the back of your neck while working outside."

      "title": "Close all windows and doors around late August.",
      "content": "Close all windows and doors around late August. When oak mites leave their galls and become airborne, they can fly through open windows, doors, or screens and bite people inside. These “mite showers” generally occur between August and October, so keep your house sealed off from the mites right before fall starts. [3] X Research source Just having a screen in your window isn’t enough to keep oak mites out because they’re so tiny and they can slip through the gaps in the screen. Make sure every window is completely shut."

      "title": "Avoid spraying or removing the oak tree with mites on it.",
      "content": "Avoid spraying or removing the oak tree with mites on it. The spray will not penetrate the gall which protects the oak mite, so it is not going to be effective. It is not necessary to remove the tree itself because the mites are not likely to be a problem every single year. [4] X Research source The best way to make sure mites don’t fall on you is to stay away from the bottom of oak trees."

      "title": "Remove all clothing and wash it immediately.",
      "content": "Remove all clothing and wash it immediately. Use laundry detergent and hot water on your clothes when you go to wash them. Mites can remain on fabric for several days once they’ve attached themselves to your clothes, so it’s important to do laundry as soon as you come inside. [5] X Research source Keep these dirty clothes away from everything in your house as you bring them to your washing machine."

    {
      "title": "Take a hot shower and wash yourself thoroughly.",
      "content": "Take a hot shower and wash yourself thoroughly. Apply soap all over your body and vigorously rub it into your skin with a washcloth. Shampoo and rinse your hair as well to make sure every part of your body gets cleaned. Soap and hot water will kill any oak mites on your body. [6] X Research source Take a long shower to give yourself the chance to clean every part of yourself. Oak mites cannot be seen with a naked eye, so use soap and hot water everywhere just to be safe."

    {
      "title": "Dry yourself off with a towel and put on fresh clothes.",
      "content": "Dry yourself off with a towel and put on fresh clothes. Use a fresh towel and get all the soap and water off your body. When you are done with the towel, run it through the washing machine before using it again. Wear clothes that you haven’t worn to work outside. [7] X Research source Repeat this process whenever you work outside in late summer."

      "title": "Use anti-itch cream to treat your skin if you’ve been bitten.",
      "content": "Use anti-itch cream to treat your skin if you’ve been bitten. The bites are tiny, welt-like bumps that inflame your skin and become incredibly itchy. You can pick up an over-the-counter itch cream from your local drug store or order some online. Apply a dab of cream every day to each bump and let it sit. Use the cream until the bites are completely gone. Oak mite bites usually last about 2 weeks. [8] X Research source Do not scratch your bites as this can lead to an infection."
