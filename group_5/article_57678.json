      "content": "Sailors used to get an anchor tattoo after crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Sailing across the Atlantic was a long, treacherous journey for many seamen, so when they crossed it the first time, they’d often get an anchor tattoo to commemorate the occasion. It served as a rite of passage. [7] X Research source Other sailors sometimes got an anchor tattoo at the end of their sailing career to symbolize “putting their anchor down” one last time. Some also got the tattoo to help them stay calm during strong storms or other crises. Later, the United States military branches of the Navy and Marines also adopted anchor tattoos. Pirates may have also sported anchor tattoos, though the skull and crossbones are more frequently associated with them."

      "content": "Christians used the anchor as a hidden cross. Sometimes called the “Cross of Hope,” this tattoo often incorporated a Christian cross into the top of the anchor to represent the wearer’s faith. This symbol likely stems from the Romans’ persecution of Christians, in which the Christians used the anchor as a hidden symbol. Someone might get this tattoo if they needed to hide their beliefs but still wanted to connect with them and find other Christians. [8] X Research source This idea may come from Hebrews 6:19, which states, “Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.” St. Paul also once said, “One must anchor one’s soul in Christ as the only way of avoiding spiritual shipwreck.”"

      "content": "There is no right or wrong place to get an anchor tattoo. It’s entirely up to you and where you think it would look best on your body. When preparing for your tattoo appointment , it’s best to have a general idea in mind (like your bicep or your calf, for example), but don’t be afraid to ask your artist to move the stencil a few times so you can be positive you’re choosing the right spot . Here are a few ideas for you to consider: [15] X Research source Get a small, minimalist tattoo on your ankle, wrist, or behind your ear. These locations can all be easily hidden if you don’t want your tattoo to be visible 24/7. If you want a large anchor tattoo, opt for the chest, stomach, or back. Since these are the largest flat areas on your body, you’ll likely be able to get the exact design you want without having to compromise too much. Forearms, biceps, calves, and thighs are all common areas to get a tattoo, especially if it’s your first one. If you’re really daring, you can get an anchor tattoo on your neck or hands. Make sure you’re fully committed, however, as these areas are very painful to tattoo and still come with a lot of stigma."
