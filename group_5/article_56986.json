      "content": "Buy a strain that has the smell and flavor profile you're looking for. Sure, growing conditions can affect how your marijuana smells, but plant strain is one of the biggest indicators of smell. Shop for a strain with the smell you're after—you'll find sweet, funky, sour, or fruity strains, for instance. [1] X Research source Still not sure what to get? Talk with a seed supplier who you trust and describe the smell you're going for. [2] X Expert Source Jamie Corroon, ND, MPH Medical Director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Education Expert Interview. 10 March 2020. You can also check out seed companies or forums for marijuana growers. Any of these should be able to point you in the right direction!"

      "content": "Skip standard plant soil and fertilizers which are too high in nitrogen. Instead, use gardening products made for marijuana plants. These usually help the plant produce terpenes, the compounds that make your marijuana smell its best. [3] X Research source Generic plant soils and fertilizers can pack too much nitrogen. A nitrogen excess will help your marijuana plant put on a lot of growth, but it will reduce bud yield which is where those fantastic aroma compounds are found."

      "content": "Heat can make marijuana lose its smell so 75 °F (24 °C) is the sweet spot. If the temperature in your grow room is over 80 °F (27 °C), the plant's going to be really stressed and it won't put on as many aromatic buds. [4] X Research source Check the room's thermostat so you know it's accurate and set between 70 to 75 °F (21 to 24 °C)."

      "title": "Bend and tie back tall branches to encourage more buds to form.",
      "content": "Bend and tie back tall branches to encourage more buds to form. You've probably noticed that most marijuana plants grow a tall main stem with buds on the end. Since the aroma compounds are in the buds, if you tie back the tall branches you can encourage flat, uniform growth. This means you'll get more and bigger buds across the plant which means more flavor! [5] X Research source Be gentle when you bend the branches down and away from the center. You can use a twist tie or plant tie to secure the branch to a nearby branch so it doesn't pop back up. Start low-stress training as soon as you notice that some branches are taller than the others. The earlier you start training, the better."

      "title": "Turn on UV-B lights for 2 to 3 weeks to encourage trichome production.",
      "content": "Turn on UV-B lights for 2 to 3 weeks to encourage trichome production. Aim for 12 hours of lighting while the marijuana is flowering, alternating with 12 hours of darkness. The UV-B rays help the plant make trichomes—those hairy, glittery glands that contain terpenes. [6] X Research source The flowering phase is usually 8 to 9 weeks after planting, but your seeds should have a specific flowering timeline. UV-B light can cause eye inflammation so you should always wear protective goggles or glasses when you work around the light."

      "title": "You can buy sugar- or carbohydrate-based supplements at grow supply shops.",
      "content": "You can buy sugar- or carbohydrate-based supplements at grow supply shops. These products can make your marijuana smell sweeter. Just dilute the product according to the manufacturer's directions and water your plant for the 2 weeks before you harvest. [7] X Research source If you want to try a homemade supplement, dissolve 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of blackstrap molasses in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water."

      "title": "Water the plant with plain water to help the plant absorb nutrients.",
      "content": "Water the plant with plain water to help the plant absorb nutrients. If you've been using supplements that help the plant put on aromatic buds, a lot of the nutrients are still in the soil. Stop adding supplements in the last 2 growing weeks and just use water. This gives the marijuana a chance to absorb the nutrients that are still in the soil. [8] X Research source Flushing is also a great way to prevent your marijuana from smelling or tasting like chemicals or mint."

      "title": "Experiment with harvesting a week early or late within the time frame.",
      "content": "Experiment with harvesting a week early or late within the time frame. Check your seed strain for a specific harvesting timeframe. Then, play around with harvesting to find out what gets you the most aromatic marijuana. You may harvest a week earlier than recommended or give your plants an extra week so the aromatic compounds can develop. [9] X Research source This is a good experiment if you've got several marijuana plants. Keep a log or journal and make notes so you know what harvesting time worked best for which strain. In general, marijuana plants are ready to harvest when you see the glittery crystal-like trichomes on the buds turn milky or amber."

      "content": "Keep the temperature in your drying room between 60 and 68 °F (16 and 20 °C). Set the humidity to 50% so the marijuana dries slowly and evenly. This can help preserve the aromatic compounds so your marijuana smells great. [10] X Research source If the drying room is over 75 °F (24 °C), your marijuana will lose a lot of flavor and aroma."

      "title": "Carefully cut the buds from the stems and put them in wide-mouthed jars.",
      "content": "Carefully cut the buds from the stems and put them in wide-mouthed jars. Handle the buds really gently since these are covered with hairy, glittery trichomes that are packed with aromatic compounds. Fill wide-mouthed mason jars with the buds and seal them closed. [11] X Research source Fill your jars only 75% full so they're not packed and they can continue to dry out. Your marijuana will continue to become flavorful as the buds cure."

      "title": "Place the jars in a room that's 70 °F (21 °C) with 60-65% humidity.",
      "content": "Place the jars in a room that's 70 °F (21 °C) with 60-65% humidity. The buds will keep drying and will develop more flavor and aroma. Giving the marijuana time to dry can also make it feel more potent. [12] X Research source As the marijuana cures, it will lose the flavor compounds that make it smell like hay. Instead, it will develop scents that are common for the particular strain. For instance, your marijuana may start to smell fruity, floral, or funky."
