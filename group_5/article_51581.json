Do your homework first and think through whether you can provide adequate lifelong care for a lionhead. Know that they can live up to ten years, so this is a long term commitment.

      "content": "Consider the ongoing costs of looking after your lionhead rabbit. Be aware that the initial purchase price of a lionhead can be small relative to the cost of ongoing maintenance. There is the purchase cost of runs and hutches, bedding, and feedstuffs. There is also the cost of veterinary treatment, possible nail clips and teeth filing, and preventative healthcare, such as products to prevent fly strike (when flies breed on the skin) and vaccinations. [3] X Research source Also, there could be unexpected expenses, such as if your rabbit falls ill and you rack up veterinary bills."

      "content": "Find a lionhead rabbit at an animal shelter. Shelters are a good option and it is entirely possible that you will find a lionhead that needs rehoming. Large charities work hand-in-hand with vets, and so your new rabbit is likely to have been checked over and passed as healthy. Many charities often get litters of unwanted rabbits handed in, when the owners thought they had two rabbits of the same gender, whereas they had a male and female, so there is every chance of finding the bunny you want at a shelter."

      "content": "Go to a rabbit breeder. Contact The British Rabbit Council (BRC) or The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) for a list of breeders in your area. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Make an appointment to visit a breeder and see their rabbits. Check that the rabbits are kept in spacious conditions, with plenty of resources such as clean bedding, food, shelters, and toys. The rabbits should look alert and inquisitive, and have bright eyes free from discharges, sleek glossy coats, and not runny noses, coughing or sneezing. Take a look at the pellets in the run and make sure they are dry, rather than runny or diarrhea."

      "content": "Look for a lionhead rabbit at a pet store. Be aware that pet store rabbits have been shipped and may be suffering from stress, which can predispose rabbits to disease and illness. It is also difficult to get an appreciation of the conditions in which the rabbit was bred, and hence know if this was done in an ethical and kind way. Encouraging unscrupulous breeders is undesirable as it perpetuates unnecessary distress for the animals."

It is good to keep rabbits as indoor pets because outdoor rabbits can be \"forgotten\" about and neglected more easily. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source However, one disadvantage of keeping a rabbit indoors is its lack of exposure to grass, sunshine, and fresh air, which are all part of its basic needs. Get a run that is predator-proof and escape-proof to keep the rabbit safe outside. Consider building the run yourself. You may want to compromise and just put your rabbit outside in good weather, or else train it to wear a harness so you can take it out but keep control."

      "content": "Have the rabbit's cage set up before you bring it home. If the cage is in the house, it should be set up in an area where the rabbit will be able to see you, but can have peace and quiet as well. Your rabbit's cage should have an area for it to bed down full of bedding, as well as a dish of food and a bowl of water. Your lionhead should never be in a cage with soft wood (cedar or pine) bedding because it can cause respiratory problems. Choose a safe, recycled brand of bedding or use a towel that is soft. Buy the cage large enough so the bunny can move around. It should be at least 8x the length of your rabbit. Even better than a cage is a large pen or bedroom, and the best of all is free-range! You can make a rabbit safe room and put a gate in the doorway to keep bunny in. Rabbits are super easy to litterbox train. Put a dish for his food in the cage, and don't forget about the water! The cage at left is not suitable for a rabbit, it is too small. The run is also quite small, a shed with an attached 10 foot run is best. Make sure you pave the floor so bunnies can not dig out and around it so predators can not dig in. Large flat paving stones work well. If you have more than one lionhead be sure to bond them before putting together unless they are baby siblings. Be sure to get them neutered before sexual activity begins, usually by four months old."

Most importantly know that rabbits gnaw and chew, and will happily chew on electrical cables, with disastrous consequences. Lie down on floor levels and look for anything the rabbit could pick up and chew. Remove all hazards or make them safe, such as placing cable protectors over electrical wires."

Don't let children touch it, at least not until the bunny feels more at ease. How long this overall process takes depends on the individual bunny; some require more time while others require less."

      "title": "Feed your rabbit.",
      "content": "Feed your rabbit. Talk to your vet about the right diet for your rabbit. In general, your rabbit should be fed a limited amount of pellets (about 1/8 cup per pound of body weight), fresh greens, and unlimited amounts of Timothy hay (or alfalfa hay if the rabbit is less than seven months old). Treats such as apples, carrots, bananas, etc, can be fed in small quantities (a couple of tablespoons per day). Always make sure your rabbit has water all the time. As a rule of thumb, any one food will be high in a particular nutrient. To avoid the rabbit eating excessive amount of any one nutrient, which could result in a health problem (for example excessive oxalate in carrots that can cause bladder stones), never feed the same fresh food two days running. By providing variety in their diet, you avoid this pitfall. Never, on any account, feed your rabbit human foods, such as sweet biscuits. The rabbit's metabolism is not designed to cope with sugar and it will induce diabetes in your rabbit. Make sure your rabbit has plenty of fiber to help prevent against wool block (hairballs), keep teeth healthy, and groom your lionhead daily for the same reason."

      "title": "Brush your lionhead rabbit daily.",
      "content": "Brush your lionhead rabbit daily. The lionhead has a soft downy coat, and if it grooms and swallows excessive amounts of soft fur this can lead to bowel obstructions. To avoid this, and to get some great bonding time with your bunny, brush your lionhead daily. During the time of year that your lionhead is shedding most (spring and autumn), groom it more often. Pay particular attention to the longer fur, or 'mane,' between the rabbit's ears. It is important to keep this hair in order. Comb it through to avoid knots and tangles, but you should be gentle around the delicate parts of the rabbit's face, especially its eyes. Check your Lionhead's rear end every day. Fly strike happens when urine or fecal soiling occurs on the rabbit's rear. This attracts flies, that then lay eggs in the soiled fur. Those eggs hatch out into maggots, which then burrow into the rabbit's flesh. To avoid this, check the fur for soiling every day, and immediately clean the rabbit's rear with damp cotton wool if it is soiled. Be vigilant for small white dots stuck to the fur (fly eggs) and remove them immediately. If you see maggots, contact your vet for an emergency appointment."

      "content": "Get your lionhead rabbit proper preventative health care. Your rabbit should be checked by a rabbit-friendly veterinarian at least once a year. Vaccinations are an important part of protecting your rabbit's health, and do vary from state to state and indeed between countries, so speak to the veterinarian about what is appropriate for your area. Vaccines are currently available to protect your rabbit against HVD (hemorrhagic viral diarrhea) and myxomatosis. HVD is caused by a hardy virus, which you can walk in on your shoes, so even if you have a house rabbit, you should consider vaccination. In the UK, vets routinely give a course of worming treatment against a parasite called Encephalitozoon cuniculi which causes neurological damage, kidney failure, and eyesight problems in middle to older aged rabbits. It is thought that around 75% of rabbits carry this parasite, although not all become ill from it. If you live in the UK and this is a concern for you then speak to your vet about treatment with a product containing fenbendazole. [7] X Research source Be aware that female rabbits are at high risk of developing uterine cancer. With this awareness, vets now recommend routine desexing of female rabbits at a young age, from around 5 months. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Be vigilant for signs of ill health. Warning signs of a problem include a wet chin (dental issues), watery eyes, or a discharge from the eyes (infection or overgrown tooth roots), weight loss, being unusually withdrawn, or diarrhea. Also check that your rabbit is eating regularly. If a rabbit doesn't eat for 24 hours its gut tends to \"go to sleep\" and a vicious circle of decline starts. If you are worried immediately contact your vet. Lionheads should weigh between 2.5 and 3.8 pounds (if they are purebred). If it weighs 4 pounds or over, it is either overweight or pregnant (or is a mixed breed of rabbit that one parent was not a dwarf). To tell if your rabbit is over or underweight, you can run your hand over its spine, gently pressing down. If you can't feel the spine at all, your rabbit is overweight. The spine should feel smooth, with rounded bumps. If the bumps feel almost jagged and very noticeable, the rabbit is underweight."
