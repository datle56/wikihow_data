This award system is available to all Amazon customers in the United States. To get started, purchase a Kindle book or eligible printed book (before every purchase, you'll see the book's point value). You do not have to be a Kindle Unlimited member to earn Kindle Rewards.

This means that in order start earning book credits, you'll need to purchase about 6 to 7 Kindle books or 10 to 15 print books."
