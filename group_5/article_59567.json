      "content": "Use the USB cable that came with the Roku (if applicable). If you're using a streaming stick, skip this step. You don't want to use an older cable that can have degradation that inhibits power supply. Instead, use the cable that came with the Roku and plug it into a surge protector. A surge protector ensures that the power from the wall outlet is consistent and protects your devices from power surges. If you already use a surge protector, try plugging directly into the wall outlet to see if you get more power that way."

      "title": "Make sure it has proper ventilation.",
      "content": "Make sure it has proper ventilation. Even if you're using a streaming stick, overheating is still something to consider. You'll be able to physically feel that your Roku is too hot if overheating is the issue. If you have a Roku Streaming Stick, you can fill out this Roku form to get a free HDMI extender so you can move your Roku away from the back of your TV. [1] X Research source Avoid putting a Roku box inside a cabinet or closed space where heat cannot escape. Also, don't put your Roku device on top of other electronic devices, like a cable box, and don't put it in direct sunlight. Use a can of compressed air or a dust-free cloth to clean off any dust blocking the vents and causing the Roku to overheat and restart. Some Roku streaming players will show a solid red light if they're overheating, and other devices will show an on-screen message that the device is too hot. If your Roku device restarts more than three times because it's overheating, you need to stop using it."

If you've tried the other troubleshooting steps and nothing works, your current Roku is likely too old to be compatible with the newer features or malfunctioning badly enough to need a replacement. The latest Roku devices are available on Amazon and through other retailers. A Roku device that overheats for no apparent issue is a sign of old or malfunctioning hardware. Searching your model number on the internet may help you determine if your Roku device is incompatible, but there are also signs that your Roku is giving you, like it works slowly, doesn't update anymore, has lots of connectivity issues, and overheats randomly."
