Let's move forward with open hearts and high hopes for the future!\" If \"I love you\" doesn't feel honest right now, think about why you're grateful for your spouse and thank them for their best qualities. For example: \"You are the best parent our kids could ever ask for! I appreciate the dedication and care you give them. Happy anniversary!\" Write her a card apologizing for your mistakes and listing all the things you love about her.
