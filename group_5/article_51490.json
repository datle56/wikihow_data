      "content": "Most people can’t read in dreams. It’s believed that the parts of our brains that process language—Broca’s area (which is responsible for speech) and Wernicke’s area (which helps us with grammar and syntax, i.e., the ability to connect words in meaningful ways)—are less active while we sleep. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Therefore, most communication in dreams occurs through something more like telepathy or “vibes” rather than actual language."

      "content": "Some people may think about language more and therefore dream it. While it’s rare for anyone to read or write in a dream in any legible way, poets and writers, for instance, may be more likely to be able to do so simply because they spend a lot of their waking life dwelling on language. Broca’s area may be slightly active in the sleeping brains of such people, while Wernicke’s area is not, which is why they may dream words that make no sense."

      "content": "It’s not proven, but some people claim they can read while lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming refers to dreams in which the dreamer has awareness that they’re dreaming and control over their activity in the dream. 55% of people will lucid dream at some point in their life, with around 23% claiming to lucid dream at least once a month. [2] X Research source It’s not known whether or not lucid dreaming makes it possible to read in a dream, but anecdotally speaking, it may be possible."

      "content": "Dreams are mental activity or imagery that we experience in our sleep. It’s not totally clear what happens when we dream or why, but scientists can generally agree on the basics. Dreaming is most likely to occur during REM sleep, when brain activity increases, and we can dream in any of the 5 senses, although the majority of people’s dreams employ sight.
