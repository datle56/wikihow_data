Keep them current so your date recognizes you at a glance without disappointment, or you're wasting your time. Make sure they highlight your best attributes.

If you want to attract women that you'll be attracted to and who will be attracted to you, then it's a good idea to not try to make yourself sound like something that you're not. Use specific and honest details. What's a regular day like for you? What do you like to do? What do you enjoy? You don't have to make yourself look \"good,\" or sound \"smart\" to attract a woman's attention. You just need to let your personal sense of humor be on display. That'll be easier to keep up anyway. Look at other profiles for good examples, before you put up much about yourself. Avoid things you see that seem lame, or seem too desperate. try to remember: Lists of travel locations and books you've read can all start to look the same. try to be unique. [1] X Research source Don't focus too much on what you are or aren't looking for in a woman because it can rule out both the ones you want and don't want to meet. At the same time, it's good to use words like \"casual\" and \"hang out\" if you're not interested in a big relationship, but are interested in hook-ups."

Just cruise around the site for a while and see who catches your eye, and whether or not that woman might be good to get to know for a while. Then you can turn on the charm. Keep an eye out for good buzz-words. If a woman puts up that she's not interested in a long-term relationship right now, that might be someone to check out if you're not either. Depending on what you're interested in, keep an eye out for someone who has the same interests and goals. Keep an eye out for obviously bad signs, too. Anyone who says they \"Don't want any drama\" is obviously a drama-creator. Anyone who says they Most dating apps will filter so that you only see people in your area, so you don't have to worry about traveling or trying to figure out too many logistics.

What are you going to say that will catch her attention? What can you say that will stand out from the crowd? Be personal, specific, funny, and keep it light, above all. Find a specific thing on her profile, or a picture to tease her about. If she has a picture of herself riding a horse in the mountains, write something like, \"That horse looks like it would really do some damage to linoleum floors. I guess they probably hassle you about it when you ride it into saloons and such. Good thing I have a car if you ever want to meet for a drink.\" Write different messages to each person. Copy-pasted messages stand out like turds in punch bowls. Give a woman the courtesy of actually having something to say to her. Avoid coming off as whitebread, or basic. Don't use phrases like, \"I'm just a regular average guy, pretty laid back and I like having a good time.\" So what? Who doesn't? Aim a little higher. Don't go overboard on compliments because chances are she's so used to hearing them that she wouldn't even notice you."

You have to be willing to put in some hours looking at different profiles, finding girls you'd like to talk to, and actually talking to them. There's no shortcut. You have to do the work.

You want to seem like a mysterious and magnetic personality that she must get to know. In person. Lots of guys launch into compliments and really seem to over-do it. Many women will respond to this, but they're not really interested. If you want to actually get with a girl, start an emotional connection and a conversation, not an empty compliment."

There's a difference between saying something gently teasing, \"That picture of you on a horse makes me scared you're going to out-drink me and shoot me in the chest with your six gun. But I don't know if you have that in you...\" and saying something like, \"A woman who likes horses. Typical.\" That's not funny, or charming."

Ask open-ended questions, not closed ones. \"What's up?\" is always going to be, \"Not much.\" Instead, say, \"What have you been doing since we talked last?\" or better yet, ask follow-up questions. If she mentions a recent trip, ask, \"What was that like? What was your favorite part? What was the worst thing you ate?\" Give her things to say. Try to be positive and show that you have really read her profile. For example, if you've seen she's a scuba diver and you've never been scuba diving, mention that and try talking about it.

If you're chatting on a dating site, she knows you're interested. Sometimes, a little innuendo is fine, but keep it G-rated. If you're describing anything graphic, that's not going to be flirtatious, it's just going to be pornographic. Wouldn't you rather wait for the real thing? Never, under any circumstances, should your first message involve any kind of sex joke or reference to a sex act, or a reference to what's between your legs. This isn't a funny way to stand out.

Often, online chats and conversations will kind of peter out naturally, and you'll both just run out of things to say. Before it gets to that, try to cut it off by saying something like, \"Well, I've got to get going. My cat is hungry and is looking at me sideways. I'm scared for my face.\" It's generally good to wait a bit before you talk again, but if you're really having a good conversation, try to keep it going as long as possible.

There's no good rule of thumb, because every one and every conversation is different. try to feel out each girl you're talking to and wait until she says something positive to you, then don't be pushy. Once you've asked, don't bring it up again until she does. You put it out there, so it's unlikely she'll forget that you're interested."

Talk about what creative projects you've got going on, but without getting into the nitty gritty.

There's no big secret to this, other than doing it specifically instead of vaguely. Don't ask someone if they want to get a drink with you \"sometime,\" say, \"I know this place that does a great happy hour on Fridays. Interested? I'll be there anyway with some friends.\" Keep your first meeting casual. Meet her with some friends so she feels comfortable, or make it a big and fun event that will be pressure free.

If she's not responding, it's because she doesn't want to. Take it easy, and put your efforts elsewhere. You never know when a woman might cycle back through her contact list and say, \"Gee, that guy was kind of interesting, maybe I'll send him a message.\" Never lash out if you get rejected. It's really easy to post that stuff to Facebook and make you look like a total idiot."
