To put the argument to rest, user @Phosphatide created the Cube Rule of Food. This rule imagines every food as a cube—the side or sides with the starch determine what food category a dish fits in. Starches are a main source of carbohydrates and make up over ⅓ of the food you eat. Starches include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, and cereals.

      "content": "The Cube Rule of Food is a potential solution to an internet debate. Ever since the hot dog question haunted internet food critics everywhere, users have also argued whether or not burritos and other foods are also a type of sandwich. The hilarious “food wars” began when user @kadybat Tweeted “the sandwich discourse is played out. we need to have a new discussion. pop tarts are a kind of ravioli.” Then the official Pop-Tarts X (Twitter) account replied , “Um, excuse me. Ravioli are a kind of Pop-Tart.” Twitter user @matttomic created the Sandwich Alignment Chart to put these questions to rest, but his solution seemed to cause even more chaos . This is when @Phosphatide created the Cube Rule. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council doesn’t consider a hot dog a sandwich—instead, they say the dish should be in its own category. [2] X Research source However, Merriam-Webster’s dictionary argues that the hot dog is a sandwich because a meatball sandwich on a split roll counts as a sandwich. [3] X Research source New York and California tax laws also deem a hot dog as a type of sandwich.
