    {
      "title": "Try Dettol or any similar antiseptic solution.",
      "content": "Try Dettol or any similar antiseptic solution. This will combat the water-based acrylic paint and should strip off the paint fairly easily. The end result shouldn't look too shabby, although a fresh coat of paint should be added afterwards to touch it up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use oven cleaner.",
      "content": "Use oven cleaner. Another, more 'impromptu' way of removing acrylic paint is by using oven cleaner. Yes, you heard right, oven cleaner. You can either spray the foam onto the model and put it into a ziplock bag and leave it for a day or two, or spray it into a cup and scrub it on with a toothbrush. Again, the results should be good, but another fresh coat of paint is highly recommended."

    {
      "title": "Try a Revell or Humbrol-style brush cleaner.",
      "content": "Try a Revell or Humbrol-style brush cleaner. This may also remove acrylic paint, although this may or may not work, and will depend on the brand. Again, in the same way, acrylic thinners may or may not strip the paint off."

    {
      "title": "Soak them as needed.",
      "content": "Soak them as needed. Your best bet is to use the antiseptic solution or oven cleaner, and just let the item to be stripped of the paint soak in the solution for a few hours."

    {
      "title": "Seek brand-specific advice.",
      "content": "Seek brand-specific advice. If all of these do not work, then ask a modelling forum like britmodeller.com to see what enthusiasts there suggest."

      "title": "Consider sand paper as a last resort.",
      "content": "Consider sand paper as a last resort. You can try sanding it down, but you have to be very careful when doing this, so as not to accidentally sand down panel lines or model details."
