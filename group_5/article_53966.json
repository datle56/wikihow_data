      "content": "Disable Enhance Pointer Precision when you're gaming. This feature may only be helpful when you're doing office work or surfing the web. When playing a first-person shooter game such as Fortnite or Call of Duty , this setting can affect your mouse sensitivity (the speed your cursor moves). Enhance Point Precision works by increasing your mouse sensitivity when your mouse moves at a certain speed. This variation of mouse sensitivity makes it harder to build muscle memory with your hand movements. Disabling this feature allows you to rely on consistent movements, and as you practice, you should find yourself landing shots more frequently. Some games, such as Overwatch, may have this feature automatically disabled."
