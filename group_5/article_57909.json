These codes break down Netflix content into highly-specific genres so you can find things to watch you wouldn't find otherwise. Skip down to our massive Netflix Secret Menu Code list to see what's available! Once you've found a secret menu code, highlight it with your mouse and copy it, or jot it down somewhere so you don't forget it. You can then use the code to access secret Netflix menus when you're watching on a TV or a web browser. Unfortunately, secret menus do not work in the mobile app on tablets and smartphones. Some secret codes are fairly broad, such as the code \"67673,\" which is for Disney movies and shows.
