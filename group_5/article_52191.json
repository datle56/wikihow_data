      "title": "Use a soft, dry cloth to clean the sensors.",
      "content": "Use a soft, dry cloth to clean the sensors. A dry cloth is all you should need to remove dust and other debris that’s blocking the sensors on your vacuum. A microfiber or cotton cloth will do the trick. Don’t use anything abrasive to clean the sensors, like paper towels or the rough side of a sponge, since it can scratch them. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t use water or other cleaners on your Roborock’s sensors.",
      "content": "Don’t use water or other cleaners on your Roborock’s sensors. Roborock advises against using anything damp to wipe down any part of a Roborock vacuum, including the sensors. If liquid gets inside of your vacuum, it could damage it. [2] X Research source If the sensors are particularly dirty and a dry cloth isn’t helping, you could try using a slightly damp cloth to wipe down the sensors. However, this could potentially damage the sensors and void any warranty you have on your vacuum, so proceed with caution."

      "title": "Clean the sensors once a week to keep them working properly.",
      "content": "Clean the sensors once a week to keep them working properly. When dirt and debris accumulate on the sensors, your vacuum will stop working properly. To prevent this, try to remember to clean the sensors at least once per week. Consider cleaning them after every use so you don’t forget. [3] X Research source Clean the other components of your Roborock on a regular basis too, like the dustbin, filter, wheels, and main brush."

      "title": "Wipe down the 4 drop sensors located on the bottom of your vacuum.",
      "content": "Wipe down the 4 drop sensors located on the bottom of your vacuum. Flip your Roborock over. Then, locate the 4 sensors running along the edge of the front half of the device. These are the drop sensors. Take your soft, dry cloth and gently wipe off each sensor. [4] X Research source The drop sensors will be slightly sunk into the plastic that’s covering the bottom of the vacuum. They’re each about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long and they’re reflective. Different models of Roborock vacuums may have slightly different layouts. If you’re having a hard time locating any of the sensors, refer to the owner’s manual or look up a diagram of your specific model online."

      "title": "Clean the distance sensors located on the sides of your Roborock.",
      "content": "Clean the distance sensors located on the sides of your Roborock. These are the sensors that help your vacuum determine how far it is from nearby walls. Look for a small oval-shaped sensor on each side of your vacuum. These are the distance sensors. Wipe them down with the dry cloth to remove any dust and debris. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wipe off the contact sensors on the bottom of the device.",
      "content": "Wipe off the contact sensors on the bottom of the device. The contact sensors are the small square sensors located on either side of the front wheel. They make contact with the terminals on the docking station when you’re charging your Roborock. Gently wipe off these sensors with the dry cloth. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean the dock-station return and collision sensors on the front bumper. These sensors help your Roborock enter the docking station and avoid objects while it’s running. The dock-station return sensor is a narrow, horizontal oval that’s centered on the front bumper. The collision sensor is a long, narrow sensor that runs along the bottom edge of the front bumper. Wipe both of these sensors down with the dry cloth. [7] X Research source"
