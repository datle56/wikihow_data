      "content": "Carefully brush away any small stones or loose soil from around the edge of the area to be cast. You won't want any rocks getting into the impression once you start pouring the Plaster of Paris casting material. If the footwear mark is a loose material, spraying the footwear mark with hairspray will hold the particles of the soil or powder together, so that the casting material does not distort it. If the track or mark contains water, it can be carefully removed by using paper towels. Dip them into the impression and allow the water to be soaked up by the paper, taking care not to disturb the mark. There is no need to remove all the water; the Plaster of Paris will sink into the bottom of the impression and displace any water. To stop the Plaster of Paris from spreading out and overflowing, use stones or pieces of cardboard to make a barrier around the area. This is particularly important when the impression to be cast is on a shallow or sloping ground."

      "title": "Try to avoid pouring it directly into the middle of the impression.",
      "content": "Try to avoid pouring it directly into the middle of the impression. This can distort the detail or wash away the mark. Once the impression is full, tapping the surface of the casting material (while it is still a liquid) with a stick (or a pen/ruler) will make any air bubbles within the casting material rise to the top, preventing air bubbles in the final cast. Small pieces of string or sticks can be pushed into the surface of the casting material to reinforce it, so it is less likely to break into pieces when handled after lifting. A paper exhibit label tied to a piece of string can be attached by pressing the string into the casting material before it sets."

      "title": "Allow to fully dry before lifting.",
      "content": "Allow to fully dry before lifting. Do not attempt to remove the cast from the ground until it is completely dry and hard or it may crumble or lose detail. Use a spade or trowel to lift the cast from the ground. Dig into the ground a few inches away from the cast, using the soil as a cushion between the cast and space during removal. Avoid hitting the cast with the spade to prevent breakages."

    {
      "title": "Allow the removed cast to dry overnight.",
      "content": "Allow the removed cast to dry overnight. Wait until the next day before attempting to remove any soil adhering to the bottom of the cast. Large, loose pieces of soil can be picked off straight away, but leave a thin layer on the cast until it has hardened sufficiently. This will protect the cast during transportation. Carefully remove the soil, or you may damage the fine detail in the cast; a toothbrush or paintbrush used lightly will work best. Once the majority of soil has been removed, put the cast under a running tap and, using the paint brush, gently brush the cast to remove any remaining soil."
