      "title": "Get a good journal or notebook.",
      "content": "Get a good journal or notebook. There are tons of notebooks and journals to choose from. Pick one that you like and decorate it in any way you'd like. Decorative ideas include: A saying from the Bible, scrapbook cutouts, your name in large letters, words that represent the joy of Christianity to you, etc. If you'd rather, you can even make a journal from scratch. It all depends on how craft-savvy you are. There are prayer journal templates available for printing off from a variety of online sites; just do a quick search and choose what you like the look of."

      "title": "Make a front page explaining what you're doing.",
      "content": "Make a front page explaining what you're doing. This will help to guide you with the purpose for the journal and will help anyone else you'd like to read it to see what you were aiming to achieve through the journal. You don't have to share it with anyone though, but it can be nice to hand down this journal as a family heirloom later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write.",
      "content": "Write. You can write anything that inspires your Christianity, your views about Christianity and the things that you've learned from the Bible, church, etc. This might include poems, songs, your favorite scriptures, sermons, and faith mementos. Just remember that it is a Christian journal, not a regular journal that you would normally write what you did for the day. It is a journal intended to help increase your faith, so it is important to focus mainly on what inspires your faith and keeps you strong. You can make the journal as visual as you like. Mind maps, images, doodles, etc., are all creative ways to increase the value and enjoyment of creating your Christian journal."

    {
      "title": "Read the Bible regularly.",
      "content": "Read the Bible regularly. Use your journal to make notes about what you've read and the interpretations as they appear to you. What biblical passages have great meaning for you? In what way are you inspired or motivated by what you have read? Are there things that you want to do to help others through your readings? Are there other ways to apply the verse or chapter you've read for this day? Add these things to your journal, as notes, snippets, essays, poems, or whatever feels appropriate. Write down verses, quotes and stories from the Bible that are of particular importance to you. You may wish to write down prayers too. These could be prayers you have read or ones that you have made up yourself."

      "title": "Write down the things you'd like to share with God.",
      "content": "Write down the things you'd like to share with God. These might be thoughts, ideas or questions."

    {
      "title": "Consider creating lists of things you are praying to change or happen.",
      "content": "Consider creating lists of things you are praying to change or happen. For example, in one column you can have the item needing resolution, such as a safe medical checkup for a family member or a safe journey for a friend. In the other column, you can write down the resolution or achievement that prayer has brought about once the hoped for change or happening has occurred. If the hoped for outcome has not been positive, use the journal to work through why this might be the case and come up with your next approach."

      "title": "If you're going through a difficult time, a challenge or you're working hard to achieve something, use the journal to align your efforts with biblical encouragement.",
      "content": "If you're going through a difficult time, a challenge or you're working hard to achieve something, use the journal to align your efforts with biblical encouragement. Find verses and chapters within the Bible that lift you up and help you get through the hardest times. For example, if you're going through a hard time letting go of the past, look for verses that help you to deal with such letting go. You might focus on something like: \"Psalm 27:14, Wait for the Lord; be strong and let your heart take courage; yes, wait for the Lord.\" Or, \"1 Corinthians 15:33, Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”\" Use a verse or story to inspire your plan for letting go and moving forward with God's help."

      "content": "Use the journal to help you memorize scripture. You can write it down then read it again and again. Decorate the pages beautifully, so that you want to spend time gazing at it; the decorative effects will also become part of your memory, triggering it and making it easier to remember the words."

      "title": "Carry the journal with you wherever you go.",
      "content": "Carry the journal with you wherever you go. The Lord works in mysterious ways. You never know when you will encounter something worth writing down! Take the journal to such places as: school, church, the library, summer camp, when visiting family, etc."
