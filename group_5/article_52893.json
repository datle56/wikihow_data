      "content": "Tie up your hair in a high ponytail and brush it. Use an elastic band to secure your hair in a high ponytail. Use a brush to smooth out any bumps or lumps as you pull it back. Then, after you’ve tied back your hair, use the brush to get out any tangles or knots left in your ponytail. [1] X Research source This method works best with medium to long hair that can be completely pulled back into a ponytail. It also works well for thick hair at either of those lengths."

      "title": "Apply heat protectant to your ponytail to avoid damaging your hair.",
      "content": "Apply heat protectant to your ponytail to avoid damaging your hair. Prep your hair for the curling wand by running a few drops of heat protectant through your hair. You only need to apply the product to your ponytail, since you won’t be curling the rest of your hair. [2] X Research source Some heat protectants come in spray form, in which case, you should spray your ponytail several times and run your fingers through it to distribute the product further."

      "title": "Choose a heat setting that's right for you hair thickness.",
      "content": "Choose a heat setting that's right for you hair thickness. For fine hair, choose a low heat setting of around 375 °F (191 °C). Thick or textured hair will curl best if you use a high heat setting of around 415 to 420 °F (213 to 216 °C). All other hair types can use a medium heat seating of around 400 °F (204 °C). [3] X Research source If you have colored or damaged hair, it's best to use a low heat setting to prevent further damage or dulling of color."

      "content": "Divide your ponytail in half, then gather a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of hair. Position the sections of your ponytail in front of either shoulder to keep them in place. Decide which half you want to start with, and pull out a small section of hair from that half. [4] X Research source This section will become your first curl."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the piece of hair around the barrel of the curling wand.",
      "content": "Wrap the piece of hair around the barrel of the curling wand. Start wrapping at the very top of your ponytail, beginning the curl as close to the hair tie as possible. Begin your curl around the base of the curling iron and work your way to the top as you continue to wrap. Make sure the hair doesn’t overlap around the barrel of the wand. [5] X Research source You should wrap the hair until there’s a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece at the tip of your hair left in your fingers. Make sure you begin wrapping each curl away from your face."

      "title": "Hold the curling wand in place for 10-20 seconds, then release the hair.",
      "content": "Hold the curling wand in place for 10-20 seconds, then release the hair. Once you’ve wrapped the section of hair around the curling wand, allow it to sit for 10-20 seconds. Then, let go of the end of the curl and your hair will slide off the wand. [6] X Research source Curling wands come with differently sized barrels—the larger the barrel, the wider and looser your curl. Select a large barrel for loose, relaxed waves. Choose a small barrel for tighter, more defined curls."

      "content": "Hold the hair into a tight curl for 5 seconds. Grab the just-curled section of hair and lift it with the palm of your hand so it compresses into a small circle. Allow the hair to cool before you release it, which will give the curl time to set completely and last longer in your hair. [7] X Research source"

Make sure you’re continuing to curl away from your face, which will create the most flattering look once you remove the curls from the ponytail. [8] X Research source Don’t forget to support the curled section of your hair for 5 seconds after it’s released from the curling wand, in order to achieve longer-lasting curls."

      "content": "Switch to the other half of your ponytail and continue curling. Once you’ve completed one half, switch to the other side. Work in 1 in (2.5 cm) sections. Continue to curl away from your face, which will require you to reverse the direction of your curling iron. Since you’re only curling the ponytail, the top part of your hair will remain straight. Once you untie your hair, only your ends will have waves."

Then, remove the elastic hairband and find your part. Use your fingers to comb through the curls and finalize your style.

Lay one in front of each shoulder, then pick up a flat clip and secure the right one so the hair is pulled away from the left section. [10] X Research source This method works for all lengths of hair, although it’s easier with short and medium length. Consider spraying your hair with a heat protectant if you’re worried about damaging it with hot styling tools."

Start about halfway down the hair in order to curl just the ends. Hold the straightener diagonally so the end points upwards, then twist it towards your ear once to wrap your hair around the barrel of the straightener. [13] X Research source For a tighter curl, keep your straightener parallel to the ground and slide it more slowly down your hair. For medium or tight curls and waves, use a straightener that’s 1 inch (2.5 cm) or smaller. Large straighteners will create much looser waves that may not work well on short hair."

Make sure each piece of hair wraps around the exterior part of the straightener, since that’s what creates the curl. [15] X Research source Clip up the curled bottom section and release the uncurled top section. Use a flat clip to pin the now-curly bottom section of your hair towards the back of your head so it’s out of the way. Unclip the right top section, which you’re about to curl.

If your weave is made of synthetic hair extensions, however, check with your stylist before using a straightener. You can also check the packaging your weave came in to see if using heat is okay and what temperatures are best. The heat could damage or melt the weave. [20] X Research source"
