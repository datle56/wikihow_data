      "title": "No—alcohol lowers your inhibitions, but it doesn’t “make” you tell the truth.",
      "content": "No—alcohol lowers your inhibitions, but it doesn’t “make” you tell the truth. As you drink, alcohol makes you less concerned about what is or is not socially acceptable. With this in mind, alcohol isn’t a truth serum that automatically makes people honest—it’s a drink that makes people care less about what they’re saying. So, a drunk individual might give a brutally honest opinion simply because they have no filter at that moment (not because they actually mean what they’re saying). [1] X Research source It’s important to note that drinking alcohol impacts brain chemistry, which can make people feel extra emotional. [2] X Research source This may result in people saying things that they don’t mean or say things that aren’t true to begin with. Think of it this way—drunk individuals are legally not allowed to provide consent, as intoxicated people can not think or make decisions clearly. [3] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Context can help you figure out if a drunk person is being honest. For instance, a person who’s being exceptionally affectionate or providing an unsolicited opinion is likely being honest, while a person who’s defending themselves in a nasty argument might be telling a lie."

      "content": "Your reaction times are a bit slower. Once a little bit of alcohol starts entering your bloodstream (between 0.01 and 0.05 Blood Alcohol Content/BAC), you experience minuscule shifts in your behavior and perceptions. For instance, your sense of judgment might be a little impaired and you might not be as quick on your feet. [4] X Research source When your judgment is impaired, you might not be thinking through everything that you’re saying. Enjoying one serving of alcohol typically brings you to this point."

      "title": "You feel happier and relaxed.",
      "content": "You feel happier and relaxed. As you start drinking, your brain starts producing extra dopamine, a “feel-good” chemical. Physical side effects become more obvious at this point, like slurred speech, blurry vision, rapid changes in emotion, and poor judgment calls. [5] X Research source A person’s BAC is around 0.03 and 0.12 at this point. If you’re feeling more relaxed, you might feel inclined to share more than you would sober."

      "title": "You eventually feel confused and disoriented.",
      "content": "You eventually feel confused and disoriented. Once a person’s BAC reaches 0.18, the physical side effects of drinking are much more pronounced. Complete memory loss (commonly known as a “blackout”) can occur, and you may have trouble moving around on your own. Once your BAC is 0.25 or higher, there’s a good chance that you’ll pass out. [6] X Research source It’s easy to say things you don’t mean when you’re operating from a point of confusion and disorientation."

      "title": "It can lead to memory loss and blackouts.",
      "content": "It can lead to memory loss and blackouts. Drinking a lot of alcohol at once can impact your brain’s ability to move short-term memories to your long-term memory bank—because of this, drunk individuals often “blackout.” Consuming too much alcohol over a long period of time can also raise your risk of cognitive and memory issues later on in life. [7] X Research source Memory loss can make for a sticky situation after the fact, especially if you can’t remember what was said during the time you were drunk."

      "title": "It can contribute to anxiety issues.",
      "content": "It can contribute to anxiety issues. People sometimes turn to alcohol when they’re dealing with an anxiety-inducing or otherwise stressful life event. While alcohol can make an anxious person feel better in the short term, it doesn’t erase the problem that led to them drinking in the first place. As this coping cycle continues, it can eventually snowball into full-blown alcohol abuse. [8] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 2229 wikiHow readers about the most common signs that someone is stressed, and only 6% of them said self-medicating with alcohol or food . [Take Poll] Other signs, like having a quick temper or withdrawing, might be more common."

      "title": "It can lead to depression.",
      "content": "It can lead to depression. Drinking alcohol frequently can lead to negative changes in your daily life, like the loss of a job or the end of a long-term relationship; because of these major changes, depression can develop. From a biological and chemical standpoint, alcohol functions as a depressant, and can negatively impact your brain chemistry in a way that can contribute to depression. [9] X Research source Alcohol can cause certain chemicals in your brain (like serotonin, a feel-good chemical) to not function properly, which contributes to depression. If you’re feeling anxious or depressed while drinking, you might end up making some emotionally-charged statements that you don’t fully understand."

      "title": "It can increase your risk of committing suicide.",
      "content": "It can increase your risk of committing suicide. Alcohol switches off your inhibitions, which typically prevent you from doing or saying anything rash. With these mental barriers out of the way, it’s much simpler for someone to make an impulsive (and permanent) decision based on how they’re feeling in the moment. [10] X Research source According to one study, people with noticeable alcohol struggles were 3 times more likely to take their own life, 2.5 times more likely to have thoughts related to suicide, and 1.5 times more likely to hurt themselves in some way. [11] X Research source After drinking, you might be inclined to act on your feelings of self-harm rather than reaching out and asking for help."

      "content": "It can put a strain on your long-term relationships. The more you drink, the less you’re able to be an active and productive member of your household—over time, this can take a really big toll on your relationships. Alcohol can also put a strain on partnerships in terms of finances since the alcohol-dependent partner often spends a lot of money on drinks. [12] X Research source When you’re drunk around a partner, roommate, or another close relative, it can be easy to say things you don’t mean or utter something that makes the other person uncomfortable."
