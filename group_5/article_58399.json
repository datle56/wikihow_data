      "content": "Set up the game. You will need one standard cup (milk glass will do), some alcohol, cups to put the alcohol in, a table, and a quarter. Players (as many as you would like) sit around the table, either standing or in chairs. The milk glass is placed in the center of the table, at least 10 inches away from each player. Each person gets their own cup, filled with the alcohol of their choosing. Beer is usually used rather than hard liquor. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Take turns shooting. Players take turns shooting, generally proceeding counterclockwise around the table. The objective is to bounce the quarter off of the table, into the milk glass at the center of the table. If the quarter lands in the glass, then the shooter chooses any player in the game to take a drink from his or her own beverage. The shooter's turn doesn't end until he or she misses.

      "title": "Play \"chance\" during the game.",
      "content": "Play \"chance\" during the game. After a miss, the shooter passes the quarter to the next player. Sometimes, after a miss, the shooter can opt to play \"chance\", which gives them another attempt. All that is required of this is for the shooter to say the word \"chance\" after a miss. A successful \"chance\" shot means the shooter can continue shooting normally, but a miss results in a penalty drink. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Make up rules as you go along. The great thing about quarters is that there is a great deal of replay value. If the shooter hits three in a row, he or she is allowed to make up a rule. Rules should be creative and fun, and can involve performing a ritual when drinking, or prohibiting the use of certain common words. A player who breaks any of the rules must take a penalty drink. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source As the game progresses and the players become inebriated, the many rules often prove difficult to remember. The objective of the game is not to be a stickler however, but to enjoy the game and have fun. Some examples of made-up rules include, but are not limited to: banning the word \"drink,\" have a drink before each attempted shot, no use of proper names, etc."

If the shooter misses again, he or she must take a drink for each challenging player, but if the shooter gets it in the glass all challengers must drink. However, the shooter does not have to accept the initial challenge, and can instead choose to pass the coin on to the next shooter. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

If a player misses, the player must quickly try again. As soon as a player gets their quarter into the cup, they pass the quarter and the cup to the player on their right. If a player shoots the quarter into the cup on the first try, then he may pass it to any player at the table. [14] X Research source"

If a player ever has both quarters at the same time, then that player is the loser. The player who passes the second cup to the opponent with the other cup is said to have \"screwed\" the loser. [15] X Research source However, it is not good enough to simply pass the cup to the opponent with the other cup. You must stack the cup inside your opponent's cup. This action serves to prevent the loser from attempting another shot, since oftentimes the loser is unaware that their opponent has \"screwed\" them."

If the loser misses, he or she must drink the penalty beverage, which is often a shot or a large portion (perhaps all) of an alcoholic drink. If the loser makes the final shot, then the tables have been turned on the other players. [16] X Research source Some rules insist that all other players take penalty drinks, others require only the player who \"screwed\" the loser to drink. Sometimes the player who \"screwed\" the loser is given a single shot just like the loser had, and the two take turns shooting until someone misses. Another option for the penalty beverage is that the player who \"screwed\" the loser is allowed to spin a quarter, and the loser has to drink a beer or a mixed drink for as long as the quarter remains standing. In the case where the loser makes the final shot, she must then spin a quarter and everyone else drinks for as long as the loser allows it to spin."
