      "content": "Water keeps your nasal passages moist, easing any congestion. Women should have 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of water daily, and men should get 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water. You can get about 20% of that from food, but the rest should come from drinks. Have at least eight glasses of water daily to help drain the fluids from your nose. You’ll feel better when your body is hydrated! [1] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If you’re sick, you may need even more water to keep your body hydrated while fighting the illness. Keep a water bottle with you throughout the day to ensure water is always on hand when needed."

      "content": "The steam from the tea can open and decongest your nasal passages. Herbal tea is also helpful because it hydrates you (like water does), so the tea can moisten your nose while the steam clears all the mucus out of it. Brew a cup of hot herbal tea and drink it, breathing in steam from the cup as you drink. After finishing the cup, try blowing your nose gently. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Some herbal tea has properties as a decongestant. Mint, chamomile, and ginger teas are all especially effective at clearing a runny nose. If you have a sore throat, add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey to your tea. Honey has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe your throat."

      "content": "Capsaicin is a natural chemical that is effective at clearing your sinuses. If your runny nose is caused by congestion, add a small amount of spice with capsaicin to your meal, or simply order a spicy dish you enjoy. As you eat and your nose runs more, grab a tissue and blow the mucus out. The heat from capsaicin loosens the mucus in your nose, making it easier to clear away. [3] X Research source Look for spices like cayenne pepper, horseradish, ginger, wasabi, and habanero—all of which contain capsaicin and would be highly effective at clearing your nose."

      "content": "A facial steam loosens the mucus in your nose, making it easier to clear. It’s a quick method of clearing up a runny nose; simply fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Then, sit next to the pot and lean over it so the steam rises directly towards your face. Drape a towel over your head and take several deep breaths, breathing in the water vapors for 5 to 10 minutes until you feel better. [4] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You could also add essential oils to the water; peppermint, pine, sage, spearmint, tea tree, and eucalyptus all have decongestant properties. Add 1 drop of oil per 1 cup (240 mL) of water. [5] X Research source Repeat the facial steam 2 to 4 times each day as needed, and be careful not to get too close to the steam; it could burn your nasal passages."

      "content": "Like facial steams, a hot shower helps clear mucus from your sinuses. Take a long, hot shower and inhale the steam deeply to loosen the mucus in your nose. After about 10 minutes of showering, try to blow your nose gently and clear out some of the snot. Face away from the water while taking deep breaths to ensure you don’t accidentally inhale any water! [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you’re not in the mood for a full shower, you can always turn on the shower and close all doors and windows in the bathroom, so steam builds up rapidly. Sit in your bathroom, breathing deeply until your sinuses clear."

      "content": "A warm, wet washcloth compress eases the pressure in your sinuses. Run a washcloth under hot (but not boiling) tap water until it’s entirely saturated. Wring out the washcloth until it’s damp (but still warm) and place it over your forehead and nose like a compress. Leave the washcloth for 15 to 20 minutes, allowing the warmth to increase circulation in your sinuses while the moisture loosens mucus. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Repeat the process and reapply the warm washcloth if your runny nose persists. Alternatively, you could wet the washcloth, wring it out, then stick it in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds until it’s warm."

Fill your neti pot with warm saline solution, bend your head sideways over the sink and place the spout in your upper nostril. Pour the saline solution into your nostril and let it safely run out through your other nostril before repeating from the other side of your nose. [8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Use distilled or sterile water to make the saline solution.

      "title": "Saline nasal spray",
      "content": "Saline nasal spray naturally irrigates your nose and clears out mucus. Choose a gentle saline spray for congested or runny noses and use it 3-4 times per day as needed. Hold a nostril shut and place the tip of the spray bottle into the open one, inhaling as you squeeze the bottle lightly. Saline rinse washes away bacteria, allergens, viruses, and excess mucus in your sinuses. [9] X Research source Saline spray is easy to find and inexpensive, but you can also make your own saline spray at home with salt, baking soda, and warm water. Avoid using a nasal spray for more than 5 days, as this can cause congestion to return. Talk to your doctor about other solutions if your runny nose lasts longer."

      "content": "Humidifiers moisten the air, reducing mucus buildup in your nose. It transforms water into vapor and releases that vapor into the air for you to breathe in. Invest in a cool-mist humidifier and set it up in your bedroom (or whichever room you’ll be in most often for the time being). Spend time in the same area as your humidifier and breathe the moisturized air deeply. [10] X Research source Make sure you clean your humidifier to prevent mold and bacteria from growing inside it. Read the manufacturer’s instructions for your humidifier, so you know how often to clean it! If your runny nose is seasonal, caused by cold and dry air in the winter, a humidifier is a great long-term solution to fight congestion."

      "content": "Blowing mucus from 1 nostril at a time clears your nose more effectively. Grab a tissue and hold it to your face. While holding one nostril softly closed, blow the other gently into your tissue. Do the same for your other nostril to fully cleanse it and breathe normally (or through your mouth) throughout the process. [11] X Research source If your nose is extremely runny, rip a tissue in half, roll the pieces into 2 small balls, and place one in each nostril to stop the flow of mucus. Use moisturizing tissues to blow your nose if you can, so the skin beneath your nose doesn’t become irritated. If you blow your nose too hard, mucus might get pushed further into your sinuses."

A runny nose is a common symptom of allergies, which can be caused by many different irritants, such as pollen, pet dander, dust mites, or foods. Notice if your nose starts to run more around certain materials, and avoid those irritants as much as possible.

      "content": "Sleep will help you get better fast if your runny nose is caused by a cold. Get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, and take naps during the day whenever you need one. When you lie down to rest, prop your head up on a couple of pillows to encourage the fluids in your nose to drain naturally. When your upper back and head are elevated, it’s also easier to breathe while you rest. [13] X Research source You could also apply nasal strips , as they ease congestion and make breathing easier. Simply place one over the bridge of your nose before going to sleep. Though nasal strips are usually used at night, you could apply them during the day if needed."

      "content": "Decongestant medication soothes both a runny and stuffed-up nose. The medication you take will vary based on the cause of your runny nose. If you have a cold, take cold medicine designed to alleviate congestion. If you have allergies, take an antihistamine instead. For any other kind of runny nose, use a simple over-the-counter decongestant to relieve your symptoms. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cedars Sinai Hospital Website of one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common antihistamines include Benadryl and Zyrtec. Popular decongestants include Sudafed and Vicks Sinex. Cold medicine alleviates other cold symptoms beyond the runny nose. Take cold medicine (like DayQuil or Theraflu) if you need to treat a cough, fever, aches, sore throat, or other symptoms. Only use a decongestant for 2 to 3 days. If overused, decongestants can cause congestion to return even more severely."
