      "content": "Yes, plenty of girls like guys with long hair! Of course, what a woman finds attractive is all personal preference—not all women will like a guy with long hair, but there are plenty out there who will. Interestingly, though, one study suggests that more conservative women prefer men with short hair, and more liberally-minded women prefer long hair. [1] X Research source Just keep in mind that since long hair on a guy isn’t the norm, it’s also pretty polarizing! Women tend to either love it or hate it, with not much middle ground. On a related note, research suggests that guys find long hair on women just as attractive as short, but for different reasons. Long-haired women are generally seen as healthier, while short-haired women are seen as more honest. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Long hair can make you seem more masculine or mature.",
      "content": "Long hair can make you seem more masculine or mature. One college survey of people ages 15-25 found that the majority of participants said that long hair on a man makes him look more masculine. [3] X Research source This is likely because a good, thick head of hair suggests “good genes,” or suggests that a guy is less likely to lose his hair as he ages. Of course, a bald dome is its own look, and studies show that women also tend to find bald men masculine and attractive. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Long hair can make you seem more confident or edgy.",
      "content": "Long hair can make you seem more confident or edgy. Short hair is the norm for men in most cultures. [5] X Research source So wearing your hair long instantly makes you stand out, and being willing to stand out can signal your own self-confidence or willingness to be a bit different, which some women find super attractive. Standing out also means you’re more likely to catch a girl’s eye, which puts you on her radar more easily than having average, short hair."

      "title": "Long hair sometimes suggests more sensitivity or creativity.",
      "content": "Long hair sometimes suggests more sensitivity or creativity. Standing out with long hair can also make you seem more expressive and willing to ignore societal norms in order to be your true self, which is its own kind of attractive. It’s also associated with artistic and “hippie” movements of years past, which can lend you a creative, open-minded vibe that short hair can’t."

      "title": "She might want to play with or talk to you about your hair.",
      "content": "She might want to play with or talk to you about your hair. Any long-haired guy knows that girls love to play with it, style it, or just run their fingers through it. It’s a sort of novelty, after all. Plus, plenty of girls will appreciate having a partner who understands how much care and effort it takes to maintain long hair, and might even want to swap tips and advice."

      "title": "Long hair can show that you’re able to commit.",
      "content": "Long hair can show that you’re able to commit. It take a long time to grow out your hair , and it’s not always easy. There’s an awkward stage in the middle, and then once it’s long, there’s all the maintenance and upkeep. Which is why having long hair can signal that you’re down to put in the effort it takes to get what you want, and that you’re not afraid to commit—to both hair and a romantic relationship. On the other hand, if you don’t groom and maintain your hair, it might come off as a sign of laziness, rather than commitment. An intentional style and proper care is key!"

      "title": "Long hair can make a guy look more feminine.",
      "content": "Long hair can make a guy look more feminine. We know that we said some women think a guy’s long hair is masculine, but other women think the opposite. Long hair is a trademark “feminine” trait, after all. [6] X Research source Some women prefer men who are more clearly masculine, and who don’t rock the boat in terms of gender appearances. Of course, this varies by culture. Plenty of cultures flip the script of long hair and masculinity, with long-haired men being the norm."

      "title": "Long hair can make you seem a little high-maintenance.",
      "content": "Long hair can make you seem a little high-maintenance. Any long-haired girl knows that there’s a price for beauty, and some women don’t want to have to deal with their guy going through the same hair-care routines that they do. For one, it means sharing hair products and bathroom space, but it also might suggest a little bit of vanity, if you’re always brushing and preening your male mane."

      "title": "Some girls don’t want their man to have better hair than them.",
      "content": "Some girls don’t want their man to have better hair than them. Many women put a lot of effort into making their hair look good, and if you’re standing next to her with hair that’s on par (or better) than hers, all that effort gets outshined, and for some women, that’s a dealbreaker."

      "title": "Long hair takes more work.",
      "content": "Long hair takes more work. First there’s growing it out and getting through the awkward stages. Then, there’s all the upkeep. You’ll have to shampoo and condition regularly, and more intensely than before, and also keep it brushed and tidy so that it doesn’t tangle and mat. There’s not much point in having long hair if you don’t keep it looking healthy and attractive! Taking care of long hair can add hours to your morning and evening routine each week. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into."

      "content": "You’ll probably be wearing it up more often than you think. What they don’t tell you about long hair is that it gets in the way. A lot. If it’s not tied up, it will get in your face. Some men are disappointed when they realize they grew out their long, lustrous hair only to keep it up in a bun most of the time. [7] X Research source Of course, a bun, braid, or other updos on a man can also be super attractive in their own right."

      "title": "Long hair isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.",
      "content": "Long hair isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. We’ve already talked about it, but it’s worth reiterating: Many women are turned off by guys with long hair, for various reasons. If your goal is to attract as many girls as possible, shorter hair will cast your net wider. But the girls who like long hair tend to really like long hair, so if you’re confident and ready, we say go for it! This is also true of your career! Creative fields are more open to long hair on men, but more formal professions, like office jobs, may have other standards. In any case, presentation is crucial. People are more open to longer hair on men if it’s well-kept and intentionally styled."

      "title": "Long hair may not suit your personal style.",
      "content": "Long hair may not suit your personal style. At least, not if you aren’t careful. If your style leans more casual or loungey, long hair might have the unfortunate effect of making you look sloppy. On the other hand, if your style is ultra-formal, long hair might clash a bit. And while long hair works with any face shapes, the same isn’t true for every style of long hair. Consider these factors before you set off on your long-hair journey! For example, long hair can lengthen rounder faces, which is great! But it can also make long faces seem even longer, which may not be as flattering. At the end of the day, it’s all about confidence! If you feel good wearing long hair, then you probably look good, as well."

      "content": "If you’re balding, you might consider chopping it all off, instead. One study shows that men who shaved their heads were often seen as stronger, more dominant, and even taller than men with full heads of hair. It also suggests that for someone with thinning hair or a receding hairline, shaving your head can make you more attractive to others. [8] X Research source Don’t fight it; own it!"

      "content": "Choose the look that makes you happy, not what makes others happy. At the end of the day, it’s your body and your hair, and if you have your heart set on growing it out, or are even just curious, why not go for it? The great thing about long hair is that if you ever get tired of it, you can just chop it off and be back to normal in a few minutes."
