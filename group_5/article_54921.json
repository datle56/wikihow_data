      "content": "Rub a generous amount of salt into the stain. The salt will dry the stain and leach the red wine from the couch. Vacuum up the salt once it’s dry⁠—you can even let it sit to the next day. You can repeat this method as needed. [1] X Research source The salt method tends to work better on fresh stains. Make sure to blot up or flush the wet stain with cool water before applying the salt ⁠—this will help the salt sink in better. Patch-test this solution on an inconspicuous part of the couch first to avoid any possible damage."

      "title": "Baking soda can assist in cleaning the stain.",
      "content": "Baking soda can assist in cleaning the stain. It works similarly to salt, as it is a dry substance that can help leach the red wine from the couch. Rub a generous amount of baking soda into the stain and leave it alone to let it settle in. The next day—or once it’s dry—vacuum up the baking soda. Repeat this method as needed. [2] X Research source You can either apply just baking soda or make a paste. To make a paste, mix 1 part baking soda with 3 parts water."

      "title": "White vinegar is a good cleaning agent for wine.",
      "content": "White vinegar is a good cleaning agent for wine. This is because it removes the acidic portion of the wine. You can make a paste by combining 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar with 1/4 cup (57.6 grams) of baking soda. Rub the paste thoroughly into the stain and allow it to settle in.0 4/24/24 Vacuum up the salt once it’s dry⁠, or on the next day. [3] X Research source If you don’t have baking soda, you can replace it with salt!"

      "content": "Dishwashing liquid is an effective detergent that can carry away the acid. Just combine 0.5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of liquid dishwashing detergent with 2 cups (470 mL) of water. Apply the solution to a sponge and soak the stain with it. Then, blot up the stain before sponging again with cool water and blotting dry. [4] X Research source Though this method is liquid based, you will still want to blot up the wet stain before applying the detergent."

      "title": "Combine dishwashing liquid with hydrogen peroxide for extra potency.",
      "content": "Combine dishwashing liquid with hydrogen peroxide for extra potency. This combination is easy to make: mix 3 parts of hydrogen peroxide with 1 part dishwashing liquid and apply it to the stain. Let it sit for up to an hour, and then wipe it up with a cloth or paper towel. The stain may wash out more easily after this. [5] X Research source Because hydrogen peroxide is a powerful and corrosive chemical, handle it with care and wear gloves! Hydrogen peroxide is also a mild bleach, so perform a patch test on an inconspicuous area of the couch first if possible. Check to make sure that the fabric doesn’t fade."

Then blot it up, and repeat as needed until the stain is lighter or gone. Make sure to dry the area completely to prevent any water damage or streaking. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide has bleaching properties, which can help lift the color. Mix together 2 parts club soda and 1 part hydrogen peroxide to boost stain removal. First, spray or apply the hydrogen peroxide over the stain. Then, sprinkle the baking soda on top. Let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing it off. [7] X Research source Consider performing a patch test on a more hidden area of the couch. If your couch is made of silk, use hydrogen peroxide as a last resort, as silk is an especially delicate fabric. [8] X Research source"

If you are able to remove the couch covers or upholstery, launder the fabric. Otherwise, let it air dry. [9] X Research source Patch-test a hidden area of the couch first."
