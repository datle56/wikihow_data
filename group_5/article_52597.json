      "title": "Colorful puddles",
      "content": "Colorful puddles If there’s a hole or crack in your radiator, hoses, or reservoir tank, look beneath your car for any colorful puddles. Coolant, or antifreeze , can leave behind a green, blue, pink, orange, or yellow puddle. Automotive repair specialist Duston Maynes recommends promptly bringing your vehicle to the shop for a leak, as it can be the beginning of something more severe. It can help to leave a large piece of paper or cardboard beneath your vehicle overnight to catch the leak."

      "title": "Burnt, sweet smell",
      "content": "Burnt, sweet smell When the engine temperature increases, you may notice a sweet smell coming from beneath the hood after shutting the vehicle off. This is the coolant “burning off” after use. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Overheating engine",
      "content": "Overheating engine When the coolant levels drop too low, the engine cannot effectively cool down quickly, leading to overheating. On your vehicle’s dashboard, pay attention to the temperature gauge. In most vehicles, it will be a small gauge with C for “Cold” and H for “Hot.” Over time, the engine may release heavy steam and a sweet, burnt smell. [3] X Research source Left unaddressed, it can cause serious damage and engine failure—putting yourself and other drivers at risk. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect the bottom of your radiator to identify a leak.",
      "content": "Inspect the bottom of your radiator to identify a leak. You'll need to locate the leak first to determine how bad a coolant leak is. Inspect the bottom of the radiator and check the radiator itself, the hose, the drain valve, and the reservoir. Look for a slow drip from one of these places. Additionally, you can park your vehicle on top of cardboard and wait for the leak to drip. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a hand pump or compressed air to pressurize the cooling system.",
      "content": "Use a hand pump or compressed air to pressurize the cooling system. Alternatively, you can detect an engine coolant leak by pressurizing the cooling system. Get a hand pump or compressed air , then remove the radiator cap. Plug the overflow valve, fill the system with air, and monitor the gauge for any pressure loss. [6] X Research source Pressure loss indicates there’s a leak."

      "title": "Add a UV dye to the coolant system to locate the leak.",
      "content": "Add a UV dye to the coolant system to locate the leak. Start with a cool engine and remove the radiator cap. If your coolant level is at the maximum fill line, you may want to remove a small amount to make room for the UV dye. Add the dye to the radiator and top it off with water. Run the engine for 15 minutes so the dye can circulate through the system. Afterward, use a UV flashlight to inspect the engine. Leaks will show as a bright green or yellow stain.

      "title": "Replace the leaky radiator cap to secure the seal.",
      "content": "Replace the leaky radiator cap to secure the seal. Radiators are pressurized, so when a cap is loose, it can cause the coolant to escape. Allow your vehicle to cool down before locating the radiator cap on top of the radiator. Unscrew the cap with your hand. Look for signs of damage, cracks, or corrosion. Purchase a matching radiator cap and screw it on. [8] X Research source Cost of Repair: A cap replacement can range between $13 to $40. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply an epoxy resin to minor holes or cracks to seal a leak.",
      "content": "Apply an epoxy resin to minor holes or cracks to seal a leak. If you notice a crack in the radiator, its hoses, or the expansion tank, this can prevent the radiator from effectively cooling the engine. Inspect your radiator for any visible cracks, holes, or corrosion. Apply a bead of epoxy-resin resealer directly to the crack or hole. [10] X Research source This should only be a temporary measure, according to Maynes. Relying on a sealant can cause a clog in the process, and it’s best to refer to a professional. Cost of Repair: A leaking radiator can range between $700 and $1,000, depending on the repair, vehicle make and model, and the radiator type. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Dislodge the bolts from the water pump to replace it.",
      "content": "Dislodge the bolts from the water pump to replace it. Water pumps circulate the coolant through the engine to prevent it from overheating. Locate the pump beneath the lower part of the engine, near the drive belts. Look for signs of cracks, holes, or corrosion. To fix a water pump, detach the negative battery line before removing the radiator cap and emptying the radiator of its liquids. Detach the radiator hoses, belts, and fan shroud using a wrench. Apply an industrial cleaning solution to the pump and apply a gasket sealant before replacing the water pump. Cost of Repair: A repair or water pump replacement can range from $400 to $1,000.

      "title": "Add more coolant to the reservoir tank if your engine is overheating.",
      "content": "Add more coolant to the reservoir tank if your engine is overheating. Immediately turn your vehicle off in a safe location and avoid driving. Inspect the coolant levels under the vehicle's hood. On the side of the coolant reservoir, check that the coolant is between the “low” and “full” marks. Add more coolant to see if this helps. If not, seek the assistance of a professional to diagnose the problem. [13] X Research source Cost of Repair: Engine-related issues can run anywhere from $100 to $8,000 depending on the issue and vehicle make and model. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase replacement head gaskets to seal the combustion chamber. Head gaskets help keep oil and coolant from mixing, but when there’s a leak, it can prevent your car from starting correctly. [15] X Research source To replace the gasket, clean the surface to remove any rust or debris in contact with the new heads. Carefully position the new head gasket and press down to fit it in. Install new bolts so you have a snug fit. [16] X Research source Cost of Repair: A blown head gasket replacement can run between $1,000 to $2,000, depending on the complexity of the engine.

      "content": "No—avoid driving until you can have your vehicle inspected. If you suspect your vehicle is leaking coolant, locate the leak first to determine its severity. If it’s a slow leak, drive to your local mechanic for an inspection. However, if it leaks too much, Maynes recommends towing your vehicle to avoid overheating the engine."

      "title": "Drain, refill, or flush the coolant as the manufacturer recommends.",
      "content": "Drain, refill, or flush the coolant as the manufacturer recommends. At some point, you’ll need to change your coolant. On average, most people opt for a simple refill. But, for older vehicles, the coolant should be drained or flushed every 2 to 3 years, or around 60,000 miles. Coolant can last up to 5 years, or 100,000 miles for modern vehicles. Refer to your vehicle’s owner manual for the manufacturer’s recommendation for coolant changes. [18] X Research source Change your coolant when you notice a change in the color or constancy of the cool, a sweet, strong smell from the engine compartment, or if the engine temperature increases."

      "title": "Inspect coolant levels every 3 to 6 months.",
      "content": "Inspect coolant levels every 3 to 6 months. To keep your vehicle in tip-top shape, look to the coolant levels every 3 to 6 months to see if it needs to be topped off or drained. Look at the overflow tank next to the radiator and ensure it reaches the fill line outside the reservoir. If it’s beneath the low line, use a funnel to add more coolant in. [19] X Research source Coolant should be flushed when it’s brownish or colorless. Healthy coolant will be green, blue, yellow, or red."
