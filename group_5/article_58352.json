      "title": "Get to the golf course.",
      "content": "Get to the golf course. The only golf course in the game is the Los Santos Golf Club located in the Richman District. To get there, take Route 18 from Vinewood (center of the map) and head west. Keep driving for a few miles and you should see the golf course on the left side of the road."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter the golf course.",
      "content": "Enter the golf course. Park your car and enter through the front entrance of the course. A menu window will appear on the top left corner of the game screen. Press the “Select” button to choose “Start Game” to begin. Playing golf costs $100. After paying for the fee, your character will immediately change to his golfing outfit and will be given his own golf cart. (These mechanics are no longer used in game. Golf is now free. Auto-teleporting to each hole in turn. You will also be wearing your street clothes. Very smooth, and efficient.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drive to your first tee.",
      "content": "Drive to your first tee. Drive your golf cart to your first tee marked with a blue icon on the map at the lower right corner of your game screen. Once you get to the tee, get off your car and approach the golf ball you see on the ground. Your character will now get into position."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust your aim.",
      "content": "Adjust your aim. Press the “Aim” button and move it from left to right to adjust it to your desired position. Proper aim allows you to shoot the golf ball to the right hole. Because GTA 5 can be played on PC, PS3/4, and Xbox, the player control varies from one platform to another. Don’t worry, though. A prompt will show on the game screen telling you which button of your controller was set to “Aim,” “Swing,” or “Shot,” so you’d know which one to press."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swing your club.",
      "content": "Swing your club. Once you’ve set the right aim, press the “Swing” button and your character will start swinging his golf club. An intensity bar will also appear right beside your character, letting you gauge the strength of the swing. You’ll see a yellow dot on the intensity bar as your character swings. This yellow dot points out the right strength of swing you need to use for that particular shot you’re making. The closer the intensity bar is filled to the yellow point, the better shot you’re going to make."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot.",
      "content": "Shoot. Once the intensity bar is filled to your desired strength, press the “Shot” button and your character will strike the golf ball, sending it shooting up towards the direction you aimed for. The camera view will also change to focus on the ball so you can watch it as it travels through the air or grass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go to your next tee or to your ball.",
      "content": "Go to your next tee or to your ball. If you didn’t get the ball into the hole, approach it (walk or drive to it), and repeat steps 4 to 6 to take your shot again, until you shoot the ball into the hole. If you did get your ball holed the first time, drive to your next tee and repeat steps 4 to 6 to take the new shot. Repeat these steps until you’ve played to your ninth hole."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete the game.",
      "content": "Complete the game. After your ninth hole, a score card will appear on the screen showing how well you’ve done in the mini-game. If you want to repeat the same golf course set, simply press the “Replay” button. Otherwise, press the “Continue” button to either start a new set or exit the mini-game."
