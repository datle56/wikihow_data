Saddle soap is used to clean and condition different types of leather, and it’s perfect for cleaning shoes. Swirl the cloth in a circular motion to get the best suds. You may need to re-wet your cloth during the process so the soap has enough water to create a lather. If you have a dauber brush, which is a small soap brush often found in leather cleaning kits, you can use it to apply the saddle soap instead of using the cloth. Wet the brush, swirl it in the saddle soap, then buff the brush onto the shoe."
