Label the cheat as “Celebi” in the “Description” box, and then enter 01FB04D2 in the “Code” box. The next Pokémon you encounter in the wild will now be a Celebi! [2] X Research source If this cheat code doesn’t work, try 91FB04D2 instead. Want a shiny Celebi? Enter the code 910730D2 in your cheat console (in addition to the Celebi code that’s already there). The next Pokémon you find should be a shiny Celebi—just keep in mind that the cheat prevents you from being able to run from battle."

Release B + the down arrow (while still pressing SELECT ) and press down on the up and left control pad arrows instead. Let go of SELECT and submit the password you receive from this site ."

Enter the battle and do your best to catch Celebi; if something goes wrong, simply reload your game and try again. Want a shiny Celebi? Keep resetting your game until the Celebi appears light pink when it spawns—that’s how you know it’s shiny. This can take a lot of time and patience, though, so stick with it!"
