You can easily find the length of the segment just by counting how many horizontal spaces it takes up if it's horizontal, and counting how many vertical spaces it takes up if it's vertical. Here's how to do it: [8] X Research source The horizontal line segment with the end points (-3, 4) and (5, 4) is 8 units long. You can find this by counting the spaces it takes up or by adding the absolute values of the x-coordinates: |-3| + |5| = 8 The vertical line segment with the end points (2, 0) and (2, 3) is 3 units long.

Here's how you do it: [10] X Research source To find the midpoint of the points (-3, 4) and (5, 4), just shift over 4 units either from the left or right to reach the middle of the segment. (-3, 4) shifted over 4 x-coordinates is (1, 4). You won't need to change the y-coordinates since you know the midpoint will be on the same y-coordinate as the endpoints. The midpoint of (-3, 4) and (5, 4) is (1, 4). To find the midpoint of the points (2, 0) and (2, 3), just shift over 1.5 units either from the top or bottom to reach the middle of the segment.
