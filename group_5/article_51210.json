[1] X Research source You don’t have to measure the length and width of the deck if you don’t want to cover the entire thing. For example, if you just want to build a square pergola in the middle of a larger deck, you can make it 10 ft (3.0 m) by 10 ft (3.0 m)."

Write down the measurement. [2] X Research source If you want to build a free-standing deck cover, then you don’t need to measure the height of the roof. Make any free-standing structure at least 7 ft (2.1 m) tall so there is plenty of clearance under it."

      "content": "Screw 6 in × 6 in (15 cm × 15 cm) post mounts into each corner of the deck. Use 3 in (7.6 cm) decking screws to secure the post mounts to the deck. Make sure to screw them into the joists underneath the decking and not only into the decking material. [3] X Research source Post mounts are metal brackets that will hold the corner posts of the deck cover vertically. If you plan to attach the deck cover to the side of the home, then you only need 2 post mounts in the outer corners of the deck. If you are making a cover over a concrete patio rather than a deck cover, you will have to bolt the post mounts into the concrete instead of screwing them in place."

You only need 2 corner posts if you are going to attach the deck cover to the side of the home. They will go in the outer corners of the deck."

You will cut out a 2 in (5.1 cm) deep and 8 in (20 cm) long section from this line to the top of the post on just 1 side of the post. Set the depth on your circular saw to 2 in (5.1 cm) and make about 20 cuts right next to each other, starting at the line and going towards the top of the post, then chisel out the skinny pieces. [5] X Research source You could also use a reciprocating saw to cut out the notch in 1 piece by making a 2 in (5.1 cm) cut at the line you marked first, then cutting in from the top of the post."

Orient the posts so that the notches for the cross-beams face inwards towards the center of the deck, or towards the home if you are connecting the cover to the side of it. Get a helper to hold each post in place while you put the screws in. Screw 3 in (7.6 cm) decking screws into the corner posts through the holes in the post mounts using an electric drill. [6] X Research source The number of screws you need depends on how many holes the post mounts have. You will have 4 corner posts if you are making a free-standing patio cover, and only 2 if you are attaching one side of the cover to your home."

[7] X Research source You only need 1 cross-beam if you’re going to attach the deck cover to the side of the home. If you are using 4 corner posts then you need 2 cross-beams. You need to use weather-resistant wood for the posts and cross-beams. Use pressure-treated pine for an affordable option or use cedar if you want a naturally weather-resistant and more beautiful option."

[8] X Research source Screw a 2 in × 6 in (5.1 cm × 15.2 cm) piece of lumber along the whole length of the side of the home if you’re going to attach the patio cover there. You can then nail the joist hangers into place along the board. Never nail joist hangers directly into the side of your home."

Install shingles that match the ones that the home has, such as asphalt shingles , to make the deck cover appear as an extension of the home. [11] X Research source OSB is a type of engineered wood made of compressed layers of wood strands, kind of similar to particle board. This is a good option if you attached the deck cover to the side of the home."

Nail them into place with carpentry nails and a hammer or using a nail gun. Put nails every 16 in (41 cm) or so along each rafter. [13] X Research source This is a nice option if you just want to add some shade to your deck but keep it more open to the air. You can then put planters with vines next to the corner posts and let them grow up the posts and onto the trellis to add some nature to the deck."
