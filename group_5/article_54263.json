      "content": "Find a gap cover that matches your counters and put it between the gaps. Gap covers are long pieces of T-shaped plastic or silicone. To find the perfect gap cover, instructs Shipe, “check your local hardware store or look online for stove or counter gap covers, preferably made of silicone.” [1] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. The bottom part of the T, Shipe goes on to explain, fits into the space between the oven and the counter, while the top of the T sits flat on your stove and counter—no effort needed. [2] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. For a seamless look in your kitchen, find a gap cover that is clear or closely resembles the color of your countertop. You can cut most silicone covers with scissors or a utility knife if your counter depth is shorter than normal. Silicone is the most popular material for oven gaps, but you can find slightly pricier stainless steel covers if you want a more modern look."

      "content": "Measure the size of the gap between your stove and counter. Using a ruler or a tape measure, find the width of the gap so you can choose the right size tubing. Make sure to “measure and cut the plastic tubing to fit the gap” on each side of the stove, advises Shipe, as one side may have more space than the other!

      "title": "Get clear PVC tubing 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) thicker than the gap.",
      "content": "Get clear PVC tubing 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) thicker than the gap. Using a clear tube will make it close to invisible between your counter and stove. Using a slightly thicker tube will create a firm fit without it falling to the floor. While clear tubing is discreet, you can purchase other colors if they better fit the look and style of your kitchen."

      "title": "Push the tubing into the gap until it is level.",
      "content": "Push the tubing into the gap until it is level. Make sure the end of the tube is butting against the wall before securing it. Using your fingers, push the tube into the space between your counter and stove. Keep it flush with the tops of the counter. If you go too far down, crumbs will still fall onto the tubing and be trapped."

      "title": "Cut off excess tubing with a pair of scissors.",
      "content": "Cut off excess tubing with a pair of scissors. Match the length of the tube to the depth of your counter and use shears or scissors to make the cut. After making the cut, use your finger to push any excess tube into the gap until it is level with the countertop. The tubing can be removed and cleaned in a sink of soapy water. Let the tube air dry before putting it back. If it gets dirty or stained, you can replace the tubing entirely."

      "title": "Purchase a roll of plastic T-molding to match the countertop style.",
      "content": "Purchase a roll of plastic T-molding to match the countertop style. Transition molding, or T-molding, is typically used in flooring to cover a gap, but Shipe explains that it’s also a “low-cost alternative” to stove gap fillers—it just “needs to be measured, cut, and placed to fill the gap.” [4] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. T-molding comes in a variety of colors and styles, so buy a set that matches your countertop color. Use clear plastic molding for better flexibility and have a less noticeable cover. You can also use a bolder color to add an accent to your kitchen if you’d like."

      "title": "Cut the molding to the correct length.",
      "content": "Cut the molding to the correct length. Shipe says that you only need to measure from the edge of your counter to the back of the stove. Trim the molding with a utility knife or a pair of molding shears so it fits the length of the gap. [5] X Expert Source Eric Shipe Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021."

      "title": "Create a tighter fit using duct tape, if necessary.",
      "content": "Create a tighter fit using duct tape, if necessary. If the molding fits loosely in the gap, cover the bottom arm with duct tape to make it thicker. Continue to add duct tape until the molding fits snugly in the gap. [6] X Research source The bottom arm of the T-molding refers to the bottom line of its 'T' shape. Test the fit of the T-molding after each layer of tape until it holds firm. Ensure that no part of the tape's adhesive side is exposed."

      "title": "Clean the molding with soapy water when necessary.",
      "content": "Clean the molding with soapy water when necessary. If the molding is too dirty to clean with a dishrag, remove it and let it soak in soapy water. Scrub it with a sponge or dishcloth before letting it air dry. Replace the molding once it has dried. If the molding is stained and cannot be cleaned, repeat the processes to make another cover."

      "content": "Yes, if you want to keep your kitchen clean, gap covers are essential. Those tiny gaps between the stove and the counter are magnets for food crumbs, sauce droplets, and dust. All of that gunk attracts bugs, negatively contributes to the aroma of your home, and makes your kitchen harder to clean. Gap covers prevent all of these issues and really make your kitchen feel cleaner—all for a few dollar's worth of silicone! Some modern stoves actually come with gap covers. If you just moved into a place and saw some T-shaped strips in a counter or cabinet, they’re probably meant to cover the gap in your stove."
