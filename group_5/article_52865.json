      "content": "CTFU means “Cracking the f*ck up” on text and social media. Since “Cracking up” means that you’re laughing (presumably after seeing or hearing something funny), the full phrase “Cracking the f*ck up” expresses laughter and emphasizes that you’re laughing particularly hard or find something very amusing. It’s most commonly used over text and online platforms like Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram. [1] X Research source “That TikTok you sent me was so funny I’m ctfu!! 🤣” “CTFU, my baby niece just threw her cake all over the room! 🍰” CTFU can also be read as “crack the f*ck up,” which means the same thing—it’s just a different way of saying the phrase."

Since it means “Cracking the f*ck up,” sending this acronym to someone (or writing it as a comment on a social media post) makes it pretty clear that they tickled your funny bone! [2] X Research source “Looove the pics you posted! CTFU! 🤣” “OMG please send more pics of your fur baby as soon as possible, I’m ctfu!”"

If you come across something hilarious like a video or meme or just have a silly story to share, send it to a friend and pair it with CTFU. That way, they can see right off the bat that whatever you sent them is intended to make them laugh (and it’s already making you laugh). [3] X Research source For example: “CTFU, my cat just stole a whole chicken nugget!! Sending a pic now 🐈‍⬛” “This video is making me CTFU! Check it out 😂”"

All 3 acronyms are used to express laughter—so if you feel like updating your text slang and using a newer term, try replacing some of those LOLs and ROFLs with CTFU.

You might agree with them to show that you share their amusement or simply bring something else up if the joke is over.

When someone sends you a joke or funny video and adds CTFU to the message, you might echo them and send CTFU in response to show them that you’re laughing too. Alternatively, you could reply with a laughing GIF or emoji (like 🤣 or 😂). Anything that expresses laughter is fair game! Them: “CTFU, this video is gold.

      "content": "CTFU is a strictly casual acronym. It’s inappropriate to use CTFU in formal or professional messages, not only because it has a swear word in it, but also because it’s considered texting slang. In a setting where spelling and grammar are important—particularly when you’re messaging a coworker, boss, or professional acquaintance—it’s a good idea to stick to full words (and clean language) rather than using abbreviations. For example, it’s typically inappropriate to use CTFU in emails to clients or in Instagram posts for an official brand or business account."

Use your best judgment: if the friend you’re messaging doesn’t swear and feels uncomfortable when they see swear words, it’s not a good idea to use CTFU around them. However, if they have no problem when other people swear (even if they don’t), then it’s fine to use CTFU while texting them. It may also be better to avoid CTFU when messaging someone who doesn’t really use text abbreviations or slang altogether since there’s a chance they won’t know what you mean."

It’s the same as saying, “Cheer up,” with the swear word adding extra emphasis. [4] X Research source “Hey, is something up? CTFU!” “Dude, CTFU! You’ve been a grump all day!”"

You might see someone say they’re going to “CTFU at the party,” for example, meaning they’re going to go nuts and have a good time when they arrive. “This song is 🔥🔥🔥 I’m gonna CTFU!!” “I can’t wait for the concert tonight, we’re gonna CTFU in the pit!”"
