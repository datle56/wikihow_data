      "title": "Your freezer doesn't have enough power.",
      "content": "Your freezer doesn't have enough power. Make sure the plug is securely connected to the wall to avoid power disruptions. If the plug isn't all the way in, power can be intermittent, which can cause your freezer not to cool properly. If it is plugged in correctly, unplug it and try plugging something else, like a lamp, into that outlet. You can tell right away if the outlet isn't giving enough power if the lamp doesn't turn on. To fix this, plug your freezer into another outlet. You also may have a power supply problem if the light inside your freezer doesn't turn on whenever you open the doors."

      "content": "Open or cracked doors. Open doors can cause cold air to leak out. In that case, it will seem like your freezer isn't cooling even when the fridge is still cold. Look around the door(s) when you close them to make sure there aren't any open spots."

      "title": "Weak seals.",
      "content": "Weak seals. Weak seals let warm air in, preventing your freezer from cooling. Get a piece of paper and shut the door(s) on it. If you can easily pull the paper away, clean the seals with dish soap and water, then try the paper again. If it's still easy to pull away, the seals are damaged and you can either call for a repair or repair them yourself . In this case, you might think the doors are shut, but the freezer won't stay cold even if everything else seems to be working properly."

      "content": "Outside heat influences. Direct sunlight or being next to heat sources makes it harder for your freezer to cool down. So if it's in direct sunlight or next to a heat source, like an oven, relocate it if you can. Most LG freezers are designed to be used in a temperature-controlled indoor space. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Your freezer isn't set to ideal temps. Ideal temps are −22 °C (−8 °F) (for the freezer). You can set or lower the temperature in different ways according to the freezer model you have. Note that your freezer can take up to 48 hours to cool down to your set temperature. Most modern LG freezers have a Freezer button on the control panel that you can use to adjust the freezer temperature. [2] X Research source The ideal temperatures for an LG freezer may be lower and colder than those for other freezers!"

      "title": "Not enough room to vent heat.",
      "content": "Not enough room to vent heat. Your LG freezer expels heat in order to keep cool. Make sure there's at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of clearance at the top, back, and sides of your freezer. Without that clearance, the expelled heat won't have anywhere to go, and in turn, keep your freezer warmer than it should be."

      "title": "Dirty or frozen condenser coils.",
      "content": "Dirty or frozen condenser coils. If they are dirty or covered in frost, your freezer won't cool. You can find these coils at the back of your freezer. Unplug your freezer from power, pull it out from the wall so you can see the coils, and take the coil cover off. If the coils are covered in frost, leave the freezer powered off to let the ice defrost. Once defrosted, wipe the coils with a clean cloth, then replace the cover, push the unit back into place, and plug it in again. If the coils are dirty, clean them with a soft-bristled brush and a vacuum, then replace the cover, push the unit back into place, and plug it in."

      "content": "A faulty condenser fan. A faulty fan will prevent your freezer from cooling. If you've checked and cleaned dirty or frosted condenser coils, give your freezer about 24-48 hours to cool down and normalize the interior temperature. If it still isn't cooling, you want to check the condenser fan. First, unplug the freezer from power and pull it away from the wall. Find the fan and take the cover off, then manually turn the fan 360 degrees. If anything is preventing the fan from rotating, remove it. If the fan is frosted over, let it defrost. You might need to replace the fan if it still doesn't rotate 360 degrees."

      "title": "Empty freezers are harder to keep cool.",
      "content": "Empty freezers are harder to keep cool. Keep your freezer about 2/3rds full so it has to cool down less whenever you open the doors. Keeping the freezer stocked will help keep the inside cool. Here are some tips for maintaining the food in your freezer: Use sealable and stackable containers. These keep excess moisture down. Avoid putting perishable food in the doors, since this area gets a blast of warm air every time you open the freezer. If you have a lot of open space, fill water bottles to stay within the ⅔ mark.

      "content": "A failing compressor can prevent the freezer from cooling down. The fridge may be working fine, but the freezer won't get cold enough. It's a little more complicated, but you need to: Unplug the fridge/freezer from the wall and pull it out. Locate the compressor. Use a multimeter to test the compressor for continuity. Do this by placing the probes on the electrical pins on the side of the compressor. If you see that the compressor has an open circuit, it's faulty. If you don't see an open circuit, the compressor is working fine."
