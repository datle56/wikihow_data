      "title": "Low engine oil",
      "content": "Low engine oil Engine oil is responsible for keeping the engine components lubricated and cool, but if you’re low on oil the engine’s moving parts will grind and wear on one another as you drive. The faster you go, the more heat this friction produces. Eventually, that friction will create a rattling sensation. [1] X Research source Other Symptoms: The problem is worse when the engine is hot, your engine runs hot, the check engine light comes on, the check oil light comes on, or you see smoke coming out of the engine bay. The Fix: Look under your engine bay for puddles and check your dipstick . If you just happen to be low on oil, add more. If you do have a leak, see a mechanic to have the leak repaired and get an oil change. Estimated Cost: If you do need a mechanic to patch a leak, expect to spend $100-500 depending on which gasket or valve needs to be repaired."

      "title": "Loose serpentine belt",
      "content": "Loose serpentine belt The serpentine belt, also known as a timing belt, is the rubber belt that runs around the pulleys on the side of your engine. It’s responsible for synchronizing the valves, pistons, and crankshaft so that the combustion in the pistons occurs in the proper sequence. If the belt is loose, the engine won’t operate correctly and it could cause the engine to shake and rattle. [2] X Research source Other Symptoms: Your engine misfires, your car starts to seize or stall once you get up to higher speeds, you get poor fuel mileage, or you see fumes and smoke coming from the engine bay. The Fix: If the belt has lost its texture or it’s old, it probably just needs to be replaced , which is a DIY job if you’re handy. Otherwise, see a mechanic to have them readjust the chain tensioner or replace the belt. Estimated Cost: This shouldn’t run more than $50-250 if you have a mechanic do it."

      "title": "Cracked flywheel (manual only)",
      "content": "Cracked flywheel (manual only) The flywheel is a disc that helps rotate the engine when you start the car. After starting, the flywheel is responsible for smoothing the engine out and maintaining rotational momentum when you shift gears. If the flywheel is cracked, it can cause all kinds of stutters and jumps when you accelerate that feel like rattling in the steering wheel. [3] X Research source Other Symptoms: You smell something burning, the shaking gets worse when your transmission tries to shift gears, you struggle to start the engine, and you have trouble operating the clutch. The Fix: See a mechanic to have the flywheel inspected and repaired. Estimated Cost: Accessing the flywheel is relatively complex because it’s usually situated in between the transmission and engine. As a result, it can run $800-2,000 to fix a flywheel."

      "title": "Broken flexplate (automatic only)",
      "content": "Broken flexplate (automatic only) In automatic vehicles, the flexplate serves the same purpose as the flywheel. However, it also joins the torque converter to the transmission to help maintain rotational power in the engine. A broken or misaligned flexplate will cause your engine and transmission to rattle when you accelerate. [4] X Research source Other Symptoms: Your entire vehicle vibrates the faster you go, you hear scratching noises, your engine performance is poor, and your vehicle struggles to shift gears. The Fix: Visit a professional mechanic for flexplate repairs. Estimated Cost: Like flywheel issues, flexplate repairs require a lot of effort. Expect to spend $1,000-3,000 repairing a cracked or damaged flexplate."

      "title": "Loose or cracked engine mount",
      "content": "Loose or cracked engine mount The engine mount is the frame that holds the engine up in your vehicle’s engine bay. If part of the engine mount cracks or breaks, the engine will shake and vibrate when you drive. The faster you go, the more vibration you’ll notice. [5] X Research source Other Symptoms: The check engine light comes on, you hear odd noises coming from the engine bay, the ride generally feels rough, and you keep spurring oil leaks. The Fix: The frame needs to be repaired but this requires a pro. See a mechanic. They’ll remove the engine and fix the frame. Estimated Cost: You’ll likely spend $200-500 fixing a cracked mount."

      "title": "Exhaust system issues",
      "content": "Exhaust system issues Your exhaust system is responsible for safely directing all of the noxious fumes created by your engine out of the vehicle. If one of the exhaust pipes is loose or a clamp holding a pipe in place is broken it can create rattling noises when you drive as the metal components bang against the chassis. [6] X Research source Other Symptoms: You may not have any. If the broken component is causing an emissions leak, you may notice nasty odors or have a check engine light pop on, though. The Fix: If you can get under your vehicle, gently wiggle the pipes and components to look for loose connections and tighten them as needed. If you can’t get under the vehicle, just have a mechanic inspect it. Estimated Cost: It depends on what’s loose, but this shouldn’t run more than $100-200 most of the time."

      "title": "Failing catalytic converter",
      "content": "Failing catalytic converter A bad catalytic converter can cause rattling noises, although you’re unlikely to feel any kind of rattling in your vehicle. The catalytic converter absorbs all of the noxious emissions, but if it’s failing, damaged, or clogged, the emissions can build up in the converter and trigger and kinds of weird noises. [7] X Research source Other Symptoms: You smell rotten eggs, the rattling is present when you idle, your check engine light comes on, and you see smoke coming from the back of the vehicle. The Fix: You likely need a new catalytic converter. See a professional mechanic. Estimated Cost: Catalytic converters are expensive unfortunately, so you may need to spend up to $3,000 on a new converter."

      "title": "Loose heat shield",
      "content": "Loose heat shield Your vehicle has multiple heat shields. They’re basically panels that surround components that get extremely hot to prevent them from damaging other components or starting fires. If a heat shield is loose, it may bang against the component it’s protecting and cause a rattling noise. [8] X Research source Other Symptoms: In fringe cases, your engine may overheat. You’re unlikely to notice any other symptoms, though. The Fix: Heat shields are essential for the safety of your vehicle, so see a professional mechanic to ensure any loose heat shields are safely secured. Estimated Cost: This shouldn’t cost more than $100-150 if a heat shield is just loose. If it needs to be replaced, it may run $150-300."
