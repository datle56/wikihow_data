[2] X Expert Source Leela Fazzuoli & Daniele Cavallo Professional Latin Dance Instructors Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. Place your feet shoulder width apart to get a good, strong stance. Then, lift your toes and move them slightly to the left. To get even more balance, put your left foot about a half-step in front of your right one. [3] X Research source The body roll can be done to either direction, so you can also angle to the right and put your right foot forward."

      "title": "Start off by imagining that a hoop is floating in front of you.",
      "content": "Start off by imagining that a hoop is floating in front of you. The imaginary hoop should be about the size of your head and shoulders. Picture it hanging right in front of your face. You’ll use this imaginary hoop to get down the basics of the body roll. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put your head then shoulders through the imaginary hoop.",
      "content": "Put your head then shoulders through the imaginary hoop. In a smooth motion, move your head forward. Follow your head with your chest. Both should now have gone “through” the hoop. [5] X Research source This movement should be fluid. If it feels jerky, keep practicing until you’ve smoothed it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Come back over the top of the imaginary hoop.",
      "content": "Come back over the top of the imaginary hoop. Now, lean back with your head and upper body. Imagine that you’re lifting your head and chest over the top of the hoop. This will make your torso jut forward a bit, which is the next element of the body roll. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sit down to pop out your butt at the end.",
      "content": "Sit down to pop out your butt at the end. The last movement is the only one that should be a little abrupt. Once you’ve leaned back enough that the roll has traveled down the length of your torso, make a sitting motion. Don’t forget to stick your booty out! That’s a key part of the body roll, and it means you’ve completed the move. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Reverse the direction to roll back up.",
      "content": "Reverse the direction to roll back up. Push your hips forward to start. Follow through by pushing the rest of your body forward, starting with your belly, then your chest and shoulders, and finally your head. This, too, should be a fluid movement. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stand up to repeat a downward body roll.",
      "content": "Stand up to repeat a downward body roll. If you want to go right back into another downward body roll, stand up after you’ve popped your booty out. Then, repeat the movement by starting with your head again. This lets you do lots of body rolls continuously. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put the movement together and add music.",
      "content": "Put the movement together and add music. To help you move to the music, connect your body roll to a rhythm. Use a 4-count rhythm by moving your head on beat 1, your chest on beat 2, your belly on beat 3, and your hips on beat 4. Now turn on your favorite song and match your body roll to the music! [10] X Research source Most hip hop songs use a 4/4 or 4/8 time signature, meaning that the music can be easily counted in beats of 4 or 8."

[11] X Expert Source Leela Fazzuoli & Daniele Cavallo Professional Latin Dance Instructors Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. If you belong to a gym, you’re sure to see a wide variety of dance options on the list of aerobic exercise classes. Zumba instructors, who use Latin and international dance moves to create a high-energy, intense cardio workout, will certainly sprinkle a few body rolls into their routines. You should also be prepared to do this move in a hip hop or Jazzercise class. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Move only your shoulders and torso for less intensity.",
      "content": "Move only your shoulders and torso for less intensity. The first few times you do a dance workout, it’ll probably be pretty tough. Before working on the roll itself, work on specific isolations for that area. [13] X Expert Source Leela Fazzuoli & Daniele Cavallo Professional Latin Dance Instructors Expert Interview. 7 October 2021. Keep your body rolls simple by moving fewer body parts. The less you move, the easier it’ll be. [14] X Research source So instead of starting by moving your head, you’ll begin the roll with your shoulders. While you can still end with a little booty pop, your main focus should be on moving your torso. This will concentrate the workout in your abs."

      "title": "Lift your arms as you go down to add an arm workout.",
      "content": "Lift your arms as you go down to add an arm workout. Just as moving less lowers the intensity, moving more amps it up. As you roll down, pick your arms up so they go above your head. Continue to raise and lower them each time you do a new body roll. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a lunge to work your glutes and hamstrings.",
      "content": "Add a lunge to work your glutes and hamstrings. In order to do this combination, exaggerate the start and finish of the body roll. So, rather than just putting one foot farther forward than the other, do a half-lunge by lowering your body over your front foot. Once you’ve done the body roll from this position, sink down into a full lunge by making a 90 degree angle with your front thigh and calf. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay in a squat throughout the body roll for a tougher workout.",
      "content": "Stay in a squat throughout the body roll for a tougher workout. Place your feet slightly farther than shoulder width apart. Your legs should form an upside-down “V.” Squat by lowering your body down and bending your knees. Now execute the body roll and booty pop. It’ll be harder to stay balanced and controlled from this position, so start slow! [17] X Research source Your feet should still be angled outwards slightly. Don’t angle them in the same direction, however. Move your right foot out to the right and your left foot out to the left. This will help you balance."

      "content": "Count out your dance with beats. Each of your steps corresponds with a beat. Counting these beats out will help you learn the dance at your own pace. Start without music so you can move as slowly as you want from beat to beat. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Move your left leg out and roll your hips in a counterclockwise circle. Once you’ve brought your feet back together for the second time, go right into the booty roll by moving your left leg out so your feet end up shoulder width apart. Then, move your hips to the left, back, to the right, forward, and end at the left again. [20] X Research source The booty roll doesn’t need to be counted out. Instead, make the roll smooth and fluid."

      "title": "Bring your right leg together with your left to start more sidesteps.",
      "content": "Bring your right leg together with your left to start more sidesteps. Once you’ve finished the booty roll, move your right left so that your feet are next to each other again. This will allow you to do 2 more sidesteps to the right. Remember to count these out by starting with 1 and ending with 4. [21] X Research source"
