Class A fire extinguishers can be used for trash, wood, and paper fires. Class B fire extinguishers can be used for flammable liquids, such as oil or grease. Class C fire extinguishers can be used for electrical fires. Class D fire extinguishers can be used for fires involving combustible metals, such as magnesium or sodium. Class K fire extinguishers can be used for cooking fires. Most fire extinguishers in use are rated for class A, B, and C fires."

Rinse it out with the hose when it's cooled down to keep the mess from stinking up your kitchen. Make sure you put on a heating pad or oven mitt first before trying to grab the handle."

You can use the lid method, or use a slightly damp towel to smother the fire, but usually the safest and quickest (though not cleanest) method is to sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda or salt onto the grease to quickly absorb it and eliminate the fire at the source. [2] X Research source You should also feel free to use a fire extinguisher on grease fires. It works particularly well. Stand at a safe distance from the grease and activate the extinguisher. Avoid using water or flour on grease fires. Flour can ignite, making the fire worse, and—since water doesn't mix with oil—water can cause the oil to spray elsewhere, throwing flaming oil onto other nearby surfaces. [3] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Make sure the fire pit is of an appropriate size and of good quality before building your fire. Consider reinforcing pre-made metal pits by piling up dirt or rock to keep the fire housed safely and burning properly. Do NOT burn glass, aluminum cans, or any kind of pressurized aerosol. These objects won't burn and will be extraordinarily dangerous when they heat up.

If you're ready to call it a night, spread the embers out as thinly as possible and then stop stirring the fire, letting it slowly die down.

[9] X Research source Use heavy equipment, if available, to create a larger firebreak if the situation warrants it.

Use buckets, pots, or other containers to carry water to the blaze if no other fire fighting equipment is available, and a stream or pond, or other source of water is nearby. If you're close enough to the brush to use a hose, take advantage of the water as soon as possible. Try to control the burn by wetting the ground in front of the direction the fire might be traveling. If it's blowing in a particular direction, watch the wind to anticipate it's motion and cut it off at the pass."
