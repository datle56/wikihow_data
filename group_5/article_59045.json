      "content": "Ask your dermatologist about microdermabrasion . If you have a lot of blackheads that aren't responding to skin care products, talk with the dermatologist about microdermabrasion.

      "content": "Wash and moisturize your hair before you wash your back. If you usually wash your back before shampooing and conditioning your hair, switch your routine. Tilt your head to the side as you rinse shampoo and moisturizer from your hair. This will help the residual hair product drain down your side instead of down your back. Then you can wash your back so it's completely clean. [8] X Research source Your blackhead treatments will be more effective if your skin is clean and free from oily shampoo residue."

      "content": "Apply a mask product to your back once a week. Take a shower and wash your back thoroughly. Then turn off the water and rub the mask over your back. Let the mask sit on your skin for 10 minutes so the ingredients can work their way into your pores. Rinse the mask off and pat your skin dry. To lock in moisture, rub a moisturizer designed for your skin type onto your back after you dry off. For example, if you have sensitive skin, choose a gentle moisturizer that doesn't contain fragrance."
