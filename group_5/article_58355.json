      "content": "Gather and shuffle together a 52-card deck for each player at the table. Hand and foot is played with 4-6 players. Add a full deck of cards to the game for each player at the table (e.g. if you’re playing with 4 players, use 4 decks), then shuffle together all the decks to make 1 large deck. [1] X Research source This large deck is referred to as the “stock.” Since Hand and Foot is played with many cards at once, start by shuffling each deck independently. Then, shuffle 2 decks together, divide the 2 shuffled decks in half, and shuffle them with other shuffled decks to thoroughly mix up the cards. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Deal 11 cards to each player, twice.",
      "content": "Deal 11 cards to each player, twice. Working clockwise around the table, deal cards face-down until each player has a stack of 11 cards in front of them. Instruct players to keep these cards face-down in a stack—no peeking! This first stack is known as the “foot,” and each player will use their foot later in the game. Then, deal each player a “hand”—another 11 cards—and allow them to examine them. These are the cards players will use first. If you're playing with teams (2 players to a team), have team members sit across from each other at the table during the deal, and as they play the game. Some variations of the game have players try to take stacks of exactly 22 cards from the deck instead of a deal. If they’re successful, they earn 300 points right away."

      "content": "Turn over the top card of the stock to create a discard pile. Place the stock in the center of the table, then turn over the stock’s top card and place it next to the stock. This face-up card begins the discard, where players will discard 1 card after their turn, and optionally take new cards at the start of their turns. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw 2 cards from the stock and check your hand for sets of at least 3.",
      "content": "Draw 2 cards from the stock and check your hand for sets of at least 3. The person to the left of the dealer begins the game. Draw 2 cards from the stock at the center of the table, and incorporate them into your hand (ignoring your foot cards for now). Examine your hand for possible melds (sets of at least 3 cards of the same value). [4] X Research source Or, instead of drawing 2 cards from the stock, draw 5 cards from the discard pile (or the entire discard, if there are fewer than 5 cards)."

      "title": "Create a new “meld” on the table, or add cards to existing melds.",
      "content": "Create a new “meld” on the table, or add cards to existing melds. The object of Hand and Foot is to play all the cards in your hand and foot piles, and to do that, players make “melds” in the center of the table. To make a meld, place at least 3 cards of the same value in the center of the table (such as three 6s). Or, you may add cards from your hand onto existing melds of the same value, if there are any on the table. [5] X Research source Note that melding in Hand and Foot comes with a fairly in-depth set of its own rules and procedures. For complete guidelines, see the Melding Section of this article. A player may only make new melds or lay cards onto their own existing melds, but not both. If laying cards onto existing melds, they may lay cards into multiple melds. If you’re playing with teams, teammates may only add new cards onto their teammate’s or their own melds."

Immediately after you discard or meld the last card in your hand, pick up your face-down foot pile and use it to play the game as normal. If you use up your hand in the middle of your turn, your turn continues using your foot pile. [6] X Research source That said, if you use up your hand by discarding, your turn ends immediately, and you’ll use your foot pile on your next and subsequent turns."

Then, the person to your left takes their turn, making melds or laying cards. [7] X Research source Continue taking turns clockwise around the table until 1 player discards or melds their last card. If you’re playing with teams, keep playing until the second partner has played at least 1 card from their foot pile."

In each of the 4 rounds, the cards of a player’s (or team’s) first meld played that round must add up to at least 50 points in the first round, 90 points in the second round, 120 points in the third, and 150 points in the fourth round. After this first meld is made, new melds by that player or team don’t need to add up to any certain value. Players may reach the point threshold with multiple melds, if they choose. Card values are as follows: [9] X Research source 4-7: 5 points 8-Kings: 10 points Aces & 2: 20 points Jokers: 50 points 3s cannot be melded. Wild cards (jokers and 2s) may be played in place of any other card."

      "content": "Complete melds of 7 cards, which are known as “books.” Once a player or a team has created a meld of 7 cards, that meld is set aside and becomes a completed “book.” New cards cannot be added to completed books. A book that was made with no wild cards is called a “clean” book and is worth 500 points at the end of the round, while one made with wild cards, which is known as a “dirty” book, is worth 300. [10] X Research source Once you make a book, stack the cards into a pile and set them aside. Place a red card from the meld face-up on top if it’s a clean meld, or a black card if it’s a dirty meld, to help you tell them apart later. Because dirty melds are easier to play, usually it's wise to save these plays for later in the game."
