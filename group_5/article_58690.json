      "title": "Place the TV somewhere it will be safe from sunlight.",
      "content": "Place the TV somewhere it will be safe from sunlight. Direct sunlight evaporates water faster, which creates more humidity in the air. Keep your TV shaded to reduce how much humidity forms on the screen. Keeping your TV in the shade will also reduce the glare on the screen, making it easier to watch."

      "title": "Install a waterproof case over your outdoor TV.",
      "content": "Install a waterproof case over your outdoor TV. These covers will protect your TV from humidity, moisture, and allergens, all of which can get inside your TV and cause problems. Look for a case made out of ABS plastic or an aluminum mixture. Shop for an outdoor waterproof TV cover online or visit your local electronics store. Make sure to measure your TV to ensure the cover you get is the right size. Ideally, you want a case or shield that can be kept on your TV at all times. Some covers are meant to be used just when the TV isn’t on, which means you would have to remove it and put it back on yourself often. The TV Shield is a highly reviewed company that makes protective cases. A1Cover, Clicks Outdoor, and Storm Shell are also companies that make similar products."

      "content": "Reduce humidity around the TV with a portable evaporative cooler. Look for a cooler made specifically for outdoor use for the best results. Plug it in near your TV and run it when the humidity level is over 50%. If you aren’t sure of how to tell the humidity level, try one of these different methods: [1] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Department of Energy Official site for the U.S. Department of Energy, which provides resources related to energy safety, conservation, and efficiency Go to source Observe the TV screen. If condensation is forming, there’s a good chance that the humidity level is high. Pay attention to how you feel. If your skin feels sticky and the air around you feels thick, you’re most likely dealing with high humidity. Create a wet/dry thermometer with 2 thermometers, cotton gauze, rubber bands, and water to get a reading after 2-3 hours. Purchase an outdoor hygrometer for fast and exact readings."

      "content": "Invest in a weatherproof TV to protect your TV all year long. If it’s in your budget, consider purchasing a TV made specifically to be used outdoors. These TVs come with extra protection already built-in to protect against excess moisture. Indoor TVs can be used outdoors, but keep in mind that they’ll wear out sooner if they aren’t covered with a waterproof case. Even then, they won’t last as long as an outdoor TV would."

      "content": "Run a dehumidifier in your TV room to reduce excess moisture. You can buy a single-room dehumidifier online or at a local home improvement store. If you live in a humid climate or often experience high humidity, you may want to consider installing a whole-home dehumidifier. [3] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Some dehumidifiers even have adjustable stats that allow you to program the machine to turn on or off depending on the current humidity level. Most dehumidifiers need to be emptied regularly, so make sure to check the water basin every few days."

      "content": "Wipe down your TV with a lint-free cloth to absorb excess moisture. If you notice condensation forming on your TV screen, wipe it away so it’s less likely to work its way inside the TV. Use a lint-free cloth so fibers don’t cling to your screen.

      "content": "Put moisture-absorbing plants around your TV room. Look for peace lilies, reed palms, English ivy, Boston ferns, and tillandsia. These plants can help control the humidity in a room, though they won’t be able to combat an excessive problem. Try getting 1 or 2 plants to start and add more if you feel they’re helping the problem. [5] X Research source If you’re running low on floor space, consider using a hanging planter. Keep in mind that these plants need a lot of moisture to thrive. If you live in an area that also experiences very dry weather during certain seasons, make sure to give them extra water and mist their leaves every 2-3 days."

      "content": "Turn on the exhaust fans when you cook or take a shower. Even if your TV isn’t in your kitchen or bathroom, the excess humidity can travel out of the room and affect other areas of your home. Running the exhaust fan helps filter out some of that humid air so it doesn’t fog up your mirrors or TV or make the air as heavy. [6] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. If you don’t have exhaust fans, try running a ceiling fan or a standing fan to keep the air moving. Crack a window and point the fan in that direction if possible to remove as much moisture-filled air as possible. Taking shorter, cooler showers can also help reduce the humidity in your home."
