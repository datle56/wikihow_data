      "content": "Line a baking pan or dish with aluminum foil. Yams tend to ooze syrupy juice, which can be difficult to clean up. Lining your pan ensures an easy clean up process. Don't wrap your yams or sweet potatoes in aluminum foil. Simply lay them on the foil."

You can drizzle vegetable or olive oil on the yams if you choose. Rub the oil evenly over the skins.

      "content": "Bake for approximately 1 hour. Once during cooking, turn them over. The sweet potato or yam is done when the yam is soft. Touch it with an oven mitt and test for softness. Insert a knife into the middle of the potato; it should easily glide into the potato if it's done. If it's not done, continue cooking. [5] X Research source Another way to tell it is done is that the outside will be darker when it's done. [6] X Research source Cooking time will vary depending upon the size of the yams. Larger yams will take longer to cook. The yams can take from 45 to 75 minutes to cook."

For a paleo or clean variation, cover with coconut butter and sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg. Another clean option is to top with maple syrup or honey. Add brown or granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice for a sweeter taste. Add salt and pepper, paprika, or cumin for a more savory dish. Mix chili pepper with butter for a kick of spice."

An alternate way to cut the yams is to wash and leave the peel on the yams. Slice the yams into medallions, as narrow or wide as desired.
