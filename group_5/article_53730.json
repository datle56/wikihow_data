Honor the dress code and let the occasion dictate the formality of your wardrobe."

      "content": "Dress appropriately. Having good clothing etiquette will allow you to look great and feel comfortable. Don’t make the mistake of wearing the wrong outfit for the occasion, like wearing a ball gown to a cocktail party or revealing clothes in a conservative culture. You need to know your colors, too. For example, it’s not appropriate to wear white to a wedding or light-colored clothes to a funeral. There is also a difference between daytime clothes and evening clothes. For the day, it’s better to wear light colors, natural-looking makeup, minimal jewelry, and low to medium heels. At night, you can go more formal and choose darker colors, heavier makeup, high heels, and glitzier accessories."

[1] X Expert Source Christina Santelli Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 22 April 2019. Wear a particular color that looks great with your skin or hair. Dressing in clothes that look fantastic specifically on you can put you on your “A” game. [2] X Research source It can also be helpful to consider your age when dressing up so you can choose the clothes that flatter your body best as it currently is. For example, you might find that different cuts and materials flatter you more in your forties than the styles you used to wear in your twenties."

      "content": "Wear stylish, yet comfortable, attire on a first date. Often, what looks good is not comfortable and what’s comfortable is not stylish. The key is to spend time choosing the right outfit that meets both these criteria. If you wait until the last minute, you’re apt to throw anything on and then regret wearing those itchy pants or unbearably tight shoes! Remember you not only want to look good to the other person but you want to feel confident, too. The way to do that is to wear an outfit that shows your personality but that you don’t have to think about once you put it on. [3] X Research source Keep it casual for a daytime date, and dress it up in the evening. Avoid wearing anything that’s political or offensive."

Bathe yourself well; create a flattering hairdo, and carefully apply some makeup. You don’t need to go over the top -- groom according to the formality of the occasion."

      "content": "Remember less is more. To create an elegant look, pick one feature that you want to accentuate, and keep the rest of your look simple. With your makeup, play up your eyes or lips but not both. If you start with a little black dress, try adding a statement accessory like a fancy clutch or an eye-catching necklace. The goal is to not overwhelm the look but to have each element complement the other."

Your attire should be appropriate, conservative and respectful. If the invite does not state a specific style of dress, then follow the “Dressy Casual” or “Semi-formal” step below, or ask someone in the wedding party; they usually know months in advance. [4] X Research source Along with the invitation, base your attire on the season, venue and weather. Time is also important. Weddings in the evening are usually more formal than daytime ceremonies. If you don’t know the couple (perhaps you’re going as the date of a friend or family member of the betrothed), you may want to call the venue and see what dress is appropriate. Consider packing a few accessories to either dress up or dress down your outfit."

White is a special color reserved for the bride, so the rest of us should not wear white dresses. Even if the bride isn’t wearing white, still avoid this color. It’s okay, though, to wear a patterned outfit with white mixed in. Tradition also states that guests should not wear black. However, it’s no longer considered off-limits unless specifically stated on the invitation. Don’t wear black, however, if it’s a summer, outdoor wedding held during the day. You could look out of place, not to mention the heat factor. [5] X Research source"

Keep the chunky necklaces, cocktail rings and earrings for an evening ceremony and less dramatic pieces for a daytime wedding. For your bag, a clutch purse is a terrific choice for most weddings.

For this ultra-chic occasion, you’re expected to wear a formal, full-length ball gown with long gloves either white or the same color as your gown. White gloves are suitable for almost any dresses. Match your gown with glamorous makeup, your finest jewelry, and an upswept, elegant hairstyle, if possible. Shoes should match your gown.

Hair and makeup can be everyday and natural. As a general rule, bathing attire should not be worn, even under your outfit unless the invite specifically states."

For a daytime ceremony, a classy sundress is perfect. Save dark colors for an evening wedding and lighter colors/fabrics for a daytime ceremony. Assume business casual if the invitation says “Casual.” Usually, casual means just about anything goes. However, unless it states on the invite, tank tops, shorts, and jeans are probably not appropriate."

You should also wear a white, formal shirt, black bowtie, black vest or cummerbund, suspenders, and patent leather shoes. If it’s during the summer, black tuxedo trousers with a white dinner jacket are also fine. [9] X Research source There will always be a few guests who misinterpret the invitation to simply mean “formal” and will dress in whatever they feel is dressy. A gracious host will understand. In technical terms, though, a tuxedo is the best choice for black tie events. If the invite says “Black Tie Optional, the safest choice is still a tuxedo. The hosts worded it this way because they don’t want to exclude those who can’t afford one. So if you genuinely can’t, then a dark suit and tie is just fine."
