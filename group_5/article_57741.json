      "title": "Develop a baseline before customizing your lessons.",
      "content": "Develop a baseline before customizing your lessons. Set defined outcomes and goals for the learning period, so all your students ultimately learn the same information. Once you have a base goal in mind, you can start customizing your lessons and cater to all your students’ individual needs. [1] X Research source “I need my class to divide fractions at the end of the learning period” is a great example of a clear learning goal."

      "content": "Students may enjoy learning new content in visual, auditory, or hands-on ways. Show your students a video at the beginning of the unit, or let your pupils listen to required readings on tape. You might also use charts, diagrams, or other visual aids to help present the content in a clear, interesting way.

Students tend to learn best when they're presented with information from a variety of angles, so get creative!

      "title": "A single, uniform activity might not resonate with all your students.",
      "content": "A single, uniform activity might not resonate with all your students. Instead, change up the process for your lesson with different activities. You might have your students journal their thoughts, or let them discuss the lesson with a partner. [5] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source You might divide your students into literature groups if you’re reading a specific book in class. You could have students study historical queens and kings with a graphic organizer. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Students with different learning styles may prefer different projects.",
      "content": "Students with different learning styles may prefer different projects. Let your students pick from a list or suggest a project style that caters to their learning needs, instead of requiring all students to present their information in the same way. [7] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Instead of assigning a book report, you might set up a mock debate between 2 students. Students who learn visually might have an easier time submitting a photographic essay."

      "title": "Create a diverse classroom that welcomes all learning styles.",
      "content": "Create a diverse classroom that welcomes all learning styles. Some students might prefer to work by themselves, while others may work better in groups. Set aside different spaces where all of your students can really thrive, focus, and engage with the lesson material. [8] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source Develop clear instructions and guidelines for students who prefer to do their work individually."

      "title": "Flexible groups let students work together in a dynamic way.",
      "content": "Flexible groups let students work together in a dynamic way. Ultimately, you get to decide how many students are in which group, and which activities would do best with group work. Best of all, these groups don’t have to be set in stone—feel free to change up the groupings for different assignments. [9] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source You might assign partners to work on a book report. Divide students into small groups to complete a lab assignment or science experiment."

      "title": "Let your students feel like they’re living in the real world.",
      "content": "Let your students feel like they’re living in the real world. Not all students get a lot out of traditional, passive lesson plans—instead, they need to really live the material to understand its real purpose. Set up scenarios in your lessons that force students to apply their knowledge in a professional way, which can really take their learning to the next level. [10] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Instead of having students answer questions from a French textbook, invite them to translate a section of a French website. You might give your students applied chemistry problems that a professional pharmacist or chemist might deal with."

      "title": "Assign different tasks to different sections of the classroom.",
      "content": "Assign different tasks to different sections of the classroom. Don’t force everyone to do the same assignment at once—instead, breaks the lesson into bite-sized chunks. Assign students to specific stations, so your pupils can work on different types of tasks. [11] X Research source You might send advanced students to a more challenging station, while giving struggling students more targeted assignments. In a foreign language class, you might set up stations for reading, speaking, and listening. [12] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source In a biology class, you might set up different stations that focus on the different stages of mitosis."

      "title": "Develop a specific, 2-3 week plan for each student.",
      "content": "Develop a specific, 2-3 week plan for each student. Agendas let you focus on an individual student’s progress, and create a lesson plan that caters to their needs and capabilities. Create a long checklist for each student, giving them a list of tasks each student must finish within 2-3 weeks. [13] X Research source Some agendas might be similar, while others might be more advanced or scaled down, depending on the individual needs of the student. In a chemistry class, you might give students a list of labs they need to complete within 2 weeks. In a literature class, you might have assigned readings over a month-long period."

      "title": "Orbital studies are long-term investigative studies into the curriculum.",
      "content": "Orbital studies are long-term investigative studies into the curriculum. Let students pick a specific topic that they’re interested in, which they’ll focus and research on for 3-6 weeks. Then, work with each student over that time period as they complete a final project, like a presentation or paper. [14] X Research source In a history class, you might let your students pick out a specific historical figure to study from a certain time period. You could let your students pick out and read a book from a specific literary time period. In a forensic science class, you might have students study a certain type of forensic evidence, like trace evidence or tire impressions."

      "content": "Choice boards let your students pick out their assignments. Set up a row of hanging pockets. Write different assignments on a stack of index cards, and separate the index cards into different pockets. Encourage your students to pick out a card from the choice board, instead of automatically assigning them something to do. [15] X Research source You might place cards with different difficulty levels on different rows of your choice board. This way, students could pick out assignments that match their knowledge and skill level."

      "content": "Get an idea of a student’s comfort level before jumping into a new subject. If a student does well on the initial test, they can skip over sections of the lesson instead of relearning information they already know. After the evaluation, focus on the students who didn’t test as well. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t let multiple-choice tests make up your students’ entire grade.",
      "content": "Don’t let multiple-choice tests make up your students’ entire grade. Instead, let other elements count toward their final scores, like homework, classwork, and class participation. This way, students who don’t test well can still prove that they understand the material. [17] X Research source"
