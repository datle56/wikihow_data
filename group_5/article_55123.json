      "title": "Teach your puppy bite inhibition by making a sound like you’re in pain.",
      "content": "Teach your puppy bite inhibition by making a sound like you’re in pain. When puppies play with each other, they’ll naturally nip and bite each other (sometimes too hard). If their littermate is in pain, they will naturally yelp and jerk backward. To mimic this, make a loud “ow!” sound and remove your hand from their mouth whenever your puppy bites you. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that for some puppies, a loud noise like this will actually encourage them to bite you again (because they think you’re playing). If your loud noise doesn’t stop your puppy, move onto the methods listed below."

      "title": "Send the signal to your puppy that when they bite, you aren’t playing anymore.",
      "content": "Send the signal to your puppy that when they bite, you aren’t playing anymore. When your puppy bites you, yelp loudly and remove your hand to signal that playing has stopped. Then, ignore the puppy for 20 seconds. Physical isolation from the pack sends a strong message to the puppy that they have acted incorrectly. [2] X Research source If the puppy bites you again, get up and leave for another 20 seconds. After the 20 seconds are up, go back and start playing with your puppy again. Communicate with your dog that gentle play is encouraged and rough play is discouraged. Play with your puppy until the same sequence happens again and repeat the ignore/withdraw steps."

      "title": "Take your puppy to the crate to give them a chance to calm down.",
      "content": "Take your puppy to the crate to give them a chance to calm down. Sometimes, simply ignoring your dog isn’t enough. While you never want your puppy to associate their crate with negativity, sometimes giving them a chance to relax and wind down will curb their biting behavior. When your puppy bites, gently take them to their crate and give them a time-out for 5 to 10 minutes. [3] X Research source Do this calmly and quietly without yelling at your pup. The more they associate their crate with a calm, soothing environment, the easier crate training will be. Don’t have a crate? Put your puppy in a separate room that’s blocked off with a baby gate to give them some quiet time."

      "title": "Offer your puppy an alternative to keep their mouth occupied.",
      "content": "Offer your puppy an alternative to keep their mouth occupied. When you play with your puppy, keep a fun toy or a new bone nearby. Whenever they start to bite you, quickly offer them a toy or bone to chew on. Praise them to encourage positive behavior and reinforce good habits. [4] X Research source Using a toy is a great way to get your puppy to stop biting your ankles, too. Whenever you feel a nip near your feet, drop your puppy’s favorite toy on the ground as a distraction. Always make sure that your puppy has plenty of fun, exciting toys around. Otherwise, they could get bored and look for other things to chew on (like your fingers)."

      "title": "Distract your puppy with a new task they can follow.",
      "content": "Distract your puppy with a new task they can follow. If you’re working on teaching your dog basic commands , this is a great opportunity to practice. When your puppy starts to get mouthy, give them a simple command, like “sit,” or “down.” Then, reward them with a treat when they follow it. A command gives your puppy something else to focus on besides their urge to bite."

      "title": "Reward good behavior so your puppy is more likely to repeat it.",
      "content": "Reward good behavior so your puppy is more likely to repeat it. When your puppy is playing calmly or lounging around, give them a treat and tell them “good dog.” As they grow up, they’ll learn to associate their calm behavior with a reward, which makes them much more likely to repeat it. Studies have shown that positive reinforcement is much more effective than negative reinforcement when it comes to training animals. Focus on rewarding your pup as much as you can to get them into good habits."

      "content": "Tired dogs don’t bite as much, so make sure you walk and play with your pup. In general, bigger breeds need more exercise, while smaller breeds need less. Make sure to walk your puppy at least once a day, and play with them multiple times per day to get all their energy out. [5] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source If your puppy tends to bite or nip more when you’re playing with them, try non-contact forms of play, like fetch. Have you ever noticed that your puppy gets “the zoomies,” or a quick burst of energy? Puppies typically like to play or exercise in short bursts, followed by a long nap."

      "content": "Meet your puppy’s needs if they seem antsy or restless. Occasionally, your puppy might be biting because they feel worked up or anxious. Make sure that your puppy has food, water, and has been outside to potty recently. That way, you know that they aren’t trying to tell you something. [6] X Research source Keep your puppy on a regular feeding and pottying schedule so don’t lose track of their needs."

And just like your own childhood, this is a time for exploration and learning lessons. Regular play with other well-mannered dogs, who don't need to act to teach bite inhibition, will encourage your pup to play nicely around other dogs (and you).

While a puppy biting you can be frustrating (and painful), it’s important to try and keep your cool when dealing with your dog. Punishing your dog is confusing for them, and it’s much less effective than teaching them good behaviors and rewarding them for doing the right thing.
