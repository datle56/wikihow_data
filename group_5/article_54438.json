There are three rods in the game: [1] X Research source Old Rod - This can be obtained from the fisherman near the Dewford Town gym. This will let you catch Pokémon up to level 15 (mostly Magikarp).

Super Rod - This can be obtained from the fisherman living in the house on the northern cliff in Mossdeep City. This will let you catch any swimming Pokémon."

The chance of finding a certain Pokémon is based on the area, not on your fishing spot. There is no one spot that will be better for catching a specific Pokémon than another. The only exception to this is Feebas , who can only be caught on certain tiles in a specific area."
