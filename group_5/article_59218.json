      "content": "Get the spline and input shaft to insert into the torque converter and pilot bearing. It's tricky. It has to be straight in line both ways with the insertion point, and preferably supported on its balance point (balanced from fore and aft, and side to side), securely strapped (for example) from falling, not dangling or flopping around. But, it must be angled the same as the car is (if the front of the car is raised for instance). It would be easier, if the entire car were lifted, level, not angled. Gravity will fight your getting it in all the way in the spline-socket and into the bearing on the end, unless it is supported at its balance point and lined up perfectly. Lifting the trans unsecured, or off balance, can cause chaos, wobbling, rolling, falling,... The spline grooves must align both ways, vertically and horizontally. The input shaft can hang-up on the pilot bearing edge, instead of proceeding in -- if the transmission is angled more than a few hairs -- if not balanced and aligned. Do not allow the spline, alone to support the weight of the transmission."
