Check the temperature next to \"Core #0, \"Core #1,\" \"Core #2,\" \"Core #3\", etc. Core temperatures that are starting to get too hot will have red text. Generally, you want your core temperatures running between 40° C and 80° C. Above 90° C, you may want to look into ways of lowering your CPU temperature . The minimum temperature is the lowest temperature your CPU cores have reached while your computer is taking readings, while the maximum temperature is the highest. When Core Temp is running, you can monitor the temperature of each core in the taskbar. The icon resembles a bracket pointing up next to the time and date."

Most BIOS interfaces have a built-in hardware monitor, allowing you to check the temperature. However, this will only give you a temperature reading while your CPU is idle. It will not give you a standard use reading (such as when playing a game). You have to access the BIOS when your computer first boots up. If you are running Windows 8, open the Power menu and hold the Shift key while you click Restart. This will start in Advanced Startup Mode, where you can open your motherboard settings (UEFI) in the Troubleshooting menu."

Check your CPU’s documentation to determine the exact temperature threshold. Check your other temperatures. While checking your CPU temperature, see how hot the rest of your system is running. Most hardware monitors will also tell you the motherboard temperature, the graphics card temperature, and possibly ambient temperature in the case."

Opinions vary on how often you should replace your thermal paste , but if you are experiencing higher than normal temperatures, this is the easiest place to start. Don’t use excessive thermal paste, as too much can insulate the CPU instead of conducting the heat. A small dot spread evenly over the CPU is the most effective way to use it."

Underclocking your PC will slow it down but give it a considerably longer hardware lifespan, reduced heat generation (and hence dissipation), reduced electrical power consumption, increased stability, and reduced noise from mechanical cooling parts."
