      "content": "It is not possible to make an animated GIF in Microsoft Paint. Animated GIFs contain multiple frames, which Paint cannot do. Instead, you can make individual images in Paint using the method above and then go to a free site like https://ezgif.com/maker to add all your still images together and create an animated GIF! Since you can only make simple GIFs with Paint, you'll want to use a website or program like Photoshop, Carpstudio, GIPHY or GIMP . Those other programs will help you create GIFs with moving frames."
