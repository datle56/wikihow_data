Restaurant jobs at McDonald’s don’t have a specific minimum age requirement, although your state or local government may have limitations on how old a person must be before getting a job. Most individual locations require you to be at least 18 years old to work as a manager. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Some states will allow people as young as 14 to work as cashiers or other non-food service personnel. The types of entry-level positions you can apply for at McDonald’s typically include crew member (general restaurant staff member), maintenance, and beverage specialist (the person who runs the McCafe station). These positions don’t require any prior experience. Management positions can include shift manager, assistant manager, and department manager. Note that management positions typically require at least some prior experience at McDonald’s or another food service establishment."

      "content": "Ask for a job application at your local McDonald’s or look for one online. There is an online jobs portal on the McDonald’s website, but many restaurants don’t actually participate in this hiring portal. This means that the most reliable way to get an application is to just go into the restaurant and ask for one. [2] X Research source The URL to search for McDonald’s jobs online is: https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/mcdonalds-careers.html You can typically just ask a cashier working the register to hand you an application. If you see the restaurant manager, ask them for the application so that they’ll know you want a job."

You’ll have to provide information that will be used to perform a background check on you, such as your full name, Social Security number, and address, so it’s important that this information all be accurate. Try to provide as much information as possible in order to make hiring you an easier process. [3] X Research source For example, if you have previous work experience, list your former employer’s name, address, and telephone number on your application, rather than just their name. Avoid leaving any parts of your application blank, if you can. Answer as many questions as you can, even if they aren’t required. Be sure to indicate your availability on your application, including how many hours a week you can work and on which days. Remember that the more hours you can work, the stronger applicant you’ll be."

[4] X Research source If your application is online, you can simply hit the “Submit” button in order to turn it in. You can expect to hear back from the restaurant’s hiring manager within 1-2 weeks of handing in your application."

[9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Other questions you can expect to be asked include “Why should I hire you?”, “Are you good at math?”, and “How many hours can you work?” If you can, have someone ask you these questions and practice giving your answers verbally."

For women, a business casual outfit might include a skirt or dress that falls just above the knee, formal pants (if you choose not to wear a skirt or dress), a conservative shirt that isn’t too revealing, and flat trouser shoes or high heels.
