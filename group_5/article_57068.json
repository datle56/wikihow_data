      "content": "Lay out a tortilla or sandwich wrap. The anchor for a good wrap is a large flour tortilla. You can use a plain one, or you can opt for colorful, flavored variations like tomato or spinach wraps. [1] X Research source Whatever you choose, just make sure it’s a large, burrito-sized tortilla (around 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter). Lay it down on a plate or clean cutting board. If you want your tortilla warm, cook it in a pan with a bit of oil for a few seconds on each side or heat it in the microwave for 10 seconds. Heating the tortilla also makes it more flexible for wrapping and helps prevent tearing. [2] X Research source Tortillas vs. sandwich wrap flatbreads: Tortillas are unleavened, which means they're made without any yeast. Sandwich wrap flatbreads are usually made of dough that does contain yeast, so they tend to have a fluffier texture. [3] X Research source Since both are thin enough to roll and fold, they both work for wraps—it’s just a matter of preference!"

      "content": "Spread any sauces or condiments you’re using across the whole tortilla. This will hold everything together once wrapped and help your fillings stick to the tortilla. Choose a spread or sauce that you think will go along well with the meat, veggies, or cheese you're planning on adding later. Here are some ideas: Cream cheese Hummus Tzatziki Pesto Guacamole or mashed avocado Salad dressing (ranch, Italian, caesar, etc) Sour cream Mayo Mustard"

      "title": "Add your toppings to the bottom ⅓ of the tortilla.",
      "content": "Add your toppings to the bottom ⅓ of the tortilla. Try to leave about ⅔ of the tortilla free above where you’re placing your toppings. You’ll need this free space later when you roll the wrap up . Leave a few inches free on each side of your toppings as well—you’ll be folding the sides up later, too. Here are some ideas of toppings to add: Meats: Sliced turkey, sliced ham, grilled chicken, sliced steak Seafood: Grilled salmon, tuna salad Vegetarian proteins: Tofu, black beans, garbanzo beans, sliced avocado Cheeses: Cheddar, Swiss, provolone, mozzarella, parmesan Veggies: Lettuce, spinach, kale, sprouts, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery, bell peppers, shredded carrots, microgreens Deluxe toppings: Pickled vegetables, chopped cornichons, capers, caperberries, olives, tapenade, slivered almonds, sesame seeds, walnuts Seasonings and drizzles: Salt, pepper, dried or fresh herbs, spices, olive oil, red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold in the sides of your tortilla.",
      "content": "Fold in the sides of your tortilla. Bring the sides together toward the center of the wrap, but not to the point that they’re touching. There should still be a few inches of space between them."

      "title": "Fold up a small section from the bottom of the tortilla.",
      "content": "Fold up a small section from the bottom of the tortilla. It should slightly cover your filling, which should be positioned in the bottom ⅓ of the tortilla."

    {
      "title": "Continue rolling the wrap from the bottom.",
      "content": "Continue rolling the wrap from the bottom. As you fold up the bottom of the tortilla, continue rolling the whole wrap upward until you’ve used up all the free space you left above your fillings. Make sure to keep the side flaps folded in as you roll. By the end of this step, your wrap should look like a perfectly-secured burrito. Note: If you’re having a hard time rolling your wrap, it might be overfilled. Remove some of the filling and try again. This will most likely fix the problem! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Slice the wrap in half.",
      "content": "Slice the wrap in half. You don't have to do this step if you prefer to keep your wrap whole. But, if you want to go for that classic restaurant look, use a knife to cut your wrap in half on a diagonal. Tips for packing or storing your wrap: Secure each half of your wrap with a toothpick to keep it from falling apart, then place in a sealable tupperware. [6] X Research source You can also wrap the whole thing up in parchment paper or wax paper to hold it together, then place it in your fridge or lunchbox. Avoid using plastic wrap for this—it can cause the wrap to get soggy! [7] X Research source If you’re really worried about sogginess, avoid putting watery sauces or dressings inside your wrap. Instead, put them in small containers and use them as dipping sauces when you’re ready to eat."
