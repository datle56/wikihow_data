If you leave the holes open, the water will enter the inner pot and will also run out of the larger pot, making the fridge ineffective. [1] X Research source Putty or duct tape can plug the hole."

Pour in more water as it becomes drier to keep it well moistened. Usually this will need to be done twice a day. You can add food or drinks to the pot-in-pot refrigerator if you're having an outdoor party or picnic. Make one for the drinks and one for the food if you have a lot of items."
