      "content": "Be courteous, look at your customer when greeting them, and smile. You don't have to say \"Welcome to Walmart!\" if you think it sounds cheesy, instead, you can say \"Hello, how are you?\" or \"how are you doing?\" instead."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with sticker applying procedures. Throughout the day you may have to peel those little \"happy faces\" off the roll and applying them to various customers throughout the day. Your fingers/hands will likely take an abuse so make sure you properly stretch and exercise the fingers. NOTE: most customers will not want a sticker so your next option would be to tear a few off the roll of stickers."

      "content": "Check receipts, especially if you notice a customer carrying an item that isn't contained in a bag. You should always check anyway, but do not overdo this , you don't want to stress yourself out if you miss a few customers here or there, this will happen and this is normal. Some rush out the door, some stop and hand you a receipt if you ask them, and some customers are angry either way, so be careful."

      "content": "Use Express Returns in SMART to issue a return label if a customer has a return, provided you have an MC40 or TC70. If you do not have one of these, just write them up. Write your initials, the date, how many items they have and you should be golden."

      "content": "When the store is not busy, you should work on keeping the vestibule (area between the two sets of doors) clean by cleaning the windows by the entrance doors, straightening nearby shelves, sweeping, etc. Basically whatever you can do to keep yourself from being bored. Remember that management will be watching you and, whatever you can do to help them out will be a really big help to them, because they have a lot of responsibility, so you should treat this job as important as any other."

      "title": "Remember:",
      "content": "Remember: you have it really easy, don't mess up! This is by far the easiest job in the store. You have it made, and you're making money to stand around, even more overnight. Not too shabby. It is going to get boring, but my suggestion to you would be to grin and bear it until something better comes your way."
