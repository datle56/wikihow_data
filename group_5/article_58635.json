If you want the same page to be printed multiple times per page, one easy way to do it is to click the \"Pages\" radio option below \"Pages to print\". Then use the box next to this option to manually type the order you want the pages to print, repeating each page number each time you want it to print (i.g. 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,...). Separate each page with a comma. If you are printing on both sides of the paper with a single-sided printer, you'll want to print only the odd number pages first.
