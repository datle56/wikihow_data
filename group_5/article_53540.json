      "content": "Find your Mods folder. Close out your game and open File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on Mac). Your Mods folder, if you installed your game in the default location, will be in [User] > Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods . There will be a file called Resource.cfg in the Mods folder. Do not delete this file; if you do, your custom content won't show up."

      "content": "Download a program such as 7-Zip or The Unarchiver. A lot of custom content is compressed into .rar or .zip files, which you'll need to extract before you can place the files into your game."

      "title": "Search around for Sims 4 custom content.",
      "content": "Search around for Sims 4 custom content. You can usually find some content sites by using a search engine. Some popular custom content websites include Mod The Sims and The Sims Resource, and many people also share Sims 4 custom content on blogs such as Tumblr. Many sites allow you to drill down to specific content categories (such as makeup or study furniture). You can also search for specific types of content on search engines, like \"sims 4 custom hairstyles\". If you're looking for good CC creators, try asking for people's favorite creators on Sims 4 forums or social media sites. You may get some great recommendations!"

      "title": "Look for any needed requirements.",
      "content": "Look for any needed requirements. Some custom content requires you to have something else for the content to work, such as a game pack or a mesh, and other content may not work with certain game patches. Creators usually write what's needed in the content descriptions, so make sure to read the description first! Some sites such as Mod The Sims allow you to filter out content that requires game packs that you don't have, or display icons of the game packs necessary for the content. Make sure the content is for Sims 4 before you download it. Content for Sims 3 and Sims 2 also come in .package files, but putting Sims 3 or Sims 2 files in your game won't work and will cause the game to run slowly."

    {
      "title": "Find the download link or button for the content.",
      "content": "Find the download link or button for the content. Dedicated custom content websites will usually have a \"Download\" button on the page. If the content is located on a blog or other site that's not dedicated to Sims content, you'll usually need to find the link to the download site. (Most independent creators host their files on websites like Sim File Share, Box, OneDrive, or MediaFire.) The Sims Resource will make you wait ten seconds before proceeding, unless you pay for VIP membership. If you try to skip these ten seconds, it will redirect you to a page for Sims 4 downloads, so stay on the same tab for ten seconds. Some downloads make you wait in adFly for 5 seconds. Don't click on any of the ads, as a lot of them are viruses. When a \"Skip\" button appears in the right hand corner, click it and find the download link for the custom content."

If it's a .zip file, choose Extract to /* ; if it's a .rar file, find the option for your decompression program (such as 7-Zip) and choose Extract or Extract to /* . On Mac: Either double-click the file, or right-click it and select Open with... > The Unarchiver . Once the content has been extracted, you can delete the .rar or .zip file."
