This can make the person feel more comfortable talking to you about it as well. [1] X Research source You don’t have to get specific if you don’t want to. You can say something like: “I know this must be a really difficult time for you and your family.” Or, say something like: “I know you must be feeling a lot of pain right now.”"

Let them know there is a standing invitation any time they want to hang out and distract themselves from the difficult time they’re going through. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if your friend just lost a parent to suicide, say something like: “I’m really sorry that happened. I'm always here if you need some company. Do you want to go out to dinner this week?” Or, if a coworker is grieving over a break-up, tell them something like: “Hey, I’ve been there.

      "content": "People often bottle up feelings of sadness because they’re ashamed to cry. Tell the person who’s going through a hard time that it’s totally fine for them to cry in front of you if they need to. Letting it all out can really help someone through the healing process. [11] X Research source For example, if your friend is putting on a tough face after his wife left him, but you know he’s hurting, say: “Man, if you need to cry, go ahead. I know you’re hurting right now.” Or, if your friend is sad because her dog just died, say: “I’m here if you need a shoulder to cry on. You don’t have to hold back any tears in front of me.”"

Or, if you feel affected by someone else’s loss and grief, tell them how you feel to show that you understand. [13] X Research source For example, you might say: “Wow, I’m so sorry about your dad’s passing. We had a lot of good times with him growing up, didn’t we? That makes me really sad, too.” Or, you could say: “Hey, I don’t really know what to say right now, and my words probably won’t make it hurt any less, but I just want you to know I care and I’m here for you.”"

      "content": "People usually aren't looking for advice when they’re sad or upset. Avoid giving the person advice about what they should or shouldn’t do during this difficult time. Instead, focus on making sure they know you’re they’re for them and acknowledging that they’re passing through a really difficult moment. [14] X Research source For example, if someone is sad because their cat just ran away and disappeared, don’t tell them they should have checked their windows before they went out. Instead, say something like, “I’m really sorry that happened. Can I help you look for your cat?” Or, if someone is upset because they got fired from their job, don’t say, “You should go start applying for new jobs right now.” Instead, say something like: “That really sucks, I’m sorry. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help when you start job hunting.”"

Don’t tell someone who just lost a loved one that they are in a better place or that it was God’s will, for instance. Avoid using cliches like “It wasn’t meant to be,” to justify things like breakups or job losses. [15] X Research source For example, if your friend’s dad just passed away, don’t say, “At least he’s no longer suffering.” Instead, say, “I’m really sorry. I know how hard this moment is for you.” Or, if your girlfriend just lost her job, don’t say, “It probably wasn’t a good fit, anyways.” Instead, say, “I know you’re feeling a bit lost right now, but I’m here to help you however I can.”"
