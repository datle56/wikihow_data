      "content": "Pay off any remaining balance and contact the credit card company. Before you destroy and dispose of your credit card, it’s important to take a few cautionary measures, especially if you're closing an account. First, pay off the balance of your card (if there is one), as leaving a balance could negatively affect your credit score. Lastly, contact your credit card company if you’re closing your account. This way, they can ensure that your information is secure and the account is closed correctly. [1] X Research source If you’re getting rid of an expired card or receiving a replacement, skip this step. As finance executive Andrew Lokenauth advises, it’s always best to call your credit card company and let them know that you no longer have to have the card. You can also ask them to freeze the credit card if you believe your identity is at risk."

      "content": "Demagnetise the credit card’s magnetic strip using a magnet. To safely dispose of an old card, disable the magnetic strip containing all your personal data, such as your account number, card limit, and name. Demagnetizing this strip makes the card unusable by anybody, making it nearly impossible for someone to steal your information. Run a magnet along the credit card’s strip (where you’d swipe the card when making a purchase). [2] X Research source Do this slowly so the magnet is against the strip for a good amount of time. Use any magnet! A fridge magnet is perfect for the job."

      "content": "Smash the credit card chip with a hammer. The credit card’s chip is the small silver or gold square typically on the left-hand side of the card. This chip contains the same personal information the magnetic strip does, so it’s also very important to destroy. It can be difficult to cut it up with scissors, so for the best results, use a hammer to smash the chip into small pieces. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a plastic credit card up with scissors. Lokenauth recommends that once you’ve disabled the magnetic strip and electronic chip to cut up the rest of the card. Cut the card up into several pieces that are difficult (if nearly impossible) to piece back together. If you’re not sure where to start, follow these simple steps: [4] X Research source Start by cutting up the numbers on the card so there are no more than 2 numbers on each piece of card. Then, cut up the security code and signature on the back of the card into very small pieces. Cut the card with bent, curved, and straight cuts that’ll make it harder to piece together. If you have a metal credit card, return it directly to the bank or company, as they can safely destroy it despite its durability."

      "title": "Throw away a plastic credit card’s pieces separately.",
      "content": "Throw away a plastic credit card’s pieces separately. The safest way to dispose of your card is to throw various pieces away in different trash cans or bags. This way, all of the credit card fragments aren’t in the same place, making it even more difficult for someone to obtain and piece back together. [5] X Research source If you’re throwing away any related documentation, such as account statements or receipts, avoid putting these in the same bag as the card fragments."

This includes statements or receipts that contain personal information about you and your account. Tear the papers up by hand, with scissors, or use a cross-shredder if you have access to one.

      "content": "Incinerate any remaining paper or documentation. If you want to be completely sure that your card and all the related documentation are destroyed, consider setting it on fire. It’s generally not advisable to burn the card itself, as the materials it’s made of may contain harmful substances, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, dioxins, furans and heavy metals, as well as particulates. [7] X Research source Burning papers and bills is a way to guarantee that nobody will be able to read them. Always use caution when handling fire. Burn remaining records in a safe outdoor environment in a barrel or firepit with minimal wind."

      "content": "How do you destroy a metal credit card? Destroy a metal credit card by returning it to the bank or card issuer. Unlike plastic credit cards, metal cards are harder to destroy by hand. Their durable material must be broken down and recycled by the card company itself. So, if you’d like to dispose of a metal credit card, call up your bank or credit card company for additional guidance. [8] X Research source"

It’s possible to set fire to a plastic credit card, but the plastic can release harmful gasses when burned, such as hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide. Cutting up a card is the safest option; however, if you’d prefer to burn it, make sure to do so safely in an incinerator or burn barrel. [9] X Research source"

Credit card collecting is a hobby with a small community around the world. [11] X Research source The age, condition, owner, brand, and rarity of a card contributes to its worth. For instance, an original 1959 AmEx paper card was sold for $1,200 (one of the highest expired credit card prices recorded). [12] X Research source"
