      "content": "Use fresh seaweed from the beach (or buy dried seaweed instead). This is the fun part! Head to the beach with a bucket or bag and collect seaweed that’s washed up on shore. Just make sure to check your local laws online first—in some places, it’s illegal to collect seaweed on the beach, or there’s a limit to how much you can collect in one day. [2] X Research source If you can’t make it to a beach or collecting seaweed isn’t allowed in your area, order dried (but unroasted) seaweed online and use that to make your fertilizer tea instead. [3] X Research source It will still have all the same plant-boosting nutrients as fresh seaweed. Only collect seaweed that’s washed up on shore. Pulling up live seaweed can harm the local ecosystem.

To use your seaweed tea, transfer some to a watering can and dilute it with water (1 part seaweed tea to 10 parts water is perfect). [10] X Research source Water your outdoor plants and houseplants with the seaweed tea as needed to fertilize them. Alternatively, add 1 part seaweed tea and 20 parts water to a foliar sprayer and spray the mixture directly on the leaves of your plants. [11] X Research source Store your seaweed tea in a sealed container out of direct sunlight for up to one year. [12] X Research source"
