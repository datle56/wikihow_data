If you're just beginning to crochet, choose a yarn with a smooth texture, a light color (so you can see your stitches clearly) and worsted (medium) weight. [1] X Research source Count on needing 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket or a receiving blanket. Double that estimation for a larger blanket. If you are at all unsure about whether you have enough yarn for the project at hand, get an extra skein or two. If you're buying yarn that's produced in a dye lot, make sure each skein has the same dye lot number on the label. Otherwise, your skeins might be slightly different colors."

      "title": "Choose a hook size.",
      "content": "Choose a hook size. Crochet hooks range in size from B (2.25mm) to S (19mm). [2] X Research source Here's what to keep in mind when you're selecting a hook: The bigger the hook, the bigger the stitch. Bigger stitches are easier to see, and they mean you'll get through the blanket faster. However, you'll also use up more yarn. Bigger stitches are also looser and make for more lightweight blankets. If you want a particularly warm blanket, choose a smaller hook for tighter stitches. If you're just starting to crochet, choose a hook that's size N or bigger. You can work your way up to smaller hooks as you get more comfortable with crocheting."

Hint: Make the number of stitches in your chain divisible by 5 or 10. It makes it easier to keep track of whether you're inadvertently increasing or decreasing each round. Know how many \"extra\" chains you'll need. Depending on the type of stitch you plan to use, you'll have a certain number of stitches that become part of the \"turn\" when you move on to the second row. For a single crochet, it's one chain; for a double crochet, it's three. [4] X Research source"

Crocheting only into the far side of each loop (instead of through both loops) gives a nice ridged appearance to the finished crochet."
