      "title": "Research your state's law.",
      "content": "Research your state's law. Police will only investigate activity that violates state criminal law, so find your state's law that applies to criminal fraud and make sure it applies to your case. Specifics differ from state to state, but generally the person must have lied or misrepresented an important fact to induce you into providing him with money or some other benefit. For the crime of fraud, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person knew the information he was stating was false, but lied anyway to realize an unfair gain. [9] X Research source For example, one common Craigslist scam involves fake rental listings. The criminal finds a home for sale on a real estate site and copies the information for a Craigslist ad, using his own email address. When interested would-be renters contact him about the listing, he explains that he has had to leave the U.S. quickly â€“ often because of some sort of missionary or other work in Africa. He then instructs the person to wire a deposit of first and last months' rent overseas. Of course, the home is not available for rent and the person who wired the money will probably never hear from the supposed \"landlord\" again. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Gather information about the incident.",
      "content": "Gather information about the incident. With a basic understanding of what must be proven to prosecute fraud, make copies of any emails or other information you have that could be of assistance to police and prosecutors. Since the person is trying to trick you, it's likely they've given you a fake name or are using a dummy email account. However, you still should keep records of all correspondence and any information you've received over the course of the transaction. Keep in mind that fraud essentially is theft by deception, so proving the intent to deceive is crucial to any fraud case. If the person didn't know the information they were giving you was false, they may not be liable for fraud. For example, suppose you respond to a Craigslist classified ad posted by someone offering to sell her 2005 Volkswagen Beetle for $8,000. In the listing, she states the vehicle has no mechanical problems. However, after purchasing the car you take it to a mechanic and discover the transmission is blown. The seller isn't guilty of fraud unless it can be proven that she knew the car needed a new transmission and intentionally lied about it to get more money from you for the car."
