      "content": "In keeping with Jedi philosophy, the disarming strike attempts to disarm the opponent instead of killing them. It consists of a strong attack at your opponents weapon, in an attempt to rip it from their grasp - or chop it in half.

      "content": "Because of it's broad, sweeping movements, Shii-Cho is suitable for use against multiple opponents. However, a single opponent can easily find and exploit flaws in your attacks. In addition, the second lightsaber form, Makashi, was specifically designed for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat. Do not use Shii-Cho against a Makashi user."
