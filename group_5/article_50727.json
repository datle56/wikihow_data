      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and grease 2 round pans. You can use two 8 or 9-in (20 or 23 cm) cake pans. Butter and flour the pans or spray them with baking spray. To make it even easier to remove the cakes, consider lining the pans with parchment paper. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Dissolve the powdered milk in the water. Measure 4 tablespoons (26 g) of powdered milk into a bowl and pour in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of water. Whisk or stir until the powdered milk is completely dissolved. If you'd like, use 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of liquid milk instead of reconstituting the powdered milk."

      "content": "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Put 4 cups (520 g) of plain flour into a large bowl and add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking powder. If you'd like the cake to be lightly spiced, add 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of grated nutmeg. Whisk the dry ingredients for about 30 seconds so that they are fully combined."

      "title": "Cream the butter, margarine, and sugar for 5 to 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Cream the butter, margarine, and sugar for 5 to 10 minutes. Place 1 cup (226 g) of softened unsalted butter, 1 cup (226 g) of margarine, and 2 cups (400 g) of sugar into a large mixing bowl. Use an electric or stand mixer to beat them together on medium speed. The creamed mixture should become pale and fluffy. If you don't have a mixer, use a wooden spoon. Keep in mind that it will take 5 to 10 minutes longer to cream the mixture by hand. Let the butter soften naturally at room temperature, not in the microwave. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Beat in 10 eggs 1 at a time on medium speed.",
      "content": "Beat in 10 eggs 1 at a time on medium speed. Keep the mixer running while you add 1 egg at a time to the creamed mixture. Once the egg is incorporated, add the next egg. Continue beating them in until you've added a total of 10 eggs. Room temperature eggs will blend into the batter the best. If they're cold the batter may separate, but it will come together again when you add the dry ingredients."

      "content": "Beat the batter for 2 minutes at medium-high speed and add the vanilla. Turn the mixer up and beat the batter so that it becomes pale. Then add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla and beat it until it's incorporated."

      "title": "Alternate adding the dry mixture and the milk.",
      "content": "Alternate adding the dry mixture and the milk. Turn the mixer to low and beat in about 1/3 of the dry mix. Then beat in half of the milk before you add another 1/3 of the dry mix. Beat in the rest of the milk and then the rest of the flour. Stop beating as soon as the last of the dry mix is incorporated. It's fine if there are a few lumps in the cake batter. Over beating the batter will make the cake tough and dense."

Put both pans in the oven and bake them until they become golden brown and begin to pull away from the side of the pan. To test if the cakes are done, insert a cake tester or skewer into the center. The tester should come out clean. If it doesn't, bake the cake for 3 to 5 more minutes and check again. [3] X Research source"
