Peters says “solvents like acetone or rubbing alcohol…quickly remove leftover adhesive.” Simply dampen a clean cloth, cotton ball, or paper towel with rubbing alcohol or acetone. Then, repeatedly press the solvent into the carpet and rub the spot slightly to remove the adhesive residue. Blot the area with a damp cloth to remove any leftover solvent and sticky residue. Note : Test the rubbing alcohol or acetone on a hidden part of the carpet before using it in a visible location to ensure it doesn’t damage or stain the fabric. Other solvents like nail polish remover, vodka, and isopropyl alcohol work to remove tape residue. If the adhesive is stubborn, lay an alcohol or acetone-soaked cloth over the spot for 10 to 15 minutes to help dissolve the residue."

[5] X Research source Clean your carpet with warm water and dish soap or a commercial carpet cleaner to remove the WD-40. Note : Test the WD-40 on an inconspicuous part of your carpet before you apply it to a visible area to make sure it doesn't stain or damage your carpet. For example, test it on a spot behind your sofa. Don't leave the WD-40 on your carpet for longer than 15-30 minutes. If you do, it might weaken the glue that holds your carpet down."
