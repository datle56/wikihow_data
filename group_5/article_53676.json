Next, add a “Gaussian Blur” effect on the circle in this way: Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur. And then set the radius to 20 pixels. For the shadow, copy and subtract the main shape to form a small shadow on the moon. Set the color to (5) C=72.51, M=2.45, Y=14.11, K=0. Then set the transparency to multiply with opacity of 20%. You now have a sleeping crescent moon created using Adobe Illustrator. Add other details such as a sky, stars or clouds such as in this picture."
