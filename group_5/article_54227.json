      "content": "Make a study schedule. To make sure you don’t leave studying to the last minute, create a schedule for when you will study during the days or weeks before the exam. [2] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. For example, you could commit to studying for one hour a day right after school for one week before the exam. Making a study schedule can help you to avoid allowing other activities to interfere with studying. Plan to study for about 45 minutes at a time. It’s difficult to concentrate for more than 45 minutes. You may find it easier to concentrate if you take short breaks once an hour. [3] X Research source If the test will cover a lot of material, consider using the “chunking” technique. Break your topic into sections so that you can focus on each one comfortable instead of trying to cover all of the material in every study session. [4] X Research source You can then plan your study sessions around specific sections of the material."

If the exam is open-book, this summary sheet can also be a helpful guide to your notes or textbook while you’re taking the test. Keep your learning style in mind when creating your study tools. For example, if you are a more visual learner, you may retain more information by drawing diagrams or mindmaps."

You’ll need to prepare differently depending on whether your exam will require you to write an essay or answer multiple choice questions. Make sure you know what kind of test you’ll be taking and prepare accordingly. [6] X Research source If you are taking a standardized test, take a few practice tests to familiarize yourself with the structure and timing of the test. [7] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. For national standardized tests like the SAT, you will be able to find copies of previous versions of the test which you can take for practice. If you will be taking an essay exam, practice writing essay responses while you study. It can be helpful to time yourself so that you know you’ll be able to complete the essay during the allotted test period. If your test involves a lot of memorized material, remember that you probably won’t remember everything on the first try. Memorization and recall improve with repetition.

      "content": "Think positively. Scientific research has shown that our expectations can affect our performance. If you expect to do well on the exam, you will still have to study; but if you expect to do poorly, studying may not be enough to help you do well. [10] X Research source Practice self-affirmation - the process of transforming your thoughts to focus on the positive and downplay the negative. For example, remind yourself that you worked hard to prepare for this test. Challenge your negative thoughts. For example, if you think that doing badly on the exam will ruin your life, tell yourself that this is not true. Then replace that thought with a more accurate one - failing a test may hurt your grade, but it’s not the end of the world. [11] X Research source If you’re having a hard time quelling negative thoughts, try distracting yourself using humor. Watch a funny movie or TV show, read a funny book or comic. You can even try to remember all of the jokes you know."

Remind yourself that manageable levels of anxiety can increase your alertness and energy. [13] X Research source To combat anxiety that arises when you’re first given the exam, make sure to read over the entire test before beginning. Look for “easy” questions - when you’re prepared, you shouldn’t have trouble finding them.

Imagine yourself getting the test back with the grade you want. While visualization can’t replace preparation, it can help you to feel more confident, which can improve performance. [14] X Research source Visualization works because your brain and body react to visualization as if you were actually experiencing the event you’re imagining. Your brain forms and strengthens connections as a result - in this case, between test taking and success."

Anything you can do to counteract these physical reactions will help you think more clearly and feel more confident. Remember to use these techniques during the test if you feel anxious. Calming techniques include: [15] X Research source Breathing. Breathing exercises can help you to relax, including slow, abdominal breathing and ‘equal breathing’ - equalizing the time you spend breathing in and breathing out. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Stretching. You don’t have to do a full yoga routine to get the benefits of stretching. Try stretching your arms above your head and behind your back to release shoulder tension; standing forward bends can release back and neck tension. Relaxing your muscles. You may not even be aware that you’re holding tension in your muscles. To become aware, try a body scan, which involves focusing on each body part for a few seconds, starting with the toes and moving up progressively to the top of your head. Walking. Moving your body will help clear your mind. Just remember to pay attention to your surroundings -- don’t spend the whole walk worrying about the exam!"

Ask a member of your support group to let you explain the material that will be on the test to them. You need a solid understanding of a concept to be able to explain it to someone who doesn’t know much about it. If you can explain the Second Law of Thermodynamics or the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire to your grandmother, you may feel more confident that you have a grasp of the material. Friends and family may also be able to help you in peripheral ways. For example, if you know you tend to sleep through your alarm clock, ask a reliable member of your support group to call you to make sure you’re awake."
