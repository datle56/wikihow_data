      "content": "Surrendering lets you take back half of your bet if you have a weak hand. After you’re dealt in a round of blackjack, you have the choice to surrender on your turn. When you surrender, you drop out of the round and the dealer keeps 50% of your bet. You get the other half of your bet back to use again later on. [1] X Research source If a table has an early surrender rule, then you immediately get half your bet back when you surrender. If the blackjack table has a late surrender , you only get half your bet back if the dealer doesn’t have a blackjack."

      "content": "Surrender if you have a hard 16 and the dealer has a 9, 10, or Ace. A hard 16 means that you do not have an Ace. When the dealer has a 9, 10, or Ace, they have a high probability of hitting a blackjack. With a hard 16, most of the cards in the deck would make you lose or bust, so it’s better to surrender and recover some of your bet. [2] X Research source When you have 16 in your hand from an Ace and a 5 in your hand, then choose to hit because you have a soft hand. For a soft hand, the Ace can count as 1 or 11, so you won’t risk busting. If you have a pair of 8s, then choose to split your hand. That way, you play 2 hands at the same time and you have better odds of beating the dealer."

      "content": "Surrender if you’re dealt a hard 15 and the dealer is showing 10. When the dealer has a 10 or face card, they have a high probability of getting 20 or blackjack from their next card. With a hard 15, you’re more likely to bust or get a lower total than the dealer. [3] X Research source If you have a hard 15 and the dealer has an Ace, then surrender if they are required to hit on a soft 17."

      "title": "Surrender with 17+ if the dealer has an Ace and hits on soft 17s.",
      "content": "Surrender with 17+ if the dealer has an Ace and hits on soft 17s. Some casinos or blackjack tables require the dealer to hit when their hand has a total of 17. When their up-card is an Ace, they have a good chance of getting blackjack or reaching a higher total than you. With 17 or more points in your hand, surrendering protects you from busting or losing your entire bet."

      "title": "Tell the dealer you’d like to surrender instead of hitting or standing.",
      "content": "Tell the dealer you’d like to surrender instead of hitting or standing. When the dealer gets to you, just say out loud that you’d like to surrender the round. The dealer will take your cards and half of your bet, but you get to keep the other half. If the blackjack table uses the late surrender rule, you won’t get your bet back until the dealer checks their face-down card. If they end up getting a blackjack, they keep all of your bet instead."

While some die-hard blackjack players refuse to do it, surrendering during a game is a really advantageous play when you’re trying to save your money. Plus, you’ll be able to have fun and play for longer since you aren’t losing as many chips when you have a bad hand."
