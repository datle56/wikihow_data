Gaining access to your computer’s heatsink and/or CPU will vary depending on the computer you have, especially if you built your own PC . Refer to its owner’s manual to find out how to identify, access, remove, and reinstall the necessary parts. If you don’t have a hard copy, search the manufacturer’s website for a copy online. Some heatsinks have four screws that must be removed first. Other heatsinks will just need a simple twist to remove. When removed correctly, you should see the CPU with the old thermal paste."
