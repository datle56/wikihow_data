      "content": "Mix the water and cement together. Add 5 gallons of water to your cement mixer or wheelbarrow. Then, add the cement mix. For best mixing results, add the first half of your 94lb bag of concrete mix to your mixer or wheelbarrow. Mix until the cement is even throughout the whole thing and then add the last half of the bag. Once thoroughly mixed, prepare to add sand."

      "title": "Add 1 to 2 buckets of sand to your cement mixer or wheelbarrow.",
      "content": "Add 1 to 2 buckets of sand to your cement mixer or wheelbarrow. Sand dictates the weight and firmness of your blocks. For a lightweight result, you can use 1 bucket of sand, or for a stronger result, you can use 2 buckets of sand. Once the sand has been thoroughly mixed, prepare to add your perlite."

      "title": "Perlite is what gives your concrete that porous texture when finished.",
      "content": "Perlite is what gives your concrete that porous texture when finished. Add one 5 gallon bucket of perlite to your mix first. Perlite will absorb the water in the mixture and thicken your mix. Depending on how thick you want your mixture, add anywhere from 5 to 25 gallons of perlite. Once youâ€™ve reached the desired thickness, prepare to fill your block molds."

      "content": "Scoop or pour the cement mixture into your block molds. Ensure that you are doing so on a leveled surface. Pour your foam cement mixture into the molds. If the molds are small, pour the cement mix into a wheelbarrow and fill the molds with your shovel. For best drying results, cover the molds with plastic wrap."
