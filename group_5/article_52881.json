      "content": "Wear an eyepatch over your good eye for 2-6 hours each day. When you have lazy eye, your stronger eye over-compensates for your weaker eye. Covering your good eye with an eyepatch will force your weak eye to work harder. Over time, this helps correct lazy eye. Use your eyepatch 2-6 hours a day for 3-6 months to see if it helps you. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For convenience, you might wear the patch at the same time every day. However, changing your time frame for wearing the patch won't affect your progress. Covering your stronger eye will help your weaker eye whether you're near-sighted or far-sighted. However, you might focus on close-up tasks if you can't see far away and might avoid reading if you're far-sighted. It may take longer than 6 months to get significant results. However, you should start seeing some change after 3-6 months."

      "content": "Cover the glasses lens over your good eye with a Bangerter filter. Bangerter filters work just like an eyepatch but can only be used with glasses. Additionally, they won’t draw attention to you like an eyepatch might. Stick the self-adhesive filter over your glasses lens to blur the vision in your good eye. Wear the filter for 3-4 hours a day for 3-6 months. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might prefer to wear the filter at the same time each day so it becomes a habit. However, it's okay to vary your time frame if that's more convenient for you. You can buy Bangerter filters online or through your doctor’s office. They can help improve your vision whether you're near-sighted or far-sighted. However, it may be best to do only close-up tasks if you're near-sighted and to avoid reading if you're far-sighted. You may need to use the Bangerter filter for longer than 6 months to get results, but you will likely notice improvements after 3-6 months."

Choose quick games like Pacman and Tetris that are repetitive and play 1 to 1.5 hours a day. [8] X Research source You can buy dichotic glasses through your doctor or an online eyeglasses store.
