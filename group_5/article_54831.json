      "content": "Use degreasing soap to quickly remove hair dye. Sometimes, a little soap and water is all you need! Grab a clean towel and get it wet, then add a few drops of dish soap. Scrub the sink to remove most of the hair dye and tackle any stains left behind. [1] X Research source The great part about using soap to clean is that it’s safe for almost every surface in your bathroom. If you got hair dye on your counter, tub, or shower, use soap to quickly clean it off. Soap might not remove the hair dye entirely. If you can still see some color, move on to another method."

      "content": "Rubbing alcohol strips the color out of tough stains. Grab a bottle of rubbing alcohol and dip a cotton pad into it. Use the cotton pad to rub at the stains to remove most of the dye. Then, leave the cotton pad with rubbing alcohol on it sitting on top of the stain for 5 minutes before rinsing with warm water. [2] X Research source Rubbing alcohol is fine for most surfaces except varnished or painted ones. Using rubbing alcohol on surfaces like these can strip the color, so use caution."

      "title": "Baking soda is mildly abrasive, so it can tackle tough stains.",
      "content": "Baking soda is mildly abrasive, so it can tackle tough stains. Mix 1 tsp (5.6 g) of baking soda with water until it forms a thick paste. Spread the paste onto the hair dye stain, then let it sit for 1 hour. After an hour, come back and scrub the stain with a clean cloth before rinsing with water. [4] X Research source Baking soda is safe to clean most surfaces, but scrubbing too aggressively can damage some materials, like enamel and porcelain. If you have a varnished or enamel sink or tub, use caution with baking soda, especially when it comes time to scrub the stain. You could also try scrubbing your sink with a Magic Eraser . These sponges are also mildly abrasive, so they work about as well as baking soda does."

      "content": "Bleach easily takes care of stains on white porcelain. Pour equal amounts of bleach and water into a spray bottle, then cover up your bathroom countertops with paper towels to prevent overspray. Spritz the stains with the bleach mixture, then let it sit for 1 hour. Rinse your sink with clean water to remove the stains. [5] X Research source Using bleach is ideal for white porcelain sinks that could be damaged with other cleaning products. Bleach is a very strong cleaning agent. Always work in a ventilated area, and use gloves to protect your hands when cleaning. Oxygenated bleaches, like OxiClean , also work well on white sinks."

Since Bar Keeper’s Friend is abrasive, it has the potential to scratch or damage the porcelain on your sink if you scrub too hard."
