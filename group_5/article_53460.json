Do this only if you have experience with fasting. The liver flush itself can cause nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting. If you're not used to fasting, these effects may be amplified. If you are an experienced faster, consider doing a three to seven day juice fast before the liver flush. Apple juice is rich in malic acid and liminoid, which can help break down gallstones."

Squeeze the grapefruits, oranges, and lemons separately and do not mix the juices at first. You will need 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice, 1/4 cup of orange juice, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Mix them together well, then split the mixture up into separate glasses, each filled with 1/4 cup of juice. You will also need 1 cup of olive oil separated into four doses of ¼ cup each."

      "content": "Go on a two-day apple juice fast. For centuries, scientists have researched ways to treat gallstones without surgery. A liver flush is a \"chemical contact\" treatment, in which you consume chemicals that break up the gallstone from within. [5] X Research source Helmstadter, Axel. “Ether and the Chemical-Contact Dissolution of Gallstones.” Lancet (London, England) 354.9187 (1999): 1367. MEDLINE with Full Text. Web. 15 July 2015. Many chemical contact treatments doctors tried throughout history had long-term negative side-effects on patients. The malic acid and liminoid found in apples, though, have relatively benign side effects that last a short amount of time. [6] X Research source Dekkers, R. \"Apple Juice And The Chemical-Contact Softening Of Gallstones.\" Lancet (London, England) 354.9196 (1999): 2171. MEDLINE with Full Text. Web. 15 July 2015. Don’t drink juices made from concentrate or that have added sugars. Look for natural apple products. Keep the juice at room temperature, and mix it with warm water to further raise the temperature when you drink it. Drink 16 oz. (2 cups) of organic apple juice or apple cider every 2 hours between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on both days"

Again, you can substitute the juice from half a lemon if you don’t have sea salt. Eat only vegetables and clear broths for the rest of the day. The nausea you felt the night before should pass once you get some food in your stomach, and you should pass your gallstones sometime during the third or fourth day."
