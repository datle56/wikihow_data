      "content": "Actions are the best way to build trust. There are no magic words that make someone trust you. Instead, you'll need to prove that you're dependable through your actions. If you say you want good communication and honesty in your relationship, take the time to sit down, look her in the eyes, and have those tough conversations. [1] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. This goes for everything, not just relationship conversations. If you agree to go on a trip with her, then take the time to actually plan that trip."

    {
      "title": "Listen",
      "content": "Listen without focusing on yourself. Communication is super important in a relationship, but that doesn't just mean you talk a lot. Focus on what the other person is saying, wait a moment to process it, and then reply. It's easy to think mainly about your own thoughts and feelings. If you want her to trust you, slow down and actively listen to show that you're worth opening up to. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Try repeating what you just heard, for instance: \"I'm hearing that you're upset because I was late to our date. Is that right?\" This validates the other person's concerns and makes it easy to clear up any misunderstandings."

      "title": "Don't assume you know how best to help her.",
      "content": "Don't assume you know how best to help her. People need different kinds of support. If she's going through a tough time, does she want someone to vent to? Someone to help find a solution? Someone to sit quietly with? Or does she just want to be left alone for a while? The best way to show that you're dependable is to ask how you can help, respect the answer, and provide the kind of help that she's looking for.

      "title": "Show that you trust her with your own problems.",
      "content": "Show that you trust her with your own problems. In the long run, any healthy relationship relies on the ability to talk about difficult subjects. You can't decide when another person is ready to open up, but you can control your end of the conversation. When you're having a tough time, tell her about your fear or pain. And if a problem shows up in your relationship, don't be afraid to bring it up and try to work on it together. [4] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Still in the \"casual fun\" stage of dating? If you're ready for a deeper emotional connection, then at some point you have to make the move—but it's not unreasonable to wait until you're spending time together outside of scheduled dates, and have met each other's friends."

      "title": "Suggest using timeouts or written conversation.",
      "content": "Suggest using timeouts or written conversation. Trust issues can make arguments feel overwhelming, and cause someone to run away or shut the conversation down. If this is a problem, talk to her while you're both calm and ask \"What would help you to not feel like you have to run away when we have these arguments?\" Brainstorm ideas together, and suggest these if they seem helpful: [5] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. A timeout system: either person can call a timeout to pause the argument and get some space to cool off. That person comes back and starts the conversation again when they're ready. If talking feels too overwhelming, stop and exchange thoughts in writing instead."

    {
      "title": "Use \"I\" statements to focus on yourself, not her.",
      "content": "Use \"I\" statements to focus on yourself, not her. If you're unhappy with something she did, bring it up by talking about how it made you feel. This focuses on a problem (your negative feelings) that you can both try to solve together. Avoid criticizing her or her actions, since this pits you against each other. Trust comes from cooperation, not fighting. [6] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. For example, say \"I feel disappointed that our date didn't go well\" instead of \"You ruined our date.\""

      "title": "Trust takes time.",
      "content": "Trust takes time. Keep being reliable, following through on your promises, and working on good communication, and trust will slowly build up. You can't expect someone to suddenly trust you completely, especially if she's recovering from a betrayal in her past.

      "title": "Ultimately, the work she puts in is the most important.",
      "content": "Ultimately, the work she puts in is the most important. Feeling insecure or emotionally withdrawn is an internal problem. You can support her, but you shouldn't see yourself as a hero saving her single-handedly. If she builds her self-esteem and confidence as an independent person, she will also be a healthier relationship partner. In the meantime, make sure you are working to become the best version of yourself that you can be, for your own sake.

They take work to maintain and to guide through difficult times, and that work can't come from just one person. [9] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Right now, that means you're making an effort to show that you're trustworthy—but your partner should meet you halfway. If the relationship is going to succeed, she'll at some point need to acknowledge her trust issues, discuss them with you, and work toward a solution."
