      "content": "Place 3 wood blocks on the bottom row of a crafting table. Build a crafting table and place 3 wood blocks in the bottom 3 slots of the 3 by 3 crafting interface. Stems and stripped logs can also work for this base layer. Any type of wood works for this—it doesn’t have to be a specific type."

      "title": "Place a triangle of sticks around the piece of coal or charcoal.",
      "content": "Place a triangle of sticks around the piece of coal or charcoal. Put your first 2 sticks to the left and right of the coal/charcoal. Then, place your 3rd stick on top of the coal/charcoal. Don’t have any sticks? Put a few wood planks in the center spot of the crafting table, and then put planks in the slot directly underneath it. Alternative: Use a piece of soul sand or soul soil to make a soul campfire. These items can be acquired in the Nether, which can be reached by making a Nether Portal . Soul campfires largely do the same thing as campfires, though their flames are a little less bright (but twice as damaging)."

      "content": "Grab the finished campfire and place it on the ground. After your sticks, charcoal, and wood blocks are in place, a campfire appears in the output box of the crafting table. Take the campfire so it goes directly into your inventory. Then, set your campfire in a spot where it could be useful, like a place where you’re setting up camp for the night. Campfires light automatically when you place them on the ground."

To make the smoke trail even more powerful, put the campfire on top of a hay bale when you first place it down. Using a hay bale with a campfire makes the smoke trail 24 blocks high."

If you’re camping out in the Nether, set out a soul campfire to keep nearby Piglins from attacking you. Wearing a gold item in the Nether also prevents Piglins from automatically attacking."
