      "content": "Jumping straight into a low-calorie diet is a shock to your system. When you go cold turkey, your body has no idea what's going on—so as a protective measure it clings onto your fat stores. Instead, ease your body into the diet by cutting your calories gradually. Set a reasonable daily calorie goal that you can reduce gradually. It might be 1,200 or 2,200 depending on your individual factors. Seek advice from your doctor, nutritionist, or dietician for guidance tailored to your needs."

To keep your body guessing and your metabolism up, try switching between higher and lower daily calorie intakes. This might help avoid that dreaded weight-loss plateau and improve your willpower. [1] X Research source In other words, if you do a low-calorie diet all the time, your body may adjust its metabolic rate so you don't lose too much fat. But if you keep it on its toes, it won't be able to regulate your fat stores as effectively. This plan should still be paired with lowering your average daily intake gradually. Ask a doctor or nutrition expert you trust for their take on this type of diet plan. Try tracking your daily calories and portion sizes in a food diary to better understand your eating habits and how they affect your body. Reader Poll: We asked 240 wikiHow readers and 50% said that they don’t track their food intake . [Take Poll] But studies show that this is an effective way to lose weight, so if you haven't tried yet, that's a great, expert-backed tip to support your fitness journey!"

However, cutting carbs alone may not help you shed fat unless you are also cutting your overall calories as part of the process. Remember that all carbs are not created equal (e.g., refined sugar and whole grains). There are okay carbs for you (the slow-burning kind like oatmeal and the ones in veggies); the bad ones are the simple sugars (think white things and candies)."

      "content": "Protein is used as building blocks for muscle in your body and won't turn to fat. Both protein and carbs contain roughly the same amount of calories per gram, but protein is not a preferred fuel like carbs. So make lean meats, fish, and soy a regular part of your diet. [7] X Research source When you're packing on protein and saying no to carbs, your brain will send signals, which you interpret as hunger, before switching to ketosis (i.e., fat burning). After that, your hunger pangs should subside. Eating a lot of protein is hard on the liver and kidneys, and there are other considerations for \"keto dieting.\" It is not advised to consume zero carbs; just limit them, and stick to the good ones."

If you absolutely must drink alcohol, keep it to one drink if you're a woman or two if you're a man. But that should only be a once-in-a-while thing, for the sake of your fat-burning goals."
