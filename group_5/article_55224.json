If you weren't notified about your court date or your landlord locked you out without giving you a chance to work out a payment plan, call your local legal aid office . In these situations, it's likely that your landlord didn't follow proper legal procedures. An attorney will look over your case for free and talk with you about your options. [1] X Research source Law schools often have landlord/tenant clinics where you can get free help as well. Your case will be primarily handled by a law student, but a licensed attorney will be in charge. It's fairly common for landlords to cut corners with evictions—and because tenants don't often call them on it, they usually get away with it."

Unfortunately, it likely won't mention the fact that you won the case, leaving potential landlords to assume you were evicted. [2] X Research source Avoid this by asking the judge to seal the record as soon as you win. [3] X Research source You can also enter an agreement with the landlord to seal your eviction record so no one will be able to see that you were evicted. Usually, this is part of a larger agreement for payment of past-due rent. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that sealing is not the same thing as having the eviction removed (\"expunged\"). Even if you have the record sealed, you're still technically required to disclose to potential landlords that you were evicted if you're asked. [5] X Research source"

As of August 2022, only 3 states—Oregon, Minnesota, and Nevada—allow evictions to be expunged. [6] X Research source Legislation has been introduced in several other states, including Connecticut, Florida, and California. [7] X Research source If you live in a state that allows expungement, call your local legal aid society —they'll help you file a motion in court. If you were evicted for nonpayment of rent, the judge typically won't expunge your case until after you've paid your debt in full.

[15] X Research source This option is especially valuable if you won the eviction case or moved out before the landlord could take you to court. Even though the record is still there, you weren't technically evicted, and that makes a big difference! This also gives you the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the eviction. For example, you might write, \"My youngest daughter was sick and I had to stay home with her. As a result, I lost my job and couldn't pay rent. I was evicted before I could make arrangements with the landlord.\""

It also gives you a chance to tell your side of the story in a non-confrontational way when the landlord will likely be more receptive. [16] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Before I fill out this application, I need to tell you that I was evicted a couple of years ago. I lost my job and was having a hard time making ends meet. Now, I have a new job that pays a lot more than the one I lost, and I really just want to put that chapter in my life behind me.\" If you've already applied at a bunch of different places, ask the landlord what tenant screening agency they use. If you've already dealt with a landlord who used the same agency, you'll know what's on that report so you can do damage control.

Most of these offices have wait lists, but they may still be able to help you or point you toward other resources.

[25] X Research source Landlords don't have to accept cosigners, but a lot of them do. It helps if your cosigner lives in the same state—even better if they're local. Keep in mind that this is a big thing you're asking them—they'll be on the hook if you don't pay your rent in full and on time.

But if you got evicted for nonpayment of rent, having an account in collections could put a serious dent in your score. [29] X Research source Once your landlord turns over your account to a collections agency, that agency will report the debt to at least 1 (if not all 3) credit bureaus.

If your landlord agrees to work with you, be sure to get it in writing! [30] X Research source Be upfront about your financial situation and what you can afford to pay to satisfy the debt. The landlord might be willing to accept less than what you owe if you're able to pay it at once.

[31] X Research source Collections agencies are usually willing to settle for much less than the total amount. They might include information about different payment plans you can choose, or you can negotiate your own. Plug the payments into your budget so you know how much you can afford.
