Keep in mind that darker colored flooring will take a bit longer to start looking dirty than lighter flooring. [1] X Research source Lower traffic areas will need to be swept around twice a week."

Keep the pile of swept dirt in each section, creating a new dirt pile in each section. [3] X Research source Don’t move the dirt pile around, as this will make the floor dirtier."

      "content": "Use a clean broom that’s in good shape. A clean broom is key to making sure that it will actually clean the floor, rather than add more dirt to it. The bristles should all be facing in one direction. [5] X Research source If the broom bristles are askew, invest in a new one."

      "title": "Vacuum high traffic areas at least 3 times per week.",
      "content": "Vacuum high traffic areas at least 3 times per week. Kitchens and living rooms require regular vacuuming, and this will increase as the number of people living in the house rises. Lower traffic areas such as bedrooms should be vacuumed once a week. As a general rule of thumb, vacuum an area as many times per week as the number of people that use that space. [7] X Research source For example, a 1-person bedroom can be swept weekly. However, a living area with 4 people should be swept 4 times per week. You will need to vacuum more often if you have a pet that sheds fur or a child with allergies. Move all of the small furniture out of the room once a month, so that you can vacuum the floor beneath it as part of a deeper cleaning routine. Move all of the large furniture out of the room to vacuum beneath it once or twice a year."

      "title": "Dust the room first.",
      "content": "Dust the room first. The HEPA filters in modern vacuum cleaners prevent fine debris from being emitted from the vacuum, which means that you don’t have to dust afterward. Use a microfiber cloth to dust objects, surfaces, and furniture. [8] X Research source Shake out the curtains too while you are dusting. Let the dust from the curtains settle on the ground for a few minutes before your vacuum."

The vacuum cleaner head has a crevice attachment that you can click on to vacuum around the edges of the room. Also go around the edges of furniture that you cannot vacuum beneath, such as couches. [11] X Research source Although you can use the regular vacuum cleaner head for doing the edges, you will get a much better result using the crevice attachment."

      "content": "Vacuum the rest of the room. Start by vacuuming the whole room in one direction, and then vacuum the space again at a right angle. This will make sure you are cleaning thoroughly, and that the vacuum picks up at much debris as possible. [13] X Research source Vacuum the whole floor twice if it is a high traffic area. Make sure that you area vacuuming slowly so that the machine has a chance to be effective. This will make lifting up pet hair faster, as you won’t need to do as many strokes."

[20] X Research source You can repeat this process for as many times as it is necessary to remove the water from that spot on your floor. The reason for only swishing the mop 3 times over the floor is because otherwise the dirty water is just being put onto the floor again."

Try not to get \"stuck\" in a certain area, as you will have to rewash it after you've walked over it. Clean from the far corner of any given room and work towards the door, so that you don't end up doing extra work."
