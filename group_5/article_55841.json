      "title": "Not all apps have dark icons.",
      "content": "Not all apps have dark icons. If you swipe over to the App Library, you'll probably see that some of your icons haven't changed color. While all of the preinstalled apps on your iPhone have both dark and light icons to choose from, you won't be able to change the color of other app icons if their developers haven't added dark icons in an update. If an app's icon has a solid background color that's part of its logo design (such as Amazon's brown box icon and Reddit's red robot icon), the developer may be unable to create a dark icon. Instead, they'll add a darker-tinted version of the original icon to match dark icon themes better. Quick fix: If you want darker icons but don't like that some icons are still brightly colored, use Tinted instead. This makes every icon on your iPhone a uniform tinted color."
