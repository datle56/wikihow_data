      "content": "Step into the shower. Start by washing and rinsing your hair, then wet your washcloth (not a reusable sponge) and wash your face. This way your pores aren't open when you rinse your hair creating zits from soap."

      "content": "Rinse and dry yourself off, especially between the toes to prevent athletes feet. You can also tap a small amount of powder on your toes if you are active most days and your shoes don't breath. Feet tend to sweat and can become itchy as moisture and dark places can create fungi."

      "content": "Shave and trim beard so it's neat. Don't be afraid to use your beard trimmer between your eyes or use pluckers at first to welcome two eyebrows. Unibrow is a no-no even if it's hardly noticeable. Don't forget to splash your preferred aftershave on or any skin creams that you use."

      "content": "Apply deodorant and choose something other than dry crumbly brands that ball up and fall out of your shirt during the day. If you chose antiperspirant with deodorant it may make your armpits on shirts yellow and deodorant alone may not be strong enough. Bleach your white tees every so often to get the yellow stains out if you enjoy the longevity of armpit scent."

      "title": "Depending on your hair type, you may go with wax, paste, gel, etc.",
      "content": "Depending on your hair type, you may go with wax, paste, gel, etc. It's great if you have a variety, that way your hair stays on edge, and works with you. Trying out different kinds for your hair type can make a huge difference. Maybe your hair holds with your desired preference in front but it's not strong enough to hold the stubborn hairs in the center. Use a stronger product such as wax to hold down the impossible and create the carefree look overall with paste."

      "title": "One can never own enough cologne!",
      "content": "One can never own enough cologne! Five sprays maximum, two on the arm rubbed together, one on each side of neckline, and last one on outside shirt. Mix up your scents every so often, it gets boring once you can't smell it anymore because you've become immune to it. That's one mistake people make when they can't smell quite as strong anymore. They will spray double making it unpleasant for others as they walk by. Change it up so you can smell it as fresh as everyone else!"
