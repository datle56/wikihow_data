      "title": "Slice the liver into strips about 3 in (7.6 cm) thick.",
      "content": "Slice the liver into strips about 3 in (7.6 cm) thick. Start on 1 side of the liver, cutting it lengthwise. Keep each piece as uniform as possible. You can make the slices smaller if you would like, but remember that smaller pieces cook faster. You can also slice the liver horizontally into steaks. The steaks will cook evenly as long as they are thin and flat. However, you won’t be able to fit more than 1 into the pan at a time."

      "title": "Heat butter or olive oil over medium heat.",
      "content": "Heat butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of oil or butter to a large frying pan. You can use either substance to cook the liver the same way. Wait for the butter or oil to get hot enough before you add the liver. If you use butter, wait for it to melt and begin to foam. For olive oil, heat it until it sizzles, but remove the pan from heat if the oil begins to smoke."

      "title": "Put the liver in the pan and season it with salt and pepper.",
      "content": "Put the liver in the pan and season it with salt and pepper. Set the liver in the oil or butter, then apply the seasoning directly to its top. Use about 1 teaspoon, or .17 oz (4.8 g), of both salt and pepper. Sprinkle it as evenly across the liver as you can. [1] X Research source Season the liver to your tastes. You can always use more or less seasoning."

      "title": "Fry the liver for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.",
      "content": "Fry the liver for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Leave the liver still in the butter or oil for a couple of minutes. The side down in the pan will begin to brown. After a couple of minutes pass, flip the liver over so the top side is down in the pan. Wait for each piece of liver to finish browning. The cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the liver. Thinner pieces may require less cooking time."

      "title": "Check the liver for a brown coloring to make sure it is done cooking.",
      "content": "Check the liver for a brown coloring to make sure it is done cooking. A finished piece of liver is golden brown on the outside but slightly pink in the center. Leaving the center pink prevents the liver from overcooking. You can test the liver’s doneness by cutting into it. You can also use a kitchen thermometer to make sure the temperature in the center of the meat is at least 158 °F (70 °C). Overcooked liver is chewy and grainy. If you have had overcooked steak, you know how unpleasant overcooked liver is to eat!"

      "content": "Slice the liver and the other ingredients. Slice 1 lb (0.45 kg) of cleaned liver into small pieces or thin halves. Dice 2 banana shallots, 1 clove of garlic, and 5 oz (140 g) of thick, smoked bacon by cutting them into small cubes. Chop up about 5 sprigs of fresh parsley and 2 Portobello mushrooms. [2] X Research source Separate the shallots, garlic, and parsley from the other ingredients. Add them to a separate mixing bowl and set it aside. If you have lettuce, cut the leaves in half lengthwise. You can also make potatoes, a mash, or use other fresh vegetables in place of the lettuce."

Add 1 1 ⁄ 8 oz (32 g) of butter, letting it warm until it melts and begins foaming. [6] X Research source A large frying pan should be big enough. You won’t need to add all of the remaining ingredients at once, so space probably won’t be an issue."

Leave the liver to cook, then flip it over and cook the other side. Take the liver out of the pan when it is finished. [9] X Research source You can cook the liver in multiple batches if you don’t have enough space in your pan. The liver should be golden brown on the outside and slightly pink in the center. Test it with a thermometer to make sure it cooks through."

      "title": "Set the pâté in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Set the pâté in the refrigerator. Cool temperatures allow the liver to set, giving it a more solid consistency similar to a loaf you can cut. This will take between 15 to 30 minutes. Then, you can eat the liver with a spoon or with bread or crackers. The pâté cools quicker when it is divided into smaller portions, so you may need to give it more time to cool if it is in 1 big container. If you don’t plan on eating the pâté right away, melt another 1.8 oz (51 g) of butter and pour it over the pâté. It helps the pâté keep its shape."

      "title": "Pull the membrane off the outside of the liver.",
      "content": "Pull the membrane off the outside of the liver. Not all livers will still have the membrane on when you buy them. Look for a white, almost transparent film over the dark, red liver. You can also detect it by touching the liver, feeling for a soft, slimy substance. Reach your fingers underneath the membrane and pull it off of the liver completely. [14] X Research source If the membrane sticks the liver, cut it off carefully using kitchen scissors or a sharp knife. Try to position the blade away from the liver so you don’t accidentally cut it. A good piece of liver will be dark red, smooth, and firm to the touch. If the membrane is there, it will affect how the liver looks and feels."

      "title": "Cut off any exposed veins or tubes with a sharp blade.",
      "content": "Cut off any exposed veins or tubes with a sharp blade. Look over the liver to make sure it is flat and smooth before you cook it. The liver may have noticeable veins and tubes on its surface. They will look round and gristly. Slice them off as close to the liver as possible with a sharp pair of kitchen scissors or a knife. [15] X Research source Be sure to remove any remaining connective tissue you notice. The tissue will look like white streaks, the same as the membrane you may have removed earlier. The parts you removed are rough and not tasty, so you can throw them away."

      "content": "Rinse the liver under running water. Get a stream of cool water flowing in your sink. Use the water to ensure that any remaining gristle or membrane pieces are gone. The liver should look and feel completely smooth when you are done. [16] X Research source You can safely skip rinsing if you are sure you have removed all of the tubes and membrane. Any bacteria on the liver will be taken care of during the cooking process."

    {
      "title": "Pat the liver dry before cooking it.",
      "content": "Pat the liver dry before cooking it. Set a paper towel on your countertop. Dab the liver with a second paper towel until it feels dry. You should do this even if you didn’t rinse the liver. This is because a dry piece of liver cooks more evenly than a piece with moisture on it. Take extra time to dry the liver if you rinsed it off. Use multiple paper towels as needed."
