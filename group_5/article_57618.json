      "content": "Asking someone out right away can be a little off-putting. Instead, try chatting with this guy back and forth for at least a couple of hours (or even a couple of days) before you make your move. There’s no rush to ask someone out, and talking to him online let’s you get to know them a little more before you ask them out. [1] X Research source There’s no magic number of messages you should go for, but in general, 5 to 10 messages back and forth is the minimum."

      "content": "This is a great way to start a conversation on social media. If you’re scrolling through Instagram and he posts a funny story, send him a message telling him that you just laughed out loud. If you’re on Twitter and he drops a hot selfie, DM him and tell him how good he looks. Social media posts are a great way to grab easy conversation starters without a ton of effort. [2] X Research source For instance, after he posts a meme you might say, “LOL, where the heck did you find this??” In response to a cute selfie, you might say, “Wow, you’re a sight for sore eyes. You look great!”"

      "content": "This is a subtle way to let him know you’re interested. Keep your compliments relatively tame, and don’t say anything specific about his body or physique (since that can be a little weird to hear online). If this is your first time chatting, tell him he has a nice smile or that he takes great pictures. Try something like: [3] X Expert Source Collette Gee Dating Coach Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. “That picture you took of the mountain is so nice! I feel like I’m actually there.” “You have such a nice smile!”"

      "content": "Show him that you’re interested in his life. Ask him a few open-ended questions to learn more about him and what he likes to do. You could chat about his hobbies, his friends, or even his pets if he has them. This is a great way to get to know each other a little more before you dive into asking him out. Try things like: [4] X Expert Source Collette Gee Dating Coach Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. “What do you get up to on the weekends?” “Who have you been hanging out with lately?” “Do you have any pets?”"

For instance, if you both like rock climbing, you might say, “Heading to the climb center this weekend?” If you checked out his profile and realized that you both love going hiking, you might say, “I just saw that pic you posted on your hike!

People usually only tease each other when they’re into them, so try poking fun at something he likes or something he did. Keep it super playful, and throw in an “lol” or a few emojis so he knows you’re not being serious. You could say something like: [6] X Expert Source Collette Gee Dating Coach Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. “Wow, you’ve never been to Disneyland?

If he doesn’t have plans, then you know he might be open to you asking him out. If he says he’s busy (and he doesn’t offer up an alternative), then it might be a sign that he’s just not into you.

When you’re crafting the perfect message to send this guy, try to think of a potential date idea instead of just asking him to hang out. This will show him that you’ve put a lot of thought into asking him out, and he’ll probably be more likely to say yes! Try something like: [10] X Research source “Do you wanna go frisbee golfing with me on Saturday? We could grab drinks afterward.” “There’s a new coffee shop downtown I wanted to try. Want to meet me there after work on Tuesday?” Reader Poll: We asked 2378 wikiHow readers about which first date they’d like to go on the most, and only 8% said going rock climbing .

If you’re on a dating app or social media, consider giving this guy your number before you stop messaging each other just in case he needs to get ahold of you. Then, you can wait patiently for your date to get to know this guy even more. [11] X Research source You could say something like, “Awesome! So Friday at 2:00 then?”"

[12] X Expert Source Collette Gee Dating Coach Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. Rejection is rarely ever about you as a person.
