Do you see Major Leaguers hitting towering home runs with bad technique? Do you see swimmers carving through water at breakneck speeds with bad technique? We didn't think so either. The right punching technique will not only make your punches harder; it will make them more efficient, meaning less energy gets packed into a bigger punch you will have to practice.

      "content": "Get your feet and legs in the right position. Your feet and legs are the anchors of your weight. They keep you balanced, but allow you to transfer power from your lower body to your upper body, right through to your fist. Here are some quick tips for you to consider when using your feet and legs. [2] X Research source Place your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart. When in doubt, place them apart a little further. Lift your back foot heel up, and keep it lifted. Don't be \"flat\" footed. Point your toes in the direction of your punch. Pointing your feet away from your target will deliver a less forceful punch. Keep your knees bent. When you punch, your knees can then extend, giving your punch extra power."

Now try moving your hips and torso when you punch. It's at least twice as forceful as the first punch, right? Think about it: professional golfers, tennis players, and baseball players all use their hips and torso to generate extra power. There's no reason why you shouldn't, too. [3] X Research source Use your hips to swing your torso back. Think of it like cocking a gun. Then unload by reversing your hip movement, swinging your torso towards the target."

      "content": "Make sure you exhale before you punch. Breathing out, or exhaling, will help loosen your muscles right before contact. If you're having trouble exhaling before you punch, make a noise as you punch. Martial artists do this all the time to ensure that they've exhaled. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Lean your head over slightly, tuck your chin, and look at your target while punching. You lean slightly and tuck your head so that your head is out of the way from counterattack; keeping it still would just make it easier to target. Keep your target in sight to direct your hand to punch. This is a natural guiding method for your hand."

      "content": "Streamline your arm and fist. Aside from the power you generate from your hips, proper arm and fist technique is the most important part of a successful punch. Here are some tips you can use to make sure you're getting the most out of your arm and fist. Keep both your arm and fist relaxed until immediately before contact. As you feel contact with the opponent, tighten your fist. A relaxed fist will travel better through the air, but a tight fist will deliver more of a punch. Punch straight with your arm, not with an arc. You might be tempted to trace a long arc with your punch, but don't: Remember that your power comes from your hips and torso, not from the path of the arm. Don't cock back your hand or arm. This is called \"telegraphing,\" or showing the opponent what you're going to be doing before you do it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Practice jabbing the air with the dumbbells.",
      "content": "Practice jabbing the air with the dumbbells. Punching with dumbbells will increase your speed and shoulder endurance as well as building strength when you deliver the punch. Start off by doing 12-15 reps of punches on one hand, and then switch to the other hand. Try to shoot for 10 sets on each hand; do this daily. Remember to not overtrain your dominant hand at the expense of the other. If you have an obvious weakness in one hand, focus on training that hand. In a fight, a smart opponent will try to exploit your weak side. Not giving him an exploitation point will make you a stronger fighter. Gradually increase the weight as you become accustomed to the lower weight. Increase your weight will make your arm-strength and speed increase without trying you will get knocked out. Never punch a punching bag with dumbbell weights in your hand. Only air-jab with weights in your hand."
