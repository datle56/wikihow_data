This will take into account your vehicle’s condition, mileage, and other details to give you an estimated transaction price, which is the price you want to end up at after negotiations. Set your asking price roughly 10-15% higher than the FMV to leave room for negotiations. For instance, if you want to sell your car at $5,000, set the asking price at $5,750. For more expensive cars, leave more room for negotiation. For instance, if you want to sell your car at $15,000, set the asking price at $16,500. Set your car just below benchmark numbers so the buyer feels like the price is lower than it actually is. For example, if you want to sell your car for $10,000, set the asking price at $9,900 instead. To make sure your asking price is in the right ballpark, run a quick search to see what similar cars are selling for in your area. You may want to have your car professionally appraised, as they can give you the value of your car in writing. This can be a valuable resource when negotiating price later on. [2] X Research source"
