      "title": "You will need the following:",
      "content": "You will need the following: An original bottle of Dettol solution, which is a liquid disinfectant available from most supermarkets, pharmacists or general stores. Do not get any variation of the Dettol solution or your results may vary from those intended. Two old toothbrushes, preferably hard or medium in strength, as soft toothbrushes fail to remove as much paint. Some sort of fine object, such as toothpick, pin or paper clip. These will come in handy later on in the process. A large container, about the size of a gherkin jar or larger. Glass or plastic will suffice, but make sure it is one you can do without as it will not be usable after the process. Several rags or cloths, preferably thin so you can feel models through them. Again, make sure they are old and unwanted. Two rubber gloves. Dettol, while not dangerous, does dehydrate skin and can cause peeling and discomfort on areas exposed to it for too long. Wearing thin surgeon's gloves, or similar, will help you avoid this problem. [1] X Research source Access to running water, preferably where you are working with the process. Newspapers or covers for the area you will be working with, as it can get quite messy and the paint that you remove will be hard to get off any surfaces should it fall onto them. A well ventilated room. The mixture can give off a lot of fumes, which although harmless, can be a bit overwhelming in a confined space. An open door or a few open windows should allow sufficient airflow."

      "title": "You can create as much of the solution as you require.",
      "content": "You can create as much of the solution as you require. You can also vary the concentration. Generally, a 1:1 ratio of Dettol to cold tap water in the container you have brought will give you the best result in 24 hours. You can make the mixture with more water, for example a 1:2 ratio, but the models will need to rest in the solution for longer. So if you have bought a whole bottle of Dettol, the easiest thing to do is simply pour the bottle in and then mix in an equal amount of water, and add more if you wish. Nothing else needs to be done to the solution."

    {
      "title": "This solution works with both plastic and metal.",
      "content": "This solution works with both plastic and metal. It also works on both heavily painted and partially painted models. The mixture does loosen joints of \"green stuff\" modeling putty and occasionally super glue, so do not soak any models where you wish to keep the miniature in once piece with these adhesives.

      "content": "Most models will only need a day's soaking. [3] X Research source However, with the newer, stronger paints available and better knowledge of undercoating, some models will indeed need much longer before all the paint will come off. Of course, the mixture will not harm detail, so is perfectly safe for this period of time. Remember to screw the cap on of the container and leave it in a safe place."
    },
    {
      "title": "This should be done after 24–48 hours.",
      "content": "This should be done after 24–48 hours. First, remove the container cap and put on your gloves. The mixture should be almost opaque, maybe milky or brownish, and paint should have formed a loose slime covering on the models and with one of your toothbrushes, will be very easy to flick off onto your newspaper."

      "content": "Only use one toothbrush, as the second will be used later in the process. Flick away from you at roughly a 45 degree angle to the model's surface. Keep scrubbing away in all the grooves and areas until the paint is gone. If it won't budge, read further on. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Do NOT use tap water to remove loose paint. This is true for any of your equipment (i.e., your gloves if they are getting paint back on your clean model, you model if it still has loose paint etc.). This is very important - if you place the mixture with loose paint into water, it will clog up your brush and the model, and anything else it touches and make it near impossible to continue . See the tips and warnings sections for more information. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "This won't always be necessary.",
      "content": "This won't always be necessary. However, sometimes you will need to remove the majority of loose paint and place the model in the bath for a further 24 hours or so before the most difficult-to-remove paint will budge. Scrub off as much of the loose paint as you can and if it still isn't fully cleaned, place the model back in the mixture. Repeat these steps as many times as needed until you are happy that all the paint is gone."

      "title": "By now you should have a nice, bare model.",
      "content": "By now you should have a nice, bare model. However, there are a few more steps to go - paint can still be lurking in the recesses of the model and can obscure detail or even weaken layers of paint on top of it later in your painting."

      "title": "Take the models individually and rub them with your hands under a tap of running water.",
      "content": "Take the models individually and rub them with your hands under a tap of running water. It is safe to take your gloves off now as most of the mixture will be washed away. Rinse the models under the water until you can feel they have lost their \"slimy\" feel on your skin. Place them back on the cloth."

      "title": "Rub the cloth over the model's open areas.",
      "content": "Rub the cloth over the model's open areas. You will be surprised how much paint is still left on the model. This will also help dry the model fully for the next step."

      "content": "Flick off any remaining paint in the deep recesses. You can use your second toothbrush and the hard, slim object you have (i.e. paper clip, toothpick etc.). There is no need to get this brush into the mixture. Really look to force the toothbrush into the gaps and recesses to make sure there is no paint in them."

      "content": "Then, leave them to dry for about a day. After this time period, the model should hopefully be ready to be painted on and of course, all your paint will have been stripped in a non-lethal, easy way!"

      "content": "The Dettol mixture can be kept for a long time. However, generally, it begins to lose its effect after the second use. It would be advisable to throw the mixture away in a safe environment, clean the container out and then remake a new batch of the solution. [6] X Research source"
