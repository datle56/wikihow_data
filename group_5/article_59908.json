[2] X Research source The + button is located on the front of the watch directly below the watch face, and the - button is located on the bottom right side of the watch. On some Timex models, the + button reads “Start/Split” and the – button reads “Stop/Reset.” [3] X Research source This feature is useful for checking the time in another part of the world quickly. If you do business or have to make a phone call to different time zones, it’s handy to stay organized."
