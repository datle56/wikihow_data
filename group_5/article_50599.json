      "content": "An athame is a ritual knife used in many Wiccan and witchcraft practices. An athama is a ceremonial dagger that's typically used in rituals and spells to direct energy and carve symbols in the air. Wiccans generally believe that the athame is purely symbolic and should never be used for cutting. Anyone can own and use an athame, though they often represent masculinity. [1] X Research source Athames are a sacred and important tool in witchcraft. Because they’re so often used in spells and rituals, many practitioners consider them to be essential for the craft. This is especially true if you use an altar, as athames are often placed there. In some practices, an athame must be double-edged and have a black handle, but this is not universal. Since the athame isn’t used for cutting, the blade is dull. The word “athame” may come from the Latin “artavus” which refers to a small knife used to sharpen pens. Many cite Gerald Gardner, the founder of Wicca, as being the first to use the word. Athame can be pronounced a few different ways, including “A-thuh-may” and “a-THAW-me.”"

      "title": "The athame represents masculine energy and the Wiccan god.",
      "content": "The athame represents masculine energy and the Wiccan god. Wiccans believe in a god and goddess who rule equally. In rituals, they sometimes use the athame to represent the god, while a chalice represents the goddess. This is because the athame has a more phallic shape, and it’s frequently used to represent masculinity in general. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "In some practices, athames represent the element of air.",
      "content": "In some practices, athames represent the element of air. Since athames are only used to cut things symbolically in most practices, this often means cutting through the air. Because of this, athames can be used in spells and rituals as a representation of air. [3] X Research source In tarot, athames are associated with the suit of swords, which is also connected to the air element."

      "title": "In Gardnerian witchcraft (traditional Wicca), athames represent fire.",
      "content": "In Gardnerian witchcraft (traditional Wicca), athames represent fire. Depending on the practice, some Wiccans associate the athame with fire rather than air. This is because knives are forged in fire, and both athames and the element of fire are associated with transformation. [4] X Research source Gerald Gardner, the founder of Wicca, associated athames with fire in his own book of shadows. The athame symbolizes the removal of unwanted memories and emotions. Some people use athames to “cut” out the negative parts of their life and start fresh. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The athame represents duality.",
      "content": "The athame represents duality. Because athames traditionally have a double-edged blade, they often represent the dual nature of life and the universe. This includes the masculine and the feminine, good and evil, positive and negative, and projection and reception. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Athames are used in the Great Rite to balance masculine and feminine energy.",
      "content": "Athames are used in the Great Rite to balance masculine and feminine energy. The Great Rite is a Wiccan ritual performed during the Sabbats that represents the union of the god and goddess. Typically, a priest and priestess represent the god and goddess and either literally or symbolically have sexual intercourse. The athame is used by the priest in the symbolic ritual. [7] X Research source In the symbolic performance, the priestess holds a chalice at her waist and the priest holds the athame above his head. They move their tools to meet in the middle, symbolizing the deities’ union and the balance of masculine and feminine energy."

      "content": "Athames can consecrate other magical items. In some practices, magical objects are consecrated by using the four elements. After your athame has been consecrated itself, you can use it to represent either air or fire (depending on your practice) during consecration rituals."

      "title": "Athames transmit spiritual energy.",
      "content": "Athames transmit spiritual energy. Many Wiccans believe that energy can be transferred from one object to another. An athame carries the energy of its owner, and when placed on an altar, it picks up energy from the items around it. [8] X Research source Some covens choose to place each member’s athame on an altar so that their energies can mix and help them connect spiritually. This is why most athames are made of metal, which can conduct heat and energy."

      "content": "Athames are used to cast circles to begin rituals. When casting a circle , holding an athame can help direct your protective energy. Use it to “draw” your circle as you walk around it, pointing the blade toward the ground and imagining your energy flowing out of you."

    {
      "title": "Athames invoke the elements and call upon deities.",
      "content": "Athames invoke the elements and call upon deities. Because athames help draw and focus energy, they’re used to “call the quarters” or invite the elements (earth, air, water, and fire) into your ritual to aid in your magic. If you work with the Wiccan god, goddess, or other deities, use an athame to invite them to your rituals. The athame will help draw and direct their energy toward you and your magic."

      "title": "Athames cut spiritual ties.",
      "content": "Athames cut spiritual ties. Even though most Wiccans don’t use them to cut things physically, athames are frequently used to symbolically sever spiritual and energetic connections. They may be used during cord-cutting rituals to help separate you from a person or situation. [9] X Research source When performing a cord cutting ritual, visualize a cord of light connecting you to the person or situation you’re trying to remove yourself from. Then, bring your athame down through the air like you’re physically cutting the cord in two to sever the connection."

      "content": "Consecrate a knife to create your own athame if you don’t want to buy one. Any knife can be used as an athame if you consecrate and dedicate it to your craft—even a butter knife! Purify your knife, then place it on your altar. Cast a circle and call on any deities you want to help with the consecration. Then, tell the knife its new purpose and let it sit on your altar for 24 hours. While dedicating your knife, try saying something like “Knife, you are brought into this circle to forever be my athame.” If you work with metal, wood, or even glass, you can also craft your own athame to fit your ritual needs and stylistic preferences. You should only make your own if you know how to safely work with the materials needed. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Purchase a pre-made athame to find a style that works for you.",
      "content": "Purchase a pre-made athame to find a style that works for you. Athames are often sold at new age or witchcraft stores both in-person and online. They come in a variety of colors and styles, and you can choose which one speaks to you the most. [11] X Research source Even if you purchase a brand new athame, it’s important to consecrate it before using it for the first time. Purify your athame by placing it in direct sunlight or moonlight, then place it on your altar and cast a circle. Inform the athame of its new connection to you and let it absorb your energy. When selecting an athame, choose a size that works best for you. Athames don’t have to be a certain size, so pick one that you can work with comfortably. According to some beliefs, you should buy your athame on Thursday, which is the day of Jupiter (the planet of prosperity and success) during a waxing moon."

      "title": "Choose a material based on its magical properties.",
      "content": "Choose a material based on its magical properties. Athames can be made of almost any material, so it’s important to choose one that best fits your practice. Here are some common materials and what they’re associated with: Steel or iron: these are the most traditional materials and are believed to have strong energetic properties. Silver or copper: these materials are often associated with lunar magic and feminine energy. Wood or bone: natural materials like these are best for those following an Earth-centered practice. Rubber or plastic: these are not ideal materials, as they don’t hold a magical correspondence. You can still use these materials if you want to rely solely on your own magical intent. Personalize your athame by adding gemstones or carving symbols into the handle. This helps the athame absorb your personal magical energy."

      "title": "Rely on your intuition when selecting your athame.",
      "content": "Rely on your intuition when selecting your athame. Each witch or Wiccan’s athame is tied directly to them and their magic, so choose one that best reflects you and your practice. When choosing an athame, it’s best to pick it up so you can test how it feels and see if it resonates with you. Because athames are so personal to their owners, touching someone’s athame without their permission is considered an intrusion of space. It violates the bond between the owner and the athame and requires it to be re-purified and reconsecrated. [12] X Research source Athames are so highly regarded that they’re often buried with their owner when they die so they can take their athame with them into the next life."

      "title": "Cleanse your athame to get rid of any negative energy it holds.",
      "content": "Cleanse your athame to get rid of any negative energy it holds. Cleansing is an important aspect of Wicca and witchcraft, as negative or unwanted energy can affect your tool’s magical performance. Cleanse your athame when you first receive it, if someone else has touched it, or any time you notice a change in energy. Here are some common cleansing techniques: Put it in salt. Salt absorbs energy, so place your athame in a bowl of it and leave it overnight, or mix salt in water and sprinkle it over the athame. Make sure the materials of your athame can handle salt beforehand. Lay it in sunlight or moonlight. Sunlight is a powerful natural cleanser, as it burns away any unwanted energy. Moonlight works similarly and is preferable for materials that may fade or be harmed by direct sunlight. Smudge it with cleansing herbs. Burn sage, rosemary, or lavender and wave the smoke over the athame to clear any unwanted energy."

Hold the athame in your hands and imagine your energy flowing into it. You can also speak your intention aloud or lay the athame in sunlight or moonlight for an extra magical boost."
