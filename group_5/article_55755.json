      "content": "It takes about 67 hours and 18 minutes to read the whole Bible. On average, a person reads about 200 words per minute, though some can read up to 500 words per minute if the material is easy to digest. [1] X Research source The number of words in your Bible can vary depending on the translation you choose, however, one site estimates that the New American Standard Bible (NASB) has around 807,361 words. This means that it would take around 67.3 hours to read this version of the Bible from cover to cover, which is just under 3 days of non-stop reading. [2] X Research source The Old Testament in the NASB has around 622,771 words, meaning that it would take about 52 hours to read the entire thing. The New Testament is significantly shorter and has around 184,590 words. So it would take only about 15 hours for the average person to read. If your goal is to read the entire Bible within a month (30 days), read from the Bible for about 2 hours and 15 minutes each day. If you’re going for a slightly longer period of 40 days (such as during Lent), cut your reading time down to about 1 hour and 40 minutes per day. If you wish to finish the Bible within 1 year, many reading plans such as this one suggest reading 2 to 3 chapters each day. You only need to read for around 11 minutes a day to get through the whole Bible in 1 year. The breakdown of reading times for each of the 6 sections of the Bible is as follows: Pentateuch (books 1-5): around 13 hours Historical Books (books 6-16): around 17 hours Writings (books 17-22): around 9 hours Prophets (books 23-39): around 15 hours Gospels and Acts (books 40-44): around 10 hours Epistles and Revelation (books 45-66): around 7 hours"

Even though the Bible doesn’t necessarily go in chronological order, it’s still possible to read it from Genesis chapter 1 to Revelations chapter 22. Just keep in mind that each story may not flow smoothly into the next since the Bible is a collection of writings rather than a chronological narrative. [3] X Research source If you want to read the Bible in a way that makes sense chronologically, go ahead and purchase a chronological Bible . These also sometimes come with guided notes that can help you understand what you’re reading."

Whenever you have a spare moment, open up your Bible or read an online version and go through a few passages. For example, read a passage or two while you’re waiting in line, eating a meal, or waiting for a commercial break on TV to be over. [11] X Research source Another option is to listen to the Bible in audiobook format. On average, audiobooks read at about 150 words per minute, so it will take longer (around 90 hours, or a little less than 4 days of non-stop listening) to “read” the entire Bible. When it comes to audiobooks, you always have the option to make the reading speed faster. If you want to listen to the entire Bible within 1 year at a normal speed, listen for around 1 hour and 30 minutes each day."
