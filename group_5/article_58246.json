Their positive, fun-loving attitude attracts potential candidates, builds company culture, and keeps the office in good spirits.

Since personality hires are sociable, they tend to have a lot of connections too. This can be extremely helpful when it comes to securing deals or building good relationships with clients."

[11] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Personality does play a part in culture fit, but it’s only a small aspect of it. Employers are more interested in whether the candidate aligns with the company’s mission and is likely to thrive in the role. For example, a candidate who prefers working independently is not a good fit for a company that mainly consists of team-based projects. When it comes to personality hires, managers might follow their gut to see if a candidate is friendly or fun to work with. Candidates who align with the company’s culture possess both hard and soft skills for the role."
