      "content": "Yes—some experts say you should always roll your neck. Jade rollers are thought to help push toxins from under your skin toward your lymph system, where they're then flushed out. Some beauty experts believe that if you start by rolling your neck first, you'll get better drainage when you roll your face. [1] X Research source Other experts advocate rolling your face first, then your neck, since that might help push out the toxins from your face. [2] X Research source Removing these toxins may help reduce puffiness in your skin. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Moisturize first, then use your jade roller. Although some people claim that using a jade roller pushes your moisturizer deeper into your skin, there's not actually much proof of that. However, it definitely feels better to jade roll your face after you've applied a little moisturizer or your favorite facial oil. [4] X Research source That will help the jade roll more smoothly over your skin. [5] X Research source Jojoba and almond oils are neutral oils that work for a variety of skin types. Make sure you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients in your moisturizer or facial oil, as an allergic reaction can cause skin irritation and redness."

Start with the roller on the back of your neck, off to one side of your spine, and gently roll down all the way to the base of your neck. Do this anywhere from 4-12 times—whatever feels good to you. [6] X Research source Repeat that on the other side of your spine, then move to the front and roll down from the corner of your jaw down to your collarbone on either side. [7] X Research source Some dermatologists say this will clear out blockages and improve the drainage when you roll your face. Avoid rolling further in on your throat where your pulse point is, since that could be painful. [8] X Research source"

When you're rolling, it should feel like a gentle massage. If it hurts, you're definitely pressing too hard. [9] X Research source If you press too hard with the roller, it could lead to skin irritation. If you have acne, it may get worse, as well. [10] X Research source"

When you're just starting out, it might take some time to get used to the pressure you should use—if you roll too hard and go over the skin several times, your skin might get a little irritated. However, it's probably fine to roll longer once you know your skin will tolerate it well—some people roll the same area up to 12 times! [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Use it at least 3 times a week. Although jade rollers can be helpful at reducing puffiness, the effects are only temporary, so you have to keep using the roller to see consistent results. It's best to use it every day—or at least every other day—so try to work it in as part of your normal skincare routine. [12] X Research source Some people prefer to use their jade roller in the morning for a complexion boost first thing, while others enjoy the relaxing benefits as part of their evening routine. You could even do it twice a day, if you want!"

      "content": "Clean it every time you use it. After you roll your face and neck, rinse the jade roller with warm, soapy water, then dry it with a soft cloth. That will remove any moisturizer that was transferred to the stone, preventing buildup that could harbor bacteria. [13] X Research source Washing your jade roller with soap and water is probably good enough, but if you want to sanitize your roller between uses, wipe it down with alcohol, then let it dry.

      "content": "Experts are divided on this one. Some experts say no—since the main purpose of a jade roller is to improve circulation, the cold can actually counteract that. However, if your skin is red or inflamed, or if you're experiencing sunburn, allergies, or rosacea, putting the roller in the fridge first can help soothe your skin irritation. [15] X Research source Try using your jade roller chilled and at room temp to see what you like best."
