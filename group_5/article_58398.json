      "content": "Set up the game. The number of players is unlimited, so the whole family or group of friends can join in if wished. Hand out three quarters to each player. Alternatively, have each player provide their own three quarters. If preferred, you can use poker chips, play money, chocolate coins, dare or chore promise vouchers, or anything else you consider to be appropriate. The item should be desirable to win, however."

      "content": "Find three dice to roll. The number of dice rolled will depend on the number of quarters held: When a player has one or two quarters, he or she rolls one or two dice, directly related to the number of quarters held. If a player has three or more quarters, the player rolls all three dice. If a player doesn't have any money left in front of them, he or she is still in the game, but doesn't get to roll until someone passes them a quarter . The last player with quarters rolls the dice and has to roll a 1, 2, or 3 in order to win the center pot of money or other goodies used."

      "content": "Roll for the center pot. When only one person is left holding quarters, he or she must roll for the center pot. The player must roll a 1, 2, or 3 to win the pot. If the player rolls a 4 and only has one quarter left, that quarter must go into the center pot. In this case, the pot becomes a \"carry-over\" pot because nobody wins. The game (or a new round) begins afresh, with everyone taking three quarters again. The person who rolled last begins the new game using the same rules until somebody wins. If the player rolls a 4, 5, or 6, then the remaining quarters are passed as throughout the game."
