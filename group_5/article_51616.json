      "title": "Do not move someone if you think she has a spinal injury.",
      "content": "Do not move someone if you think she has a spinal injury. Moving them could increase the damage and even cause them to be paralyzed. If you are unsure if the person has a spinal injury, then you should proceed as if they do. Signs of a spinal injury include: [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Having a head injury, particularly one that involved a blow to the head or neck. Showing changes in the state of consciousness, for example, being unconscious or confused. Experiencing pain in the neck or back. Not moving the neck. Experiencing weakness, numbness, or paralysis in the limbs. Losing control of the bladder or bowels. The head or neck is twisted in a strange position. Reacts to painful stimulus (trapezius pinch or sternal rub) by flexing all their limbs inward or by extending all her limbs out (referred to as posturing)."

      "title": "Stabilize someone with a spinal injury.",
      "content": "Stabilize someone with a spinal injury. If the person’s head or body moves, it may increase the damage to the spine. You can prevent this by: [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Putting towels or pillows on both sides of the person’s head to prevent it from rolling or slipping. Providing first aid, like CPR, without moving the head. This means that you should not tilt the person’s head back to open the airway. Instead, use the jaw-thrust method. Not taking the person’s helmet off if he was wearing one. For example, if they had a bike or motorcycle helmet on, leave it so you don’t move the spine."

      "title": "Roll the person onto their side if necessary.",
      "content": "Roll the person onto their side if necessary. This should only be done if the person is in immediate danger, for example, if they are vomiting or choking on blood. Under these circumstances, you may have to roll the person onto their side. It is important to do this with at least one other person so that you can prevent the person’s body from twisting. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source One person should be positioned at the head and the other at the injured person’s side. The two of you must coordinate so that the spine remains aligned while the person is rolled. Twisting can cause additional damage to the spine. While rolling, wait for the lead person's cue. Roll by grabbing the opposite shoulder and hip, rolling the patient toward you. While the person is in this position, check their back and neck quickly for obvious injuries."

      "title": "Use the human crutch method.",
      "content": "Use the human crutch method. If the person is conscious and can move on their own, this method might be the most effective. It can be used if the person has an injury to only one leg. [7] X Research source Crouch with your knees bent and back straight next to the injured person on the side of the injury. Have the person sit up and wrap their arm over your shoulder. Slowly stand, allowing the injured person to support themself with their good leg. You will support their weight on the side with the injury. Hold their hand around your shoulders with the hand furthest from them. Put your other hand around their waist. Help them balance as they hop to safety. This enables them to minimize the amount of weight that must go on the injured leg."

      "title": "Drag the person to safety.",
      "content": "Drag the person to safety. The drag method is safer than lifting the person, for both you and the injured person. Lifting increases the amount of weight that you must support and it puts the person at risk of falling. Always pull slowly and steadily, moving the person in as straight a line as possible. You want to keep the person’s spine aligned so that it does not twist or bend unnaturally. Which type of drag you use will depend on the injures that the person has. [8] X Research source Blanket pull — This is the most preferred way to drag someone who’s been injured. Move the person onto a large blanket using a “logroll” or three-person lift. Keep the person’s head about 2 feet (0.61 m) from the corner of the blanket. Wrap the blanket around the person and try to pull them in as straight of a line as possible. Keep your back straight and use your legs to pull the person. [9] X Research source Shoulder pull — This method is necessary when the person has leg injuries and is the best method to support the person’s head. Bend forward at the waist and keep your knees bent. Hold onto the injured person underneath their shoulders right behind their armpits. Support the person’s head as you pull them. [10] X Research source Ankle pull —This method is used when the person has no leg injuries, but cannot walk. Bend at your knees so that your back remains straight, but you can hold the person’s ankles. Lean back and slowly and steadily use your weight to drag the person to safety. Be careful not to drag the person over surfaces or objects that may injure them. If you are sure that the person has not suffered a spinal injury, you can lift the head and put something underneath to protect it. If you think the person might have a spinal injury, you should move the head as little as possible. [11] X Research source Clothing drag — If the person has injuries on both the arms and legs, it may be necessary to drag them by their clothing. If you use this method, pay attention to the clothing to make sure that it doesn’t suddenly tear and cause the person’s head to bang on the ground. Bend your knees and grip the clothing under the armpits. Lean back and use your weight to drag the person."

      "content": "Carry a child using the cradle method. This method is quick and easy but it can only be used for children and people who are much smaller than the rescuer. Because the person’s entire weight hangs on your arms, you will tire quickly. [12] X Research source Scoop the child up so that you are carrying them in front of you with one hand around their back and the other under his knees. Bend at the knees and keep your back straight when lifting. If you injure your back in the process of lifting the person, you won’t be able to help as effectively."

      "title": "Carry a larger person like a backpack.",
      "content": "Carry a larger person like a backpack. This method can be used if the person is too large for you to carry in the cradle position or the person must be carried too far for you to maintain the cradle position. It can be used for people who are unconscious. [13] X Research source Start with the injured person on their back. Bend their legs and stand with your feet on their toes. Pull them up by their wrists to a standing position. As you put the person into a standing position, rotate so that the person’s chest is against your back and their arms are over your shoulders. This allows you to hold the person’s arms, tip forward slightly at the waist, and carry the person like a backpack."
