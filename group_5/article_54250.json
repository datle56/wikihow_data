      "title": "Create a parenting plan.",
      "content": "Create a parenting plan. Child custody is a major issue in a divorce or separation where the couple has children. If both parties can agree to a parenting plan, the court will not have to hold a hearing or trial to determine custody. Talk to the other parent about how best to schedule custody and visitation. Remember to take into account each parent's work schedule and the child's school schedule. For example, if you work during the times that your child is home from school, let the other parent have the child at those times. Decide who will get physical custody. Physical custody means that the child primarily lives with that parent. The other parent has visitation rights, and can visit the child or have the child visit him or her. [1] X Research source Decide who will get legal custody. A parent with legal custody has the right to make decisions about the child's health care, education, and religious upbringing. [2] X Research source Both parents can usually share legal custody even if one parent has physical custody."
