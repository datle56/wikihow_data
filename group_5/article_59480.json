      "content": "Look at how often he reaches out to determine his texting style. Some guys prefer to have conversations in person or over the phone if they aren’t a big fan of texting. If you’ve been chatting with the guy for a while, scroll through your conversations to see if he’s taken a similar amount of time between his responses. If he has, then everything is probably fine and you can carry on the conversation as normal. You can even ask him directly to see how he prefers to text. [1] X Research source If there’s a sudden change in texting times, then it could be a sign that his feelings have changed. If you just went on a date and he responds 3 days after, he might be following an old dating rule to make you more interested in him. When you first start dating, it’s normal for him to only text when you’re making plans together."

      "content": "Take a moment to work through how you feel before replying. You might be excited that the guy you’re seeing finally texted back, but it’s okay if you’re a little upset or confused too. Rather than responding right away, sit with your feelings and determine what you want from him going forward. Give it a few minutes or hours to think it over. Making him wait on a response also shows him that you weren’t waiting by your phone and expecting a text from him."

      "title": "Ask what took him so long if he doesn’t explain right away.",
      "content": "Ask what took him so long if he doesn’t explain right away. If the guy was really busy or something came up, he’ll usually tell you as soon as he responds so you understand why he disappeared. When he jumps right back into a conversation or doesn’t acknowledge that he ghosted you, hold him accountable and ask what was going on so you can get to the bottom of it. If he has a good reason, then you can assume that he’s still into you. “Hey, I haven’t heard from you in a few days. What have you been up to?” “I’m surprised to hear from you again! Where have you been the past couple of days?” “It felt like you were ghosting me for a little while. Did something come up?”"

      "content": "Mention how you’d prefer him to text you in the future. It’s completely normal to tell a guy how you expect him to communicate if you’re not happy right now. If you want him to text you at least once a day so you stay connected, then don’t be afraid to say that to him. Tell him that it’s important that you’re able to communicate so he knows that you’re serious about how you want to communicate. “I don’t appreciate being ignored for days between texts, so I’d really appreciate it if you could check in once a day please.” “I feel like you don’t care about us when you disappear like that. Can you send me a text telling me what you’re up to?” “I’m afraid that you’ve moved on when you leave me on read, so can you tell me if you’re busy so I don’t worry?”"

If you don’t feel like the guy is putting in the effort you want from him, then tell him that you don’t want to reconnect again. You can even just ghost him and give him a taste of his own medicine if you want.

      "content": "Reply to your ex if it won’t negatively affect your mood. Getting a text from your ex might bring up a lot of emotions depending on how you ended things. Before you reach out, remember your relationship and think about how your ex makes you feel. If you don’t have good memories of the relationship or your ex makes you feel uncomfortable, it’s better to ignore the message. If you’re with a new partner, think about how they would feel about you talking to your ex. [6] X Expert Source Lisa Shield Dating Coach Expert Interview. 13 December 2018.

If he says he misses you: “It took you long enough to realize it 😉” If he says he still has feelings for you: “I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t thinking about you too…” If he says he wants to get back together: “Maybe that’s something we could work towards 😊”"
