You do not want to create opposing scratches, which will only add more ridges and valleys in the paint that need to be repaired. Rinse the area with water as needed to check your progress. This will allow you to better see if you have gotten to the bottom of the scratch. If the scratch is slightly deeper than the clear coat, use 1500-grit sandpaper to level the surface and then 2000-grit sandpaper to remove the scratches made by the coarser sandpaper. Avoid getting dirt or debris between the sandpaper and the vehicle. This will cause scratching."
