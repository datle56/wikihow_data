This is especially true when they are not diluted enough or if they are ingested by an animal with a weak immune system. Talk to your doctor about your pet's health and about your specific plan for treatment in order to ensure that you can safely use essential oils on your pet and on surfaces in your home.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show.

Make sure to get 100% pure peppermint oil so that you can make your own diffusions. [2] X Research source Pure peppermint oil is made by pressing the oil out of peppermint leaves. Though peppermint does not kill full-grown fleas, it helps in restricting their attack on pets. One way it does this is by killing the larvae of fleas, which are more vulnerable."

      "content": "Make a peppermint oil solution. Mix 12 parts carrier oil, such as grapeseed oil, with 1 part peppermint oil. For instance, combine 12 tablespoons of grapeseed oil with 1 tablespoon of peppermint oil. Ensure that the solution is stirred or shaken together well before using it on your pet. [3] X Research source Shake the solution before each use, as the parts will separate when not in use. A little of this solution will go a long way, so there's no need to make a batch that takes more than a tablespoon of peppermint oil."

[4] X Research source Put it on any affected areas, which typically includes the animal's neck and back. These are spots most pets can't easily groom, so they tend to be where fleas congregate. The oil can also help soothe any itching or discomfort your pet has because of the flea bites."
