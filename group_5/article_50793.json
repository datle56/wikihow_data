      "title": "Practice daily gratitude.",
      "content": "Practice daily gratitude. Write in a gratitude journal each day in order to consistently recognize all of the great things that you have in your life. Whether you write a whole page or just a sentence each day on what you feel grateful for, this activity may help you feel satisfied by bringing all the positives of your life to light. Try writing down one thing for every letter of the alphabet (a-z) that you’re grateful for. If you want to involve others in your daily gratitude, consider writing thank you notes to those you’re grateful for."

      "title": "Be open to change.",
      "content": "Be open to change. Those who change at least one of their viewpoints or behaviors every few months are more likely to look to the future with hope and positivity. These individuals also generally claim to be in a better mood most of the time. Keep in mind that growth isn’t possible without change, and try to approach life’s changes with open arms so that you can feel more satisfied overall. [1] X Research source For example, you may find that you accidentally interrupt people sometimes, and then make a conscious effort to change this behavior. For example, you may decide to change your political stance on taxes after you hear someone bring up a few strong points that you hadn’t before considered."

      "title": "Look at things from a new perspective.",
      "content": "Look at things from a new perspective. By attempting to look at seemingly negative situations in a positive light, you can change your thought processes over time. This may help you to feel more satisfied because you’re putting a positive filter on the people, events, and situations in your life. For instance, maybe your job wasn’t really fulfilling, and losing it was a gift in disguise because now you can pursue your true passion."

      "title": "Recognize that having more doesn’t ensure happiness.",
      "content": "Recognize that having more doesn’t ensure happiness. Reflect on those who you know that are wealthy and those who aren’t as fortunate. There are many people who have less than you but still manage to have a positive outlook on life. There are also many who have more than you and are dissatisfied. Keep this in mind when you think you have to have more in order to be happy."

      "title": "Invest in friendships.",
      "content": "Invest in friendships. Studies have shown that having several close friendships significantly increase people’s optimism and life satisfaction. [2] X Research source Reach out to your friends and invite them to things more often. Make a conscious effort to prioritize time with friends. The closeness that may result in investing in your friendships may also come with comforting support and fun experiences."

      "title": "Accept loved ones for who they are.",
      "content": "Accept loved ones for who they are. You may wish that your spouse would be more organized or that your child would be more athletic. Try not to get too caught up in what you wish was different about those who you love. This can cause strain on your relationships and dissatisfaction. Instead, try your best to accept those who you love for who they are. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don’t compare yourself to others.",
      "content": "Don’t compare yourself to others. Most of the people that you come in contact with are on a different path or at a different stage of life than you are. Try to celebrate others’ happiness, accomplishments, and good fortune instead of comparing them to your own. This will lead to less bitterness and jealousy and more peace of mind."

      "title": "Keep in mind that people often omit negativity on social media.",
      "content": "Keep in mind that people often omit negativity on social media. When scrolling through all of the happy faces and fun adventures posted on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites, it’s easy to get jealous. Try to remember that everyone has positive and negative experiences, even if you only see the good aspects of their lives on social media."

      "title": "Volunteer to serve others.",
      "content": "Volunteer to serve others. Helping others can lift your spirits and give you a sense of purpose. When you’re immersed in the hard work of day-to-day life, it can be hard to see the point of everything you’re doing. Volunteering for those in need can often have a more obvious impact. This sense of purpose can help you to feel more satisfied with your life. For instance, you may feel purposeful while volunteering at a soup kitchen to serve lunch to the homeless individuals in your community. The impact of this activity is apparent because it involves feeding those who are hungry and without food."

      "title": "Incorporate non-material joys into your life.",
      "content": "Incorporate non-material joys into your life. Start by making a list of all the things you love that don’t require or involve money. Refer to this list often and try to incorporate one or more things on the list into each day. Some things on your list might include: love, laughter, faith, family, long walks, nature, and more."

      "title": "Buy what you need and not what you want.",
      "content": "Buy what you need and not what you want. Struggling financially can often lead to unhappiness in life. While it’s often difficult to ever be in a position where money isn’t a concern at all, you can lessen the stress by living within your means. Instead of just buying whatever you want, think through every purchase and mostly only buy the things that you need in order to survive comfortably. [4] X Research source If your friend just got the new iPhone and you really like it, take a look at your own phone. If it’s functioning properly, there’s no need to get a new one. If your phone has issues, do some research to see what affordable, reliable phones are currently on the market."

      "content": "Desire what you have. Instead of focusing on all of the things you don’t have, try to focus on all of the things you do have. [5] X Research source If you’re often wanting more than you possess, you might never feel fulfilled because there are so many fancy, expensive material items out there and you may never be able to buy all of them. Try to get enjoyment out of the things you already own and use. If you’re frustrated because you can’t afford a fun video game that just came out, play some of the games you already own. You bought those for a reason, and you can have fun playing them as well."
