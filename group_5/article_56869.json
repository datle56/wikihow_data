      "content": "Crudite requires a single vegetable. To make a Crudite in Dreamlight Valley, you can drop almost any vegetable in a pot. Try gathering Carrots, Mushrooms, Zucchini, or Cucumber. Some vegetables, such as Corn, will not yield a Crudite when cooked. When cooked, Corn turns into a Grilled Vegetable Plate. To cook anything in Dreamlight Valley, you will need a piece of Coal as well."

      "content": "Drop a single vegetable into the pot. Do not combine multiple vegetables, as this will create a Grilled Vegetable Platter instead of Crudite. To complete the Missing Minnie quest, you will need to create five Crudites. They do not each need to be unique, but they must be made separately from one another."
