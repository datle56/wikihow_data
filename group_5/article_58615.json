      "title": "Find a set of stretchy bands for beds.",
      "content": "Find a set of stretchy bands for beds. These bands are basically like large rubber bands that fit over the mattress. They fit over the top and bottom of the mattress. You can find them online, at some big box stores, or at a household item store. Choose the bands based on the size of your bed."

    {
      "title": "Stretch bands over the mattress at the bottom and the top.",
      "content": "Stretch bands over the mattress at the bottom and the top. Stretch out 1 band. Find the locking mechanisms. These should be on either side of the mattress. Slide the band onto 1 side at the top of your mattress, go above and below the mattress. Go to the other side and pull the band down on that side. It should be about 1 foot (30 cm) down the mattress. Do the same with the bottom band. Put on your fitted sheet. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the fitted sheet on the bed.",
      "content": "Place the fitted sheet on the bed. Next, put the fitted sheet on the bed like you normally would. You're putting the fitted sheet on over the bands, which will help hold it in place. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Click the knobs into the locking mechanisms.",
      "content": "Click the knobs into the locking mechanisms. The bands should come with knobs that fit into the locking mechanism. Place a knob on each locking mechanism. Click the knob in place over the fitted sheet. Place the rest of your sheets on the bed per normal. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use suspenders to hold the corners in place.",
      "content": "Use suspenders to hold the corners in place. Suspenders go across the corners of the fitted sheet. Suspenders can have metal clips or plastic locking mechanisms, where a knob fits into place on the other side. Lock them into place on the corners, about 6 inches (15 cm) out on either side of the corner seam. Put the sheet on the bed, tucking the suspenders under the mattress."

      "title": "Cut elastic to create your own suspenders.",
      "content": "Cut elastic to create your own suspenders. Cut a short length of elastic. Use elastic that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide or so. A length of about 6 inches (15 cm) should be fine. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mark the place you'll pin the elastic on either side of the corner seam.",
      "content": "Mark the place you'll pin the elastic on either side of the corner seam. Stretch out the corner of the sheet so you have about 6 inches (15 cm) of straight (not ruffled) sheet on either side of the seam at 1 corner. Mark the length on the sheet with a small safety pin on each end. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use safety pins to attach the elastic to the fitted sheet. Pin the ends of the elastic at each marker. The elastic should draw the corner of each sheet together. Repeat for each corner, and then place the sheet on the bed. [6] X Research source You can also sew these in place if you prefer."

      "title": "Pick the correct-sized sheets.",
      "content": "Pick the correct-sized sheets. While picking sheets that fit well won't automatically stop them from popping off, it can help. Start by measuring the depth of your mattress. When you look at sheets, make sure they fit the mattress you have, as you may need deeper or shallower sheets, depending on your mattress. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use zipping sheets for babies and kids. If your kids are constantly pulling their sheets off, you may want to switch to zipping sheets. The main part of the sheet goes under the bed, but you only put it on once. The top of the sheet zips off, so you can change it out as needed. With the zipper, the sheets stay in place. [8] X Research source For adults, try drawstring sheets, which allow you to tighten the sheets on the bed underneath the mattress."

      "content": "Place non-slip rug corners under the mattress. You may have seen the corners that you place under rugs to keep them from moving. You can also use these for your sheets. Place 1 under each corner of the mattress, and then put the sheets on as normal. The stickiness of the corners keep the sheets in place. [9] X Research source Foam can also work for this purpose."

      "title": "Place a rougher sheet underneath the softer sheet.",
      "content": "Place a rougher sheet underneath the softer sheet. Sometimes, if you have silk sheets or other smooth sheets, they're more likely to pop off. Try placing a rougher sheet underneath the fitted sheet, such as a flannel sheet, to help keep the top one from popping off."
