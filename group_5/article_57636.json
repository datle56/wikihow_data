      "content": "We attract the energy we put out, so it's important to emit positive vibes. Adopting a positive attitude isn't a simple task, we know. It might sound impossible, but you can rewire the neural pathways in your brain to be more positive by looking for the silver lining in bad situations, performing random acts of kindness for people, and smiling and laughing more. [1] X Research source Believe it or not, smiling and laughing—even when you don't feel like it—can actually make you feel happier! In time, this leads to an overall more positive attitude. We attract the energy we give off, so if you manifest from a place of desperation or loneliness, you will attract only negative energy in return."

      "title": "A clear idea of what you want increases your odds of manifesting it.",
      "content": "A clear idea of what you want increases your odds of manifesting it. Who do you want to manifest to be obsessed with you? Is this someone you know, or a person you’ve yet to meet? Be specific and intentional here, being sure to think not just about who you want, but why you want them: how will your relationship go with this person? What do you want out of the connection? Solidify what you want up front: don’t jump from “my ex who I want to get back together with” this week to “that hot guy who works at the food co-op” next week. Settle on one vision, and stick with it. Be clear on what you want—but open-minded about how your desire may come to fruition. Journaling is a great way to help you clarify your vision. What qualities are you looking for in your ideal relationship? How do you imagine this person fulfilling your needs?"

      "title": "Vision boards are a way to (literally!) visualize what you want to manifest.",
      "content": "Vision boards are a way to (literally!) visualize what you want to manifest. To make a vision board , take a poster board and attach photos and journal entries related to what you want your future with this person to look like. Hang the board somewhere you’ll see it every day, like beside your mirror or above the coffee maker. [2] X Research source You don't have to break out the glue and glitter if you don't want to: you can make your vision board on your computer. Print it out and hang it up, or make it your computer background so you'll see it every day."

      "title": "Ask yourself what beliefs you hold around your ability to find love.",
      "content": "Ask yourself what beliefs you hold around your ability to find love. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: believing you can’t attract what you want will prevent you from getting it, while believing you can will help you manifest your desires. Therefore, it’s important to be aware of and overcome any limiting beliefs you hold around what you’re trying to manifest. Limiting beliefs might sound something like, \"I can't get the person I want because I'm not attractive or funny\" or \"I'm destined to be all alone.\" Reframe the belief to be more positive. For instance, \"I'm destined to be alone\" might become \"My solitude has helped me be more independent and taught me a lot about myself.\" [3] X Research source Put your new, positive belief into action by acting as if it is true. It'll feel funny at first, but with practice, you'll start to believe it, just like you used to believe your limiting belief."

      "title": "Positive affirmations will attract positive energy.",
      "content": "Positive affirmations will attract positive energy. A positive affirmation is a present-tense statement about what you want to manifest, such as “Casey is thinking about me right now.” Positive affirmations speak your desires into existence until they eventually come to fruition. Create 3 or 4 positive affirmations related to your desire, and begin each day reciting them to yourself in the mirror. [4] X Research source Recite affirmations related to the person you want to attract, like “Dane is obsessed with me” or “Amal can’t stop thinking about me.” Create affirmations about the energy you want to emit (and therefore attract), like “I am strong and capable,” “I am worthy of love,” or “I am creative and intelligent.”"

      "title": "You have to take action to make your dreams come true.",
      "content": "You have to take action to make your dreams come true. Manifestation is both a spiritual and physical practice, which means that while reciting affirmations and creating a vision board are essential to getting your heart’s desire, if you don’t make movements to go get what you want, it’s unlikely to just come to you. So what steps can you take today to increase your odds of getting what you want? [5] X Research source If you want to manifest a fitness nut, for instance, get a membership at your local gym. If you’re after a book lover, hang out at your library or attend readings at local bookstores. If you already know the person you want to attract, make an effort to spend more time with them. Hang out at their favorite haunts, or be more direct and ask if they'd like to meet up. A lot of people hold the mistaken belief that manifestation is about sitting back and willing something to happen, when in reality, manifestation also requires that you take action to get what you want.

      "content": "Friendliness and confidence will draw them to you. If you meet the person (or if you already know them), increase the odds that they'll be obsessed with you by being self-assured, kind, and approachable. Research shows not only that believing you're capable of achieving something increases your odds of achieving it, but having a positive attitude makes you more approachable, meaning your special person is likely to be drawn to you. [7] X Research source You've already been working on your positive attitude and overcoming your limiting beliefs, which puts you in a great position to attract your special someone when you meet them!"

      "title": "Manifestation isn’t about being controlling.",
      "content": "Manifestation isn’t about being controlling. It’s about trusting the Universe to work in tandem with you to make your dreams come true. So while it may be tempting to try to control every aspect of the manifestation process, remember that being controlling actually brings about negative, anxious energy, not positive energy—and you need positive energy to attract a positive outcome. Have faith in yourself and take steps to increase your odds of attracting what you want, and leave the rest up to the Universe. While it’s important to be specific about what you want to achieve, you won’t know how the Universe will manifest your desire. It might happen in a way you never dreamed it would!"

      "title": "Manifestation shouldn’t stop you from living your life.",
      "content": "Manifestation shouldn’t stop you from living your life. This process is about bringing someone wonderful into your already wonderful life, not waiting for someone to complete you and bring your life meaning. Keep doing the things you enjoy, the things that bring you meaning, pleasure, and purpose, and the Universe will put your person in your path. [8] X Research source Living your best life and pursuing your passions keep you grounded and serve as a reminder that this person won’t complete you. It will also help you put out positive energy , and as we’ve already mentioned, you attract the energy you put out. Delve into your passions. Join clubs. Keep living the life of your dreams, keep investing positive energy into yourself, and the right person will find you."

      "content": "Try not to get discouraged while you wait to manifest your desires. A lot of people go into the manifestation process thinking they’ll get what they want immediately, but manifestation doesn’t always work that quickly. It can be disheartening not to get what you’re trying to manifest immediately, but don’t lose hope. Continue to believe you will manifest your desires and keep working to achieve them, and odds are, you will. [9] X Research source The Universe has your best interests in mind, even if the process doesn’t always go as fast as you want it to. Be patient, be open, and keep the faith. When you find yourself feeling doubt, recite one of your affirmations. Your affirmations aren’t just about speaking your desire into the world; they’re about reminding you what’s possible and what you’re capable of."
