      "content": "Find a desk that's tucked away and private. Since talking (or at least talking loudly) is usually prohibited in the library, it's a good choice when you're looking to avoid your friends. Set up your notebook, laptop, and whatever else you need at a private desk and stay focused. [3] X Research source Visit your school library or go to the public library in your neighborhood for a change of pace. If your friend walks by in the library and asks to sit with you, politely say that you need to study alone."

      "title": "Text notifications, phone calls, and emails can make it hard to focus.",
      "content": "Text notifications, phone calls, and emails can make it hard to focus. Try putting your phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode so that you don't get any text alerts or phone calls while you study. If your phone doesn't have this setting, turn off notifications and put it on silent. When you're using your computer, try disabling email notifications and logging out of your social media accounts so that you won't be as tempted to check them. [6] X Research source You could also just put your phone somewhere you're not able to reach it. [7] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. If you have a really hard time not checking your phone, schedule breaks throughout your study time to check it. For example, reward yourself with 5 minutes of phone time after completing a reading."

      "content": "This is a way to avoid your friends virtually. Apps like Freedom block social media and other websites of your choice so that you can't check them while you're studying.

      "content": "This can help if you have to study at school and can't escape them. That way, you can at least drown out their noise! Listen to some peaceful, calming music to help you focus on your studies. Use noise-canceling headphones for some extra peace and quiet. [10] X Research source If you don't like listening to music while you study, you can still use headphones to tune out the noise.
