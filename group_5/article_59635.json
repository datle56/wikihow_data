      "title": "Semi-gloss has a much brighter and more noticeable sheen than satin.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss has a much brighter and more noticeable sheen than satin. Light reflects off of semi-gloss easier than satin, since satin has a flatter finish. This makes semi-gloss a more appropriate paint for the fine trimmings of your house: railings, cabinets, crown molding, etc. Satin, on the other hand, with its slightly more matte appearance, is better for large surfaces with more noticeable flaws: walls, floors, counters. Semi-gloss makes darker spaces feel warmer. Satin mutes areas where glare and brightness may feel too intense. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss is shinier.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss is shinier. Semi-gloss is made with a higher percentage of gloss-mixture, making it smoother and more lustrous. This bright sheen helps spaces feel more formal. [2] X Research source For the smoothest effect, apply multiple thin coats of semi-gloss finishing paint instead of just one thick coat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Satin is more understated.",
      "content": "Satin is more understated. Satin paint contains more flattening paste which means it has a slightly duller appearance than semi-gloss. This soft, more pearl-like luster gives it a more chic and modern feel. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss draws more attention.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss draws more attention. Because semi-gloss is brighter, it highlights surfaces more acutely. If you have a gorgeous hardwood floor or ornate cabinet you really want to show off, semi-gloss paint will help it stand out. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Satin is better at covering imperfections.",
      "content": "Satin is better at covering imperfections. If your walls or furniture have a bit of natural wear-and-tear that you don’t want people to see, satin’s more toned-down polish helps hide these scuffs and bruises. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss reflects more light.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss reflects more light. Semi-gloss’ high radiance attracts large amounts of light. This can give surfaces a gorgeous glow, but means it should be avoided in spaces that attract lots of glare. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Satin is more diverse.",
      "content": "Satin is more diverse. Because satin’s sheen is less obvious, it’s a more easily-applicable coat for different surfaces. It can add a good flair to ceilings and hallways without capturing the same amount of light as semi-gloss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Satin is good for high-traffic areas.",
      "content": "Satin is good for high-traffic areas. Satin is a great paint for rooms that people go in and out of often. Living rooms, dining rooms and hallways experience a lot of regular foot traffic and are more likely to get dirty. Satin’s ability to hide marks makes it a great choice for these spaces. It also works great for bedrooms where semi-gloss’ high sheen may feel overwhelming. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss is good for areas with lots of moisture.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss is good for areas with lots of moisture. Semi-gloss paint is exceptionally good at combating mildew and mold. Laundry rooms, bathrooms, basements, and other areas that get damp easily will benefit tremendously from a semi-gloss finish. In addition to its functional, moisture-combating purposes, semi-gloss’ natural gleam gives it an elegance that can upgrade any room or object."
    },
    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss is slightly more durable.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss is slightly more durable. While both satin and semi-gloss are durable, semi-gloss is more damage-resistant to sun, rain, grease, and wind. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Semi-gloss is easier to clean.",
      "content": "Semi-gloss is easier to clean. “The higher the sheen, the easier to clean!” Semi-gloss is easily washable and more resistant to stains. Surfaces that get dirty easily like playrooms and pet-friendly spaces will be easily protected by a semi-gloss finish. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Satin is slightly cheaper.",
      "content": "Satin is slightly cheaper. Paints with radiant sheens usually cost roughly 2-3 dollars more per gallon. This means that, while the cost difference isn't major, satin is the less-expensive of the two. [10] X Research source"
