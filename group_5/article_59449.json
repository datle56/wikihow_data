      "content": "Passive-aggressive behaviors make you feel upset, angry, or sad. If someone says something passive-aggressively, it means that their comment has undermined something you’ve done or a value of yours. The comment likely has an underlying meaning. While you might not be able to hear it right away, it automatically makes you question or feel worse about yourself. Some examples include: [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A colleague using patronizing phrases like, “Per my last email…” or “Do you comprehend what I’m saying?” A family member giving back-handed compliments like, “You look more professional with your tattoos covered” or “You look prettier with makeup.” A friend texting, “I’m not mad” or “K.”"

      "content": "Do your best to avoid reacting defensively to de-escalate the situation. When someone makes a passive-aggressive comment, you may feel the need to defend yourself or make similar accusations about them. Try to avoid taking the bait—getting upset will likely do little good to change their habits and only aggravate them further. [2] X Expert Source Catherine Boswell, PhD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. Instead, act like what they said didn’t bother you. Try taking some deep breaths, count to 5, or even smile. Then, respond with something like, \"How about we work together on this or figure out what we can do to make this better?\""

      "title": "Focusing on the now can help you avoid future grudges or disagreements.",
      "content": "Focusing on the now can help you avoid future grudges or disagreements. After someone makes a snide or passive-aggressive comment, you may feel like bringing up the past or comparing the current situation to past transgressions they’ve made. While this may seem like the right thing to do in the moment, it can actually lead to more arguments. Stay focused on what’s currently happening rather than talking about past grievances to target the present problem. [3] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, if the current passive-aggressive comment is about the way you clean the dishes, don't talk about the commenter’s recurring lack of cleanliness around the house."

      "title": "Address passive-aggressive comments directly to prevent them.",
      "content": "Address passive-aggressive comments directly to prevent them. While it may be easier to ignore what’s been said and move on, if the comment bothered you, it’s important to stand up for yourself . Use clear, concise language to tell the commenter why what they’ve said bothers you. It’s okay to speak up for yourself. [4] X Expert Source Catherine Boswell, PhD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. For example, you might say, “I sense that you’re upset about something. Can we talk about it?” or “I'm not sure of your intentions with that comment, but I felt hurt when you said that.” If you’re nervous about speaking up, that’s okay! Try sleeping on your response and bringing it up the next day, especially if it’s something that keeps nagging at you. While confronting someone about their comments is the most direct and assertive approach, avoid assuming that they’ll change because of this. Some people may continue to disregard your statements or consequences. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Making a humorous comment can help diffuse the situation. Humor is a great ice-breaker tool that can help you and others feel more comfortable and less aggressive. So, use this to your advantage by cracking a joke or making a silly comment. [6] X Research source For example, let’s say you pass by a co-worker at work and say, “Hi, how’s it going?” Maybe they ignore you. To this, you might respond with a smile and, “That good, huh?” This may not work in all situations, so be careful with how you use humor. For instance, using it with a friend or colleague may be more appropriate than with a boss or authority figure."

      "title": "Make your response personal rather than accusing the commenter.",
      "content": "Make your response personal rather than accusing the commenter. One of the best ways to respond to passive-aggressive comments is to express why the comment has hurt you. Avoid comments that start with “you,” and instead focus on “I” and “me”—how has their comment affected you? [7] X Research source For example, let’s say a concerned family member makes a passive-aggressive comment about your poor diet or health. Try saying, “I feel sad about what was said about my health. I am trying to stay healthy and continue to make efforts to change.” As another example, you can say, \"I understand your comments and concerns, but when statements like this are made, it upsets me.”"

      "title": "Holding your head high shows that their comment doesn’t bother you.",
      "content": "Holding your head high shows that their comment doesn’t bother you. Demonstrate through your body language that their comments are not impacting you. Display a calm, cool, and powerful presence that’s not threatening or passive. This can look like maintaining eye contact , uncrossing your arms, sitting up tall, and keeping your chin up. [8] X Research source Practice active listening while you do this. Even if you disagree with what’s being said, it’s important to listen to the conversation. Plus, this will help you compile a strong, affirmative response."

      "title": "Healthy boundaries can help ensure passive-aggressive comments aren’t repeated.",
      "content": "Healthy boundaries can help ensure passive-aggressive comments aren’t repeated. If someone’s being passive-aggressive to you regularly, express your boundaries and what’ll happen if they break them. This is particularly helpful in the workplace or when dealing with frustrating relatives. When well-articulated, consequences can help passive-aggressive people to rethink their behavior. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re dealing with a co-worker who’s not interested in working on a team project, address the possible consequences of inaction and the importance of teamwork. Try offering consequences that are less threatening and more collaborative, like, “I see that this is a frustrating situation. But each team member relies on each other to do our work. You and I, we’re a part of the team. If we can’t meet our deadline, we could be fired. Let’s help each other so that none of us faces those repercussions.”"

      "content": "Sometimes, it’s best to accept that not all behavior can be reversed. Separating or avoiding someone might be the best way to deal with a passive-aggressive person , especially if other methods of communication aren’t effective. Some people aren’t worth your time, so reconsider interactions with those who undermine you.

Focus on what you can control (such as who you communicate with) rather than what you can’t. Talk to a therapist or counselor if you’re having a hard time dealing with someone who’s passive-aggressive. They’ll be able to give you personalized support and help."
