However, there are other ways to say, \"I love you,\" simply by switching up the language you use. For example, instead of saying the three words, “I love you,” you could say other meaningful things like, “I’m really happy you’re in my life,” “I feel lucky that I have you,” or “I love you for being you. [1] X Research source These different expressions offer some variety by giving specifics as to why you love your partner, and give a breath of fresh air in expressing those three little words."

      "content": "Tell them how important they are. Sharing your feelings to your partner about the positive impact they have on your life is a clear way of showing the love and value you have for your partner. For instance, if your partner makes spending time with your family easier, let them know that they make that interaction easier for you. If you have a bad day at work, and the moment you see your partner you instantly feel a wave of relief, let them know that just seeing them immediately puts you in a better mood. If your loved one makes your life better or easier, communicating their influence on making your life richer, lets them know they are wanted, valued, and loved."

      "content": "Allow yourself to be vulnerable . Being vulnerable means expressing your thoughts and feelings wholeheartedly, without reserve.

The important thing to remember is if you love someone, you opening up and wholeheartedly sharing yourself, expresses to your partner that them knowing the real you is worth the risk of you getting hurt. It is you making a self-sacrifice of security, for a deeper connection with them. Since sacrificing anything is not easy, being vulnerable with the one you love shows your commitment to the relationship."

      "title": "Vent your feelings to each other.",
      "content": "Vent your feelings to each other. If your partner is obviously nervous, upset, worried, or concerned about something, ask them to vent and share their feelings with you. Let your partner know that you want them to be able to let their guard down and spill what is on their mind. Sometimes, people just need to have a rant about what is bothering them. Let your partner know that you are there to listen to what they have to say. It shows your loved one that they can just let loose about how they are feeling, and you are there to be their outlet and listener. While they’re expressing their feelings to you, make sure you are completely there and in the moment. This means refraining from looking at your phone or any other kind of distraction and being focused on what your partner is saying. Be attentive to how they’re feeling when telling you what is bothering them, and give thoughtful feedback. If you find yourself at a loss for words, a strong and meaningful hug can always show you're there for your loved one. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Encourage your partner. As your partner’s partner, it's safe to say that it's your responsibility — as well as in the best interest of the relationship — to show your love, encourage, and help your partner achieve their dreams and goals in life. By providing a supportive environment, you stimulate your partner to be the best version of themselves and go after what they want. You can encourage your partner by saying things like, \"I believe that you can do this,\" \"You're a hard worker, and that hard work is going to get recognized,\" or \"All of your efforts are going to pay off soon.\" Supporting your partner, and pushing for their success shows your love in words of reinforcement."

      "content": "Write a letter . Sometimes writing an old-school love letter is a romantic way to show your feelings. Writing a letter can also help articulate feelings and emotions you've been having, by letting your stream of consciousness do the \"talking\". Think about what you want to accomplish with this letter. What do you want your loved one to know? Begin with saying why you’re writing them a letter. For example, you can say something like, “I was thinking about you, and how much I enjoy being around you…” or “Being around you is always so much fun, and I wanted to let you know…” Mention stories and memories that bring back good feelings. Just remember to write what you love about them, how they make you feel, and why you're happy to be with them. Writing a letter by hand is your best bet to show that what you have to say is meaningful, because it takes more effort than typing up a note or text message. Also, your personal handwriting shows through which gives a nice touch of genuineness."

You don't want to build your relationship off of lies and pretending to be someone you're not, so let your personality shine through. Sometimes, when you stuck about things to talk about, ask your crush about themselves or give them a compliment. You can say something like, \"What sports do you like to play?\" or \"You did really good on your presentation today.\" The easiest subjects to talk about with your crush are things you have in common, like classes, places you've traveled, or favorite restaurants. Talking about things you have in common will lighten the mood and help you relax."

Light touches are the best way to go to get your message across without coming off too strong. For example, if you’re talking with your crush or passing by them, you can give them a light touch on the upper arm. If you’re sitting next to your crush, you can casually let your feet or knees touch every once and smile to show your feelings. Just a little bit of physical attention will let your crush know that you like them. Touching your crush lightly just once or twice during a conversation is sufficient enough to let your crush know how you're feeling."

It can sometimes be hard to verbalize your feelings to someone you like, so writing a love letter is an easy way to express how you feel without having to do it in person.

For instance, you can begin with, \"I've really enjoyed getting to know you better over these past couple of months...\" or \"I just wanted to let you know that over this past year, you have become one of my best friends...” In our day and age of technology, typing out a text message or Facebook message is easy.

From there, you can dive right in, and explain the reason for the letter, telling your crush you have feelings for them. You can say something like, \"I just wanted to tell you that I like you, and I really like hanging out with you.\" Keep it short and sweet. You don't want to go too much into how much you like your crush or why, before you have your answer as to how they feel about you."

For example, \"I really like you. Nobody makes me laugh like you do.\" After you tell your crush how you feel, give them time to react and process what you've said. Don't immediately ask them how they feel or what they think. You don't want to come off too intense. Give your crush some time to react and respond, and try not to put pressure on them."

      "title": "Respond appropriately.",
      "content": "Respond appropriately. Once you say how you feel, your crush will either say that they share your feelings, or want to just stay friends. If your crush shares your feelings don't be afraid of your excitement. It's okay to be silly and giddy after you and your crush tell each other how you feel. If your crush just wants to be friends, be mature and say something like, \"Okay, I just wanted to let you know.\" It will hurt, but you always want to leave a good impression. Although you will be upset, try to act like it wasn't a big deal, and wait until you have some privacy to be sad about it. Once you know your crush likes you back, you can ask your crush on a casual date by offering to go see a movie together, or catch a baseball game. This will offer up some time for the both of you to get to know each other better. If your crush doesn't share your feelings, at least you had the confidence to take a chance. There are plenty of other opportunities to find someone right for you."
