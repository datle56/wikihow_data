Many countries offer a service that will mark the location of utilities in your yard. [1] X Research source Look for a service in your local area and make sure to dig away from the spaces they mark. If you’re replacing a post, you can just put the new post in the same spot as the old one. If you want to move it, get your utilities marked out. If you’re in the United States , call 811 to get your utilities marked out for free within 2 days. Once they are marked, you will have 10 days to install your mailbox post in a safe area. If you’re in the United Kingdom , use the service Linesearch Before U Dig (LSBUD) that will mark out the placement of utilities for free. Contact them through their website ."

Your country or local government may have regulations on the height and distance from the curb at which your mailbox has to sit. [2] X Research source Make a small cross on the ground with spray paint to mark a location that meets your local requirements. United States Postal Service (USPS) Guidelines: Before installing or replacing your mailbox, contact your local post office to get their approval. The opening of your box must be 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away from the curb, and 41 to 45 inches (100 to 110 cm) up from the surface of the road. [3] X Research source If you’re unsure about the regulations in your country or area, look at the height and placement of your neighbor's mailboxes for a guide on what yours should look like."

Use the post digger to make a hole in the location you marked until the hole is deep enough to hold the top of your post at the regulated height. [4] X Research source Throw the dirt you dig out of the hole onto a tarp to make it easier to clean up once you’ve finished installing your mailbox post. If you have an old mailbox post you want to replace, use a shovel to lift it and its concrete base up and out of the ground. Use the hole from the old post to install your new one. If you don’t want to buy a post digger, you may be able to rent one from your local hardware store."

Pour 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) of gravel into the bottom of your hole. [5] X Research source This leaves you with a 14 to 16 in (36 to 41 cm) deep hole. Gravel may be available from your local hardware store or nursery. You'll need about 10 to 30 lb (4.5 to 13.6 kg), depending on the gravel’s density and the size of your hole. If there's gravel in the hole from an old mailbox post you've removed, you might not need to add any more gravel as long as it sets your post at the right height."

Use a tape measure to check that it is sitting at the right height above the curb, adding or removing gravel to adjust it as necessary. USPS Guidelines: Make sure the top of your mailbox post is 41 to 45 in (100 to 110 cm) above the ground when you place it inside the hole. [6] X Research source The best mailbox posts are made of wood or aluminum that can fall if a car hits them. [7] X Research source Most posts have 20 inches (51 cm) of extra length at the base so it can sit in the hole. Make your own mailbox post by cutting a 4 by 4 in (10 by 10 cm) piece of wood to 65 inches (170 cm) in length. Cut a 1 by 6 in (2.5 by 15.2 cm) piece so it slides under the mailbox and attach it to the top of the post with wood screws. [8] X Research source Make sure your chosen mailbox post is weather-treated so that it won’t rot or disintegrate over time. Purchase waterproof wood or waterproof the wood yourself."

Mix the concrete with a stick to make sure the powder comes into full contact with the water.

[11] X Research source Make sure the post is steady and secure, and that it won't be disturbed for at least a day before leaving it to set. For extra stability, lean a few pieces of excess timber on each side of the post to hold it steady while the concrete dries. It may help to leave a sign on the post to reduce the chance that it gets knocked off center as it dries. Contact your mail carrier to make sure they don't disturb it. Most concrete mixes take 4 to 6 hours, but some may take longer. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for the recommended drying time."
