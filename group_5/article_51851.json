      "content": "Split open the charger and expose its inner wires. If you're willing to risk your battery exploding, you'll need a USB charging cable . The charger should have a regular USB end on one side, and a micro-USB end (like what you'd use on an Android) on the other. You'll need to start by exposing the wires inside the charger: First, make sure your charger isn't connected to a power source, or you could be electrocuted. Slice off the micro-USB end (it's the end of the cable that you usually plug into your phone). The other end will be plugged into a wall or power source later, so make sure you only slice one end of the cable! Cut into the cable near the micro-USB end, being careful not to slice into the cables embedded in the cord. Peel back the coating to reveal two wires â€“ red and black."

Insert the red and black wires into the bottom of your Vuse's charging port. If you're looking at the back of your Vuse, insert the red wire into the middle hole and the black wire into the left hole. You can use any power source to connect with your USB cable, such as a power block or your computer. The light should turn green on your Vuse if it's charging. Don't touch the tips of those exposed wires when the cable is plugged in or you will get shocked."
