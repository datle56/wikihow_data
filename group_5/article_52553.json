      "content": "Rinse off the celery and chop it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Give the celery stalks a quick rinse to remove any dirt and debris, then place them on a cutting board and pat them dry. Use a sharp knife to chop off the tops and the roots of the stalks. Discard those, and chop the remaining stalks into roughly bite-size pieces. You don’t have to pat the celery dry, but it can prevent your hand from slipping accidentally, which can result in injury. If your celery has any leaves on the stalks, remove those."

      "content": "Put the celery in a medium saucepan and cover it with water. Transfer the chopped celery to a saucepan and add just enough water to cover the pieces completely. Try to arrange the pieces in a single layer, but it’s okay if they overlap a little, as long as they’re fully submerged in water."

      "title": "Bring the water to a boil over high heat.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Set the saucepan on a stove burner and turn the heat to high . Let the water come to a rolling boil, which will probably take 5-10 minutes, depending on how much water you’re boiling. You'll know the water is at a rolling boil when you can stir it and it doesn't stop bubbling."

Then, put the celery on a cutting board and pat the stalks dry with a paper towel. Chop off the tops and the roots of the stalks with a knife. Then, cut the stalks into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. It’s best to remove any leaves that are on the celery stalks, but you don’t have to—they’re edible!"

      "content": "Rinse off the celery and cut the stalks into thin matchsticks. Run water over the celery to get rid of any dirt on the stalks. Put the celery on a cutting board and chop off the tops and roots. Julienne the stalks so that you end up with thin, matchstick-size strips. Celery is a root vegetable, meaning it grows in the ground, so definitely rinse the stalks off thoroughly before cooking them! Matchsticks work better for sautéing than bite-size pieces because they cook quicker and more evenly."

You don’t have to use exactly this amount of oil--just make sure the bottom of the skillet is completely covered in a thin layer of oil. Heat the oil over high heat until it starts to shimmer. You can also use peanut or canola oil instead of vegetable oil for this. Any oil with a high smoke point will work great! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sauté the celery pieces for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the matchsticks to the hot oil carefully. Let them saute for several minutes, stirring a few times to prevent sticking and to ensure the pieces cook through evenly. Remove the skillet from the heat when the celery becomes tender-crisp. You want the celery to be softened, but not so tender that it becomes floppy. If you want a little more flavor, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of soy sauce to the skillet while you saute.
