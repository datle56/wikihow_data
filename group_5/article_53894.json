      "title": "Your Elf Bar is defective or malfunctioning.",
      "content": "Your Elf Bar is defective or malfunctioning. It’s not common, but accidents happen. A defective device is often a result of incorrect assembly. Look for signs of loose wiring, an insufficient battery, or a blinking LED light. A blinking LED light means there’s an issue caused by the battery, voltage components, or improper use. [1] X Research source Elf Bars left in excessive heat or direct sunlight, or have been dropped in water can lead to a defective vape."

      "title": "You’re using an illegitimate Elf Bar.",
      "content": "You’re using an illegitimate Elf Bar. Fake Elf Bars are often cheaper than the real deal. A majority of the cost that goes into making vapes is their built-in safety features such as auto-off. Additionally, fraudulent companies don’t follow safety or quality regulations. Determine if your Elf Bar is real with these steps: Every Elf Bar comes with an authentication label on the side of the box. These labels feature 5 security features to prevent tampering. This includes anti-stripping, anti-counterfeiting patterns, fluorescent ink, holographic laser security thread, and micro text. Scan the QR code on the side of the box to receive a link to Elf Bar's security screen. This will confirm its authenticity. You can also manually type the 18-digit security code beneath the QR code.

      "content": "Your Elf Bar ran out of puffs. Every disposable vape has an estimated puff capacity which refers to how much you can smoke. For example, a puff count of 500 equals approximately 500 inhalations. Even if your Elf Bar can be recharged, it cannot be refilled. [3] X Research source So, when you’re out of puffs, it’s time to get a new one. The amount of puffs you get from your Elf Bar will vary depending on how long or short your draws are.

      "content": "You’re using a non-rechargeable Elf Bar. Most Elf Bars are non-rechargeable, meaning once the battery runs out, there’s nothing you can do. If you’re looking for a rechargeable disposable, take note of the following Elf Bar models: Rechargeable disposables: BC1600, BC3000/3500/4000/5000, BC5000 Ultra, BB3000/3500, LB5000, CR5000, 4600/5000, TE5000.

For rechargeable Elf Bars, you'll see a continuous bright light when charging. At full battery, the light will disappear.

After charging you may notice a repetitive flash. Don't worry, this just means charging has stopped. [14] X Research source"
