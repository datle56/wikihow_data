      "content": "Place a wrapped ice pack on your shoulder for 10-15 minutes. Inflammation is most likely at the onset of your pinched nerve and for the next 36-48 hours. Use a towel to wrap the ice pack so the ice doesn't directly touch your skin. Repeat every 2 to 3 hours as needed. [2] X Research source You can also alternate between cold and heat and see if you get more benefit that way. After the first 36-48 hours, you likely won't get any benefit from ice."

      "content": "Use over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as Advil to reduce inflammation. If you don't already have any, buy a bottle at your local pharmacy, grocery, or discount store. Follow the instructions on the package regarding dosage to temporarily relieve pain and inflammation in your shoulder. Check with your doctor beforehand to make sure it's okay for you to take these medications, especially if you're taking anything else."

      "title": "Stretches help decrease the pressure on the nerve.",
      "content": "Stretches help decrease the pressure on the nerve. Stretches work best if the pain in your shoulder is radiating from your neck into your shoulder. If a particular movement causes the pain to radiate out from your shoulder down your arm or back, that movement is not helping you and could be making your condition worse. Stop that exercise and move on to something else. [3] X Research source Here are some stretches you can try: Chin tucks: Sit up straight with your back flat against a chair and push your chin back into your neck without lowering your head. Hold the tuck for 3-5 seconds, breathing deeply. Repeat 10-20 times. [4] X Research source Chin tucks with extension: When you do the chin tuck exercise, extend back as far as you comfortably can, arching your back. Hold the extension for 3-5 seconds, breathing deeply. Repeat 10-20 times. [5] X Research source Scapular pinches: While standing or sitting up straight, squeeze your shoulder blades down and back together behind you. Hold for 3 seconds, then relax. Do 3 sets of 10 reps once or twice a day. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Take time to rest and use your shoulder as little as possible.",
      "content": "Take time to rest and use your shoulder as little as possible. With rest, your pinched nerve will likely heal on its own. In particular, you want to avoid the activity that resulted in the pinched nerve in the first place. [7] X Research source This can be difficult if you pinched a nerve at work or while doing a necessary task. Just try to take it easy for a couple of days and look for alternatives to using your shoulder. Repetitive motion also puts pressure on your shoulder and can compress your nerves. If you have to do repetitive activities, break up the repetition. For example, if you have 100 boxes to lift over your head onto a shelf, take a break every 10 boxes or so.

      "title": "Hunching your shoulders can compress your nerves and cause pain.",
      "content": "Hunching your shoulders can compress your nerves and cause pain. Sit and stand with your shoulders down and back so that your shoulder blades fall even on either side of your spine. When you're sitting or standing, make sure your weight is evenly distributed and you're not leaning to one side or the other. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're used to hunching, it can take some practice to get in the habit of good posture. Make an effort to start in the right position, then mentally check and adjust your position once every few minutes until it becomes automatic."

      "title": "Try to fall asleep in a position that doesn't put pressure on your shoulder.",
      "content": "Try to fall asleep in a position that doesn't put pressure on your shoulder. This can be difficult if you're used to sleeping on the side with the pinched nerve, but it'll help your pinched nerve heal more quickly. When you lay on your shoulder while sleeping, you put pressure on it and compress the nerve further. [10] X Research source Putting pillows around you will help keep you from rolling over onto your shoulder while you're sleeping. If you normally sleep on your stomach or back, you should be fine. If your position is putting undue pressure on your shoulder, you'll feel it and likely won't be comfortable sleeping that way."

      "content": "Set the heating pad on low or medium and use it for 15-20 minutes. You can repeat this every 2 to 3 hours if you feel like you get benefit from it. A warm shower might also help relieve tension and ease the pain in your shoulder. [11] X Research source If heat makes your shoulder feel better, you might want to buy heat wraps online or at your local pharmacy. You put these on in the morning and they're designed to provide up to 8 hours of relief."

      "content": "If your pain persists for more than a few days, have your doctor look at it. While it can take several weeks for a pinched nerve to heal completely, the pain should dissipate after a few days. If you still have the same amount of pain after 3-4 days, or if your pain worsens, get your doctor to examine your shoulder. Your doctor will talk to you about what you were doing leading up to the onset of pain in your shoulder and ask if you've ever had this problem before. Based on your description of the problem and a physical exam, your doctor might order imaging tests, such as an MRI, to better identify the problem."

      "content": "A pinched nerve in your neck can radiate out to your shoulder. Collars are often recommended by a doctor after an examination, but you can also buy a soft collar over-the-counter at your local pharmacy. If you think the pain is radiating from your neck, see if the collar helps your shoulder feel any better. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The collar simply keeps you from moving your head, so it has the most benefit if you only feel pain when you move your head in a certain way. A cervical collar is a short-term solutionâ€”don't wear one for more than a week unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Long-term use will cause you to lose strength in your neck muscles, which can actually increase your likelihood of having a pinched nerve again. [13] X Research source Doctors typically recommend a cervical collar for pain radiating from the neck. For example, if you've had an MRI that shows the pinched nerve is in your neck, a cervical collar might help."

      "title": "Corticosteroids offer relief if your pain doesn't respond to other treatments.",
      "content": "Corticosteroids offer relief if your pain doesn't respond to other treatments. If nothing else helps your pain, your doctor might prescribe corticosteroids after examining your shoulder. Oral corticosteroids you take in pill form following the recommended dose. Your doctor might also give you an injection directly in your shoulder. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you get an injection, you might find that your shoulder feels better almost immediately. Don't let this fool you! The injury is still there and going back to normal activity can worsen your condition. After taking corticosteroids, continue to rest your shoulder until your doctor gives you the all-clear. Typically, you'll start to have an increased range of motion within a few days."

      "content": "Learn exercises to strengthen and stretch your shoulder. Stretches and range of motion exercises can help with pain and healing as well as prevent future injuries. Your doctor is most likely to refer you to a physical therapist if you have restricted use of your shoulder for an extended period or if you get pinched nerves on a recurring basis. [15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your pinched nerve resulted from repetitive motion, a physical therapist can help you strengthen your shoulder as well as showing you different ways to move that are less likely to cause the same issue from happening again."

      "title": "Your doctor might recommend surgery if your condition doesn't improve.",
      "content": "Your doctor might recommend surgery if your condition doesn't improve. Surgery is more common when your pain is related to a herniated disc in your spine. The surgery removes all or part of the disc pressing on the nerve root so you no longer have pain. In more extreme cases, the surgeon might need to remove parts of vertebrae or fuse vertebrae together. If the pinched nerve is directly in your shoulder, surgery might involve shaving off part of the bone that's compressing the nerve."
