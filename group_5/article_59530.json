      "content": "Keep the car in park or put it in neutral with the e-brake on. The choice is yours—if your car is on flat ground and you feel like you won’t roll forward or backward, go ahead and shift into neutral! But, if you’re on a slope or a hill, keep your car in park so it doesn’t accidentally move. [2] X Research source Always check that you’re either in park or neutral before revving the engine. If you accidentally shift into drive or reverse, you could cause a serious accident. If you do put your car in neutral, engage your e-brake. That way, you have a much lower chance of rolling forward or backward."

      "content": "Press on the gas to rev the engine. There’s only one thing left to do: press on the accelerator. Since your car is in park or neutral, it can’t go anywhere, but you’ll hear the satisfying sound of a revving engine. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop pressing on the gas if the RPM nears the red line.",
      "content": "Stop pressing on the gas if the RPM nears the red line. Keep an eye on your tachometer, which tracks your car’s revolutions per minute (RPM). If the dial gets anywhere near the red line, take your foot off the gas. [4] X Research source Pushing your RPMs too high could “redline” your car, meaning you’re stressing your engine out for a long period of time. Too much stress on your engine could cause your car to stop working, and you may have to do damage control if you redline your vehicle."

      "content": "Shift into neutral. If you’re driving a manual, push on the clutch and then shift into neutral. If you’re driving an automatic, simply use the gear shift to shift down to neutral. Keep in mind that your car will be coasting at this point, so pressing on the gas won’t make it go faster. [7] X Research source In manual cars, you can also just step on the clutch without shifting into neutral if you’d like to. [8] X Research source While it might feel strange to shift into neutral in an automatic car, shifting while driving actually won’t damage your engine. [9] X Research source"

Instead, you’ll hear the engine revving loudly as you push down on the gas. [10] X Research source Keep an eye on your tachometer as you rev the engine. If the needle gets anywhere close to the red line, stop revving right away."
