Take the top card from your draw pile and turn it face-up in the middle of the table to start a central pile.

[4] X Research source If you slap or even just jerk your hand towards the card when it doesn't match the word, then you lose the round. The game is pretty fast-paced so you don’t have a lot of time to think. Try to maintain a steady rhythm as you're flipping cards and saying words until someone loses.
