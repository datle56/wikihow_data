      "content": "If you board when your child is a little sleepy, things may be easier. Kids can be unpredictable, but you should have a sense of when your child will be the most likely to be laid back. If they’re running all over the place most mornings, choose a later flight. If they tend to struggle to go to bed, fly earlier in the day. [1] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Alternatively, if your child is instinctively excited about flying, you might choose to fly when they’re going to be wide awake. That might be the calmest time for them. Some kids get irritated and annoyed when they’re tired of something they’ve been looking forward to."

      "content": "Aim to keep your child away from the aisle and strangers. Too many strange people may scare your child, and being near the aisle will expose them to all kinds of stimuli and potential dangers (like mishandled snack carts) that could throw a wrench in your plans. Remember, you’ll get to board first with a small child, so don’t worry too much about that part! [2] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source You may want to consider a few other variables, though. If your child is super excited to fly and they aren’t scared of heights, do your best to get them a window seat. If the plane has three columns of seating, don’t choose the middle section that’s far from the window. There are normally restrooms near the front and back of the plane. Sit close to them, if possible. Not only do kids need to go to the bathroom regularly, but you’ll be able to get up with your child multiple times without bothering anyone nearby."

You may also inquire about jog strollers, toys, or pack ‘n plays as well. You may need to call multiple numbers, but this may keep you from lugging something big around! [6] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. You can contact the airlines and airports you’re flying with to see if they have strollers for rent as well.

[7] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Depending on the length of the flight, you probably only need 1 extra change of clothes for your child and a tiny tube of diaper cream. Don’t overpack the formula, either. You can always buy that when you land. When it comes to diapers, the rule of thumb is 1 diaper for every 1 hour of travel. [8] X Research source If your child is in that in-between time when they’re transitioning out of diapers, feel free to use them for the flight. You won’t undermine any progress you’re making, and it can help avoid any accidents. When it comes to formula, breast milk, or juice you don’t have to follow the 3.4 fl oz (100 mL) rule. You can bring as much as you’ll reasonably need. Just make sure that you let the TSA know you’re carrying these things for your child before you go through the screening checkpoint.

[10] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. When it comes to toys, stay away from anything that’s going to make a ton of noise on the plane. If your child is older, consider packing some cards or games that the two of you can play together. If your child ever gets to use your phone or a tablet, make sure that you bring that along fully charged. Don’t forget spare batteries, remote chargers, and a set of child-sized headphones. You may want to pack crayons, pencils, and paper for your child to draw. Activity and sticker books are a great way to keep your child occupied.

Having an extra surprise in your back pocket will give you an out if you run into a sticky situation.

If you need to cull an anxiety-induced tantrum, reveal the surprise to calm them down. [12] X Research source If your child is obsessed with trucks, get them a nice model truck to play with. If they love Paw Patrol , buy a stuffed dog for them. If you’re packing a surprise food-based treat, stay away from anything that’s going to make your child hyper.

In the days and weeks leading up to the flight, keep mentioning how fun it’s going to be. Ask them what they’re excited about and address any of their questions; the more emotionally prepared your child is, the easier this will be on everyone! [13] X Research source You might periodically say things like, “Are you excited about our flight next week? It’s going to be so fun! I can’t wait!” or, “We go to the airport next week! I’m so excited.” Offer to answer any questions your child has, and remind them that it’s okay to be curious, scared, or nervous. The more comfortable your child is about the entire process, the calmer they’ll be on the flight. If you’ve got a slightly older child, you might walk them through the entire process so that they know what to expect (i.e. check-in, security, boarding, etc.). If you have a baby who can’t speak or understand you just yet, just smile and be positive with them the day of the flight. Keep your voice down and don’t express a ton of stress around them."

Set behavior expectations for the airport, the gate, and the plane. Your child has never flown before, so really spelling out what you want them to do will make things a lot easier for them. [15] X Research source You might say something like, “When we’re at the airport, I expect you to stay close, and hold my hand when I ask. It might be a little loud in there, but we still need to use our indoor voice. If you need a break, just let me know. We can relax a bit when we’re on the plane.” Setting a clear reward for good behavior will pay dividends. Offer to buy them a certain toy when you land, or give them extra time with the tablet on the flight if they’re well-behaved."

It can be scary for a child to experience a takeoff, turbulence, or even a cramped cabin space if they have no clue what’s going on. Show your child a few fun videos of people flying. They can be cartoons or even short skits of people enjoying themselves on an airplane. If your child can see what it’s like in a video, they’ll have an easier time behaving at the airport and on the flight. [16] X Research source There are tons of airplane-themed songs for kids on YouTube that will even give toddlers an idea of what they’re going to be doing. If your child hasn’t fully developed the ability to comprehend something like flying, you might explain it by comparing it to driving. This is especially important if you have an older child with a fear of flying. Showing them people being happy about flying can go a long way toward alleviating fear."

Children don’t move through security as fast as adults do, and if they start crying you may need a few extra minutes to calm them down before going to the gate. Show up to the airport at least 2 hours before your boarding time. If you have any extra time once you’re past TSA, find the airport’s play area and let your child run around. This way, they’ll burn a lot of energy before they get on the flight. [17] X Research source This also gives you time to shop for snacks if you didn’t bring anything from home!

It’s better to give your child an extra 15-20 minutes on their feet and board last (unless it’s open seating). [21] X Research source If they’re a little on the older side, you can always give them your tablet and let them play an interactive game to give them something to fixate on if you can’t get up. Make sure to monitor the games they play. You don't want the child installing things on their own, so install games with the child in advance. Make sure the device is in airplane mode, too."

But make sure not to disturb other passengers more so than they already are. [22] X Research source When in doubt, be encouraging and loving.
