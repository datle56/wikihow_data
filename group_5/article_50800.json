      "content": "Don't take yourself too seriously. One thing that annoys Gemini, are people who take themselves too seriously and will not enjoy at least a portion of humor. [1] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. All Geminis absolutely love to laugh, they enjoy being sarcastic, and they want to have a good time.

      "content": "Try not to argue. Geminis are masters of communication, in all respects. You can never really win an argument with a Gemini. The more you argue with a Gemini, the more you're fueling their fire to argue even more (because they love to debate for fun, it's in their nature), so really there's no point in trying to win an argument. Geminis can articulate well and validate every move they make. They also have an ability to see all sides of an argument."

      "title": "Never lie to a Gemini, because it's not a good idea.",
      "content": "Never lie to a Gemini, because it's not a good idea. Geminis have an unusual ability to know when people are being dishonest and once they find out you're withholding information, be deceptive (they need to know) or just straight out lying it will be a very long time, until you can gain their trust back. Geminis are caring individuals, but they will not tolerate dishonesty or lying on any level."

      "content": "Indulge your Gemini friend with great conversations. One thing that can irritate a Gemini is a person who cannot engage them in conversation. They find those who lack conversational skills to be very mundane. Have interesting things to talk about and keep in mind, a Gemini like to listen just as much as they enjoy speaking. Geminis are very intelligent, so don't just ramble about things you don't know about, because they have a lot of knowledge about different subjects and can tell when you're being pretentious."

    {
      "title": "Avoid being cocky or arrogant.",
      "content": "Avoid being cocky or arrogant. Geminis do not like people who are arrogant and who show off, for they feel this very distasteful, unattractive, and not becoming. Geminis do not like people who are too bossy. They are all fiercely independent and will not tolerate anyone stomping on their freedom, they need their autonomy. Geminis hate having the same routine and like to change things up more often than not. Geminis are very rational and analytical. They do not appreciate people who have tunnel vision, people who only see things in black and white, and people that are not open to the viewpoints of others, because they just don't operate in that mindset and considers it to be a weakness."
