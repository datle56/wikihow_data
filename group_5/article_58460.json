You can find a keyboard bench online starting at around $20 (€17). [1] X Research source If you don't have access to a keyboard bench, try to find a short bench or stool you can use instead."

      "content": "Place your hands on the keyboard in front of you. Your fingers should be on the white keys and your palms hanging off the keyboard. Keeping your hands relaxed, curve your fingers slightly downward so both hands are making a “C” shape. Your elbows should be hovering at the same height as the keyboard. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Relax and sit up straight. You want to maintain good posture without being tense. You should be scooted forward in your seat so that you're only using the front half of the bench. [4] X Research source To get into the right posture, try taking a deep breath and lifting your shoulders up toward your ears. As you exhale, slowly let your shoulders fall back into place."

      "content": "Learn the musical alphabet. There are seven notes in the musical alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. These notes go in order, from left to right, on the white keys on the keyboard. After the G keys, the musical alphabet starts over at A. Label strips of tape, putting one of the seven notes on each strip, and mark the keys on the keyboard. [5] X Research source To find one of the A keys, look for a group of three black keys on the keyboard. The A key is the white key between the second and third black key. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice playing whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes. Whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes are each notated differently on sheet music, and they’re played differently too. Whole notes, notated as empty circles, are played for four beats. Half notes, notated as empty circles with upward stretching arms, are played for two beats. And quarter notes, notated as filled-in circles with upward stretching arms, are played for one beat. [7] X Research source To practice, try playing a C whole note. Find the white C key and press down on it with the pad of your finger. Hold the key down and count to four. Then release the key. Try playing a half E. Find the white E key and press it down for two beats. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the C Major scale. Keyboard scales are groupings of notes that are played together. One of the most common scales is the C Major scale. To play the C Major scale, find the note C on the keyboard (C is the first white key to the left of a group of two black keys) and play it. Now play the next white key to the right, which is the note D, and then the next white key over, the note E, and continue playing the next white key in the row until you reach the note B (the last note before the next C). You’ve just played the C Major scale. [9] X Research source"

There are a variety of different chords that can be played, some simpler than others. One basic three-note chord you can start out practicing with is the C chord. Practice playing the C chord with your right hand by placing your thumb on the note C (remember that you can find C by looking for the first white key to the left of a group of two black keys), your middle finger on the note E, and your pinky finger on the note G. Press down on all three notes at the same time to play the chord. [10] X Research source"

Search online for “free keyboard sheet music” if you’re looking for a song to try out. Reading sheet music will be hard at first, but once you learn the musical notation you’ll get faster. Some good songs for beginners you can try out are: “Ode to Joy” by Beethoven. “Waltz from Sleeping Beauty” by Tchaikovsky. “The Entertainer” by Scott Joplin."

Your songs don’t have to be complex; just write music that you can play at your current skill level. You’ll have a better time practicing with your own music. To begin songwriting, start by experimenting with a few notes and chords. When you find something that you like, write down the notes and try to build the rest of the song from there."
