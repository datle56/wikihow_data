      "content": "Prepare a warm place for the milk to ferment. If using a thermos, ensure it is clean. If using an esky, fill it with enough warm water to mostly cover your container. If it is not waterproof simply place a tub or large jug of warm water inside. The water should be quite warm to the touch but not so hot that you can't hold your hand submerged for ten seconds. If using a warm spot you may want to place a sign or note there asking other members of the household not to move or open the container."
