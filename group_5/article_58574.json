A device will be applied to your face to abrade the uppermost layer of skin, i.e. rubbing it away via friction. This takes 30 – 40 minutes for the face and about 20 minutes for the neck. Afterwards, a moisturize will be applied.

Ask your physician for a recommendation. Read online reviews, but be careful. Reviews may be posted by clinic employees."
