      "content": "Open the chest. Go down the stairs in the Awakened Ice Admiral's spawn room and head to the right of the red carpet. You can walk through a wall in line with the stairs and find the chest containing Rengoku. You get two moves with Rengoku equipped: Demon Slayer and Burning Slash, both of which break Instinct (or Observation Haki) . They are single-target attacks, so you can't damage multiple enemies simultaneously. You can upgrade Rengoku at the Blacksmith in First or Second Sea with 8 Vampire Fangs, 20 Magma Ore, and 15 Scrap Metal."
