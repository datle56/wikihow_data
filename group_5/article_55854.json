      "content": "Pay attention to what's going on when your phone restarts. If your phone always restarts when using a particular app, you should try uninstalling that app to see if it makes a difference in your phone randomly restarting. You can also try closing all of your other open apps when you're using that particular app, as your phone could be restarting due to low memory while using that app."

      "title": "If your iPhone is running low on storage or memory, it may restart randomly.",
      "content": "If your iPhone is running low on storage or memory, it may restart randomly. Having a lot of data on your phone (be it a lot of files or apps) or running a lot of applications at once can hinder your iPhone's performance. This can lead to your iPhone restarting randomly because it's struggling with having low memory. Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage . From here, you can delete old messages and offload unused apps to help reduce the amount of storage space taken up on your device. If you have a lot of apps open at once, try closing the ones you're not using at the moment. Running a lot of apps at the same time can reduce your phone's performance, and eventually, your device will run out of memory to work properly."

      "content": "A failing battery can cause unexpected shutdowns. To find out if your phone's battery is the cause of the random restarts, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging . Under the button that says \"Peak Performance Capability,\" check to see if you see the following message: \"This iPhone has experienced an unexpected shutdown because the battery was unable to deliver the necessary peak power. Performance management has been applied to help prevent this from happening again.\" [1] X Research source If so, your phone may need its battery replaced. You can do this by contacting Apple Support, going to an Apple Store Genius Bar, or contacting a local iPhone repair shop. You can also replace the battery yourself, but only do this if you're confident in your tech repair abilities."

      "content": "Check to see if your phone needs an update. Outdated iOS software can lead to your device not working properly, including issues with random restarts. Tap on your Settings app (which is gray and looks like a set of cog wheels), then tap General > Software Update . If there is a pending update , follow the on-screen instructions to download and install it. Note that updating your phone may take some time, during which time your phone may be unusable."

      "content": "Open the SIM tray. If you have a physical SIM, removing the SIM card and putting it back in can help with your phone randomly restarting. You can open the SIM tray by using a paperclip or SIM eject tool. The SIM tray is located on the left side of your phone. [2] X Research source Remove the SIM card from the tray, then after a few seconds, place the SIM card back in the tray. Reinsert the SIM tray. Gently push the tray back into your phone until it clicks into place, but never force it. Then, restart your phone like normal. You may not have a physical SIM card. If you open the SIM tray and don't see a SIM card, check under Settings > General > About and scroll until you see information about your SIM. If you see a heading that says \"eSIM\" and no heading about \"physical SIM,\" then you must contact your carrier for eSIM assistance."

      "content": "Look in your phone's logs to see if there are any discernible patterns. Your iPhone keeps logs of analytics data stored on it, and while this information is mostly meant for tech support professionals, you can use it to discern if there's a specific app issue occurring with your device. Navigate to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data . Look through your recent logs to see if any particular app names are repeated. If so, this app is likely the culprit of your restarts and you should remove it. If you see the word \"panic\" in your log often, you should contact Apple, as \"panic\" errors are often signs of hardware issues."
