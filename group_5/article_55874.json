      "content": "Grooming behavior is done by predators to get a child ready for future sexual encounters. Some groomers try to bond with the child (and/or with the child's caregiver). Groomers often make their relationship with the child seem completely normal, which makes it harder for the child to identify the issue and cut ties. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask questions if someone gives special attention to your child. When a potential predator grooms a child, they’ll likely start giving them special attention. This might come as part of a special relationship. Watch for the person spending extra time with your child, giving them lots of compliments, or offering to give them extra help. Additionally, notice if your child is telling a lot of stories that involve the person in question. [2] X Research source Pay special attention to family friends, parents of your child’s friends, teachers, counselors, bus drivers, and coaches. Keep in mind that most teachers, counselors, or coaches only want to help your child. It’s possible that they’re paying special attention to your child because they have a special talent or need. For instance, a coach might give special attention to their best player. However, ask questions to be sure."

      "title": "Watch for offers to help you with childcare or household tasks for free.",
      "content": "Watch for offers to help you with childcare or household tasks for free. If someone is grooming your child, they’ll want to get access to them. This requires them to be in your house often. It’s common for groomers to offer to babysit your child, fix things around the house, or undertake household remodeling projects. Pay attention if someone is offering to help you, especially if they aren’t asking for anything in return. [3] X Research source Offering help doesn’t make someone a predator, and it’s possible they’re just being nice. When trying to decide if this is a sign of grooming, consider the person’s relationship to you and your child, as well as if they’re showing other signs of grooming."

      "content": "Notice if the person tries to spend time alone with your child. They may invite your child on a special trip or offer to help them with school or sports. In most cases, these trips won’t include other adults. Be careful about letting your child go on these types of outings, and try to make surprise visits to check on things. [4] X Research source For example, a soccer coach might offer to run drills after practice, or a camp counselor may offer to take your child on a special camping trip after camp is over. Don’t let your guard down just because other kids will be there. For instance, a groomer might invite your child to spend the night with just them and their own children. While this may be innocent, don’t hesitate to ask questions and look for other signs of grooming just to be sure."

      "title": "Pay attention if an adult is trying to be friends with your child.",
      "content": "Pay attention if an adult is trying to be friends with your child. A potential predator will want your child to trust them, so they’ll usually offer to be your child’s friend. They might play video games with your child and pretend to share their interests. Make sure you meet all of your child’s friends, and know who they’re spending time with. [5] X Research source It’s also possible for a groomer to first befriend you and then try to befriend your child. An adult who doesn't have bad intentions shouldn't object to you or another adult being present."

It's normal to be worried about your child, so don't hesitate to look into a situation you find suspicious. Don't alarm your child by sharing your concerns about the adult, but gently ask them questions to make sure that everything is okay. Get them to tell you about how they met the person, what they do together, and what they talk about. Here are some questions you might ask: [6] X Research source How did you meet your friend? What kinds of things do you talk about with your friend? What does your friend like to do? Does your friend ever give you presents? Has your friend gotten you candy or ice cream? Does your friend have kids you play with? If your child is reluctant to talk about their friend, or they mention keeping a \"secret,\" that can be a sign of grooming.

      "content": "Notice if someone is sharing adult information with your child. This might include dirty jokes, information about sex, or details about their own love life. No one should be telling your child these kinds of things especially without your knowledge. Listen to what your child talks about and question them if something sounds off. Additionally, when your child spends time around someone, ask them what they talked about. [8] X Research source You might say, “Earlier I heard you talking about thong underwear. Who told you about that?” or “Did you have fun at baseball practice today? What was coach saying to you after it ended?”"

      "title": "Watch for accidental, innocent, or unusual touching.",
      "content": "Watch for accidental, innocent, or unusual touching. As part of the grooming process, a potential predator will try to casually touch their target so that the child will get used to it. This makes it easier for the potential predator to graduate to sexual touching. Notice anytime someone touches your child, even if it’s innocent. Also, ask your child how they feel about the touch. [9] X Research source For example, the groomer might “accidentally” touch your child by bumping into them. Similarly, they may “innocently” touch your child by patting them on the back or giving them a quick hug. “Unusual” touching might include tickling or wrestling with your child."

They may surprise your child with things they want or items they need. Similarly, they might bring your child their favorite treats or offer to take them out. Notice when someone is spending money on your child so you can find out why. [10] X Research source If it’s around the holidays or your child’s birthday, it’s possible the gifts are innocent. Before you decide the behavior is grooming, consider the person’s relationship to your child and if they’re doing other grooming behaviors. For instance, it’s normal for relatives to give a child gifts."

They’ll ask you to keep your communications and time spent together a secret. Watch for them to say things like, “No one can know but us,” or “If people found out, we’d both get in trouble.” These are signs something might be wrong.

      "content": "Watch for signs that a person is trying to gain your trust. Someone who is grooming you will want you to trust them, which will help them take advantage of you. While people normally let trust develop slowly, a groomer will try to get you to trust them quickly. You might notice the following signs: [14] X Research source They offer you advice. They offer to be there for you while you’re going through a problem. They point out how others are untrustworthy. They claim to be going through something similar to you. They present themself as an authority figure. They give you compliments. They validate your thoughts. They pretend to reveal very important details about themself. They invite you to call them by their first name, while all other children call them by their last name."

Ask them if it’s okay to invite others to see how they react. Additionally, always tell someone where you’re going. [15] X Research source For example, they may invite you to meet them at a local park or might ask to you to come over to their home. Similarly, they may offer to tutor you or show you a really cool thing they just bought. If you ask to bring someone else and they get mad, upset, or suggest rescheduling to a time you'll be alone, then it may be a sign that something is wrong. On the other hand, they might try to use their charm to convince you that it's okay. Notice if they try to convince you that you'll have more fun alone. For instance, they might say something like, \"We'll have more fun if we go by ourselves,\" or \"There's only room for the two of us, so we might not get to go if you invite someone else.\""

Any time someone is showering you with items, it’s a cause for concern. If someone is buying you things, let your parent or guardian know what’s happening.

As you get to know them, watch for stories that change or details that they get incorrect. Additionally, stop talking to them immediately if you find out something is a lie. [17] X Research source For instance, notice if the names of their family members change, if they have trouble remembering something they told you before, or if their interests suddenly change to match yours. For example, let’s say you’re talking to a guy who says he’s the same age as you are, but then you meet in person and you realize he’s much older.

[18] X Research source For example, you might say, “Soccer practice was really tough today,” but they reply, “I’ll bet you need a nice massage. I’m imagining giving you one.” This is not okay.

Let them know that they can come to you at any time for help. [21] X Research source For instance, you might say, “It’s not okay for anyone to touch you, especially on your private area. Anytime someone touches you in a way you don’t like, even if they’re a doctor or teacher, tell me about it so I can make sure you’re safe.” Keep your tone soft and friendly when you talk to your child about dangers.

[22] X Research source Attend your child’s school's open house and other school events to meet with the faculty. Visit the homes of your child’s friends.

Talk to your friends and relatives beforehand to let them know that they need your child’s consent for things like hugs, kisses, or cuddles. Then, help your child make these choices by walking them through the process and supporting their decisions. [23] X Research source For instance, when you arrive at a family event and see your child’s grandmother, say, “Look, grandma is here!

Check all of your child’s communications so you know who they’re talking to. [25] X Research source Try installing parental monitoring software on your child’s phone and computer.
