      "title": "The Moirai",
      "content": "The Moirai The Moirai (also called the Fates) are a trio of sisters (and goddesses) in ancient Greek mythology who were thought to control human destiny. The first, Clotho (“Spinner”), spun the threads of life. The second, Lachesis (“Apportioner”), measured each thread. The third, Atropos (“Inflexible”), cut each thread. Together, they represent the idea that fate and destiny were set from birth. [1] X Research source Things like spindles, threads, scissors, and doves are all used as symbols to represent the Moirai (and, in turn, fate itself). In fact, the idea of threads or yarn representing fate and life paths is a common motif—it’s not limited to Greek mythology! Similarly, cutting those threads can signify either death or a turning point in your destiny."

      "title": "The Web of Wyrd",
      "content": "The Web of Wyrd In Norse mythology, “wyrd” is the concept of fate or destiny. The Web of Wyrd, therefore, is a symbol representing the idea of interconnected past, present, and future. According to Norse mythology, the Norns were three goddesses who controlled the destinies of gods and humans and were responsible for weaving the Web of Wyrd. [2] X Research source The three Norns were Urd (associated with the past), Verondi (associated with the present), and Skuld (associated with the future). The Web of Wyrd is sometimes called “Skuld’s Net,” and it’s associated with the Norns because, like the Greek Fates, they wove the threads of fate for all beings. In Norse mythology, the Norns are often described as dwelling by the well of Urðr at the foot of the world tree (called Yggdrasil)."

      "title": "The Wheel of Fortune",
      "content": "The Wheel of Fortune The Wheel of Fortune—also called the Rota Fortunae, is a symbol often depicting a turning wheel. This is thought to represent the cyclical nature of life, destiny, and good and bad luck. It’s a reminder that your circumstances in life can change in the blink of an eye—so it’s necessary to be prepared for both positive and negative changes. [3] X Research source The Wheel was associated with the ancient Roman goddess of luck and fortune, Fortuna. In Roman mythology, Fortuna would spin the wheel to change a person’s fate—with some gaining incredible fortune and others losing everything. The concept of a wheel of fortune originated in Babylon and was adopted by ancient Greeks before coming to Rome. Over time, the Wheel of Fortune became a symbol of fate outside of Roman mythology as well. For example, modern-day tarot cards still have a “Wheel of Fortune” card modeled after the concept of the Rota Fortunae!"

      "title": "The Red Thread of Fate",
      "content": "The Red Thread of Fate In Chinese and Japanese folklore, it was believed that individuals whose destinies were intertwined were connected by a red string. Thus, the red thread of fate became a symbol of fate, representing the idea that people could be destined to meet and be part of each other’s lives in some way. [4] X Research source In Chinese legends, the red string would be tied around each person’s ankles. In Japanese folklore, the threat would be tied around a male’s thumb and a female’s little finger instead. In Chinese culture, the color red is also believed to symbolize happiness!"

      "title": "The Ankh",
      "content": "The Ankh The ankh is an ancient Egyptian symbol representing life and immortality, with the loop at the top of the symbol indicating the neverending cycle of life and death. It also symbolizes the gods’ life-giving power and the idea that all lives are connected to the divine—which, in turn, led to the ankh being associated with the concept of fate. [5] X Research source The ankh is also commonly referred to as the “Key of Life.” In ancient Egyptian mythology, a person’s journey through life and the afterlife was part of their fate."

      "title": "The Owuo Atwedee",
      "content": "The Owuo Atwedee The owuo atwedee is an Adinkra symbol from Africa. It doesn’t directly symbolize the idea of fate; rather, it’s a symbol of the certainty of death. Its name literally means “death’s ladder,” and it’s inspired by the belief that death is universal for all individuals. Thus, it can also be a reminder of the fact that death is everyone’s natural and inescapable fate in the end. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "The Ouroboros",
      "content": "The Ouroboros The ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent (or dragon) forming an infinite circle by eating its own tail. It actually symbolizes the cycle of life, death, and rebirth that many ancient cultures believed in—and some also associate that meaning with the concept of fate and eternity. [7] X Research source One of the earliest instances of the ouroboros was depicted in ancient Egypt—but the symbol isn’t specific to that culture. For example, the ouroboros is also depicted in Norse mythology—and it’s been used as a symbol of divine power in Indian Hinduism."

      "title": "The Wheel of Dharma",
      "content": "The Wheel of Dharma The Wheel of Dharma (also called dharmachakra) is a symbol found in Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. In Buddhist teachings specifically, the wheel itself represents Buddha’s teachings and the path to enlightenment, while the circular movement of the wheel is also thought to represent the idea that nature (and life) is cyclical. [8] X Research source That’s why the wheel can often be seen as a symbol of fate; it symbolizes both following one’s dharma (or life purpose) and the idea that fate and suffering can change by following the Buddhist path."

      "title": "Labyrinth",
      "content": "Labyrinth Generally speaking, a labyrinth is an elaborate maze structure that’s difficult to navigate. In Greek mythology, specifically, the Labyrinth of Crete was said to be a deadly web of passages that was also home to the legendary minotaur. Thus, a labyrinth can represent fate and a person’s journey as they navigate the twists and turns of life to their ultimate destination. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Compass",
      "content": "Compass Compasses (devices that are designed to help you navigate) are practical objects—but symbolically, they’ve been known to represent guidance, direction, freedom, self-discovery, and protection. Ultimately, because they symbolize finding your way and navigating life, they can also evoke the idea of making your own fate and having the freedom to decide your future. Different symbols offer different versions or perspectives of the concept of fate! Some (like the Owuo Atwedee) represent the fact that everyone’s fate leads to the same ultimate place, while others (like the compass) symbolize the possibilities in life and the power of choice. Regardless, each symbol is a reminder that fate has many facets; some believe it’s predetermined, and others believe that fate (and destiny) is something you can shape yourself."

      "title": "Fate comes from the Latin word fatum, meaning “that which is ordained.”",
      "content": "Fate comes from the Latin word fatum , meaning “that which is ordained.” It refers to your lot in life, destiny, or even your guiding spirit. Literally, it means “thing spoken (by the gods).” In a positive sense, fatum (or its plural, fata ) is associated with prophecy, oracle, and prediction—but with negative connotations, it can also refer to bad luck, ill fortune, and ruin. [10] X Research source The words “ fatum ” and “ fata ,” in turn, come from “ fatus ,” which means “spoken.” In Latin, the word “ parca ” also refers to a singular goddess of fate—so its plural, “ parcae ,” refers to the three Roman Fates. Since the Greek goddesses of fate were called the Moirai, that came from a verb meaning “to receive one’s share.”"

      "title": "Fate is depicted as various goddesses across Indo-European mythology.",
      "content": "Fate is depicted as various goddesses across Indo-European mythology. Many ancient cultures adopted the belief that fate was governed by goddesses (usually a trio) representing the past, present, and future. The earliest example of this was actually the Gulses, from Hittite mythology (from an empire centered in present-day Turkey). Then, of course, there’s also the Greek Moirai, the Norse Norns, and more. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The Gulses (or Gul Ses) were two goddesses; they were regarded as benevolent and were also thought to oversee midwifery and birth. Greek mythology influenced the creation of the Roman fates, called the Parcae. In legends, the Parcae were a trio of goddesses who spun destiny and presided over the births of children; they were Nona (“Ninth”), Decuma (“Tenth”), and Morta (“Death”). Irish mythology also has references to fate goddesses who were said to weave threads of destiny—and there were supposedly seven of them!"

      "title": "Many Slavic folktales also refer to three spinning fate goddesses.",
      "content": "Many Slavic folktales also refer to three spinning fate goddesses. Lithuanian folktales refer to seven goddesses (called the “deivės valdytojos”) who could spin someone’s fate at birth and use the thread to hang a star in the sky. When that person dies, their thread would snap, and the star would fall as a meteor. Similarly, Latvian folk songs refer to a goddess called Láima (usually a single goddess, though occasionally a trio) who also wove children’s fates at birth. The Russian Rožanicy, the Czech and Slovak Sudičky, the Bulgarian Narenčnice, the Polish Rodzanice, the Croatian Rodjenice, the Serbian Sudjenice, and the Slovene Rojenice all reference three spinning fate goddesses, too! In Albanian folktales, three old women called the Fatit would appear after a child’s birth to determine its fate."

      "title": "The Fates (especially the Moirai) have many different artistic depictions.",
      "content": "The Fates (especially the Moirai) have many different artistic depictions. Of the Moirai, Clotho is often portrayed as younger (since she’s associated with birth and the past), while Atropos is commonly depicted as an old woman (since she cuts the threads of mortal lives, representing old age and death). Each also has a symbolic object; Clotho often has a thread, Lachesis has an eyeglass, and Atropos carries scissors. [12] X Research source For example, Spanish painter Francisco de Goya created a series called the “black paintings,” one of which was called Atropos and depicted the Moirai. Artist Anne-Katrin Altwein sculpted the three goddesses of fate with Clotho as a pregnant woman (instead of simply weaving thread)."

      "title": "The concept of fate is a common theme in books, movies, and more.",
      "content": "The concept of fate is a common theme in books, movies, and more. Over the years, the idea of fate goddesses has also been incorporated into numerous fictional stories—from playwright William Shakespeare’s Macbeth to the Fates in Disney’s 1997 animated film, Hercules . Their depictions vary, but each version of the goddesses is inspired by the Moirai (and other fate goddesses revered worldwide). [13] X Research source Other depictions of the Fates include: Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman comics, in which the fates are portrayed as beings called The Kindly Ones. The God of War video game series portrays both the Moirai as the “Sisters of Fate” (who were antagonists) and the Norns (as minor characters). Anaïs Mitchell's musical, Hadestown , also includes the Fates as characters. Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, which features the Moirai. Many works of fiction explore themes and ideologies related to fate, like the idea that everything happens for a reason, that fate can’t be avoided—or, conversely, that you can affect your fate through the choices you make."
