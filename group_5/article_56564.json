Phone records and call logs can be checked. Computers' browser histories can be traced. You can try erasing your call log or internet cookies and history. Some browsers also allow you to set them to “private” mode. But if you are worried that your abuser is monitoring your communication with others, you might want to find another computer or phone to use. Most public libraries offer computers with internet access to community members. This could be a good place to start. You may want to get a prepaid cellular phone. This could come in handy while looking for help and later, when you actually leave. You could also use a friend or neighbor's computer or phone. If necessary, make an excuse such as your own computer or phone being broken."

This often leads victims to believe that they have no one to help them escape their abuser. However, friends and family, even if you have been out of touch, may pull through and help you get out of a bad situation. Reach out to someone you trust and ask for help. Try to be specific with what you would like for them to do for you (such as let you stay with them, keep your “escape bag,” call the police for you if you give them a “code word,” etc.)"

If your abuser keeps money tightly controlled, withholds money from you, or does not allow you to earn your own money, it can be difficult to establish an emergency fund. Keep any change you can keep, return items to a store for cash back, hide any money given to you as a gift, or find other ways to build some emergency cash. If you can't get emergency cash, try applying for a credit card in your name, but be sure that you have statements sent to a PO Box, a work address, or even to a friend's house so that your abuser does not find out. Do not access your credit card account from your home computer. Having a credit card can help you establish or build credit (as long as you pay it off responsibly), which you may need for independent living after you leave."

You should certainly not provoke instances of abuse solely to gather evidence, but it may help you take legal action in the future if you do collect evidence of abuse. Take pictures of injuries, destroyed objects, or a room that was trashed during a violent episode, keep bloodied clothing or towels, and collect any documentation about hospital visits due to abuse. Whenever you are injured in an episode of violence, you should seek medical treatment in the emergency room and keep the records. This could be key to being awarded an order of protection, custody or your children, or a contested divorce. It is common for victims of abuse to be unsure of their sanity. Hours or days after a violent episode, they start wondering whether they have provoked partner's aggression, whether this is their fault. Documenting all the dialogues with your boyfriend or husband, their and your actions in a diary will help retain a clear picture of everything that happened to you. Also, these records will come in handy if you need to replicate the experience in a police office."

Ideally, you should talk to a shelter, abuse resource center, or a friend or relative ahead of time. In an emergency, however, these places should be able to take you in or refer you to a safe place even without notice. If you are going to stay with a friend or relative, try to choose someone who would not be immediately obvious to your abuser."

Some shelters may allow you to take a pet with you. If you cannot, you may be able to leave the pet with a neighbor or friend or even take it to a no-kill shelter for safekeeping.

Plan and prepare to leave at a time when your abuser will be out of the house, ideally for a few hours. Give yourself plenty of time to gather your emergency bag and get to a safe place before your abuser even realizes that you are gone. You do not have to leave a note or an explanation for why you are leaving. It is okay to just leave. If you do not have access to your own transportation, make arrangements to have someone pick you up.

Use your own cell phone to place calls to a hotel at least 6 hours away from your true destination. Use a shared credit card or bank account to prepay for the hotel room, and have an email confirmation sent to a shared or monitored email account. You can also book a rental car in the same place or leave a message for a real estate agent and ask her to call you back at your home phone number. Do not take these steps before you leave, as they could tip your abuser off as to the fact that you are going to leave, which could incite a violent reaction.
