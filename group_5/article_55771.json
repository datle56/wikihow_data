      "content": "Give it a few days (or even a week). Just because a guy hasn’t reached out yet doesn’t mean he’s not interested – he still could be! It might feel tough waiting for him to text you, but your crush might truly be busy and unable to respond to your messages right away. Waiting 2–3 days or up to a week before reaching out gives him a chance to text you first once he realizes what he’s missing. [1] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. If you’ve waited more than a week and still haven’t heard back from him, it might be time to move on. It’s really hard when a guy flakes out on you, but there are other people out there for you! You deserve someone who appreciates you and your time. [2] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 22 September 2021. If you just went out on a date with the guy, text him within the next day if you had a good time so he knows you’re still interested in him.

      "content": "Avoid getting upset at him. Rather than accusing the guy of ignoring you or leaving you on read, keep your messages lighthearted to nudge him back toward the conversation. Guys are more likely to respond if you talk about positive topics, so he might reach out again if you show him that you aren’t upset or worried about losing him."

      "content": "Guys will usually text a few times a week if they’re interested. When a guy wants to get to know you more, he’ll want to reach out a couple of times in between dates to get to know you better. He’s still living his own life and staying busy, so he might not be able to text you all the time, but he’ll still stay in touch so you know he hasn’t moved on yet. Most times, a guy will reach out first if he’s into you, but that shouldn’t stop you from texting him and starting the conversation if you want to talk. If he’s really into you, you can usually expect at least one text from him every day. [8] X Research source"
