      "title": "Make a loop with the string for your finger.",
      "content": "Make a loop with the string for your finger. Even though yo-yos come with loops, they often won't fit your finger tightly. Feed the string that's right under the main loop through the already tied main loop. Put your middle finger through the new loop, with the double strings towards your ring finger. The loop will tighten around your finger. [1] X Research source The part of the loop with two strings should go towards your ring finger."

      "title": "Work on the basic throw.",
      "content": "Work on the basic throw. Hold the yo-yo in your dominant hand with your palm up. The string should be on top of the yo-yo. Form your arm into a muscle, bent at the elbow with your forearm perpendicular to your upper arm, which should be straight out from your body. Flip your arm down into a throw, letting the yo-yo roll out of your hand as you do. Your arm should be straight out in front of you by the end. [2] X Research source Work on throwing the yo-yo as straight as possible from your hand, as that makes doing tricks much easier."

    {
      "title": "Pull the yo-yo back up.",
      "content": "Pull the yo-yo back up. When your yo-yo hits the bottom of the throw, immediately tug it to make it come back up. As it comes back up, have your palm facing down so you can catch the yo-yo. [3] X Research source If you can't get your yo-yo to come back up, work on throwing a little harder. This trick will only work on a responsive yo-yo, one meant to come back up. If you have an unresponsive yo-yo, you'll have to use the bind from the basic string tricks."

      "title": "Try the sleeper.",
      "content": "Try the sleeper. Throw the yo-yo to the front as you learned in the front throw. As you bring your arm down, snap your hand out and then stop the snap quickly. If done properly, the yo-yo should stay at the bottom of the string while still spinning, which is the sleeper. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Move on to walk the dog.",
      "content": "Move on to walk the dog. Throw a front roll into a sleeper. Swing the yo-yo slightly behind you, and then bring it forward. Touch it to the ground, and as you do, walk forward with your yo-yo, so it looks like you're walking your yo-yo. [5] X Research source Keep tension in the string. If you allow slack, the yo-yo returns to your hand."

      "title": "Perfect the front mount.",
      "content": "Perfect the front mount. Once you throw your yo-yo, let it spin below in sleeper to work it into a front mount. Use your other hand to push the side of your index finger into the string from behind, lifting the string up as you go. The hand holding the end of the string goes under the yo-yo from the back, threading the string around the yo-yo as you bring it to the front. Bring your dominant hand up to the height of your other hand. You should have three even lengths of string in front of you now. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Teach yourself the breakaway.",
      "content": "Teach yourself the breakaway. A breakaway is a throw you do across the front of your body, which is important in string tricks. Make sure the string is on the top of the yo-yo. The yo-yo should be in your dominant hand with your palm face up. [7] X Research source Lift your elbow out to the side to get a bit more power, and then roll the yo-yo off the edge of your hand facing outward, towards your thumb. As it rolls, let it flip in front of you towards your other arm."

As you come across your body, flip the yo-yo underneath your other hand, and let the string go around your index finger. The yo-yo will flip over your finger. Have it land on top of the string that's going in front of your body. [8] X Research source"

A bind is when you pull your yo-yo back to your hand on a non-responsive yo-yo (the kind that won't automatically come back to your hand). Start by throwing a breakaway. [9] X Research source As it comes towards your other hand, place a finger from that hand underneath the string. With your dominant hand holding the string, pull the string around the yo-yo and up the other side. As you come around with the string, let go of the loop of string you've created over your non-dominant hand, and then pull up with your throwing hand to return the yo-yo to your hand."

Have your yo-yo hand (the one holding the end of the string) slightly below your other hand, but they should be right near each other. Swing the yo-yo forward slightly. As it comes back, use the momentum to flip it over your hands by pushing into the double strings with your front finger. [12] X Research source Keep it going by using your other finger to twist the yo-yo around your other finger, making it flip over and over. The string will loop around your yo-yo hand, but you can just let the loops slide off as you finish the trick."

Place your hands fairly close together, then swing the yo-yo back and forth for the trapeze. [13] X Research source If you're having trouble, try throwing your breakaway into the side mount with more strength. Also, make sure you're landing the side mount as close to your non-dominant finger as possible, as it's easier to aim."

As the string flips around your non-dominant hand, you should still have quite a bit of string left. [14] X Research source Use your index finger on your throwing hand to flip the yo-yo around again. When it comes back to your non-dominant hand, flip it around and land it on the outermost string."
