If the router you want to add to your network (the one that's not connected directly to the internet) doesn't support bridging, you won't be able to use it to extend your Wi-Fi network. [1] X Research source Look for \"bridging mode,\" \"WDS,\" or \"repeater function\" in your router's documentation to see if it's supported."

You'll usually need to run an ethernet cable between your two routers, even if you're bridging to create a new wireless access point. Some wireless routers support bridging wirelessly, but this is usually just when both routers are the same model and/or manufacturer. The ethernet cable you use to connect your two routers should not exceed 320 ft. A longer cable could seriously impact network quality."

To connect your router to the internet: If the router and modem are combined in one device: Connect the device to the internet port on the wall using the network or coaxial cable that came with it, and turn it on. If the modem and the router are separate devices: Connect the modem to the internet port on the wall using the network or coaxial jack that came with it.

The main router is the one that comes from your internet provider (if applicable), or the one that plugs directly into your modem. One end of the ethernet cable should connect to one of the LAN ports on your router (they'll typically be labeled as such, or with numbers), and the other connects to the Ethernet port on your computer."

[3] X Research source Locate the Wireless or Wi-Fi Security area of your router's admin website. Write down the SSID (may also be called Network Name) and password. Write down the value of \"Security mode,\" \"Network mode,\" or \"Encryption mode.\" Write down the frequency, such as 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz. Go to the LAN or Network section of the router and write down the Internet (IPV4) IP address and subnet mask. If you have a TP-Link or Linksys router, you can skip this, but for many other routers, you'll need to write down the MAC address so you can enter it into the secondary router."

The steps are going to be a little different on all models. On TP-Link models, you can click Survey , select the main router's SSID, and click Choose . Then, enter the main router's Wi-Fi password (if requested) and click Save to automatically gather the details from that router. On most other routers, you'll need to specify the default gateway, which is that IP address you used to log in to your main router. You'll usually also have to enter the Subnet Mask, which should match the main router. If prompted to enter an IP address, enter any address on the same range as the main router. For example, if the main router's IP address is 192.168.0.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, you can make this router's IP address anything between 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.254. If supported by your routers, you may be able to connect the secondary router to the first router wirelessly. You'll have better results with an ethernet cable, but if a wireless connection is possible, you'll need to enter your other router's details into the Bridge Mode settings. Enter the original router's SSID (network name), password , security mode, channel, and Wi-Fi network frequency (e.g., 5 GHz). On most routers , turning on bridging mode will automatically disable the DHCP server on the secondary router. This is a good thing. If the DHCP server does not turn off when you enable bridging mode, locate your DHCP settings on the secondary router and disable DHCP."

If you plan to allow devices to connect to the secondary router via Wi-Fi, you will want the SSID to be a little different than the SSID of your primary router. You can make the SSID of the secondary router similar to the original router, but with a descriptor. Set the Wi-Fi password and security mode to match the primary router. For example, if your router is called Netgear2021, you can call this secondary router something like Netgear2021-Upstairs if it's upstairs."

If you're using a compatible Wi-Fi router that supports wireless bridging, minimize physical obstructions, such as brick walls and metal frames or siding for best results. Make sure the primary router is connected to the modem (if separate). One end of the Ethernet cable should be connected to the primary router's Internet or WAN port, and the other end into the modem or wall jack.
