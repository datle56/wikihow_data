      "content": "Provide a description of your problem. Follow the instructions to tell PayPal as much information as possible about the transaction and the fraud you believe the other person committed or attempted to commit. Be as detailed as possible. [4] X Research source If you have a link to an eBay listing, include that along with your dispute. Copy any emails or messages you received or sent to the other person. For example, if a teenager used a credit card or PayPal account without the owner's permission to commit fraud, you might have emails with the true owner of the account."

      "content": "Escalate your dispute to a claim. After you file your dispute, PayPal gives you 20 days to attempt to resolve the dispute with the other person. However, if you know the transaction was fraudulent, you don't need all that time. Instead, escalate the dispute to a claim so PayPal will start an investigation. [5] X Research source You may have to wait 7 days before you can claim fraud on PayPal."

      "content": "Forward spoof emails to PayPal's dedicated email address. Even with the strongest spam filter, you may still see emails from fraudsters pretending to be PayPal. They may have realistic-looking logos and other information, and typically claim that your account has been compromised. They hope that you'll follow the link in the email and provide your account information. [6] X Research source If you get an email that you suspect is a spoof, forward it to spoof@paypal.com. Never follow any links in an email. PayPal itself won't require you to follow a link or provide your account information, and PayPal will never ask you for your password."

      "content": "Log into your PayPal account yourself rather than following links. Fraudsters often send you an email telling you that your account has been compromised or you need to verify your email address or password. The link in the email will lead you to a website that looks like PayPal but isn't. When you enter your information, you have given the scammers access to your PayPal account. [11] X Research source PayPal will never send you an email with a link or ask for your password. Any email that does is probably trying to scam you. Some scam emails can look very convincing. However, you'll likely see typos or odd grammatical errors that you wouldn't see in a real PayPal email."

The customer sends money through PayPal for more than the purchase price of the item, then asks you to wire them the difference. The original payment is typically fraudulent and won't go through. [12] X Research source If you wire money, you'll lose the money you wired. If you've already mailed the item the fraudster \"purchased,\" you'll lose the item as well. The only way to avoid this scam is to cancel the order. Don't send an item to a customer until their payment has cleared your PayPal account."
