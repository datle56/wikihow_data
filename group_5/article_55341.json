      "content": "Recognize the benefits and reasons behind grafting. Many plants, including fruits, vegetables, ornamentals, and trees, are grafted and cross-bred over many generations to improve their attributes. By removing the top section of a plant that produces great fruit (also known as the “scion”) and grafting it onto the rootstock of a variety that absorbs nutrients well and resists disease, the plant will grow with the benefits of each variety. [1] X Research source Grafting can help create unique ornamentals or produce plants with specialized forms, such as making apple trees grow shorter to plant them in orchards. Grafting two plants that are the same variety doesn’t have any benefits because they’ll already have the same attributes as one another. [2] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Seeds from grafted plants will only contain the qualities of the scion and not carry the attributes of the rootstock."

      "title": "Use high-quality rootstock seeds or plants.",
      "content": "Use high-quality rootstock seeds or plants. The rootstock is the bottom plant in a graft that provides a root system and base. Rootstock seeds are available at most plant nurseries or gardening stores if you want to grow them on your own. Alternatively, choose a plant that has the qualities you’re looking for and has been growing for at least 1 year to use as the rootstock. [3] X Research source Generative rootstock puts more energy into producing fruit, but is more vulnerable to disease, cold, and heat. Consider using these in mild climates, such as the Pacific Northwest. [4] X Research source Vegetative rootstock tends to be less fragile and handles heat better, but won't produce fruit quickly. Choose a vegetative rootstock for long, hot growing seasons. Pick a rootstock specifically resistant to diseases in your area if you’re able to for better chances of the two plants growing together."

      "content": "Select a compatible scion that’s in the same species as the rootstock. The scion produces better fruit and is the top part of the plant grafted onto the rootstock. Scions have to be compatible with the rootstock in order to thrive, so look into the specific varieties that work well with your rootstock. If you are running a farm or commercial operation, research which scion plant will produce the type of fruit with the attributes you’re looking for. [5] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Example: You could use a French crabapple rootstock to increase disease resistance for other types of apple trees. [6] X Research source Example: You may graft different rose varieties together to reduce the size of the plant or to grow differently-colored blooms. [7] X Research source Most plants can only be grafted onto a plant of the same species, so a cucumber cannot grow on a tomato plant, for example. Some plants can be grafted onto related species in the same genus or family, but research the specific rootstock you’re using to see what’s compatible."

      "title": "Use scions and rootstocks that are the same size.",
      "content": "Use scions and rootstocks that are the same size. Grafting is most successful when the rootstock and scion have the same size stem. If you’re growing your own scions and rootstocks, plant the seeds at the same time in separate, labeled containers to tell them apart. If one of the varieties grows faster than the other, time your plantings so they reach the grafting stage at the same time. [8] X Research source Plant several seeds of each variety since there's always a chance some won't grow or survive the grafting process. If you're growing a large number of plants, use an online seed calculator to determine how to plant in your area."

      "title": "Graft plants during early morning or just after sunset.",
      "content": "Graft plants during early morning or just after sunset. At these times, the plant will be moving water from its roots to its leaves (transpiring) at a slower rate, which makes it less vulnerable to stress from grafting and the accompanying water loss. Ideally, try to carry out grafting your plants indoors or in a shaded location. [9] X Research source If you can’t graft plants in the early morning or late evening, move them to a shady spot until you’re able to do it."

Plants that have just been grafted are more vulnerable to temperature changes and infection until the plants have sealed together. Be gentle with grafted plants so they’re more likely to survive and to prevent infections from forming. Keep the grafted section protected with wraps around the point where they’re connected, or keep them in separate grow chambers to protect them from the outside elements. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Construct a healing chamber for your plants.",
      "content": "Construct a healing chamber for your plants. A healing chamber allows you to control the environment and humidity around grafted plants to protect them while they’re healing. For one or two plants, simply have a large plastic bag handy to place over each plant after you finish grafting. For a larger number of plants and a better chance of survival, put together garden frames and drape them fully with polyethylene sheeting . Cover the sheets with a shade cloth to block most sunlight from entering the chamber during the first stage of healing. [12] X Research source Use a frame with a peaked roof so condensation runs down the sides and doesn't drip onto the plants."

Before you graft any plants, monitor the environment in the healing chamber for at least a few days to make sure it is stable. The chamber is ready for grafted plants if the temperature levels are between 70–80 °F (21–27 °C) and the humidity is between 80–95%. Only keep grafted plants inside of the healing chamber because the environment may be too humid for other vegetation."

Choose plants that are 2–5 in (5.1–12.7 cm) tall when they have 2–4 true leaves and stems of exactly the same size. [13] X Research source Splice grafting works great on tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The first one or two leaves that grow on the plant are \"seed leaves\" and are not the true leaves. Seed leaves usually have a different shape or size than the true leaves, but the exact appearance depends on the species. If it's not possible to find stems of exactly the same size, use a rootstock stem larger than the scion. If the scion is thicker than the stem, then the graft may fail."

While it’s okay if the angle is a little off, try to cut the same angle for each stem so they fit together as closely as possible. Make the cut in one smooth motion to slice cleanly through the stem. Discard the top half of the rootstock and the bottom half of the scion plant.

That way, the two vascular systems of the plant can grow together, which allows the sap to flow through the stem without the risk of the scion losing any water or moisture. For 1 or 2 grafted plants, put a plastic bag over the plant and keep it out of direct sunlight. Water the base of the plant or mist its leaves when the humidity drops below 85%."

Leave the newly grafted plant in the healing chamber for at least 4 days but it often takes a full week before the leaves return to a healthy state. After that, remove the shade cloth or move the plant to a sunny spot to increase the amount of light your plant receives during the day. Alter the humidity by occasionally removing a pan of water or lifting up the plastic bag a little higher. Wilting is normal for the first day, so don’t worry too much. Mist the plant's leaves, and if the plant continues to wilt for 3 or 4 days, the graft is most likely unsuccessful. Even though splicing is usually reliable, grafts still fail about 5% of the time even in the best of circumstances."

Keep the point where the two plants are joined at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the soil to reduce the chances of the upper scion plant trying to grow roots. Just leave the grafting clip in place because it will fall off on its own as the plant grows larger.

As a general rule, the scion seed going on top of the graft grows faster, so plant it earlier than the rootstock seed if you’re growing your own. The specific variety of plant you’re growing may have different growing rates, so check beforehand to find the best times to plant. [17] X Research source Whip and tongue grafts work best for melons and cucumbers, but it can also work well for apple trees and other woody fruit-bearing plants. Plant the seeds in small containers because the two plants are grafted together while each is still attached to its own roots, so they need to be able to reach each other without being transplanted."
