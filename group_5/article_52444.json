      "content": "Contact posters are an update to iOS's contact card system. When you call someone in your contacts list who also has an iPhone, they will see your contact poster pop up on their screen instead. You can set up your own contact poster in iOS 17 , but you cannot set up a contact poster for your contacts—each iPhone user is in control of their contact poster."

      "title": "Contact posters cannot be officially disabled.",
      "content": "Contact posters cannot be officially disabled. While you can disable your own contact poster, you cannot disable the feature from your device entirely. However, there is a workaround to disabling another contact's contact poster: [1] X Research source Navigate to the contact, save their phone number, then delete the contact (tap Edit > Delete Contact ). Return to the main Contacts app and tap the plus sign in the upper-right corner to add a new contact. Re-add the contact you just deleted. Open your Photos app and navigate to a photo you want to add as your contact's photo. Tap the Share button in the bottom-left corner, then select Assign to Contact . Assign this photo to the contact you just added, and it will replace the contact poster with your selected photo. Note that this workaround is not intended behavior, as Apple has no official way to disable all contact posters, so this method may be fixed by a future iOS 17 patch."
