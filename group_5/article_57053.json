      "title": "Remove the noodles from the package.",
      "content": "Remove the noodles from the package. Some Ramen enthusiasts like to break up the noodles while the bag is still sealed, making shorter soup-like noodles that are easier to eat with a spoon, while others choose to leave the noodles in a block to slurp traditional-style. It's up to you how you want to eat them."

      "title": "Put the noodles into a microwave safe bowl and cover with water.",
      "content": "Put the noodles into a microwave safe bowl and cover with water. Typically, you'll need somewhere between 1 and 2 cups of water, depending on the size of the bowl you're using and the amount of broth you want in the soup. [1] X Research source To prevent splattering in the microwave, it's also a good idea to cover with a lid, or with a simple piece of paper towel to avoid making a mess. The noodles will sometimes float in the bowl, but that's nothing to worry about. They'll cook just fine. Make sure your bowl is safe to microwave for several minutes. Plastic containers and styrofoam are controversial to some consumers, because of concerns about BPA and other toxins being leeched into the food during microwaving."

      "content": "Microwave your ramen for between three and five minutes. Place your noodles in the microwave, set the timer, and start cooking . The exact cooking time may vary, since microwaves all behave somewhat differently. [2] X Research source To help the noodles cook evenly, and check to make sure they're not over-stewing (which can result in over-done noodles without any bite), stop the microwave about half-way through the cooking time and stir them with a fork. If you want the noodles to remain in a brick, just press on them a little, or flip the brick over to keep it whole."

      "title": "Let the noodles sit for about three minutes after the microwave stops.",
      "content": "Let the noodles sit for about three minutes after the microwave stops. Don't take them out right away! Many are the burned tongues of the over-anxious ramen eater. Just let it sit for three minutes in the closed microwave, and you'll keep your fingers and your mouth safe, letting them finish in peace and cool down to a less-than-nuclear temperature. If you must take the noodles out immediately use oven mitts or some other heat protection and be careful. Fortunately, this is a perfect time to add the flavor packet, while the water's nice and hot."

      "title": "Mix in the flavor packet.",
      "content": "Mix in the flavor packet. Stir noodles with a spoon or fork until flavoring dissolves, then pour your cooked Ramen into another bowl, if you want, and commence the deliciousness. [3] X Research source Alternatively, some Ramen eaters like to add the flavoring before the noodles cook. This is usually easier if you're cooking them over the stove, though it's still possible in the microwave. If you like the flavor to cook with the noodles some (it's a good way to get the noodles more tasty), put the noodles and the flavoring packet in the bowl first, then add the water on top to try to dissolve it some."

      "title": "Measure out 1-2 cups of water in a microwave safe container.",
      "content": "Measure out 1-2 cups of water in a microwave safe container. Another easy way to make ramen in the microwave is to boil water separately and add it to the noodles, letting them steep. If you like your noodles slightly more firm, this is an excellent way to cook them in the microwave. Depending on how much broth you want, anywhere between 1 and 1/3 cup and 2 cups is fine. Less will boil faster, but you want to make sure you have enough to make as much broth as you want."

      "title": "Microwave for at least 2 or 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Microwave for at least 2 or 3 minutes. Because of the way microwaves agitate water atoms, you won't see the water boiling consistently and steaming heavily like you will when you boil water on the stove. Sometimes, it hardly looks hot at all. Aim for a few runs of 2 or 3 minutes through the microwave, stirring quickly in between. When you're confident the water is hot, pull it out carefully with gloves or an oven mit."

      "content": "Put the noodles in a separate bowl. While the water is microwaving, remove the noodles from the package and put them in a separate bowl. You can add the seasoning packet now if you want to, or save it until after the noodles cook some."

      "content": "Pour boiling water over the noodles or into the noodle cup. When you've got your water hot, pour it over the noodles, cover the bowl with a paper towel, plate, or lid, and let the noodles sit for between 3 and 5 minutes, until the noodles are soft and delicious. Then enjoy! The instructions on the Cup 'O Noodles or Instant Lunch are somewhat vague in regard to the microwave. While the jury's somewhat silent on how dangerous it really is to microwave Styrofoam, it's probably better to heat the water separately and add it to the cup afterward, rather than risking making melted plastic for lunch. Yuck."

Instead of tossing in that little package of meat-flavoring, cook up the noodles and flavor the soup yourself. With some basic condiments you can get for cheap at most grocery stores, you can customize your Ramen into a delicious restaurant-quality meal. Try flavoring your broth with any combination of the following ingredients, after you remove it from the microwave: [4] X Research source miso paste Hoisin sauce rice vinegar lemon/lime juice Sriracha or red chili paste soy sauce honey green onions basil"

It's a simple way to hot-rod your Ramen. [5] X Research source Before you cook the noodles , consider adding celery, finely chopped carrot, garlic, or onions to the soup. Frozen peas work perfectly to add texture, as well as any other pre-cooked frozen vegetable you've got in the freezer. After you cook the noodles , add greens, or top with chopped herbs of any kind. Basil and cilantro are especially delicious, but why not toss in some rosemary and a tablespoon of half-and-half to chicken-flavored ramen? It's a savory treat that smells like Thanksgiving and changes the dish completely."

      "content": "Spice it up with eggs. A common addition to Ramen is the incredible edible itself, the egg. While it's somewhat difficult to do the egg-drop method of cooking eggs in the broth itself, you can still use the microwave to cook an egg right in the broth, or simply chop hard-boiled eggs and put them on top. [6] X Research source If you want to crack an egg into the soup to add density and flavor, remove the noodles after cooking them and crack the egg in. Stir it vigorously with a fork or a chopstick, and return to the microwave for another minute or so. The hot water should temper the egg itself, but you can return it briefly to make sure."

Toss out the flavor packet and make your own Thai-style peanut noodles from a package of Ramen, all with stuff you've probably already got in your kitchen. In a bowl, mix 1 heaping tablespoon of salty peanut butter, preferably an all-natural variety. TO that, mix in a sprinkling of brown sugar, a teaspoon of soy sauce, and Sriracha or hot sauce to taste. If you've got any ginger, it's also good to add in, or grate. When you take the noodles out of the microwave, pour off most of the hot water, leaving some to mix into the sauce. Pour the noodles into the bowl with the sauce and stir them around vigorously. Top with chopped cilantro and carrot. It's delicious."
