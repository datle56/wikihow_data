Then, give each player a stack of about 15 cards for their own Personal Draw Pile. The exact number of cards doesn’t matter as long as everyone’s Personal Draw Pile looks about the same. Keep your Personal Draw Pile in front of you to your right. [1] X Research source Throw Throw Burrito can be played with 2-6 players. It might seem a little unfair that some players have more or fewer cards in their Draw Pile than others, but the game goes so quickly that it won’t make a big difference."

When everyone’s ready, start the round by saying “3, 2, 1, Burrito!” Rather than waiting for your turn, everyone at the table plays as soon as the round begins, so you’ll have to race against the other players to play cards and earn the most points.

Immediately draw 3 new cards from your Personal Draw Pile so you have 5 cards in your hand again. [5] X Research source Each set of cards is worth points at the end of the round, so try to play as many as you can. If you ever run out of cards in your Personal Draw Pile, then draw cards from the Community Piles in the middle of the table, instead."

If you don’t have 3 of a kind, choose 1 of the cards in your hand and put it face-down on top of the player to your left’s Personal Draw Pile. Immediately draw a card from your Personal Draw Pile to refill your hand. [6] X Research source You can only discard 1 card at a time, so decide quickly so you have more time to draw cards and make sets. Be careful not to discard a lot of cards with the same name, since the player to your left might collect them in their hand and play a set. Remember, the player to your right is going to be discarding cards they don’t want onto your Personal Draw Pile, too."

The players on your left and right have to grab a Burrito as quickly as they can and try to throw it at the other person. Whoever gets hit with a Burrito first loses the battle. [7] X Research source Everything else stops as soon as a battle starts, so you can’t keep playing sets from your hand. You can try to run away, hide, and dodge the Burrito when someone throws it at you. If you catch the Burrito, the player who threw it loses the battle. [8] X Research source If the Burrito hits something else before it hits the other player, it counts as a miss. If both players miss each other, they can pick up a Burrito and try again. If someone who isn’t involved in the battle grabs a Burrito, the player who took the Burrito by mistake loses instead."

[20] X Research source If you successfully deflect a Burrito and it hits any other object, like a chair or the table, that counts as a miss. If you deflect a Burrito and it hits another player, that player loses the battle instead, and has to take a Burrito Bruise token.
