      "content": "Moderate drinking means limiting alcohol consumption to 1 or 2 drinks. The Centers for Disease Control defines moderate drinking as 2 drinks or less per day for men, 1 drink or less per day for women. It's important to note that this doesn't mean every day—aim to have more days in a week that you don't drink than days that you do. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If this sounds like a lot less than you normally drink, you're not alone. Roughly two-thirds of adult drinkers reported drinking more than this at least once a month."

      "title": "Track your alcohol usage for one week before cutting back.",
      "content": "Track your alcohol usage for one week before cutting back. Before you start drinking less, get a good idea of how much you drink, why you drink, and when you drink. Do this by keeping a log and writing down each time you drink, what you drink, and how many drinks you had. Include details about the circumstances, your location, and who was with you. This helps you identify triggers that make you want to drink. A big part of cutting back is avoiding those triggers, but you can't avoid them effectively if you don't know what they are. Go through your log and make a note of commonalities you see. For example, you might notice that you always drink whenever you're with your friend Bob, or that you always drink after fighting with your partner."

      "content": "Make a specific plan and put it in writing. Choose limits and rules that will work for you, based on your patterns of consumption. Include details about when you will and won't drink as well as what you'll drink. It also helps to write down the reasons that you want to curb your drinking or the benefits you're looking forward to. [2] X Research source If you're trying to lose weight, you might count the calories in the specific drinks you consumed and note that by drinking less, you're not consuming those calories. If you're money-motivated, total up the amount of money you spend each month on alcohol. Putting aside the money you don't spend after you cut back can really make you want to drink less!

      "content": "Let friends and family know about your plan. If you regularly drink with friends and family, they're going to wonder why you aren't drinking as much anyway. Telling them ahead of time that you're planning to cut back can spare you some awkward conversations. Beyond that, you can lean on your friends and family for support when you need it. [4] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I've been feeling like I drink a little too much and I want to cut back. So I'm only going to drink on Friday or Saturday evenings. When I do drink, I'm not going to have more than 2 beers.\""

If cutting back to only a couple of days a week seems like it would be too much for you to handle immediately, start with 3 or 4 days and then cut back again after a couple of weeks. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source Remember: this doesn't mean that you should drink as much as you want on those drinking days. You're still limiting the amount that you drink as well as the frequency. Some people benefit from taking a couple of weeks to a month completely off from drinking before they start a plan to drink moderately."

These could be people, places, activities, situations, or even emotions. Cutting back on drinking will be a lot easier for you if you can avoid the majority of these triggers. [6] X Research source For example, if you always drink beer when you go to baseball games, you might decide you're not going to go to baseball games for a month. If your drinking is sometimes triggered by things that are out of your control (such as fighting with your partner), find new coping strategies for handling those emotions that don't involve drinking. For example, you might go for a walk."

Typically, you'll be less inclined to drink if you're always busy doing something else. You might also start hanging out with different people who don't drink as much. [7] X Research source For example, you might decide that you're going to go for a walk with your family every evening after dinner instead of having a couple of after-dinner drinks. If your friends typically meet at a bar, you might suggest that you meet up at a café that doesn't serve alcohol instead."

When you're used to never turning down a drink, it can be hard to suddenly start saying \"no.\" You might feel awkward or weird about it. Having a phrase ready to go will make this easier. Here are some you can try: [8] X Research source \"Oh, no thanks, I'm good.\" \"I'm actually cutting back, but thanks for the offer.\" \"Thanks, I've had enough for now.\" \"Appreciate it, but I feel better when I don't drink as much.\""

These are things you can do as well!

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source Water is a great choice because alcohol has a dehydrating effect. But it doesn't have to be water! For example, you could alternate between a vodka cranberry and a glass of cranberry juice by itself."
