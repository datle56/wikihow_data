      "content": "Focusing on their current behavior can keep things more civil. Threatening an abusive person’s self-image by describing their character can make them lash out—narcissistic behavior comes from a place of deep woundedness, and these individuals are very sensitive. [3] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Use “I-statements” to describe how their current behavior is what you take issue with, such as: [4] X Research source Instead of saying, “You’re a narcissist,” say, “I feel like you aren’t currently taking my feelings into account.” Instead of saying, “You’re selfish,” say, “I think it would be helpful if you could try to explain how you think I might be feeling.” Instead of saying, “You’re abusive,” say, “I feel really frightened by your behavior right now. I’d like to hear what you have to say, but could we have a calmer conversation?”"

For example: If this person won’t let you get any words in, say something like, “I’ve heard what you’ve had to say. Would you mind if I expressed myself now?” If they won’t stop complaining about you, say, “I see where you’re coming from. I’d like to say a few things now.” If they call you demeaning names, say, “I understand that this is how you see me. Could you give me a few moments to share how I see things?”"

      "content": "Staying clear of the past can keep your conversation productive. An abusive person may dispute all the events of the past with you, and try to make you doubt your understanding of all of their past actions. These manipulative individuals are capable of holding grudges and anger for a long time, and tend to bring up past events where they felt wronged frequently. Try to stick to the abuse in the present in order to keep your conversation as targeted as possible. Say things like: [7] X Research source “I don’t think now is the right time to talk about the past. I’d like to focus on your anger about the current situation.” “I’m open to talking about past problems in our relationship later. For right now, I just want to be clear that I don’t find name-calling acceptable.” “I understand that you may be feeling frustrated about some unresolved issues between us. Let’s work on those after we’ve found a way to have a calmer discussion.”"

You have the right to leave a conversation whenever you want: if you want to continue your relationship, tell the person that you’re willing to discuss this issue later. Letting them know that you’ve heard what they’ve had to say and want time to think about it can give you a chance to escape the current interaction. Say something like: [8] X Research source “I have some other things to do now, but I’ll think about what you’ve said. If you’d like to talk more about this, you can call me tomorrow evening.” “I think that this conversation could be more productive if we took a break for an hour. Let’s watch some TV, and we can see how we’re feeling then.” “I hear what you’re saying. I need some time to process it, and then we can try revisiting this later.”"

      "title": "Strong boundaries are crucial to prevent further abuse.",
      "content": "Strong boundaries are crucial to prevent further abuse. A good method for setting boundaries with someone who demonstrates narcissistic qualities is empathic confrontation. This means showing the person that you understand where they’re coming from, then setting a clear boundary and sticking to it. For example: [9] X Research source “I appreciate that you’re concerned for my safety when I don’t immediately message back. Even so, you need to respect my right to space without screaming at me.” “I know you’ve had a tough childhood, and it’s not your fault that you have a hard time trusting people. Be that as it may, following me to work is completely inappropriate behavior.” “I realize you tried your best as a parent raising me. But telling other people that I’m a terrible daughter is not okay.”"

      "content": "Lack of empathy is one of the key symptoms of narcissism, so they may need hand-holding. A person with narcissistic traits won’t be able to consider the impact of their actions on you—it just isn’t in their character. When you say that you’re hurt, they might just think of this as a “you problem.” [10] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. While you might not be able to get them to change, you can try your best by carefully explaining how their abuse makes you feel. For example: “When you call me derogatory names, it makes me feel like I have no value.” “When you give me the silent treatment, I feel panicked and scared.” “When you throw things, I feel extremely unsafe.”"

      "content": "Your friends and family can help you recover from abuse. Grab a coffee with an old or new friend, call a family member, or just spend time with people you care about and who care about you to remind yourself what a good relationship is like. Understand that while your abusive partner, friend, or family member may never be able to give you the love you need, your other meaningful relationships can. [11] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020.

Think about what needs this relationship fulfills for you, which ones it ignores, and whether this relationship could ever meet those missing needs. It’s a good idea to talk to a friend you trust so that you can get an outside perspective. When you’re with someone who behaves in a narcissistic way, it’s nearly impossible to get your needs met simply because, to this person, they don’t matter. [12] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. If the person in your life is a parent or someone with whom it might be difficult to completely divest yourself from, try claiming some distance for yourself. This could mean seeing them less regularly or letting them know that you’re only willing to talk about urgent matters. If you’re leaving a relationship with a friend or partner and have a history of being abused by them, it’s okay to simply send them a message saying, “I’ve decided that it would be in both of our best interests to no longer continue this relationship.” Ghosting is also okay if your safety is at risk.
