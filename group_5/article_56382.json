    {
      "title": "Chop large roots with an ax.",
      "content": "Chop large roots with an ax. Identify the vine’s thickest roots above ground. Use an ax to chop the roots down to a stump. To chop the roots down to their stumps, you may need to chop or cut smaller vines and foliage as well. Wear gardening gloves and a long-sleeved shirt to protect your hands and arms while you chop the vine down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place roots and foliage in garbage bags.",
      "content": "Place roots and foliage in garbage bags. Make sure to pick up any flowers, seedpods, and pieces of vine off of the ground to prevent regrowth. If they are left on the ground, the vine may re-seed itself and start growing again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a shovel to dig up small stumps.",
      "content": "Use a shovel to dig up small stumps. If some of the stumps are small enough to dig up from the ground, do so. Use a shovel to dig around the stump to expose it. Chop any roots attached to the stump with an ax. Use a garden pitchfork to pull the stump out of the ground. Place the stumps in the trash bag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill 2 to 3 holes into the stumps that are left behind.",
      "content": "Drill 2 to 3 holes into the stumps that are left behind. Some of the stumps may be too large to dig up from the ground. Using a drill, place 2 to 3 holes into the stump."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour boiling water into the stumps if desirable plants are nearby.",
      "content": "Pour boiling water into the stumps if desirable plants are nearby. If the vine is growing near desirable plants and trees, use boiling water to kill the root system. Boil 6 to 8 cups (1.4 to 1.9 l) of water in a pot on the stove. Pour the boiling water into the stumps to damage the root system. You will need to continue this treatment every 4 to 6 weeks for several months to kill the vine completely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply an herbicide to the stumps if desirable plants are not nearby.",
      "content": "Apply an herbicide to the stumps if desirable plants are not nearby. Pour a full strength herbicide like Round Up, Rodeo, Pathfinder II, or Triclopyr 3 into the stumps. Apply the herbicide per the instructions on the bottle. Retreat any regrowth with the herbicide after 6 weeks. If trees and plants are nearby but you still want to use an herbicide, Round-Up and Rodeo are less invasive than Pathfinder II and Triclopyr 3. You can find these herbicides at your local gardening store."

    {
      "title": "Mow your lawn once a week until the vine is dead.",
      "content": "Mow your lawn once a week until the vine is dead. As you attempt to kill the large roots, the vine will start growing smaller shoots to keep itself alive. Mowing your grass once a week will keep smaller shoots at bay while you attempt to kill the larger roots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the stumps with mulch once the vine is finally dead.",
      "content": "Cover the stumps with mulch once the vine is finally dead. The mulch will help suffocate any remaining roots that are still under the ground. You can also cover the area with soil, cardboard, or something thick that will block sunlight."

      "title": "Prepare a mixture of high acidity vinegar and orange oil in a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Prepare a mixture of high acidity vinegar and orange oil in a spray bottle. Combine 1 ⁄ 4 gallon (0.95 L) of 20-percent acidity vinegar and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of orange oil in a large spray bottle. You can find high acidity vinegar online or at your local home improvement store."

    {
      "title": "Spray the trumpet vine with the mixture on a hot, clear day.",
      "content": "Spray the trumpet vine with the mixture on a hot, clear day. Don’t spray the vine if it has rained recently or if the forecast is calling for rain, or the mixture could wash away. Make sure you completely cover the vines, roots, and stumps of the plant with the mixture. Wear protective gloves and eyewear when you’re spraying the plant."

      "title": "Repeat if the trumpet vine doesn’t die after one application.",
      "content": "Repeat if the trumpet vine doesn’t die after one application. It may take more than one application of the vinegar and orange oil mixture to kill the trumpet vine. Wait for a hot, clear day to apply the mixture again."

      "content": "Look for green, leaf-like shoots growing from the ground. Trumpet vine spreads itself above ground and below ground. Keep the vine from expanding above the ground by immediately removing the new shoots that sprout through the soil. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove new shoots from your garden and flower bed with your hands. Wear gardening gloves to do this. Pull the new shoots up and out of your garden or flower bed. For stubborn shoots, use a garden hoe to pull them out of the ground."

      "content": "Keep mowing frequently to remove shoots from your lawn. Regular mowing helps prevent an old trumpet vine from re-emerging, and also helps stop a new vine from taking off. Mow your lawn once every 7 to 10 days."
