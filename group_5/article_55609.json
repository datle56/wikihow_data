      "content": "The right hairstyle can really help hide the appearance of thinning hair. While it may seem like cutting your hair would make it look thinner, it’s actually the opposite. Longer hair can look stringy if your hair is thinning. A good haircut can help draw attention away from thinning areas. Visit your barber, salon, or hairstylist for a cut that can help hide any baldness you’re dealing with. [1] X Research source If you have long hair, consider a cut that falls at your collarbone or shorter. A bob, blunt cut, or even a pixie cut can help make thinning areas less noticeable. If you have short hair, the shorter you cut it, the better. Especially on the sides of your head, which can help draw attention away from the thinning hair on top of your head. [2] X Research source If you have a hairstyle that’s an even length all over, the thinner areas will be more noticeable."

      "content": "Blow dryers add volume to your hair and make it look thicker. Avoid air-drying, which can cause strands to fall straight and make thinning hair look even thinner. Steer clear of towel-drying as well, which can tug and pull at your hair, potentially leading to more hair loss. Instead, use hot air to dry your hair, which will lift and separate strands and make it look thicker. [3] X Research source You can also use a blow dryer to help style your hair as you dry it. Keep the blow dryer constantly moving over your hair and hold it about 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) away so you don’t damage your hair. You can also apply a heat protectant spray to your hair before blow drying it so it doesn't get damaged."

      "content": "These have been proven to be effective products for hair loss. Both minoxidil and Propecia have been clinically trialed and scientifically proven to slow down further hair loss for many people. Minoxidil comes as a liquid or a foam product that you rub into your scalp. Propecia is a drug that you take in tablet form. Both of these products stop working if you stop using them. Talk to your doctor to see if they’re right for you. [8] X Research source Avoid “magical cures” such as castor oil or vitamin B products that claim to reverse hair loss but aren’t backed by scientific research. Check with your doctor before you try minoxidil or Propecia to make sure they’re safe for you."
