      "content": "Health and wellbeing Rising temperatures and air pollution caused by burning coal and oil can lead to several health risks, like heat stroke, dehydration, asthma, allergies, and respiratory disease. Severe rain and flooding also increase your exposure to waterborne illnesses and chemical contaminants. [1] X Research source Additionally, the real or perceived stress of experiencing severe weather events can increase your risk of developing anxiety, PTSD, or depression. [2] X Trustworthy Source World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization Go to source Warmer temperatures also cause mosquitoes and ticks to appear earlier and thrive in more areas, resulting in greater exposure to vector-borne diseases like Lyme disease and malaria. Going through severe weather events like fires, hurricanes, droughts, and flooding also increases your risk of physical harm."

      "title": "Food",
      "content": "Food Higher temperatures and more severe weather reduce crop and seafood production, making it harder for you to get the food you need. Important crops like wheat and corn are harder to grow and less nutritious due to droughts and flooding that affect soil erosion and nutrients. [3] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Warmer water temperatures affect fish and shellfish’s ability to reproduce and expose them to harmful algae contamination. [4] X Research source High heat and more severe weather also make it more difficult for agricultural workers to farm and fish, which disrupts food production even further. Severe weather also slows down the food distribution system by damaging roads and waterways, increasing food insecurity around the globe. High temperatures and droughts also limit the availability of water, while extreme weather like flooding can contaminate it."

      "title": "Cities and infrastructure",
      "content": "Cities and infrastructure Roads and bridges are damaged by flooding and other severe weather conditions, making it more difficult for you to get around your city and access important areas like hospitals and grocery stores. Extreme temperatures and weather also put a lot of strain on the energy grid and communication systems, affecting your ability to cool your home or workspace and get help when you need it. [5] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Coastal cities experience more climate change-related damage than inland cities. Rising sea levels and erosion lead to more flooding and destruction of roads, bridges, and buildings."

      "title": "Cost of living",
      "content": "Cost of living As the effects of climate change increase, prices increase, too. Higher temperatures and severe weather like droughts cause you to use more energy and water, hiking up your bill each month. Because climate change affects agricultural production and the transportation of goods, food, clothes, and household products are also more expensive. [6] X Research source Building materials and appliances that combat the effects of climate change also tend to be pricier, making it more expensive for you to buy or rent a house."

      "title": "Tourism",
      "content": "Tourism Climate change is affecting natural areas around the globe, reducing your ability to visit these spectacular sights and decreasing tourism revenue for countries that depend on it. Droughts and wildfires are damaging lakes and forests while rising sea levels and warming waters are eroding beaches and destroying coral reefs. Rising temperatures limit snowfall, making colder areas less of a destination, too. [7] X Research source Tourism doesn’t just affect tourists—people who live in tourist areas depend on tourism to make money and survive. Activities that contribute to climate change, like deforestation, are also responsible for damaging natural areas and affecting tourism. [8] X Research source"

Go to source However, human activities are the main contributor to the increases in temperatures and severe weather over the past 200 years. [12] X Research source Scientists have undeniable evidence that human activities are causing climate change: Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by 2.2°F ( 1.2°C ) since the 1800s, which is due to carbon dioxide emissions. The ocean’s average surface temperature has risen by 0.67°F (0.33°C) since 1969. [13] X Research source Sea levels have risen 8 inches (20 cm) over the past 100 years. [14] X Research source Glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice are declining. [15] X Research source Burning oil, coal, and other fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the air. The gasses get trapped in the Earth’s atmosphere, which raises temperatures."

      "content": "Climate change affects a wide range of factors besides temperatures. Climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of weather events like flooding, droughts, fires, and hurricanes. It’s also causing water temperatures and levels to rise and glaciers and ice to melt.

      "content": "Children, the elderly, people of color, and low-income groups are most affected. While everyone is affected by climate change, some people are unfairly at risk of its effects. Unfortunately, those who contribute the least to its causes are harmed the most by climate change. For instance: [17] X Trustworthy Source World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization Go to source Children, the elderly, and those who are pregnant or have a disability or medical condition tend to be more sensitive to heat and weather events. Black, indigenous, and other communities of color, as well as low-income groups, are often more at risk due to social factors, like living in areas more affected by climate change or having access to fewer resources. [18] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Agriculture, construction, transportation, and emergency response workers are typically more exposed to extreme temperatures, weather, and poor air quality.
