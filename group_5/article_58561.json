Turn the dial on your toaster all the way down so that you Pop Tart will get warm but not burnt. [2] X Research source You can turn your toaster to a higher setting if you want your Pop Tart a little more well-done, but keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t burn."

Keep an eye on your Pop Tart and take it out of the toaster if the edges or the icing start to turn black. [3] X Research source If your toaster doesn’t have a low setting, you can set a timer for 1 minute and just take your Pop Tart out manually."
