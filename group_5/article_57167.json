      "title": "Wash your hair regularly.",
      "content": "Wash your hair regularly. The simplest cause of an itchy scalp is buildup of hair products and dead skin cells. Therefore, if you aren’t already doing so, begin by making sure you wash your hair at least every other day. Use the pads of your fingers (the soft fleshy part of your finger tip) and gently massage the shampoo into your scalp. Rinse the shampoo out thoroughly with warm, running water. Make sure the water is not too warm though, as this could dry out your scalp even more. You can also use your fingers to “exfoliate” your scalp. When you are shampooing, reach your fingers all the way through your hair to your scalp and massage the skin. Make sure to do this all over your head, including the back. Don't scratch with your nails though, as this may worsen the irritation."

      "title": "Try a medicated shampoo.",
      "content": "Try a medicated shampoo. There are several shampoos on the market that are specially formulated to help deal with some of the causes of an itchy scalp. These shampoos may include one or more of the following active ingredients: coal tar, pyrithione zinc, salicylic acid, sulfur, selenium sulfide, and/or ketoconazole. Follow the directions on the bottle carefully, and if it tells you to leave it on your scalp for 5 minutes, then be sure and do so. This will give the product time to work. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Remember that these shampoos will take time to become effective. Before giving up on a particular shampoo, give it a few weeks to really kick in. If it doesn’t work after that, try a shampoo with a different active ingredient, or visit your doctor. Don’t use a medicated shampoo every day, though. These shampoos tend to be very strong, so you only need to use them once or twice a week. For your other washings, you can use a gentle every-day shampoo."

      "content": "Use conditioner. If you believe that the source of your itchy scalp happens to be the weather, or that the skin on your head is just a bit dried out, try using a good conditioner. Conditioner is meant to moisturize, so be sure to use it after shampooing. Don’t forget to rinse the conditioner from your hair thoroughly. Use your fingers to help make sure the water is able to penetrate all of your hair."

      "content": "Leave the hair products out. Sometimes, hair products or styling treatments can build up in the scalp and cause itchiness. Therefore, you should try leaving out a few hair products to see if it makes a difference. If leaving out one particular product seems to work, then you know what is causing the problem. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try to be systematic about it. Start by skipping one hair product to see if it makes any difference. If it doesn’t, then start using it again, and leave out a different one. Go easy on the heat styling, too. Applying heat can dry the skin on the scalp, so try avoiding heat styling products, such as the blow dryer, curling iron, and hair straightener."

[7] X Research source If you don’t have an Aloe Vera plant, you can also use the aloe vera gel you buy in a bottle at the store."

Treatment includes topically applied corticosteroids and emollients. Strength of the steroids used should be based upon body location, age, and degree of inflammation."
