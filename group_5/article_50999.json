      "title": "Taurus",
      "content": "Taurus As fellow earth signs, Virgo and Taurus share a lot of the same values. This is pretty important for a Virgo guy, who's unlikely to get into a serious relationship with someone if their values are at odds with his. Virgo guys also have a reputation for being perfectionists and have a stylish and sophisticated taste that Taurus will definitely appreciate. [1] X Research source Taurus and Virgo are both marriage-minded, although it might be a while before you hear wedding bells—they both like to take it slow and build a solid foundation."

      "title": "Capricorn",
      "content": "Capricorn Both Virgo and Capricorn are goal-oriented with a practical mindset. Capricorn isn't a very \"mushy\" romantic sign, but neither is Virgo. He'd rather do something to help you out than woo you with flowers and candlelight dinners, and Capricorn is much the same way. Both Virgos and Capricorns crave success, but Virgo doesn't always have the confidence to go after his goals. Capricorn can help him with this. When they work as a team, they're unstoppable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cancer",
      "content": "Cancer The traditional Virgo man is known for his unwavering moral standards. Cancerians also tend to have a strong sense of right and wrong and cherish family and tradition. Because they're already on the same wavelength, the two of them enjoy a warm, nurturing relationship. Cancer can be slow to open up, but a Virgo guy is self-assured and patient. He understands the crab's reluctance to trust people immediately because he takes relationships seriously too."

    {
      "title": "Scorpio",
      "content": "Scorpio Scorpio is naturally mysterious and secretive, which draws in a Virgo man and makes him want to learn more. The more he learns about the intriguing scorpion, the more interested he'll be. Scorpio values control and wants to be on top of whatever's going on in their life. This appeals to the organized and methodical Virgo guy who appreciates order and discipline."
    },
    {
      "title": "Libra",
      "content": "Libra Virgo and Libra are both very giving signs, but air-sign Libra can be a bit too free-spirited for the practical Libra guy. These two can build a strong relationship as long as they communicate with each other. It's easy for this relationship to become stagnant if neither is willing to shake things up from time to time. Planning a standing date night can help keep things fresh."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pisces",
      "content": "Pisces This is often a case of opposites attracting—the problem is staying together once those initial butterflies calm down. A Virgo guy relies solely on facts and logic, while Pisces looks to their feelings and intuition. Unless they happen to agree, they could end up going separate ways. These two will be fine as long as they open up emotionally. If they understand and appreciate each other's differences they can find a balance that works."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gemini",
      "content": "Gemini Gemini and Virgo are really looking for different things in a relationship. The traditional Virgo guy is definitely thinking long-term, while Gemini doesn't want to settle down. Virgo guys are also going to be a lot more serious than the playful Gemini. Since both Gemini and Virgo are mutable signs, though, they're both flexible. As long as they're open and honest with each other, they have the potential to build a relationship that works."
    },
    {
      "title": "Virgo",
      "content": "Virgo A Virgo guy definitely understands a fellow Virgo, but they face challenges because they're too much alike. They can also demand too much perfection from each other, which makes the relationship get pretty exhausting pretty quickly. Since they're both ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, they'll always be able to talk things out. The toughest issue is just them being too hard on each other."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aquarius",
      "content": "Aquarius A Virgo guy has a hard time making an emotional connection. Aquarians tend to blend love and friendship and are pretty casual about commitment. That attitude doesn't play well with the more traditional Virgo guy, who needs reassurance of that commitment before he's willing to open up. Aquarians also tend to look for someone who's different and edgy. A Virgo guy wants to stay about as far away from the edge as he can, so Aquarius probably won't be very interested in him."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sagittarius",
      "content": "Sagittarius These two are so at odds with each other that any sort of relationship with them is extremely difficult—especially a romantic one. Sagittarius tends to be really excitable, adventurous, and vivacious—all things the even-keeled Virgo man tries to steer clear of. Meanwhile, a Virgo guy's endless quest for perfection is going to seem pretty boring and uptight to a Sagittarius. Because they have so little in common, it's pretty unlikely these two will naturally cross paths. When they do, it's hard for them to connect on more than a superficial level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leo",
      "content": "Leo Have you ever heard the phrase \"all talk and no action\"? A Virgo man is more like \"all action and no talk.\" For Virgo, actions speak louder than words and talk is cheap—terrible news for the typical Leo, who needs compliments as much as they need air and water. Meanwhile, Virgo really wants a partner who will show their love through acts of service, which is not something the regal lion is in the habit of doing. Virgo tends to distrust compliments himself, so Leo is likely to end up disappointed if they pay him a compliment in the hopes of getting one in return."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aries",
      "content": "Aries The ram is the sort to throw caution to the wind. Unfortunately, Virgo guys are about as cautious as you can get—and that can spell doom for this pairing. Virgos are known as the planners of the zodiac, while Aries would rather just jump into action. Depending on their individual personalities, Aries and Virgo might find a way to make a relationship work as a bit of an odd couple—but only if Aries is willing to control their impulses and let Virgo take charge of the planning."
