[1] X Research source You'll have to wait for a Legend Lost Sector to show up that will drop a chest piece. You can complete the Master Lost Sector for a slightly higher chance of getting Gyrfalcon's Hauberk, but this is harder than completing the Legendary Lost Sector.

In PvE, you'll get Volatile Rounds for 10 seconds after ending Void Invisibility. In PvP, this is reduced to 3 seconds. When defeating an enemy with a finisher while you're invisible, all of your weapons deal bonus damage. This damage comes in the form of a 35% weapon damage buff for 6 seconds. When defeating an enemy with a finisher while you're invisible, you and any allies within 24 meters also get the Reserve Overshield buff. The Reserve Overshield buff gives an additional 500% base class ability regeneration rate. When you use a class ability, the Reserve Overshield buff will deploy a 40 HP Void Overshield for 10 seconds."
