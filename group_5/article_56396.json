      "content": "Be willing and ready. First off, make sure you are kissing for yourself, not because your friends dared you to, or you have been dating so long that you are far past the make-out point. Do this for yourself, so make sure you are ready to kiss him, both physically and emotionally."

      "title": "Get the obvious stuff out of the way.",
      "content": "Get the obvious stuff out of the way. Have a fresh breath, and soft lips, look nice and make sure that the \"touch barrier\" has been broken with hugs and flirtatious gestures."

      "title": "Get into the right place.",
      "content": "Get into the right place. This task is harder than people think, if it's hard to get into a place that is private, then the school might be the best place there is, for now, just make sure that you aren't being watched by a teacher or any other unwanted viewer."

      "title": "Talk for a moment.",
      "content": "Talk for a moment. If it's the end of the day, and you both are about to go your separate ways, then now is your chance, give him a hug and hold it for about 5 seconds, then pull back a bit, but don't move your arms."

      "title": "Look into his eyes.",
      "content": "Look into his eyes. Forget about being nervous. Think about this going great, because if you do this step properly, kissing will be the easiest thing in the world. Look into his eyes, tilt your head just a bit to avoid colliding, lean in and gently close your eyes, and kiss him. Try to look for a good window of opportunity! If he's in the mood to kiss, he'll be making eye contact and mirroring your body language."

      "title": "Don't forget to breathe (breath gently in and out of your nose) and kiss his bottom lip.",
      "content": "Don't forget to breathe (breath gently in and out of your nose) and kiss his bottom lip. Hold the kiss for about 10 seconds, keeping your eyes closed, after about 10 seconds, pull away, smile at him, and be happy for the rest of the day."
