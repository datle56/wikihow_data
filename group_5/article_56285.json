[1] X Research source However, it can come off as passive-aggressive because it’s an indirect request for your time or attention that doesn’t have a clear call to action. “Just checking in” also seems redundant because the other person knows you’re “checking in” when you send the email. “Just checking in” emails also usually lack context or important info and are not typically memorable for the reader."
