      "content": "Buy a DVD recorder. You can get a DVD/VCR combo recorder at most electronics stores. Or, if you have a functioning VCR, you can buy a standalone DVD recorder and connect your VCR to it. [1] X Expert Source Travis Page Video Content Specialist Expert Interview. 27 June 2019. DVD recorders cost between $100-$500 at major electronic stores or online. You can also usually find one between $50-$100 in good condition on eBay. With a DVD recorder, you don't have much flexibility regarding menus, buttons, and chapter settings, but it's the fastest and easiest way to convert VHS to DVD. If you have a VCR or camcorder with Firewire connections, you can get a DVD recorder with Firewire connections and transfer tapes at a higher quality. Firewire ports look similar to USB ports, except they are flatter and tapered at the end."

      "content": "Find the right cable. Your VCR/camcorder or DVD recorder may have the correct cable to connect to the other, but if not, you'll need to buy one. Both your DVD recorder and your VCR should be able to connect to an RCA or S-Video cable. RCA cables are red, white, and yellow. They connect to their corresponding colored ports on the DVD recorder and VCR. S-Video cables have four small, round pin connectors. Check the back of both your devices to see what kind of cable you need. If you don’t have the correct cable, you can find one at an electronics store or purchase an adapter. If you're using a camcorder, the cable that came with it should connect to your DVD Recorder. If you no longer have it, you can find the right cable at an electronic store or online for $5-$10. If your DVD Recorder and VCR/camcorder have Firewire ports, make sure your Firewire cable matches them exactly. The number of pins and the shape of a Firewire cable can vary slightly—they aren’t all the same. If you don’t have the correct cable, you can find it at an electronic store or online for $5-$10."
