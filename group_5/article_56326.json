      "content": "Allow the faucets to trickle in below-freezing temperatures. When the temperatures dip below freezing, make sure you crack the faucets on your sink to allow some water to trickle out. Moving water takes much longer to freeze. You don't have to open the tap all the way, but there should be steady trickle coming from the faucet.

It might save you a little money on your power bill, but if your pipes freeze, you’ll pay a lot more to repair the damage.

[5] X Research source If you don’t have insulation or heat tape on hand, try wrapping a heavy dish cloth around your spigot, then hold it in place with duct tape. If an outside spigot is dripping or leaking, fix the leak before the frost comes."

Closing the door will allow your garage to absorb more of the heat from your home. Even a difference of just a few degrees can sometimes make the difference when it comes to freezing pipes.

If this happens, you’ll need to be able to get to the water main quickly to reduce damage to your home. Locate your water meter before the weather freezes and make sure there’s nothing around it that would prevent you from reaching it in an emergency. [7] X Research source If you turn on your sinks and no water or only a small trickle comes out, it’s probably due to a frozen pipe. Turn off your water main and call a plumber.
