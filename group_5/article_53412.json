      "content": "Staple your fabric very tightly to the frame -so tight, you think it is going to rip. Staple one of the corners first, stretch it, then staple the opposite corner. Go back to the first corner, stretch the fabric, and staple about one inch clockwise from the 1st staple you made. Go back to the opposite corner, stretch the fabric, and staple one inch clockwise next the other staple. Keep doing this, going back and forth, and stretching every time, until you get all the way around the screen. What should happen is that you have to re-staple the first couple that you made because they are looser than the rest."

To see what you are doing, use a red photo-darkroom light. [1] X Research source"
