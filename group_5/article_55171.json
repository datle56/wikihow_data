It’s important to know that Joe just broke up with his girlfriend before you accidentally ask him how she’s doing! If he doesn’t offer to introduce you to his friends and it’s been a couple of weeks, bring it up casually yourself. Say something like, “I was thinking it would be fun to get our friends together to watch the big game this weekend. Want to?” Never badmouth or make fun of his friends.
