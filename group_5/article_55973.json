      "content": "Make your requirement a range, too. Just like your history, you should make your requirement a range, too. A $10,000 range is usually a good bet. Try placing what you want to make in the middle. For example, if you want to make $50,000, you could say your requirement is $45,000 to $55,000. However, make sure you are actually willing to accept the lower end before putting it on your resume. [6] X Research source When create a salary requirement, look at job listings that have salaries on them in your industry; look for similar level positions with your education and experience. That process will help give you an idea of a range, if you don't already know. You can also use salary surveys to help you. Don't forget, salaries vary by location, as cost of living will make salaries higher in some areas than in others. One reason to look for positions similar to your education and experience is that you can ask for more money if you have more experience or more education than other candidates. For example, if you have a master's degree, you can ask for more money than if you have a bachelor's degree. Don't add benefits and bonuses into the salary. The salary requirement range should be just your base salary. [7] X Research source"

In your cover letter, include it near the end of your letter. On the resume, you can add it as a section under your experience."

However, if the person who looks at your resume thinks you expect a certain salary, she may not call you in if it's too high, and if it's lower than the company was planning on giving out, you may not get all the money you deserve because you've already named your price.
