      "content": "Unfortunately, there’s no way to do a Wonder Trade as of April 2024. Nintendo has closed down the servers for all Wii U and 3DS systems, discontinuing many Pokémon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby features in the process. One of these now-discontinued features is the Wonder Trade—now that the servers are closed down, there’s no way to do it. [1] X Research source Local Pokémon trading doesn’t rely on these servers, so these features aren’t impacted by the server closure. With local trades, you and your trading partner are in control over what Pokémon you trade, while the Pokémon you receive in a wonder trade is totally random."
