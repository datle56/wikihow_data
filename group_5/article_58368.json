      "content": "Give each player 5 dice and a dice cup . Liar’s Dice works best with 3 or more players, and you’re only limited by how many dice you have. Make sure each player gets an opaque cup as well so players can shake up their dice without anyone seeing. [1] X Research source If you don’t have any opaque cups, you can just cover the dice with your hand as soon as you roll them. You can buy a Liar’s Dice set that has all the supplies you need to start playing."

      "title": "Roll 1 die to determine the starting player.",
      "content": "Roll 1 die to determine the starting player. Each player takes one of their dice and rolls it. Whoever has the highest roll gets to go first. If there’s a tie for highest roll, then have the tied players roll again. [2] X Research source After the first person, players take turns going clockwise around the table."

      "title": "Have everyone secretly roll their dice at the same time.",
      "content": "Have everyone secretly roll their dice at the same time. Put your dice in your cup and shake them up. Flip the cup face-down on the table to keep your dice hidden. You can peek at your own dice, but be careful so no one else sees what you have. [3] X Research source If anyone sees another player’s dice, have everyone roll again to start the round over."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the first player bid how many total dice of one value were rolled.",
      "content": "Let the first player bid how many total dice of one value were rolled. After they look at their dice, the first player makes a guess at how many dice are showing a certain face value between all of the players. Base the guess on what dice are showing under your cup, but don’t be afraid to bluff and say more than you have. [4] X Research source Example: If the first player bids “four 3s,” they believe that between all the players, there are at least 4 dice showing a 3. Bluffing lets you make a bid even if you don’t have the dice. For example, if you don’t have any 5s, you can still bid “two 5s” if you think other players have the dice under their cups."
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise the bid if you think there are more dice.",
      "content": "Raise the bid if you think there are more dice. The person to the left of the first player takes the next turn and play continues clockwise. If you want to keep the round going and raise the bid, it has to be a higher quantity of dice, a higher face value, or a higher quantity and face value. You can bluff about how many dice you think there are, or base your bid off of what you have under your cup. [5] X Research source Example: If the first bid is “two 3s,” the next player could bid “three 3s,” “two 4s,” or “three 5s.” “Two 2s” would not be allowed since it’s a lower quantity and face value. Some variations consider “1s” to be wild, meaning they can be any value. However, if “1s” are bid by the first player, then they count as their face value for the rest of the round. Even if you don’t have any dice under your cup that match your bid, there’s still a good probability that other players have them. Be conservative with your bids so you don’t get caught bluffing. Bidding something like “ten 6s” would take a lot of luck, but a bid of “three 6s” sounds more believable."

      "title": "Challenge the last bid if you think it’s wrong.",
      "content": "Challenge the last bid if you think it’s wrong. Instead of raising the bid, you can challenge it to call another player’s bluff and end the round. Say “Liar!” or “Challenge!” when it’s your turn to let the previous player know you don’t believe their bid. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Reveal all the dice when a player challenges.",
      "content": "Reveal all the dice when a player challenges. Have everyone lift up their cups to reveal all of the dice. If there are fewer dice showing than the bid, whoever made the bet loses the round. If the number of dice is equal to or more than the bid, the player who made the challenge was wrong and loses the round. [7] X Research source Example: Raul bets “seven 6s.” Nya doesn’t believe him and challenges. There are nine 6s after revealing the dice, so Raul wins and Nya loses. Example: Ali bet “six 3s.” Camila thinks he’s lying and challenges. There are only four 3s showing, so Camila wins and Ali loses."

      "content": "Lose a die if you lost the round. Take one of the dice out of your cup and set it aside. That die is out for the rest of the game, so you’ll roll fewer dice during the next round. [8] X Research source If you lose your last die, then you’re knocked out of the game. If the person made their bid exactly, you can play with the “spot on” rule and have all players lose a die except for the bidder."
