      "content": "Different cultures have different ideas of personal space. Generally, it's considered rude to get in someone's face, or to sit or stand too close to someone you don't know. Stay about arm's length away—enough room for a bow or a handshake—until you learn what the other person is comfortable with. [1] X Research source For example, people from Latin American cultures often stand closer together and touch each other frequently. However, if you do this when you've just met someone, they might feel uncomfortable."

      "title": "Enunciate and say each word clearly so the person can follow.",
      "content": "Enunciate and say each word clearly so the person can follow. If you're talking to someone whose first language isn't your native language, make sure they understand every word. You don't have to raise your voice (unless they're actually hard of hearing)—just use correct pronunciation and say every syllable of each word distinctly. Pause between each sentence to give them a moment to comprehend what you've said. [2] X Research source Maintain eye contact as you talk so you can tell if they're understanding what you say. If they appear confused, stop and ask them to tell you what they don't understand so you can make it clearer for them."

      "title": "Metaphors, idioms, and slang are hard for non-native speakers to understand.",
      "content": "Metaphors, idioms, and slang are hard for non-native speakers to understand. Non-native speakers tend to understand words literally, which makes figurative language more difficult for them to translate. You'll be less likely to miscommunicate if you say exactly what you mean. Some slang becomes so ingrained in your speech that you might not even recognize it as slang. For example, suppose you said, \"I would've bombed that test if I hadn't hit the books, so I had to pull an all-nighter to ace it.\" In that seemingly simple sentence, words like \"bombed,\" \"hit,\" \"all-nighter,\" and \"ace\" are slang terms that might confuse a non-native speaker. Avoid sarcasm, which doesn't translate well. It's hard to understand and can be even harder to explain—especially if you're talking to someone whose culture doesn't really use sarcasm or dry humor."

      "title": "Maintain a formal, reserved posture with your hands folded or at your side.",
      "content": "Maintain a formal, reserved posture with your hands folded or at your side. Hand gestures, in particular, can be a minefield in cross-cultural communication. Even \"talking with your hands,\" which is common in some cultures, can seem overly familiar and casual in others. [3] X Research source Some gestures that are fine in your culture might be rude in another culture. For example, pointing at someone is rude in many cultures. Even a subtle nod of the head doesn't always mean \"yes\"—if you're talking to a Bulgarian or a Greek, it means the opposite. [4] X Research source Often you'll be fine if you simply mirror the other person's stance. For example, if they're standing with their hands clasped behind their back and you stand in the same way, you'll be unlikely to offend them or miscommunicate your intent. If you're sitting, keep your feet flat on the floor or cross them at the ankles and try not to fidget too much. Showing the soles of your feet or pointing them toward another person is offensive to people from certain parts of the Middle East and India. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Many cultures maintain a high degree of formality with strangers. Some cultures are more casual than others, but you can never go wrong with being overly polite. If you're being excessively formal, the person you're talking to will correct you—but they certainly won't be offended by it. [6] X Research source Generally, refer to strangers by their surname and \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" In many cultures, it's a big deal to be on a first-name basis with someone. If they prefer that you call them by their first name, or by something else, they'll let you know. Remember your manners! Regularly use words such as \"please,\" \"thank you,\" \"excuse me,\" \"pardon me,\" and \"I'm sorry.\" If you know some of these words and phrases in the person's native language, they'll appreciate it all the more."

      "content": "Keep eye contact brief to show respect and attention. Different cultures treat eye contact differently, so it's best to keep it brief if you're trying to avoid miscommunication. In some Asian, Latin American, and African communities, prolonged eye contact is seen as rude and challenging. [7] X Research source In more hierarchal cultures, such as many Asian cultures, avoid eye contact if you're speaking to someone older than you or in a position of authority. This communicates respect for their position. In Middle Eastern cultures, prolonged eye contact is common if you're speaking to someone of the same gender, but if you're speaking to someone of another sex, eye contact should generally be avoided."

      "content": "Providing a physical demonstration ensures nothing gets lost in translation. Although you do want to be careful with hand gestures generally, it's entirely different if you're showing someone how to do something. A demonstration is usually easier to follow than verbal directions—especially if you're not speaking the person's native language. [8] X Research source For example, if you're talking about baking a cake, you might mime the act of stirring, using a spoon in an empty bowl. You could also wave your hands over the cake to demonstrate how to spread the icing on the cake after it cools. If you're showing someone how to use something, walk them through the steps while using it yourself. Physical demonstrations are also helpful if you're trying to communicate in a non-native language and don't remember the word for something. If you can show the other person what you mean, they'll usually catch on pretty quick."

      "title": "Use open-ended questions to get additional details or clarification.",
      "content": "Use open-ended questions to get additional details or clarification. While yes/no questions might seem easier for the other person to answer, many cultures stigmatize negative answers. That means you'll get some sort of \"yes\" answer every time, even if it's not meant—and this can lead to a lot of confusion. Open-ended questions give you enough information to figure out what the person really means. [9] X Expert Source Jeffrey Fermin Employee Relations Expert Expert Interview. 11 July 2022. [10] X Research source Likewise, if you want to make sure the person understood you, ask them to repeat what you said rather than simply asking them if they understood. You can also simply repeat an ambiguous word or phrase as a way to seek clarification. [11] X Research source For example, if the person keeps mentioning your assistant and you don't have an assistant, you might say \"Assistant?\" They'll fill in information about the person they're talking about, and then you can clarify that person's role."

      "content": "Look up information about cultural norms online before meeting someone. A simple search with the name of the person's culture or nationality and a phrase such as \"cultural etiquette,\" \"social norms,\" or \"customs and norms\" will get you the information you need. If you're talking to someone in a particular context, find out cultural norms that are applicable there as well. [12] X Research source Take the time to get to know your coworker so you can understand how they like to communicate. [13] X Expert Source Jeffrey Fermin Employee Relations Expert Expert Interview. 11 July 2022. Keep in mind that cultures can be extremely varied, so be as specific as possible. For example, while you'll get some information by searching for \"Asian culture,\" you'll get better information if you look specifically for \"Chinese culture,\" \"Korean culture,\" or \"Japanese culture.\" For example, if you're meeting someone as a business representative to negotiate a contract, look up cultural norms both for business and for contract negotiation. Picking up some common words and phrases in someone's native language also helps a lot! For example, polite words and phrases such as \"I'm sorry,\" \"please,\" and \"thank you\" can help smooth out any missteps."
