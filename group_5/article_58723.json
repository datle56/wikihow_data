For others, I would recommend that they do quit…[depending] on their personality, their risk tolerance, or their financial situation.” If you start searching for a new job, she recommends looking at your “power, passion, and purpose” to find a good fit: Your power is “your strengths and skills. Not just the skills you've learned, but also who you are and how you approach the world. What gifts do you have to offer? What are the traits and qualities that you offer just by being who you are?” Your passion is what “you love to do. What brings you joy or what makes you come alive and gives you energy?” Lastly, your purpose is “what’s meaningful or important to you. What impact do you want to have on the world?” According to Meredith Walters, “knowing what's essential to you in those three areas and where they overlap gives you really great clues about where to look for fulfilling work.”"
