Making sure these are all in balance protects the pool from corrosion or scale buildup that can occur over the winter while the pool is shut down. These adjustments should be made about five days before you completely close down the pool. Adjust the pH to a level between 7.2 and 7.6. Adjust the alkalinity to 80 to 120 ppm (parts per million). Adjust the calcium hardness to 180 to 220 ppm or higher according to product instructions for protecting a plaster pool to lessen minerals dissolving and leeching out."

Buy a shock product with at least 65 percent sodium hypochlorite or a non-chlorine substitute of equivalent strength. Fill a five-gallon bucket with pool water, add the instructed amount of shock granules for the size of pool, and pour it into the pool away from the pool skimmer water outlets while the filtration system is running. [3] X Research source If you typically use a shock product/mix that is safe for people to swim in right away, it's probably not strong enough to kill all the bacteria in your pool. Since you're closing the pool down, use the instructed stronger shock treatment."

      "content": "Add a winterizing algaecide. Algaecide kills existing algae and prevents more from blooming. Algae can cause the pool to become discolored, give it a bad smell and clog the filter; so, it's important to treat your pool with algaecide before shutting it down. Make sure the chlorine level has returned to 1 to 3 ppm before adding algaecide. Otherwise, the chlorine will render the algaecide ineffective. Buy an extra-strength algaecide. Use one meant to be used to overwinter a pool, rather than one you add to your pool on an ongoing basis while it's in use. The stronger algaecide is meant to prevent algae from blooming all winter long."

This is while the pool is working. Later empty the filter, if it is a diatomaceous earth (DE) filter dry and store the filter elements, or perhaps it is a sand filter. Either will be recharged with water in the Spring (more below in the \"lower water and drain equipment\")."

Or, it works to setup a vacuum hose as if vacuuming using the skimmer suction so that the pump draws water from below the skimmer level. The water should be lowered below the skimmer and below the water returns according to the type of pool cover you're using. If you're using a mesh cover, lower the water 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) below the skimmer. If you're using a solid, floating cover, lower the water to 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) below the skimmer."

If it is a DE filter the filter elements can be removed and replaced one by one. The excess DE settled in the bottom may need to be removed by hand -- or there may be a drain plug on the filter, near the bottom. Or, if it is a sand filter , the sand may need to be cleaned manually and may need to be replaced if it is not cleanable. If the filters cannot be removed, blow carefully with a shop vacuum to help remove the remaining water out of them. An air compressor might build up excessive pressure in the system or damage the system otherwise."

Use a shop vacuum to blow air into the skimmer outlet pipe , through the equipment and back into the pool. If you have more than one skimmer this should be done one by one. Use expansion plugs to plug the lines at the returns and in the skimmer; so water doesn't enter them. Or, if you don't blow out the lines, you can add swimming pool antifreeze (not automotive) to them to prevent remaining water from freezing. Put 1/2 gallon of antifreeze above the plug in the skimmer(s). Put a styrofoam chunk or a plastic bottle in the skimmer as a doughnut to prevent damage to the skimmer from any possible freezing, if rain water or snow-melt drains into it. Follow the manufacturer's instructions."

      "content": "Cover the pool. The floating tarp cover is not child/pet proof. [6] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source It's essential to use a cover that fits well and doesn't leave any gaps or cracks for debris to enter the pool over the winter. An anchored, strapped down, reinforced, mesh safety cover would tightly fit the pool to protect it. It helps prevent a child or pet from wandering into the pool. Waterproof, \"solid floating covers\" (like large, flexible-vinyl tarps) lie loosely on the surface of the lowered pool water and run up the walls. Some people add a little water on top of the cover to keep the surface weighted down. Watch to see whether you need to clean debris off the cover. It may be necessary to pump rainwater, snow-melt off the cover. You could use an automatic cover pump on the cover for as long as water getting on the tarp fall through spring. Scatter 1/2 full water bags around the edges of the pool, out of your way. Center the cover over the pool. Press the cover edges down so it lies on the water, and the remainder lies on the deck. Fold any excess cover under and weight all edges with the water bags so there is no part of the tarp to blow around the entire edge of the pool. Water bags can be emptied for storage in the spring, while sand bags are not convenient. If you have trees that would continue to shed leaves surrounding your pool, you can place a leaf net over it to catch debris to prevent a soggy mess on top off the cover. Some trees shed all leaves in 3 weeks are not a continual problem."
