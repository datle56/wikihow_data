      "content": "Stop whatever you're doing when you feel your knee get injured. It's common to think you should play through the pain, meaning you should keep going even if you're hurting. However, knee injuries are serious, and you can make things worse if you don't stop what you're doing. [1] X Research source In the first 3 days after your injury, use the RICE method even before you see your doctor."

      "title": "Stay off your knee.",
      "content": "Stay off your knee. \"Resting\" is the first part of the RICE method. It means you should stay off your knee as much as possible in the first few days, particularly if you haven't seen the doctor yet and you don't know what's wrong. Resting your knee keeps you from making the injury worse and helps start the healing process. Take a few days off from work if you can. [2] X Research source Ask for help around the house."

      "title": "Use ice to reduce pain and swelling.",
      "content": "Use ice to reduce pain and swelling. \"Ice\" is the \"I\" in RICE. Apply ice to your knee for 15-30 minutes at a time and do so as often as possible for the first 48 hours after the injury. Take breaks of at least 10 minutes between each application. After the first 48 hours, you can switch to applying ice every 2 hours. The ice will make your joint feel better by numbing the pain and help with inflammation. Always use a towel between the ice and your skin, as ice against your skin can damage it. [3] X Research source Avoid applying heat, as that could make the swelling worse."

      "title": "Put on an elastic bandage or a brace to compress it.",
      "content": "Put on an elastic bandage or a brace to compress it. The \"C\" stands for \"compress.\" Compressing the joint gives it support and allows it time to heal. You can use an elastic knee brace, or you can wrap an ace bandage around your knee and leg. You should wear this bandage as long as your knee feels injured or at least until you see the doctor if you decide to go. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source To wrap your leg, extend it in front of you. Start with one end of an ace bandage, and wrap it all the way around your lower thigh so it goes back over itself. Then, move down your leg, overlapping the bandage as you wrap it around and around your leg. Leave a little extra space when you go around your knee cap. When you reach the end, tuck it in or let it stick to itself if it's the self-adhesive kind. Don't wrap it so tight that it cuts off circulation. [5] X Research source"

In bed, you may want to put a pillow behind your knee to prop it up. If you're at work, try propping your leg up on another desk chair. [6] X Research source When you elevate your leg, the fluid around your knee has to work against gravity, so some of it will drain away."

Another type of surgery is a partial-knee replacement, where the doctor just removes and replaces the damaged parts with metal or plastic.
