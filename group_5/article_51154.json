If you're aware that one of your dogs has any sort of medical problem that can be passed on to its offspring, you shouldn't breed it. Breeding a dog with medical problems will make sure those medical problems continue to cause problems for Labradors and their owners in the future. Some common Labrador health problems include: [1] X Research source Joint problems like hip or elbow dysplasia Progressive retinal atrophy (a disorder that causes blindness). Cancer Even if you're not aware of your dog having any medical problems, it's still a good idea to have it screened."

This is because it could have serious medical issues that can be passed on to its offspring. To verify your dog is good breeding stock and doesn't have major hereditary problems, have it genetically screened.

Let them know that you'd like them to check for any potential medical problems that could endanger the pregnancy or cause complications, and that you need your labradors to be up-to-date on their vaccinations. Ask them to run a blood test to check your dogs' blood sugar levels, blood cell counts, and more. This way, they'll be able to rule out problematic disorders like diabetes and Cushings.

[4] X Research source If you don't have registration papers but believe your Labrador is a purebred, you can run a DNA test on your dog to confirm it. Dog DNA tests usually cost between $50 and $100.
