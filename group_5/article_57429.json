      "content": "A Pisces man might be a little shy. He'll need some confirmation that you like him before he can miss you. If you're still getting to know him, try asking him out on a fun date or telling him you enjoy his company. A subtle nudge like this is really all that you need to get him to realize your feelings for him. A Pisces is intuitive and highly sentimental. He's sure to miss you like crazy as soon as he knows that you like him. [1] X Research source You might text him , \"I had such a good time talking in class today. Would you want to go to the art walk together this weekend?\" To tell him you like him , try, \"You're such a fun person to be around. I really like talking to you üòä \" If you don't text him after awhile, he might assume that you're not interested.

      "title": "This will leave him wanting more.",
      "content": "This will leave him wanting more. A Pisces man is pretty mysterious himself, so he'll be super intrigued if he sees you as his perfect match. To do that, only reveal a little bit about yourself each time you interact. You can also try being the one to end a conversation sometimes, even if it's going great. Both methods will leave him with tons of questions about you, and he'll be stuck thinking about all the things he wants to learn about you when you talk again. [3] X Research source If you've traveled the world for work, for example, avoid listing everywhere you've been. Instead, say something like, \"I've gotten to travel a lot for my job. It's led to some great experiences.\" He'll want to know all about it and will likely ask questions. Maybe you've been texting all day and have been really hitting it off. Right when things are heating up, text him something like, \"Well I've got plans with a friend tonight, so I'm going to have to go. Talk to you soon üòâ \" He'll wonder what those plans were and will be stuck thinking of you all night."

Send him reminders that he's on your mind, text cute selfies to help him remember how cute you are, and don't be afraid to flirt a little. A Pisces is won over pretty easily by sweet gestures like this, and he'll long to see you in person as soon as possible. [4] X Research source Text him something like, \"Thinking of your smile. How is your day so far?\" Throw on an outfit that makes you feel incredible and take some selfies. Send one his way with the caption, \"Thought you might like my new shirt. How's your day?\""

      "content": "A Pisces man sometimes struggles to maintain high self-esteem. With such an intelligent, insular mind, he may fall into doubting himself. Be the person that builds him up and he'll want you by his side 100% of the time. Compliment his strengths, talents, and unique attributes (this is another fun opportunity to be a little flirty, too). [5] X Research source You might text him, \"Hope you've been having a good day at work. You're the most talented chef I know (and the cutest).\" If he's ever feeling down, compliment his strengths to boost him back up again. You might say, \"I know your classes are tough this semester, but you've gotta know how smart you are. If anyone can ace Philosophy 101, you can!\" Reader Poll: We asked 819 wikiHow readers who are Pisces, and 53% of them said that the compliment they‚Äôd most like to receive would be something sweet about their personality, like: ‚ÄúYou have a great heart.‚Äù [Take Poll]"

Think back to moments like your first kiss, the first time you hung out together, or even that fateful day you locked eyes in class. Then, send him a random text or call him to talk about your favorite memories. A Pisces loves to reminisce and be lost in dreams, so this will be right up his alley. He'll miss those times and will want to make new memories with you ASAP. [6] X Research source You might text him, \"Been thinking of our first date. Remember how bad we both were at mini-golf? We probably won't be allowed back at that place.\" Call him on your lunch break and say something like, \"I can't get the first time we met off my mind. We've got to see each other soon.\" You can even text him a picture of the two of you from earlier in your relationship. This is sure to make him swoon and want to be with you again in no time."

I would totally have a similar reaction.\" Avoid getting distracted by your phone or other people when he talks to you. This could hurt his feelings and make him feel like you're not interested.

      "content": "Pisces men engage with the world with an eye toward magic and fantasy. Try adopting a similar lifestyle by getting creative and refusing to let your life become predictable. Plan solo adventures out of the city or explore new places where you live. Your Pisces man will take notice and will want to spend more time with a like-minded soul. [14] X Research source Plan fun solo trips or get out of town with your friends. If you can't travel, explore your city. Even taking a new route to work or school can open the door to new experiences. Change up your plans when they start to feel a little monotonous. For example, if you've got plans to go to the art museum but aren't in the mood to be indoors, make new plans. Go to a carnival or try out a new hiking trail instead."

      "content": "A Pisces wants to know the real you. Be honest about your thoughts and opinions, embrace your unique quirks, and avoid pretending to be someone else to get his attention. A Pisces is drawn to someone that is comfortable with themselves, as it helps them feel more at ease with themselves, too. He'll think highly of your earnest nature and will want you even more because of it. [15] X Research source Speak your thoughts freely. A Pisces is super intuitive (some describe them as nearly psychic), so you won't get very far hiding them anyway. Be honest about your life experiences. Instead of hiding the fact that you were an award winning debater growing up, tell him funny stories about all the fun trips you took with the debate team."
