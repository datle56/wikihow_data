      "title": "A lightworker is any person who helps others and the planet.",
      "content": "A lightworker is any person who helps others and the planet. If an individual believes in service and supporting those in need, it's a clear sign that they're bringing \"light\" to this world and filling it up with positive energy. Many spiritual communities believe that \"light\" consists of \"high vibrations\" like love, gratitude, and joy. These unique and special forms of energy help \"lift\" the vibrations of the planet so it's not bogged down with \"low vibrations\" like selfishness, fear, and anger. [1] X Research source Lightworkers are said to be very important because they elevate whatever environment they're in. When people come in contact with them, they tend to feel happier and more hopeful."

    {
      "title": "You support others even when you're struggling.",
      "content": "You support others even when you're struggling. A bad day isn't enough to make you give up and focus only on yourself. Instead, you seem to have an almost limitless reservoir of emotional bandwidth for your fellow humans. When you see that they're in need, you leap into action and try to cheer them up or lift a burden off their shoulders."
    },
    {
      "title": "You pick up on people's thoughts and emotions.",
      "content": "You pick up on people's thoughts and emotions. You're scarily accurate when it comes to guessing how people feel, even if they haven't verbalized what's going on with them. You're an expert at reading body language and can even intuit what's happening in people's inner worlds, even when they try to hide their problems. Many people experience a sense of relief with you because you can read them like a book, so they don't have to come up with all the words to express themselves."
    },
    {
      "title": "You feel very in touch with your intuition.",
      "content": "You feel very in touch with your intuition. You have a \"sixth sense\" that you rely on in order to navigate situations. You can make split-second decisions based on the way the Universe is guiding you. For example, you can tell if someone is dying to speak up, so you encourage them to express themselves. You can also tell when there's injustice or abuse occurring, so you often know when to intervene in a situation and advocate for those who've been marginalized."
    },
    {
      "title": "You counsel others and give them advice.",
      "content": "You counsel others and give them advice. Oftentimes, people make a beeline to you because they want answers to their burning questions. You don't have to provide unsolicited opinions because others are so keen to learn more about your perspective on a matter. Your presence provides people a lot of relief because they feel you'll steer them true."
    },
    {
      "title": "You avoid violent news or media.",
      "content": "You avoid violent news or media. You only want \"good vibes,\" like love, positivity, and hope, so you prefer entertainment that's wholesome, like cute news stories about animals or romantic comedies that help others believe in healthy relationships. You may have a pretty extreme aversion to graphic content that stirs up fear or disgust—you may struggle to see the point to it because it doesn't lift people up."
    },
    {
      "title": "You desire a spiritual lifestyle.",
      "content": "You desire a spiritual lifestyle. You're either religious or want a relationship with the Universe. It's incredibly important for you to center and ground yourself so you have the energy to help out other people. You might pray or meditate in order to channel information from another dimension and you're often on the lookout for higher truths."
    },
    {
      "title": "You champion causes related to animals and eco-friendliness.",
      "content": "You champion causes related to animals and eco-friendliness. You believe that all life forms are worthy of respect and care. You may rally against global warming and warn people about the negative consequences of mistreating the planet. Ultimately, you just want society to be more sensitive and protective of Earth since it provides so much sustenance and beauty to humanity."

      "content": "Healers help people through difficult or challenging stages. They're most likely people you'd encounter in health care, including nurses, hospice workers, doctors, psychologists, and counselors. They are incredibly empathetic, driven by communication, and devoted to taking away the pain that their fellow humans struggle with. They're willing to spend a great deal of time perfecting their skillset—such as attending medical school for years—so they can better serve their community. [2] X Research source Healers who spend a lot of time assisting and advising a person are sometimes considered \"spiritual guides.\" Spiritual guides are usually put on someone's path to make sure they don't surrender to dark thoughts. They can be a mentor, like a professor; a caregiver, like a live-in nurse; or even a really bubbly and optimistic aunt."

      "title": "Psychics predict what might happen in the future to prepare others.",
      "content": "Psychics predict what might happen in the future to prepare others. They're usually one of those people who appear to have that \"sixth sense\" and who seem incredibly intuitive—they might say \"I told you so!\" or \"Well, that's not a surprise to me...\" more than a couple of times. Psychics who are lightworkers try their best to arm people with knowledge so they can be happy and successful: for example, they might advise querents about their love life or suggest which negative influences to steer clear of. [3] X Research source Psychics are believed to have one (or more) of four supernatural gifts: Clairvoyance: seeing the future. Clairaudience: hearing messages. Clairsentience: feeling others' emotions. Claircognizance: knowing what someone is thinking. Incredibly advanced psychics are called \"seers\" because they can see vivid and specific events before they happen."

      "title": "Gridworkers clear negative energy so people can thrive.",
      "content": "Gridworkers clear negative energy so people can thrive. In many spiritual communities, the Earth is thought to have \"grids,\" or invisible energy fields, which impact people's emotions and thought patterns. If certain places have grids infected with darkness and negativity, they can cause others to feel on edge or lash out. If gridworkers live or travel to these areas, they can transform the grids so they radiate love and positive energy. After they're finished with their task, the community they served will likely feel immediately uplifted. [4] X Research source Sometimes, gridworkers don't have to do anything major to change the energy of places. When they walk into a room, they might just immediately brighten everyone's mood. That being said, gridworkers are considered advanced lightworkers because their auras and personalities change others. They're often motivational speakers or \"gurus\" who are able to enchant an audience. Once gridworkers visit a place, they leave it better than they found it. People usually want to be their best selves after they cross paths with a gridworker."

      "content": "Gatekeepers insist on peace and won't tolerate injustice. Typically, gatekeepers pursue careers in politics or the legal system. They might be government employees, diplomats, mediators, or lawyers because they want to champion equal rights and fairness. They usually look down upon any kind of cruelty and live for improving the quality of life for everyone possible. They're often very impassioned and welcome public speaking so they can discuss how the world needs to be changed. [5] X Research source Certain lightworkers are called \"gatekeepers\" because they insist on healthy environments. For example, a gatekeeper might be the person who implores a judge to shut down a business until it proves that it treats its factory workers humanely and ethically."

      "title": "Manifestors attract positive experiences, like wealth or love.",
      "content": "Manifestors attract positive experiences, like wealth or love. Manifestors are those people that seem lucky no matter what—they're the type of folks who make six figures with their small businesses even during a recession. Fortunately, they love to share their blessings and knowledge; they're particularly fond of teaching others about how they can use the power of attraction to change their circumstances. Ultimately, they strive to prove to society that anything is possible. [6] X Research source Manifestors are also called \"blueprint keepers\" because they always seem to have the \"keys\" or \"cheat codes\" to success. They thrive on handing over these secrets to others so they can enjoy happiness and fulfilment."

      "title": "Messengers are magnetic public speakers who uplift others.",
      "content": "Messengers are magnetic public speakers who uplift others. They have the \"gift of gab\" and love to talk at length about their specific area of expertise. Messengers may be teachers, writers, motivational speakers, life coaches, or even bloggers. These special individuals let their light shine bright by sharing their enthusiasm, as well as a clear vision for how everyone can co-exist and serve one another. Most of the time, messengers are very straightforward about what they'd like to share. From the philosophy professor who wants to speak about formal logic to the motivational speaker who praises courage, messengers are honest and sincere. [7] X Research source In other cases, messengers might be more humble and laidback. They might be the stay-at-home blogger with an infectious love of baking who inspires others to whip up comfort food for fun."

      "content": "Transmuters transform negative forces into positive energy. These lightworkers do their best to cancel out egoism, bullying, and other forms of dark energy that weigh heavily on people's souls. Transmuters may be reiki healers, hypnotherapists, counselors, or psychiatrists. They calmly walk people through the process of forgiveness and self-compassion so they can free themselves from generational trauma. [8] X Research source Even if transmuters may work one-on-one with a person to convert their negative energy into positive to energy, these lightworkers help lift the collective consciousness. Transmuters are also believed to help people cancel out their negative karma by performing good deeds and acts of service."

      "title": "Dreamers imagine how to reach new limits and push for progress.",
      "content": "Dreamers imagine how to reach new limits and push for progress. Some people might say dreamers \"have their heads in the clouds,\" but that doesn't bother them—they love to challenge the status quo and envision what's possible. Dreamers are typically inventors and travelers. They go on adventures to learn what humanity needs, then they work on enriching projects, like purifying water for people in third world countries. These lightworkers won't stop until they've found a way to improve people's quality of lives. [9] X Research source A great example of a dreamer is Nikola Tesla, who wanted his findings to be shared with all of society so everyone could have access to electricity. Dreamers might also work on a more local level. For example, if they're bothered by the concept of world hunger, they might start chipping away at it by working at a soup kitchen or hosting a fundraiser. Missionaries are also often dreamers: they see a world that can be free of suffering, so they go to other countries to provide aid like medicine and education."

      "content": "Ascension guides raise the vibrations of humankind. According to those that believe in the quantum realm and other dimensions, ascension guides help others \"ascend\" so they can lift their spirits and tap into the fifth dimension. In the fifth dimension, anything is said to be possible. If people can access it, they can manifest their goals much more quickly. Ultimately, ascension guides encourage others to become more spiritual and open their \"third eye\" so they can see how to help the planet. [10] X Research source Ascension guides may even help others become lightworkers themselves. Other people are said to undergo massive shifts that may transform them forever, leaving them more loving and optimistic. Ascension guides help communities retire old patterns that didn't serve them in favor of new ones. For example, a society that once overlooked the elderly may end up supporting them because they've learned every generation matters."
