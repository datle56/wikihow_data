      "content": "Picturing your style helps you realize what you don’t need in your closet. Before you start deciding what clothes to get rid of, develop the sense of style you want to have. Think about the styles that you like to wear that make you look and feel really good. Once you have an idea of the looks you want, start going into your closet and take out anything that doesn’t fit that style. [1] X Research source It can also help to visualize how clean your closet will be once you let go of some of the clothes cluttering up your space."

      "content": "Have you worn the item at all in the past 6–12 months? Go through each of your pieces individually and think about the last time you wore them out. If it's been more than 6–12 months, you’re probably not getting a lot of use from them and it would be better to let them go. [2] X Research source Try hanging all your clothes so the hooks face out. When you take clothes down to wear, turn the hanger so the hook faces in. After a few months, check for hangers that are still facing out to see what you don’t wear."

      "content": "It's easier to get rid of an item if there's no good reason to keep it. You might have some really cute clothes that you haven’t put on in a while, so think about what’s holding you back from wearing them. There may be a legitimate reason, like if the garments are out of season or are for special occasions, but if there isn’t, then it’s probably time to let go of those clothes. Determine if the garments you want to keep fit into your lifestyle anymore. For example, if you rarely attend events where you need to dress up, it’s okay to get rid of some of the formal clothes that you aren’t wearing."

      "content": "Any clothes that are too big or small may sit in your closet unworn. It might take a little bit of time, but try on every single piece of clothing you want to keep. Check yourself out in a mirror to make sure the clothes match your current style and fit your body well. If you’re not feeling fabulous, then it’s a good rule to get rid of those clothes and focus on the fits that make you feel good. Have a friend over as you go through your closet and have them give their opinion. It may be easier to have some help making the decision."

      "content": "It’s a good time to let go if the styles have gone out of fashion. If you’re holding onto a lot of trendy items from the past, they may be taking up some valuable closet space you can use for more versatile clothes. Rather than keeping the items that you only wore a few times when they were in style, move on so you can update your wardrobe. Keep staple clothes that are versatile, like plain T-shirts, jeans, sweaters, trousers, button-down shirts, blazers, and little black dresses in your closet."

It’s okay to keep a few options for things you wear regularly, like plain t-shirts or tank tops, but try to cut back on the number of items you have in styles you put on less frequently. If you notice you have a few options in the same style that are nearly identical, pick the one that’s your favorite to keep in your closet and let go of the rest. [3] X Research source"

Tuck the box in the back of your closet or under your bed so you don’t see it. If you don’t think about the garments after a month or two, you’re safe to get rid of them. [4] X Research source If you kept thinking about the clothes in your “maybe” box, then that means they’re important to you and you should hold onto them for now."

If your favorite piece of clothing has a hole or tear, you may keep it for sentimental reasons and keep it in your closet.
