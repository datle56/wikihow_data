      "content": "The numbers 7 and 1 represent independence and wisdom. In numerology, the number 1 represents the ego, the stand-alone, the trailblazer of new experiences. The number 7 represents teaching and learning, but it’s also a rebel number that prefers to find wisdom through its own trial and error. In 7117, both numbers are doubled, enhancing their significance. The 1s touch, making their power more volatile, which could mean that your independent nature will take you on new adventures. The number is sandwiched by 7s on either side, suggesting that your volatile adventure will be anchored by wisdom and learning from your experience."
