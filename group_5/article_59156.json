      "content": "Bleach white fabrics before washing them. Bleach is a powerful, corrosive detergent that can strip the color from fabric. Add a few spoonfuls of bleach to a bucket of hot water and soak your stained white garment in it for about 15 minutes. Then, toss the garment in the wash on a regular cycle. [10] X Research source Bleaching the entire garment in a bleach bath helps prevent uneven color changes. Avoid using this method on colored clothing or fabrics, as the bleach can discolor the material. If you’ve stained white silk or wool, use hydrogen peroxide in the bath instead, as bleach can be too harsh on such delicate fabrics. [11] X Research source"

Let the stain remover or detergent soak for 15 minutes, then machine wash your garment on a regular cycle. Alternatively, use more turmeric or a fabric dye to dye your clothes completely. If the stain isn’t budging on a white piece of clothing, it may be worth simply changing the color of your garment so that you can wear it again! Mix together a paste of turmeric and water and soak your clothing in it, then run the garment through a cold wash cycle. It should turn the whole fabric a nice shade of yellow!"

      "content": "Scrub out a turmeric stain with a mixture of baking soda and water. If you get turmeric or curry sauce on your cabinets, countertops, or table, there’s an easy solution. Baking soda is a natural deodorizer that’s mildly abrasive and alkaline, making it a useful stain solution for light-colored, stained, and painted hard surfaces. [13] X Research source Simply follow the instructions below: [14] X Research source Mix equal parts water and baking soda to create a thick paste. Consider adding a few drops of mild dish soap for extra cleaning power. Rub the paste onto the stain with a sponge or dish rag and let it sit for around 15 minutes.

      "content": "Use a sponge, brush, or rag to help remove stains on hard surfaces. You don’t have to be as gentle when treating surfaces like kitchen countertops, stove tops, and floors. Pair a home remedy or cleaning solution with a mild abrasive, such as a sponge, abrasive pad, brush, or rag, to help wipe and rub away the stain. Avoid using harsh abrasives (steel wool or metal scrapers), as these could leave permanent scratches on a surface. For extra cleaning power, soak the stain in a mixture of hot water and soap for five minutes before using your abrasive."

If you eat turmeric frequently, it’s possible that it would begin to stain your teeth. [18] X Research source However, teeth staining only happens if your tooth enamel is weakened. If your tooth enamel is strong, turmeric is less likely to cause any visible staining. Eating a large amount of acidic foods and drinks may weaken your tooth enamel and allow in staining from turmeric. Brush your teeth after eating turmeric to prevent stains on your teeth.
