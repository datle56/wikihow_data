Due dates are not hard and fast. Ramp Up tells you how early you could start the task and Extension tells you how many days it could slide. Getting a haircut might have a Ramp Up of 5 and an Extension of 4 - it doesn’t make sense to get a haircut 2 weeks early and people might notice if it was more than 5 days late. G - Ramp Up Days prior to Due date you could start task. H - Extension Automatic extension of Due date I - Days Left Formula. Number of days before Due date; negative if Due date has passed. J - Finished Date task was actually completed. K - Comment Any details for the task."
