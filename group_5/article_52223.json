You will have to feel around for the lower bolt, which will be just out of plain sight. Pull out the gray plug from the right side of the Honda IACV. Remove the blue plug from the throttle body. Locate the coolant hose that attaches the IACV to the TB. Use needle-nose pliers to pull back the clamp that holds the coolant hose in place and then pull the hose out. This will provide enough slack to pull the Honda idle air control valve to the front so you can completely remove it. Detach the last 2 hoses from the IACV in order to free it for cleaning."
