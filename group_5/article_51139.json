      "content": "Historically, the Roman Empire may have started the superstition. Mirrors were first made around the third century during the Roman Empire; however, this isn’t where the thought that breaking mirrors lead to bad luck originated. It was the ancient Greeks who believed reflections (primarily in pools of water) revealed a person’s soul. [1] X Research source This idea evolved into the Roman Empire, where Romans believed damaging a mirror was disrespectful to the gods. [2] X Research source So, where do the 7 years of bad luck tie in? Well, the Romans believed it took 7 years for a body to renew itself; therefore, it must take 7 years for a curse to wear off.
