      "content": "Choose shampoo and conditioner wisely. They're not all created alike. [1] X Research source Choose products that work well with your hair type so your hair will look the best it can be. If possible, go for sulfate-free shampoo and silicone-free conditioner; these ingredients are hard on hair and cause it to look dry and dull over time. Check the label. Here's a short guide to what products work well with what hair types: For dry hair that's prone to getting frizzy, look for moisturizing or hydrating products that contain oils, butter, and other nourishing ingredients. For oily or fine hair, look for clarifying products that contain ingredients like tea tree oil and chamomile. For hair that breaks and frays easily, look for restorative products that contain proteins like collagen and keratin."

      "title": "Wash your hair two or three times a week.",
      "content": "Wash your hair two or three times a week. You might think it's healthy to wash your hair daily, but that's actually too often for most people. Washing your hair too often strips your hair of protective oils naturally produced by your scalp, leaving it more prone to getting frizzy and frayed. [2] X Research source For most men, two to three shampoos a week work best. If your hair gets greasy fast, consider doing a water-only wash on the days when you don't shampoo. Water will cleanse your hair without stripping away the oils. When you first start washing less, your hair will keep overproducing oil for a week or so until things balance out. Just be patient, and soon your hair will stay clean longer."

      "title": "Use warm or cool water instead of hot.",
      "content": "Use warm or cool water instead of hot. Hot showers are great, but the heat of the water dries out hair. It's better to use warm or cool water to wash your hair. If you have to have a steaming hot shower, try finishing with a warm or cool rinse so your hair will look healthy and shiny rather than frizzy and dull when it dries."

      "title": "Spot dry your hair instead of toweling it roughly.",
      "content": "Spot dry your hair instead of toweling it roughly. Hair is weak when it's wet, since water causes the keratin molecules in hair to stretch. That's why doing a rough towel dry treatment can break your hair. Instead, use a towel to dab your hair dry and get rid of the excess water, then let it finish air drying. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a gel or pomade, but not too much.",
      "content": "Use a gel or pomade, but not too much. If you like a neat, orderly style, using a gel or pomade while your hair is still wet can help your hair look freshly groomed throughout the day. Use only a dime-sized amount of product if you have a short haircut, since using too much will make your hair look greasy. [4] X Research source Gel is generally lighter and easier to work through your hair. Look for one that's alcohol-free, since alcohol dries out hair. Pomades and creams are great for curly hair since they're thicker. They're also more difficult to wash out, so use sparingly."

      "title": "Comb your hair after applying product.",
      "content": "Comb your hair after applying product. If you use a product, use a comb to distribute it throughout your hair. Then create a neat part on one side or the other and style your hair however you like. It's generally best to comb your hair in the direction it grows: comb the hair in the back and sides down, and comb the hair on top forward. If your hair is long in the front, finish by sweeping it in the opposite direction of your part. If your hair is curly or kinky , use a wide-tooth comb to get rid of any tangles - or forego combing altogether. Using a fine-tooth comb will cause your hair to frizz. You don't always have to comb your hair forward. Experiment with different looks; try tousling the top instead of parting it, or combing the top straight up to spike it."

      "title": "Blow dry your hair sparingly.",
      "content": "Blow dry your hair sparingly. Using a blow dryer is a good way to dry your hair as quickly as possible, but doing it every day will eventually start causing hair damage. If you're concerned about thinning hair, ditch the dryer and let your hair air dry instead. When you do blow your hair dry, point the dryer in the direction of hair growth to help your hair lie flat. Or if you want more volume, point it against the direction of hair growth as you dry it."

      "title": "Maintain longer styles.",
      "content": "Maintain longer styles . If your hair is longer than an inch or two, you'll need to take a few extra steps to make sure it stays in good condition and looks great. Deep condition if your hair gets frizzy. Buy a deep conditioning product and use it once a week to keep your hair in good shape. Use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush. Brushes break long hair; remove the tangles with a wide-tooth comb instead. Consider a hair oil. Using a small amount of oil in your hair while it's wet will act as a leave-in conditioner. A little goes a long way."

      "content": "Take regular trips to the barbershop. A great routine won't make a difference if you're working with unkempt hair to begin with. Some men get it trimmed once a month, while once every three months is sufficient for others. Find your routine and keep up with it."

      "content": "Massage your scalp in the shower. Massage increases blood circulation, which stimulates hair growth. It can help you keep the hair you have and grow new hair as well. Use your fingers to rub your scalp in a circular motion, focusing on the areas where your hair is thinning. Some oils are believed to help further stimulate growth. Try massaging with coconut oil, tea tree oil, or almond oil before you shampoo, then wash out the oil."

Eat meat, eggs, nuts, beans, and other sources of protein to keep your hair healthy. B vitamins. These are found in meat, eggs, and leafy green vegetables. If you're a vegetarian, you may want to start taking a B vitamin supplement. Omega 3 fatty acids. Salmon, sardines, avocados, and walnuts have loads of this important nutrient."
