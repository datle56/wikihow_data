      "content": "Remove excess soy sauce from the fabric with a paper towel. Act quickly to remove as much soy sauce as possible. Use a clean, white paper towel to blot the stain. Repeat until the stain no longer appears on the paper towel. [1] X Research source Do not rub the stain. You could push the soy sauce farther into the fabric or cause it to spread. You can also sprinkle cornstarch on the stain before treating it. Cornstarch absorbs liquid, but make sure to dust off any excess powder before blotting."

      "content": "Rub liquid laundry detergent into the stain. Pour enough detergent to cover the stain, then gently rub the spot with your fingers for 2-3 minutes. Any liquid laundry detergent works fine, but try Puracy Natural Laundry Stain Remover for extra stubborn stains. Before attempting to treat the stain at home, thoroughly read the care label of your garment: don't attempt to treat “dry-clean only” garments at home. If you’re out of laundry detergent, use a baking soda mixture instead: mix 4 tablespoons (59 mL) baking soda and 1 US quart (0.95 L) warm water. Alternatively, make a vinegar cleaning solution or make soap-based liquid detergent with borax ."

      "content": "Let the detergent sit for 10 minutes and then rinse. This allows the detergent to fully saturate the stain and work its magic. Set the garment on a flat surface where it won’t be disturbed, then rinse the spot thoroughly with cold, clean water. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "If the stain remains, soak the garment in warm water for 30 minutes. Fill a medium-sized bowl with warm water. Apply liquid laundry detergent on the stain and rub it into the fabric for 2-3 minutes. Submerge the entire garment in water for half an hour. [4] X Research source You can also soak the garment in the sink, but don’t forget to set the stopper before you put your clothes in–your clothes could catch on the stopper and rip. Alternatively, throw the garment into the washer and use the pre-soak (or pre-wash) setting: use normal laundry detergent, but be sure to select the option for warm water."

      "title": "Launder the garment normally.",
      "content": "Launder the garment normally. It’s best to use the hottest water setting when removing stains, but read the care label to see if there are any special washing directions. After washing the garment, check if the stain has been removed before throwing it in the dryer: if the stain is still there, the heat from the dryer can set it permanently. [5] X Research source If the stain remains, repeat the previous steps and launder again, or take the garment to a professional dry cleaner. If the stain is gone, machine-dry the garment as usual. Do not attempt to wash delicate fabrics, like silk or chiffon, at home."

With a cotton swab, dab a bleach-water solution on a small patch inside the garment. If there’s no color change, the fabric is bleach-safe. [8] X Research source To make a bleach-water solution, combine 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) bleach with .25 cups (59 mL) water. [9] X Research source Make sure to thoroughly read the care label of your garment before attempting to treat the stain at home. “Dry-clean only” garments should be taken to a professional dry cleaning service as soon as possible."

Work the bleach directly into the stain, and let it sit for 10-20 minutes. [10] X Research source If you prefer natural bleaching agents, use lemon juice or distilled white vinegar instead. Alternatively, pre-soak the stain with hydrogen peroxide. Run a colorfast test with hydrogen peroxide, then soak the garment in the solution for 1-2 hours. Rinse and launder normally."
