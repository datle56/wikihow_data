      "content": "Pick out your sidewalk chalk colors. Any color will work well, it's really up to you which colors interest you the most. Perhaps consider your usual color range in clothing to get an idea of what you'll feel most comfortable with as a hair color. If wished, you can use more than one color."

      "content": "Prepare the powder. You'll need to break down the sidewalk chalk to make a powder for using as the hair colorant. To do this, take a fork or small toothed comb. Scrap off some of the powder from the piece of chalk color you're using. If you're using more than one piece of chalk, scrape each one."

      "content": "If coloring all of your hair (your whole head), use this method. Lift up one layer of hair to get to the layer underneath. Once the layer underneath has been colored, do the top layer. By doing two layers, it will look more even. If you choose, you can just do the under layer to get a cool look. You don't have to flat iron your hair if you're doing layers."
