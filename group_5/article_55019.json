      "content": "Visit your doctor to confirm that you have a yeast infection. Going to the doctor might seem annoying, but don't try to treat a yeast infection by yourself. Even if you’ve had a yeast infection before and know what it feels like, other infections could have similar symptoms. This is why you need your doctor to confirm it before starting treatment. Make an appointment for an exam, and then you can start treatment after a proper diagnosis.

[2] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Common OTC creams are Miconazole, Clotrimazole, Tioconazole, and Butoconazole.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Doctors usually recommend one-time medicines if you don’t get yeast infections often.
