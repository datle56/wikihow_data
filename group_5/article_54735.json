If you try to mine Amethyst Buds before they reach the final stage, you won't get any Amethyst Shards. Using a pickaxe will yield 4 shards while other methods will yield 2 shards. It's best to mark the Amethyst Geode on the map and return routinely to mine the Amethyst Buds when they're ready. You can also find Amethyst Shards in Ancient City chests (23.2% chance)."
