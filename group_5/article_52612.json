      "title": "Visit your dentist to have your dentures properly adjusted.",
      "content": "Visit your dentist to have your dentures properly adjusted. Tell your dentist where the dentures are causing discomfort. Make sure to wear your dentures the day before your adjustment visit. This will allow your dentist to clearly see red or raw areas of your gums. Do not try to adjust your dentures yourself. A professional dentist will make sure the adjustment will still allow your dentures to stay in place and the seal remains intact. Most dentists will schedule a follow-up appointment a few days to a week after your dentures are put in place. However, if you are having unmanageable pain before your appointment, call the dentistâ€™s office to make schedule an appointment as soon as possible."

      "title": "Rinse your mouth with salt water to relieve pain and swelling.",
      "content": "Rinse your mouth with salt water to relieve pain and swelling. Dissolve 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of salt in 1 c (0.063 US gal) of boiling water. Once the water has cooled to a warm or room temperature, swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds. Do not do this rinse daily, as the salt water can erode tooth enamel. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can use a salt water rinse every other day for a week at the most. If the pain persists, contact your dentist so they can recommend other pain relieving alternatives. This method reduces swelling in the gums and cleanses the irritated area/s."

      "title": "Take over the counter (OTC) pain relief medication to ease discomfort.",
      "content": "Take over the counter (OTC) pain relief medication to ease discomfort. Consult your doctor to determine which pain reliever, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin, would be right for you to manage pain caused by your dentures. Ibuprofen and aspirin are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and relieve pain and inflammation by blocking the effect of chemicals called cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. Acetaminophen is classified as an analgesic and relieves pain, but not inflammation. [2] X Research source Make sure to follow the label instructions and your doctor's recommendation for how often and dosage to take. All three types of pain relievers come in tablet, liquid, and capsule forms. Depending on other medications you may be taking, and other lifestyle choices and factors, one pain reliever may be more appropriate than others. OTC pain relievers should be taken on a temporary basis. [3] X Research source If pain persists, consult your dentist."

      "title": "Wear your dentures as much as possible to get used how they feel faster.",
      "content": "Wear your dentures as much as possible to get used how they feel faster. While you are expected to take out your dentures while you sleep, try to leave them in as much as you can during the day. [4] X Research source The more you wear the dentures, the faster your mouth will get used to them. In the beginning, you may need to take out your dentures several times per day to give your mouth and gums a break. However, after a few weeks, you should be able to leave them in throughout the day."

      "title": "Eat soft foods for the first 2 to 3 days.",
      "content": "Eat soft foods for the first 2 to 3 days. Eat soft foods like applesauce, mashed potatoes, yogurt, hot cereals, and pudding. [5] X Research source Your gums may be sore and these foods will be the easiest to chew and swallow. After the first few days, experiment with more solid foods such as rice, bread, fish, and beans."

      "title": "Avoid hard and/or sticky foods.",
      "content": "Avoid hard and/or sticky foods. Try not to eat sticky, hard, and tough foods very often (once or twice a week) while you are wearing your dentures as they can move your them out of place and allow food to get underneath, which can irritate your gums. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Foods like toffee, steak, and nuts can also damage or dislodge dentures as they force your jaw to apply uneven pressure. Over time, this will make the dentures wear unevenly which could cause jaw pain."

      "title": "Eat hot liquids and foods carefully.",
      "content": "Eat hot liquids and foods carefully. Eat these foods and drinks slowly, paying attention to how they feel before taking large bites or sips. It will take 3 to 4 days for you to adjust to the new heat sensitivity. [7] X Research source You will be less sensitive to heat because dentures insulate your mouth. Examples of foods to be careful with are coffee, tea, soup, stew, chili, potatoes, beans, and cooked vegetables."

      "title": "Strengthen your cheek muscles to have more control while eating.",
      "content": "Strengthen your cheek muscles to have more control while eating. Use facial exercises like pressing the inside of your cheeks against your teeth while pulling back the corners of your mouth and pursing your lips. This facial movement strengthens the buccinators, or cheek, muscles. [8] X Research source Strengthening cheek muscles will allow for better control when chewing and sucking liquids."

      "title": "Use a denture brush or regular tooth brush to clean the denture daily.",
      "content": "Use a denture brush or regular tooth brush to clean the denture daily. The brush you use should have medium-length bristles. Use denture tooth paste, denture creams, or denture soaking solution. Brush the entire denture, not just the teeth, before you place the dentures into your mouth [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source While cleaning, make sure to do it over a sink or basin of water or towel. If dentures are dropped on a hard surface, they could break."

      "content": "Do not allow dentures to dry out. Leave dentures in a cup of water or denture-soaking solution when they are out of your mouth. Typically, this will be overnight. Ask your doctor to recommend suitable denture-cleaners or denture-soaking solutions. [10] X Research source Do not leave dentures in hot water or bleach."

      "content": "Visit your dentist to have your dentures repaired if necessary. Do not attempt to repair your dentures yourself. If they break, chip, crack, or become too loose, a professional should be consulted to make the proper fix. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Usually you dentist can make the repair within the same day. Depending on the difficult of the repair, the process could take from 1 to 3 hours. However, if it is an especially complicated break, the dentures may have to be sent to a dental lab."
