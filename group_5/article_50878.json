      "content": "Bring the best Pokémon to counter Iron Leaves. The first step to beating Iron Leaves is to have the best Pokémon for the job. The best Pokémon types to bring to fight know Bug-, Dark-, or Ghost-type moves. Having a Pokémon that can learn Clear Smog or Taunt to deal with Swords Dance is a good idea as well. Below are some popular choices, along with moves: Kingambit: Despite being a Dark-type (and weak to Iron Leaves's Megahorn attack), Kingambit is a popular choice for this raid as it can learn Iron Defense, Taunt, Swords Dance, and Kowtow Cleave. [1] X Research source Ceruledge: Consider teaching Ceruledge Clear Smog to remove Iron Leaves's Swords Dance buff, Iron Defense to increase survivability, Taunt to block Iron Leaves from using status moves, and/or Swords Dance to increase Ceruledge's Attack. [2] X Research source Skeledirge: While Skeledirge can't learn any of the moves listed above, it's a strong (and popular) choice for this raid due to its Ghost-typing. [3] X Research source Gholdengo: While this is a time-consuming Pokémon to obtain, Gholdengo is resistant to all of Iron Leaves's moves and it can learn a plethora of Dark- and Ghost-type moves.

      "content": "Give your Pokémon a held item. Held items can make or break a battle, so make sure you've got a useful held item for your Pokémon. There are tons of held items in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and you can really use almost any that you want, but these held items are the most efficient: Shell Bell: Restores some of your HP when you damage the opponent. You can get Shell Bells from the Levincia Branch of Delibird Presents for $20,000 PokéDollars. You can also get one from a Pokémon League Rep after defeating 7 trainers in South Province Area Three. [5] X Research source Scope Lens: Increases your critical-hit ratio. You can buy Scope Lenses from the Levincia Branch of Delibird Presents for $15,000 PokéDollars. [6] X Research source Metronome: Increases the power of moves that are used repeatedly. This is a good option if you bring Kingambit, since you'll be using Kowtow Cleave repeatedly to deal damage. You can buy Metronomes from the Levincia Branch of Delibird Presents for $15,000 PokéDollars. [7] X Research source Electric Seed: Increases your Pokémon's defense if you're standing on Electric Terrain. As Iron Leaves makes the battle terrain Electric, an Electric Seed is a good choice as it will be activated almost immediately. You can buy Electric Seeds from the Cascarrafa Branch of Delibird Presents for $20,000 PokéDollars (only available after beating the main story). You can also find Electric Seeds as sparkling overworld items in West Province Area Three. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Outline a strategy.",
      "content": "Outline a strategy. Before going into the Raid Battle, look over your Pokémon's moveset and determine which moves you want to use. While you can use any number of moves, a good strategy is to start with Taunt, follow with one to two Iron Defenses, then do two to three Sword Dances, then finish the fight with your damage-dealing move. If your Pokémon of choice can't learn Taunt, Iron Defense, or Sword Dance, focus on selecting moves that Iron Leaves are weak to or moves that can remove stat changes, such as Clear Smog. If you're using Kingambit, the best damage-dealing move you can use is Kowtow Cleave. However, making sure to bring Iron Defense and a Shell Bell is important so you can stay alive if Iron Leaves uses Megahorn. If you're bringing along a Gholdengo, some users have had success by starting with two to three Nasty Plots and using Shadow Ball as your main damage-dealing move."
