      "content": "Pry up the tread enough to fit a reciprocating saw blade underneath. Start at the second step from the top since the top step is really more of a landing than a stair. Wiggle a flat crowbar into the line between the tread (the horizontal part of the step) and the riser (the vertical part of the step). Push down on the crowbar to lever the tread up. You won’t be able to completely pry up the tread, because it has lots of nails holding it in place. [1] X Research source Only raise the tread enough to fit a blade in between. Don’t use so much pressure that you crack the tread. If the stairs are especially creaky, they may not be nailed in at all. If you just feel resistance everywhere you move your blade, it’s probably glue holding the stairs in place. If you don’t have a reciprocating saw, you can try using a plasterboard saw or a pruning saw . Don’t see the gap in the tread? If the step has a wooden molding that sits underneath the top lip of the tread, pry up that molding with a crowbar first and remove it completely. This process only works if you’re replacing the treads but leaving the risers. If you want to replace the risers, you’re best off demolishing the staircase and rebuilding them from scratch to ensure they’re up to code."

With a nail-cutting blade on your saw, slide the saw back and forth under your tread until you feel resistance. Begin cutting until you slice through the nail. [2] X Research source If you’re just dealing with glue, it should be easy to cut through most of it without much resistance. You do not need to remove all the glue, also. Just aim to cut around 75% of it. Warning: Make sure not to cut through the wood that forms the stringer, which is the wooden frame along the sides of the steps. If you feel resistance in the middle of the step and it doesn’t feel like you’re cutting through metal, stop."

      "content": "Remove the tread completely with the crowbar. Renoj explains that you only need to slide the edge of your crowbar underneath the tread and lever it up. You may have to pry it up all along its length and jiggle it to get it loose. [3] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. If you can’t pry it off, you may not have sliced through all the nails, so run your saw through again. Is there a platform under the tread? If you can’t see through the stairs to the floor underneath, you have a platform stringer. Your best solution here is to add treads on top of the pre-built steps instead of removing the steps entirely."

It's best to work from the top of the stairs down to the bottom so you don't get stuck on the landing. Renoj says that you may need to use a fair bit of pressure to pry out certain steps if they used too much glue. [4] X Expert Source Agustin Renoj Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Thinking about replacing the risers? It’s best to leave the risers in place if they’re structurally sound. If you want to give them a new look though, purchase some wood veneers and install them after the treads are gone."

      "content": "Buy stair treads in your preferred wood. Common types of wood include pine and oak. You can buy the treads either finished or unfinished. Buying unfinished treads will save you money while buying finished treads will save you time. If you have hardwood floors, you might want to get a matching wood for your stairs, though some people like to have contrasting stairs."

      "title": "Find out your local building code for stair measurements.",
      "content": "Find out your local building code for stair measurements. Building codes vary a bit by country and state. As one example, in California, the risers need to be no taller than 7.75 inches (19.7 cm), the treads have to be at least 10 inches (25 cm) deep, and the nosing must be between .75 to 1.25 inches (1.9 to 3.2 cm). Many building codes call for no more than a 0.375 inches (0.95 cm) variation in the riser heights."

      "content": "Use a stair gauge to find the dimensions for each new tread. Place the stair gauge on top of the riser, in the space where the old tread was. Loosen the screws on top of the stair gauge so that you can extend the wings fully against the skirtboard. Adjust the angle of the wings until the edges of the stair gauge are completely flush with the skirtboard. Tighten the screws to hold the measurement in place. [7] X Research source Each tread may be slightly different, so measure each one individually if there appears to be any kind of variation from step to step. If you don’t have a stair gauge, you can create a template using a scrap piece of wood or cardboard. So long as the back of the template is flush with the riser, it’ll work the same way as a stair gauge. Just use a straight edge and a pencil to mark your tread shape. Then, use scissors or a knife to cut your template."

      "content": "Lay the stair gauge over the new tread and trace the measurements. When you lift up the stair gauge from the step, the angles and lengths will stay in place if you’ve properly tightened the screws. Lay the stair gauge on top of the piece of wood that will be the new tread and trace the edges with a pencil. Label the underside of the tread for the bottom step with a 1, the second step with a 2, and so on. That way you will easily be able to tell which tread goes where. [8] X Research source Double check your measurements—it’s easy to fix a mark, but you can’t undo a cut."

      "content": "Use a table saw to rip the tread to the right length. Adjust the fence so that the distance from the fence to the blade is the length you need to cut the board. Set a taper guide to the same angle as you need to cut. Set the blade so that it rises higher than the thickness of the wood by at least 0.125 to 0.25 inches (0.32 to 0.64 cm). Turn on the blade, hold the wood against the fence (or taper guide), and run the board through the saw at a steady pace. [9] X Research source Wear cut-resistant gloves and eye protection whenever you’re using the table saw, and don’t wear any loose or dangling clothes. Never get your hand close to the blade – there should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) between your hand and the blade at all times. Make sure the blade guard is down and that you know where the stop button is. [10] X Research source Only use a table saw if it has a blade cover or a riving knife to prevent kickback. Turn off the saw when you’re done with the cut."

      "content": "Place the tread on the step and mark it to the right depth. Put the tread onto the step and measure how much the tread sticks out from the riser with a measuring tape. Depending on your local building code, the nosing requirements (how much it sticks out over the riser) may be different, though in the US it’s often 0.75 to 1.25 inches (1.9 to 3.2 cm). If the tread sticks out further than it should, mark the end of the tread with how much you want to take off. [11] X Research source Measure twice, cut once. Always double-check your measurements before you cut. It’s a good rule for woodworking in general, but it’s especially important for stairs where being off even a few millimeters can lead to a stair being creaky and uneven."

Take all the precautions that you did the first time you used the saw. For this rip cut, you don’t need to use a taper guide because the cut isn’t at an angle. Turn on the saw, hold the wood against the fence, and run the board through the saw at a steady pace. [12] X Research source Remember to keep your hands far away from the blade at all times."

It’s best to squeeze the glue in a zigzag pattern, rather than a straight line, so that there’s more glue. Press the tread into position on top of the glue. [14] X Research source Don’t try to cut costs by using a weaker type of glue, because it won’t hold up. Wipe any glue off the tip of the glue bottle before it dries so that you can easily use it again. Most professional carpenters seem to prefer Loctite construction adhesive , but any construction-grade adhesive will work."

Then, paint the finish onto the stairs . Paint every other stair if you need to use the stairway in the next few hours. Then, finish the other stairs once the others are dry. That way, you can walk up the stairs using every other stair. [17] X Research source Another option is to finish all the stairs at once and avoid using that stairway for a few days. Make sure to tell everyone in your household that you just finished the stairs, so they don’t step on them and ruin them. Want to install carpet? No need to finish the wood!
