Trading cards often have dual purposes and for Pokémon cards, you can either collect the cards for the fun of hunting them down or you can collect them so you can play the Pokémon Trading Card Game. [1] X Research source If you only want to collect and display cards, you have the freedom to go in any direction with the kinds of cards you want. You can collect based off of Pokémon types, card values, sets, or any category you can think of. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a target list of what you want to collect. Some people exclusively try to collect rare or special cards while others are looking for certain types of Pokémon or want to catch them all. Being more specific with your list can help narrow down your search among the 900+ Pokémon that currently exist. As you start out, keep in mind that there are different rarities for cards. 'Rarity' is a term used to determine how hard a card is to find and the rarity is marked on the bottom right of the card with a symbol: [3] X Research source Easier to find cards include common (black circle mark), uncommon (black diamond), or rare (black star). Harder to find cards are either holofoil rare (black star with holographic art), ultra rare (white star), or secret rare (rarity symbol with a serial number). Some of the most sought-after cards are either full art (cards with only art), EX ('EX' is next to the Pokémon name), or reverse holos (holographic sheen is on everything but the art). These cards are limited edition and can be worth a lot of money in mint condition. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Research what kind of cards are currently in print.",
      "content": "Research what kind of cards are currently in print. It's easier to start collecting the most recent printing of cards because they are more widely and readily available. Pokémon cards are released in sets when they are printed by the manufacturers but the sets are spread out across the world in separate packs of cards, such as starter or booster packs. Many people aim for collecting a whole set; there are generally 102 different cards per set. Be aware, sets can also have expansion packs that extend the list of cards you will need to complete that particular set. It is easier to collect a set while it's in print. The older a set is or if it goes out of print, the more difficult it will be to find those cards and they will often become more expensive as well. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy in bulk. Vendors online as well as places like flea markets and hobby stores will often have options to buy cards in bulk. You can purchase a large amount at a discounted price and usually save money on shipping as well. One downside to bulk purchases is that you may not find anything of high value. But sometimes there's a rare card hiding among a few hundred common ones. The hunt for valuable cards is part of the advantage and allure for buying in bulk. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy strategically. If you want to play the card game, you may want to focus on finding certain Pokémon or trainers and building a strong team to challenge other collectors. Pokémon cards can be usually be bought in boxed sets of themed decks, booster packs, and tins. [7] X Research source A theme deck will generally have 60 cards but will be more expensive overall. It's a great way to get your collection for playing started because it will give you a wide range of Pokémon, energy cards, trainer and item cards, as well as a decent mix of different card rarities. Booster packs will have about 10 cards in the newer expansions (and around 11 in older ones) and can cost as little as $3 or $4. Tins serve a similar purpose and are a great way to expand your collection. [8] X Research source"

Trading cards with people you play against is a great way to find new cards out in the \"wild\" and you can negotiate trades to expand your team of Pokémon. This maintains that fair deals and no one is being taken advantage of within the trade. Some people make the mistake of trading several of their cards for one rare one they have their eye on and instead end up trading several cards of value for just one good card. Trading uneven amounts of cards is a quick way to lose large chunks of your collection and it's best to swap one at a time. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold on to duplicates for later use. Some people might think that duplicates aren't of any use and just take up space. Instead, think of duplicates as opportunities to trade with other collectors whether in person or online to expand your collection. It's very likely that another collector will have multiples of a card you want and vice versa, so you can swap cards with each other without taking a card from your overall set. Having duplicates can also be beneficial when building a deck and having back-ups when playing the card game."

      "content": "Trade in baby steps. The best way to go from owning a low value card to a high value one is to trade up gradually. Start by trading a card for another that is just slightly more valuable than the one you started with. Then, continue to trade that card for a slightly more valuable one each time you trade it. This is also a great way to obtain rare cards without going bankrupt. Selling cards is an option, but trading doesn't require any monetary transactions and you can still end up with a great card.

Organization should be based on your own preferences such as whether you want to be able to pull out certain Pokémon types for battles or want to keep them in numerical order so you can know what's missing in the set you're collecting. There are several ways to categorize Pokémon cards including: Type (i.e. grass, ground, fighting, water, fire) Set (i.e. guardians rising, roaring skies, jungle, ex sandstorm) Evolution (basic, stage 1, stage 2, mega, break) Pokédex number- each Pokémon is assigned a number in the master list of Pokémon.

      "content": "Use groups and subgroups when organizing your cards. You can combine different organizational methods by layering them. For example, you can have a group of all water type Pokémon and then as a subgroup, they are arranged by rarity, going from most rare to the most common card type. It's helpful to keep a master list somewhere easy to find, like the front pocket of a binder, so that you can reference it and locate a card within a group or subgroup quickly."

A 3-ring binder can hold sheets of page protectors with special pockets for trading cards. The clear plastic is a great way to display your cards with easy access so you can organize the cards as you collect more. Another option is to buy individual sleeves or toploaders to hold separate cards that can then all be stored in a box or tin. Sleeves help protect from scratches and toploaders are a stiffer plastic sleeve that prevents cards from bending. You can buy binders at office supply stores or online and sheets and sleeves can be found at any hobby store. To cut down on costs, buy in bulk to save money in the long run. [12] X Research source"

The accent needs to be present on both the back and front of the card as well as within any text on the card. Reasonable HP and attack numbers. Fakes will sometimes have ridiculously high stats. Font sizes are uniform and a Pokémon's attacks will be in bolded font. No spelling errors. Copyright and trademark symbols will be visible. Real cards will not have grainy or fuzzy images or raised textures on the card. The energy symbol on a real card will not take up the entire circle it is in.
