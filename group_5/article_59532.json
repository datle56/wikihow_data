Try to make most of your carbohydrate intake consist of complex carbohydrates. This means that they're more complicated molecularly and take longer for your body to break down. This may help your body break down glucose and may help you feel fuller longer, controlling weight and appetite control.

Try to keep your food as close to its original or natural form. To do this, limit processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as much as possible. Processed food often contains large amounts of sugar. Read labels to determine how much sugar is in a product, but realize that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. An easy way to avoid processed foods is to avoid \"white\" foods (no white bread, white pasta, or white rice). For example, one 6-ounce serving of flavored low-fat yogurt has 38 grams of sugar (which is the equivalent of 7 teaspoons of sugar)."

These fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids that are essential for your health and are anti-inflammatory. Try to eat at least 2 servings of fish each week.

The sugars in fruit are combined with the fiber which slows the absorption of sugars. Try to get 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Don't forget to add herbs that can control your blood sugar levels. These can also help you fight sugar cravings and are safe with no side effects (when taken in commonly used amounts as food). Use these herbs: Cinnamon Fenugreek Okra (not quite an herb, but more of a side-dish) Ginger Garlic and onions Basil Bitter melon (more commonly used as a tea three to four times a day)"
