Shuffle the cards thoroughly so they’re thoroughly mixed. Set the deck somewhere where it’s easy to reach throughout the game. [1] X Research source Lorcana usually works best as a 2-player game, but you can play as many people as you want. As you get more experienced, you can add new Lorcana cards to a starter deck or make your own for a better strategy ."

It’s okay to look at your own cards, but keep them hidden from the other players. [2] X Research source After drawing cards, you can alter your opening hand (also known as a “mulligan”). Starting with the first player, choose any number of cards in your hand that you don’t want and place them on the bottom of your deck. Then, draw new cards until you have 7 cards again. Finally, reshuffle your deck."

Most cards have similar parts, while some cards may have additional powers and symbols. [3] X Research source Parts on all cards Cost: The number in the top-left corner shows how much ink the card costs to play. Inkwell Icon: The Inkwell Icon looks like a golden circle around the cost. If a card has this icon, then it can be converted into ink to pay for other cards. Name: The name of the card. Some cards have a version name listed under them, like “Stitch - Covert Agent.” Ink: The color band and symbol underneath the card’s name shows its ink type. There are 6 ink types in the game. Classifications: Cards may have various classification keywords under their name. These keywords may be referenced by other card effects. Abilities and effects: Abilities and effects appear on the bottom half of the card. They are either passive or they can be activated during a turn. Parts on some cards Strength: Strength appears inside of a sun symbol on the right side of the card and shows how much damage it can deal. Willpower: Willpower is a number inside a shield on the right side of the card, and it tells you how much damage a card can take before it’s banished (removed from the game). Lore Value: Lore Values appear as diamond shapes on the bottom right side of a card. These cards earn Lore needed to win the game based on the number of symbols."

Emerald cards are more defensive and can help quest for more Lore and protect yourself against challenges. Ruby cards focus primarily on banishing your opponent’s cards, but they come at a high Ink cost. Sapphire cards prioritize adding cards to your Inkwell so you can play more powerful cards faster.
