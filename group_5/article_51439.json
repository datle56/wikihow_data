[6] X Research source You can also learn to Calculate a Square Root by Hand ! If the area of your square is 20, then the side length s =√20 , or 4.472 .

The distance from the center of an inscribed square to each of its corners is equal to the radius of the circle. To find the length of s , we must first imagine cutting the square in half diagonally to form two right triangles. Each of these triangles will have equal sides a and b and hypotenuse c , which we know is equal to two times the radius of the circle, or 2r . [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Since sides a and b are equal (remember, we are still dealing with a square!) and we know that c = 2r , we can write out the equation and simplify the equation to find the side length as follows: a 2 + a 2 = (2r) 2 , now simplify the expressions: 2a 2 = 4r 2 , now divide both sides by 2: a 2 = 2r 2 , now take the square root of each side: a = √(2r 2 ) = √2r .

      "content": "Solve an example equation. Consider a square inscribed in a circle with radius 10. That means that the diagonal of this square = 2(10), or 20. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that 2a 2 = 20 2 , so 2a 2 = 400. Now divide both sides in half to find that a 2 = 200. Then take the square root of each side to find that a = 14.142 . Multiply this by 4, and you will find the perimeter of your square: P = 56.57 . Notice that you could have found the same thing by simply multiplying the radius, 10, by 5.657. 10 * 5.567 = 56.57 , but that might be hard to remember on a test, so it's better to memorize the process we used to get there."
