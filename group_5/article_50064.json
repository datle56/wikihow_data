[9] X Research source You have a unique set of skills, traits, and values that allow you to achieve things that no one but you can do. In numerology, seeing 3939 is encouragement to use your special gifts to make positive change in the world and your life; you’re capable of starting a new chapter at any time! This message comes from the individual energies of numbers 3, 9, and 6: Number 3 represents abundance, growth, creativity, self-expression and joy. Number 9 symbolizes enlightenment, wisdom, divine guidance, selflessness, and the end of a cycle so a new start can begin. 3939 also reduces to 6, since 3+9+3+9=24, and 2+4=6. Number 6 vibrates with stability, trust, nurturing, and love. Since the number 39 is mirrored and causes 3 and 9 to each appear twice, 3939 is considered an extra urgent sign to take action from the universe."
