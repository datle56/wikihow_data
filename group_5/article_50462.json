      "content": "Make sure you aren't wearing your Apple Watch too loosely. If your Apple Watch band is loose, the sensor on the back of your watch won't have constant contact with your wrist. This can cause your watch to lock even though you've been wearing it the whole time. If your watch band is old and stretched out, you may want to purchase a replacement to keep your watch snug against your wrist."
