      "content": "“Babygirl” is slang for a guy who is cute, sensitive, and a tad naive. The term is a little slippery, but basically, if your man is over 25-ish, confident in his masculinity yet sensitive, a little broody (maybe?), and daddyish-but-still-somehow-innocent, you got yourself a babygirl right there. The term \"babygirl\" covers a broad spectrum of dude: it has been applied to sensitive sweater-wearers like Paul Mescal, men who flout gender expectations like Harry Styles, celebs with innocent daddish vibes like Pedro Pascal , curmudgeonly middle-aged anti-heroes like Walter White from Breaking Bad , and narcissistic, emotionally disoriented nepo babies like Kendall Roy from Succession . The word is typically used on celebrities and fictional characters, but real-life guys could be babygirl—or a babygirl, since the term is both an adjective and a noun. While “babygirl” for a man is often used ironically, it's still largely a compliment, and not meant to be condescending or dismissive."

      "content": "“Babygirl” can also refer to an attractive woman. The term \"babygirl\" (or \"baby girl\") is commonly used to flirtatiously refer to a woman (similar to using words like \"honey,\" \"babe,\" and \"sweetie\" to refer to a woman.) While some women enjoy being called “babygirl” (or “baby girl”), others find it condescending and infantilizing. The new meaning of “babygirl” has been celebrated as a way to subvert gender roles by positioning grown men—often very traditionally \"masculine\" men—as sweet li'l guys worthy of protecting."

      "content": "Gush over your favorite male character or celeb on social media. “Babygirl” is commonly used on social media, especially TikTok, to refer to men who are sensitive yet manly and somewhat naive, men who are tough but emotionally vulnerable in a way that makes you want to protect them. For instance, TikTok user @pascalistic captioned this TikTok video of fan fave Pedro Pascal, “he's babygirl your honor.” You might use the term to describe the guy generally, or pull it out when he’s being particularly babygirl. E.g., “Kyle Maclachlan’s giving such babygirl in these instagram photos .” The term might be used semi-sarcastically, as in this TikTok describing Godzilla as “babygirl,” but it’s nevertheless used affectionately."

      "content": "“Babygirl” as a term for men came out sometime between 2017 and 2020. Around this time, Wattpad user aradmille uploaded a photoshopped panel from the manga Mob Psycho 100 , in which Shiegeo asks Arataka, “Why does Serizawa call you babygirl?” and Arataka replies, “How about we stop talking for a little while?” [1] X Research source The word took off on Twitter and Tumblr in August 2021, when users started redrawing the panel with other characters from different fandoms. Most of the photoshops involved one male character asking another male character (for instance, Mario and Luigi ) why someone calls them “babygirl.” Internet users began using the term more widely to refer to men generally, creating TikTok reels featuring their favorite babygirl's most babygirl moments. The word was and remains reserved mostly for celebrities and fictional characters. However, any man can be called babygirl if he’s a babygirl."

(Think Timothée Chalamet's character in Lady Bird .) [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Submissive and breedable “Submissive and breedable” walked so “babygirl” could run. Before “babygirl” took off, Twitter user @T4RIG posted, “normalize 👏 platonically 👏 telling 👏 your 👏 bros 👏 they 👏 look 👏 submissive 👏and 👏 breedable 👏” in June 2021. The post garnered more than 92,000 likes and 12,200 retweets in 5 days. [4] X Research source “Submissive and breedable” are descriptors more traditionally relevant to women than men, and the phrase’s virality in this context paved the way for sweet, soft-spoken men to be praised as babygirls."
