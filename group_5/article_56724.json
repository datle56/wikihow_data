      "content": "Focus on lean protein. Protein is essential for weight loss. It helps keep you satisfied, supports your metabolism and can help support your lean muscle mass. Including three to four ounces (or 80 to 120 grams) or a card deck sized portion of protein at each meal will help you reach your daily recommendations. Lean protein sources are lower in fat and calories making them a great component of a weight loss or fat reduction plan. Choose items like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, seafood, legumes and tofu."

It's typically suggested to eat about five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Eating one to two servings at every meal and snack can help you meet this goal.

      "content": "Get your bra refitted. If it has been a while since you got your bra size measured, or you have gained or lost a significant amount of weight, it may be worth your while to get your bra resized. [2] X Research source A band that is too tight will dig in and create unflattering bulges across your back. Your skin may also hurt or ache throughout the day if your bra is not fitted to your body. Go to an undergarment store or undergarment department store and ask for help. Many stores offer free bra fittings for customers. They'll measure you and give you an idea of an appropriate size. Also try different types of bras. Some are actually designed to hold in unwanted bulges and are more comfortable to wear throughout the day."

      "content": "Avoid clothes that dig in at the waist or back. Tight fitting tops, tops that show more skin or those that are made of sheer fabric may enhance the look of bulges around your back. [3] X Research source Choose more flattering clothes to help disguise unwanted bulges on your back. Unflattering clothing choices can include: tight waistbands, tight bras, jeans that cause muffin top, etc. These can call attention to your back fat. Try to wear clothes that are flattering and that fit you well. By wearing more flattering clothing, people likely wonâ€™t even notice any back fat that you do have. You can also wear clothes that will draw attention away from your back. For example, wear a loose top with a bright skirt to guide the eye down, or pair a simple shirt with dangly earrings for the opposite effect."

By definition, cardiovascular interval exercise raises your heart rate, keeping it pumping fast during and after your cardio intervals.

Try to do at least 30 minutes of cardio most days of the week."

Lower back down slowly. If you cannot do a regular pull-up, try using the assisted pull-up machine at your gym. You'll rest your knees on the bench and slowly pull yourself up. Pull-ups are difficult, so try to do 10 repetitions, or just as many as you can. Do two or three sets if you can."
