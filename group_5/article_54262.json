      "content": "Set the dryer to cool air for a handy DIY air pump. Lay the mattress out flat and press the end of the dryer over the intake valve on the mattress. Make sure the dryer is on the cool air setting and start it up. Some of the air will escape since the dryer and intake valve are different sizes, but the mattress should slowly fill up. [1] X Research source You may get a better seal between the valve and dryer if you have a vacuum cleaner with a crevice attachment that fits over the end of the dryer. Don’t use a hair dryer that lacks a cool air setting. Hot air may melt or deform the vinyl and plastic components of the mattress."

      "content": "Use a vacuum that can blow out air as a good pump alternative. Some home vacuum cleaners, and many shop vacuums, have reverse modes that cause them to “blow” instead of “suck.” In this case, set the vacuum to reverse flow, press the end of the hose over the mattress’ intake valve, and turn on the vacuum to fill the mattress. Put one of the crevice attachments on the end of the hose if that improves the connection with the intake valve. [2] X Research source You may still be able to use your vacuum even if it doesn’t have a reverse flow mode. Detach the hose and the bag or canister that holds dirt and debris. Press one end of the hose over or into the opening that directs dirt and debris into the bag or canister. Press the other end of the hose against the mattress’ intake valve and turn on the vacuum. Air should flow from the vacuum, through the tube, and into the mattress."

      "content": "Try this noisy but solid option if you’re outdoors at home. Leave the blower’s typical attachment in place. Lay the mattress flat on the ground, then press the end of the blower’s attachment over the mattress’ intake valve. Cup your hand around the end of the attachment to maintain a better airflow seal, then turn on the blower and fill up the mattress. [3] X Research source As with a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner, the job may go faster if you can put on an attachment that better matches the size of the mattress’ intake valve. Try popping a vacuum cleaner crevice attachment onto the end of the leaf blower’s typical attachment. You can use an electric leaf blower indoors, but keep in mind that it will be really loud. Never use a gas-powered leaf blower indoors."

      "content": "Repurpose this different type of pump with a bit of tape. Since your bike pump’s nozzle is probably a good bit smaller than the mattress’ intake valve, use tape to improve the air seal. Press the pump’s nozzle against the intake valve and wrap duct tape (or a similar sturdy tape) around the valve and nozzle. Press the lever on the bike pump up and down to add air to the mattress, just like you do when filling a bike tire. Keep in mind that this will take a lot longer to fill than a bike tire, though! [4] X Research source Lay the mattress out flat on the ground for the best results. Yes, technically this is a pump...but it’s not an air mattress pump!"

      "content": "Buy a matching air mattress valve to improve this option. There isn’t much difference in using an air compressor versus an electric air pump to inflate things like a mattress: insert the compressor’s output valve into the mattress’s intake valve, flip the power switch, and run the compressor until the mattress is full. That said, the typical valve options that come with an air compressor may not perfectly fit the mattress valve, so you may have to duct tape the valves together to get a good seal. Alternatively, shop online for an air mattress valve attachment for your compressor. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the bag and squeeze out air when using this surprising option. Open up the trash bag and swing it up, down, and around until it fills with air. Cinch the opening with your hands to hold the air in. Fit the bag’s opening over the mattress’ intake valve and cinch it tightly over the valve with your hand. Squeeze the bag to push the air into the mattress, or lay front-side down on top of the bag to speed up the process a little. Refill the bag and repeat...and repeat...and repeat—it’ll take a while, but it works! [6] X Research source For the best results, use the thickest trash bag you can get, like a lawn and leaf bag or a contractor’s bag. Thinner bags will spring leaks more quickly and have to be replaced."

      "content": "Inflate the mattress with your lungs as a last resort. Wash or sanitize the mattress’ intake valve to make sure it’s clean. Take a deep breath, create a seal over the intake valve with your lips, and exhale fully into the mattress. If your mattress has a one-way valve (which most do), you can remove your mouth from the valve, take another deep breath, and repeat. If it’s a two-way valve, the air will leak back out if you remove your mouth. In this case, keep your mouth on the valve, breathe in through your nose, and breathe out through your mouth. [7] X Research source This method takes a really, really long time and will leave you out of breath and worn out. But look on the bright side—you’ll drift right off to sleep once you plop down on your freshly-filled air mattress!"
