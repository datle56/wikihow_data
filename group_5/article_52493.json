[2] X Research source You can write this \"conversion factor\" as a fraction: 1 i n c h 25.4 m m {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1inch}{25.4mm}}} . Any two units have a special conversion factor for converting between them. If you don't know what it is, you can look it up online or in a textbook."

This means the fraction is equal to 1, just like the fractions 3 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{3}}} or 8 8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {8}{8}}} simplify to 1. Remember, multiplying a number by 1 doesn't change its value. That means you can multiply your measurement by this factor and the length will be the same. The only difference is the units: your answer will be written in inches instead of millimeters. [3] X Research source"

Cancel out the millimeters: 16 x 1 i n 25.4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1in}{25.4}}} = ? Since the only unit left is inches, your answer will be in inches."

Here are two different ways to do it, continuing with the same example: Divide by two, then subtract 1/10 of the cm value: 43 cm ÷ 2 = 21.5 → 1/10 of 43 is 4.3 → subtract the second number from the first: 21.5 - 4.3 = 17.2 in. Or divide by ten, then multiply by four: 43 cm ÷ 10 = 4.3 → 4.3 x 4 = (4 x 4) + (0.3 x 4) = 16 + 1.2 = 17.2 in."

It's not a good idea for homework problems that require an exact answer, but you can use it to double check your answer and make sure it's in the right ballpark. In the example, the exact answer is actually 16.921 inches. The estimate is less than a third of an inch off, which is pretty good for mental math."
