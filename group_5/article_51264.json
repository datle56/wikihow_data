Rough sawn cedar is used in the images here for durability and appearance, but any weather resistant lumber can be used. If you want to get exact material requirements, you may need to produce a scale drawing with specific nominal dimension lumber lengths and sizes."

If you measure carefully and cut with a table saw, you should be able to get two vanes from each board, assuming you are using 1X6 cedar fence boards. These will be the stock cut for vanes later.
