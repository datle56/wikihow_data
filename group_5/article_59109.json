      "content": "Scrape the paint off with a plastic scraper or your fingernail. Plastic paint scrapers are great for flat surfaces because they have a nice, straight edge that won’t scratch your surface easily. [1] X Research source Your fingernail may work better for curved surfaces, such as toys and models. Hold the scraping tool at a slight angle and gently push it under the painted surface."

      "content": "Soak the area in soapy water or vegetable oil, then scrape again. If the plastic surface is small, like a miniature or a piece of decor, let it soak in a container with warm, soapy water for at least 20 minutes. If the surface is large, apply vegetable oil to the painted area, lay a piece of plastic wrap over it, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then, try scraping the paint off again. [2] X Research source Alternatively, soak the plastic in hot water with equal parts baking soda and vinegar. Then, scrape off the paint. [3] X Research source Once you’re done, wipe the residue with a damp cloth and let the item dry completely. If the paint still doesn’t come off, you may have to use a paint stripper or solvent to loosen it."

Water-based paints (like latex or acrylic) tend to have a duller sheen and fade over time, while oil-based paints are glossier and yellow as they age. [4] X Research source If you’re not sure what type of plastic an item is made of, try to match its appearance and feel to a plastic below. [5] X Research source ABS plastic: Very rigid and comes in a variety of colors. Often used for car and motorcycle parts. Acrylic (Plexiglass): Strong, stiff, and transparent glass-like material. Polyethylene: Low-density is thin enough to crumble (like grocery bags), high-density is translucent or milky white (like milk or juice cartons). Nylon: Soft and easily malleable. Often used for guitar strings, cleaning brushes, clothing, and paint brushes. Polypropylene: Bendable but stiff, strong, and more heat-resistant than other plastics. Plasticized PVC (vinyl chloride): One of the most widely used plastics, but is health-hazardous.

      "content": "Test your solvent in an inconspicuous area. Some types of plastics may react poorly to some solvents. To see if a solvent will harm your item, pick up a drop of your solvent with a soft paintbrush or cotton swab and place it onto an inconspicuous area on your item. Wait a few minutes, then rinse the solvent off. [18] X Research source If nothing happens to the plastic, the solvent may be safe to use. Keep in mind that some solvents may need hours before they have an adverse effect on your item. If the plastic changes color or texture, or if it indents when you press your fingernail into the surface, use a different solvent. Wear gloves and a respirator mask to protect your skin and lungs from the chemicals."
