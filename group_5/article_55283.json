      "content": "Throw away trash and remove unnecessary items. While this may not be the most fun part of giving your room a makeover, it is the most important! Put on your favorite playlist and get busy. Get rid of trash, throw away broken items, and put away things that don’t belong in your room like dishes. [1] X Research source Mail and other papers can often pile up so go through these types of items and recycle anything you don't need to keep."

      "content": "Donate any items you don’t want or need. Spend some time going through your stuff and ask yourself “When was the last time I used this?” If you haven’t touched it in 6 months, let it go! If your goal is to truly transform your space, you’ve got to be willing to get rid of things you don’t use. If you want to be really thorough, sort through everything in your room—all your books, shoes, clothes, pictures, jewelry, makeup, movies, CDs, knickknacks—everything! [2] X Research source This is especially important for clothes and shoes -- if you don’t wear it, you don’t need it. For items that have sentimental value, consider storing them in another room or even under your bed or in your closet. That way, they aren’t on display but you can still take them out and look at them when you’re feeling nostalgic."

      "content": "Paint your walls for a simple solution. Changing the color of your walls can make a dramatic impact on the way your room looks. Choose a color you love that complements items you know you're going to keep and display, such as a dresser or favorite piece of artwork. Start by moving everything away from the walls and masking the baseboards and ceiling. Apply a coat or 2 of primer and let it dry fully. Then, paint the walls with a roller using long, even strokes. To make your room look more airy and open, choose a light color such as white, gray, or yellow. For a more dramatic effect, you can paint one wall a bold color and the rest a subtle hue. There are tons of cool paints to try, like chalkboard paint or magnetic paint."

      "content": "Hang wallpaper to instantly transform your space. If you have the time and don’t mind putting in the effort, hanging wallpaper adds texture and drama to your walls. Pick a color or pattern you truly love since wallpaper is more difficult to remove or redo than simply painting the walls. Measure your room before purchasing wallpaper and be sure to get a little extra in case of any issues. If your wallpaper is patterned, take care to line up the pattern when you add a new strip! You can use removable wallpaper if you don't want to commit to the print or color permanently."

You can do all your walls for a cohesive look or even install shiplap on a single accent wall. Paint the shiplap white for a clean, nautical feel or simply stain the wood for a more natural look."
