      "content": "Throw away or recycle alkaline batteries. Alkaline batteries are the type that power most simple battery-operated devices, such as flashlights, toys, remote controls, or smoke alarms. They come in a variety of sizes, ranging from AAA to 9 volt. Proper disposal methods for alkaline batteries may depend on your local waste regulations. [1] X Research source Most alkaline batteries manufactured since 1996 are made of relatively non-hazardous materials, and can be tossed directly into the trash. However, some states or municipalities still require that alkaline batteries be treated as hazardous waste. In these cases, the batteries must be recycled or dropped off at a designated facility. [2] X Expert Source Kathryn Kellogg Sustainability Specialist Expert Interview. 28 June 2019. You may be able to drop off alkaline batteries for recycling at a local electronics retailer, recycling center, or community center. Check the Earth911 website for drop-off locations in your area."

      "content": "Dispose of car batteries at an auto parts retailer or hazardous waste collection site. Since car batteries contain lead acid, they can't be disposed of in the trash or tossed in with your recycling. [3] X Research source Many retailers, like Home Depot or Auto Zone, will accept dead or used car batteries. You can also drop them off at recycling or waste disposal facilities that specialize in hazardous materials."

      "title": "Take rechargeable batteries to a recycling facility.",
      "content": "Take rechargeable batteries to a recycling facility. Rechargeable batteries contain nickel and cadmium, which can create an environmental hazard if the batteries are thrown away in a landfill or an incinerator. These batteries must be disposed of at a hazardous waste collection site, recycling facility, or an electronics retailer that recycles batteries. [4] X Research source Many electronics retailers, like Radio Shack or Staples, will accept used rechargeable batteries for recycling. Check Earth911.com for participating retailers in your area."

      "content": "Donate or recycle lithium-ion batteries. These are the kinds of batteries that typically power portable electronics like your mobile phone, digital camera, tablet, or laptop. Lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at a recycling center or hazardous waste collection site, or donated to refurbishers and recyclers. [5] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source In the USA, some retailers participate in a program called the Sustainable Materials Management Electronics Challenge. The SSM program encourages companies to recycle and refurbish lithium batteries and other electronic components. Check the EPA website for a list of participating businesses, here: https://www.epa.gov/recycle/electronics-donation-and-recycling Check with electronics retailers in your area to find out if they will accept donations of lithium-ion batteries."

This kind of battery is used in hearing aids and watches, and contains mercuric oxide, lithium, silver oxide, or zinc-air. They are considered hazardous materials and must be brought to a household hazardous waste collection site for proper handling. Button batteries contain extremely toxic materials, and should never be disposed of in the trash. You may be able to recycle or dispose of button batteries at some electronics retailers."

      "content": "Check your local government website for battery disposal guidelines. The correct procedure for disposing of different types of batteries may vary significantly by region. Check the website for your state, city, or municipality for information on how to dispose of batteries in your area. For example: If you are in the UK, begin by looking at gov.uk's hazardous waste disposal page, which can help you find battery disposal facilities in your area: https://www.gov.uk/hazardous-waste-disposal If you are in the US, your state government's website probably has information on battery disposal. For example, if you live in California, you can find detailed information on battery recycling and disposal here: https://calrecycle.ca.gov/epr/batteries/"

      "content": "Tape the terminals of your batteries. Sometimes seemingly dead batteries still carry a bit of a charge. If the positive and negative terminals of old batteries touch, it can create an electric current, which can lead to a fire. This risk can be minimized by putting a little tape over the terminals of your old batteries until you are ready to dispose of them. Fire can also result from the terminals of batteries coming into contact with conductive materials (like keys, steel wool, or other objects likely to be lying in your rummage drawer)."

If you still have the original packaging for your batteries, this is a relatively safe way to store old batteries for disposal. Consider individually bagging especially hazardous batteries, like 9 volt alkaline batteries, button batteries, lead acid batteries, or lithium batteries."
