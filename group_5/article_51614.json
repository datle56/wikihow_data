      "content": "You can do this with your baby in the seat, or out of it. Get down on a knee and orient the car seat so that you’re looking at the baby (or would be if the baby were there). Keep the car seat on your dominant side. [1] X Research source Most folks find this works best with lighter car seats. If you’ve got a bulkier, heavier car seat, try to avoid carrying it with your baby in it and use both hands to carry it in front of you. A lot of people find this carrying method uncomfortable. This should not hurt. If it does, carry it in front of you with both hands. Careful with the lifting if you’ve just given birth! Wait at least 12 weeks (or more depending on your doctor’s guidance) before you lift heavy weights. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your dominant arm through the loop and cradle it. Rest the underside of the handle in the crook of your elbow, kind of like you’re carrying a big purse. Turn your palm away from you. [3] X Research source You may have carried the car seat like this on its own if you’ve ever had your hands full."

      "title": "Extend your arm like you’re reaching for the bottom of the car seat.",
      "content": "Extend your arm like you’re reaching for the bottom of the car seat. Keep your elbow against the handle and extend your arm down. To visualize this, your bicep should be above the handle on the side closest to your child’s feet. Your forearm should be on the side closer to your child’s head, pointing down towards the base of the car seat. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "What you grab depends on the model of your car seat.",
      "content": "What you grab depends on the model of your car seat. If there are any knobs or built-in latches for the straps and that feels like a natural place to grip the car seat, hold it there. If there’s nothing on the side to hold on to, cup the underside of the car seat with your fingers. [5] X Research source Carrying the car seat this way distributes the weight more evenly between your elbow and hand, so the car seat literally feels lighter."

      "title": "Raise the car seat up slowly and carefully.",
      "content": "Raise the car seat up slowly and carefully. Maintain the natural curve in your spine and don’t tilt or bend your upper body to keep the car seat steady. Once you’re upright, readjust your grip as needed to make the car seat as comfortable as possible. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you find this unnatural or uncomfortable, don’t push it. It’s okay to hold it by the handle, ask for help, or hold it with two hands in front of you."

      "title": "As you walk, keep the seat tucked at your side to support it.",
      "content": "As you walk, keep the seat tucked at your side to support it. Continue to grip the side or underside of the car seat while balancing the seat with your elbow. Walk slowly and set the car seat down if you start to feel any kind of pain. [7] X Research source A lot of people find this to be a little too cumbersome. If that’s you, don’t force it."

      "title": "If the one-arm method hurts, hold it at your stomach instead.",
      "content": "If the one-arm method hurts, hold it at your stomach instead. Wrap both of your arms around the base of the car seat like you’re hugging it. Lift with your legs and raise the car seat up. Hold it against your gut or sternum to balance it as you walk. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Have someone else carry your child or transport them separately in a stroller if you’re going to move the car seat this way. You can also carry the car seat by the handle if you prefer. Although, this is likely going to hurt your back if you found the one-arm method too painful."

      "content": "There are plenty of car seats out there that are easy to transport. If you find yourself carrying the car seat frequently, consider upgrading to something that’s easier to move. You might buy a car seat with built-in wheels if you carry the seat through airports or finished floors frequently. [9] X Research source Alternatively, purchase a stroller with a carrying strap for your shoulder which would make it easier to carry outdoors. [10] X Research source You can also buy a car seat strap to latch a car seat to some rolling luggage."

      "content": "Car seats are really not meant to be used outside of a vehicle. It’s totally fine to use the car seat as transport for short trips between vehicles or at the airport. However, if you don’t have a stroller , baby carrier , or baby wrap , buy one. These will make transporting your baby a breeze, and you can keep that heavy car seat where it belongs.
