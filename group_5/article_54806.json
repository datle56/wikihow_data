Newspapers and some online websites often have an area set aside for trades. You list what you have to trade and what you need while checking out the ads placed by others.

Many construction companies use the city dumps to dispose of material that they can't use or that they feel is not worth reclaiming. But you won't have the labor costs involved to strip paint from old windows and doors or to remove nails from lumber that the company would have, so it could be a great find for you."
