      "title": "Taurus Mercuries are reliable, direct, and considerate—but also stubborn.",
      "content": "Taurus Mercuries are reliable, direct, and considerate—but also stubborn. If Mercury was in the constellation Taurus when you were born, your personality combines all the dependability and bullheadedness of Taurus with the flexibility of Mercury. While you’re likely to contemplate for a long time before committing to an action or idea, once you do commit, it’s hard to change your mind, for better or worse. [1] X Research source Mercury is the planet associated with communication and travel, just like its namesake, the Greek messenger god. Therefore, your Mercury sign refers to how you communicate, process ideas and info, and move through the world. [2] X Research source Famous Taurus Mercuries include Sarah Michelle Gellar, Cher, Lenny Kravitz, George Lucas, and Renée Zellweger."

      "title": "Slow and steady",
      "content": "Slow and steady Like the tortoise from Aesop’s fable, you’re slow-moving and thoughtful, but dedicated and unflagging. You accomplish what you set out to do, in the way you say you’ll do it. Of all the signs, Tauruses are perhaps the most reliable, and as a Mercury in Taurus, you’re considerate and slow to speak, both because you want to make sure you know how you feel before speaking, and because you want to make sure you express yourself clearly and thoughtfully. Some people may think you’re lazy because you take your time, but anyone who really knows you knows you’re a determined, loyal worker and friend. Who better to rely on than a Taurus Mercury?"

      "title": "Decisive",
      "content": "Decisive You may be slow and deliberate as you consider different ideas and options, but once you make a decision, you stick to your guns. As a Taurus, you’re famously reluctant to change your mind, which naturally makes you slow to speak and commit to things. [3] X Research source But once you do commit to something, you see it through. This is often a positive trait, but your stubbornness can sometimes influence you to be closed off to other perspectives and ideas. Practice being open-minded and letting in new viewpoints, if not to change your mind, then to strengthen your communication with loved ones and show them you value their perspectives."

      "title": "Realistic",
      "content": "Realistic With Taurus being an earth sign, you like to keep your feet on the ground. As a Taurus Mercury, you walk a fine line between logic and emotion, and don’t tend to over-rely on either when you make decisions. Friends likely come to you for sage advice that’s simultaneously supportive and no-nonsense. [4] X Research source You’re by no means a sourpuss, but you’re not prone to running away with your imagination either. You tend to see things as they are (and when you don’t, your stubbornness may make you believe you’re seeing things “as they are” anyway)."

      "title": "Taurus Mercuries are dedicated, loyal workers.",
      "content": "Taurus Mercuries are dedicated, loyal workers. As a Taurus Mercury, you benefit from Taurus’s strength, dependability, and consideration and Mercury’s flexibility and effective communication. The result? A reliable, solid worker with potential to thrive in your field. And since Taurus is also the sign of wealth, your hard work is likely to pay off—literally. Good jobs for Taurus Mercuries include jobs requiring dedicated labor, like agriculture or factory work, or where they can reap the benefits of their good communication skills and practical attitudes, such as a career in business. Though Taurus Mercuries tend toward a no-nonsense, feet-on-the-ground way of life, Taurus is still ruled by Venus, the planet of love and aesthetics, so Taurus Mercuries may make gifted artists.

      "title": "You tend to be very committed in relationships.",
      "content": "You tend to be very committed in relationships. Tauruses are headstrong and committed as well as homebodies, so you likely view romantic relationships through the lens of domesticity and family life (even if the family is just you 2). You gravitate towards partners who you can imagine being with for the long haul: people who love to nest, who love to beautify their living space, who love staying in on date night and cuddling under the blanket. [6] X Research source And since you’re a Taurus Mercury, you know how to resolve conflict with your partner when it arises: your natural sagacity and consideration are assets to your romantic relationships—however, your stubbornness is less of an asset, so when it rears its head in an argument, practice pausing and really considering your partner’s viewpoint. Because these signs are so sensual, sex with a Taurus Mercury is a multi-sensory event. They know just what buttons to push, but they're also all about comfort and coziness, so expect passionate, intense sex followed by lots of cuddling."

      "title": "When Mercury is in Taurus, it’s a time for clarity, focus, and stubbornness.",
      "content": "When Mercury is in Taurus, it’s a time for clarity, focus, and stubbornness. If you’re prone to flights of fancy or are having trouble making a decision about something, Mercury in Taurus may come as a relief. As the planet Mercury transitions into the constellation of Taurus, expect to become more focused and to have a strong grip on reality that’ll help you better understand how you feel. [7] X Research source You’ll be less prone to being swayed by others, for better or worse: while Mercury in Taurus makes us all a little more sure of ourselves and our perspectives, if you don’t watch your stubbornness levels, you may find yourself shutting down alternative ideas and viewpoints. At its best, Mercury in Taurus is a time to abandon drama and be direct, purposeful, and calm in our interactions with others, including those who disagree with us."

      "title": "Expect communication and travel snafus.",
      "content": "Expect communication and travel snafus. Since Mercury governs communication and transportation (like the Greek messenger god for whom it was named), when this planet is in retrograde, this poses a threat to our communication and travel. Anticipate texts not being delivered or being misconstrued, flights being canceled, and general confusion. [8] X Research source “Mercury in retrograde” refers to the illusion from Earth that Mercury is moving backwards, and according to astrology, this means that the properties associated with that planet may be inverted, delayed, or corrupted. Mercury goes into retrograde 3 or 4 times a year for about 3 or 4 weeks at a time, each time in a different constellation. When Mercury’s in retrograde, hold off on important travel and delay heavy conversations if you can."

      "title": "Watch out for financial mishaps.",
      "content": "Watch out for financial mishaps. Because Taurus rules money and finances, when Mercury is retrograde in Taurus, be wary of taking any financial risks, as they could backfire. Mercury in retrograde is a time of chaos and unpredictability—2 things you don’t really want to associate with your financial health. Avoid quitting your job or making any major financial moves at this time, like buying a house or planning that big trip to Atlantic City. Play it safe during this period. Instead, pause and reconsider your financial status and spending habits. What’s going right for you financially? What do you need to change? Do all your planning now so that once Mercury is direct again, you’re ready to make your moves."
