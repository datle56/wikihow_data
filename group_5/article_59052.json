      "content": "Scrape as much wax off as you can. If there’s a lot of wax on your item, use a butter knife to get as much off as possible. [1] X Research source This method works best when trying to clean small items made of plastic, glass, ceramic, steel, vinyl, cast iron, and marble. [2] X Research source Avoid using this method of removing wax on fabric or clothing, as scraping it could drive it deeper into the fibers and make it harder to clean up."

      "title": "Put your item in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Put your item in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. Placing your item in a cold environment will harden the wax, making it easier to remove. If you have a chest or deep freezer, you may even be able to freeze large items, like candlesticks, to help remove the wax. [3] X Research source If the item is too large to fit in the freezer, wrap ice cubes or ice packs in an absorbent towel and apply them to the wax to cool it. The longer you freeze the item, the easier it’ll likely be to remove the wax. Check to see if the wax has hardened by looking at its color. If it’s turned darker and more opaque, it’s probably cooled."

      "title": "Chip off the frozen wax with a butter knife.",
      "content": "Chip off the frozen wax with a butter knife. Hold a butter knife parallel to the item that the wax is on, then slowly scrape or pop it off. The wax will loosen, flaking and chipping away with ease. If you don’t want to risk damaging your item with the knife, use a credit card instead. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your item to remove any wax residue.",
      "content": "Wash your item to remove any wax residue. Gently scrub your item with an all-purpose cleaner and a toothbrush to remove any leftover wax. This is especially important if you’re removing wax from a household item, like a glass or dish. [5] X Research source If you’re cleaning wax off furniture, simply wipe it down with a clean cloth."

      "content": "Use ice and a cleaning solvent on carpet. Wrap an ice cube in a plastic bag and rub it on top of the ice until it’s hard. Use a butter knife to scrape the wax off as much of the surface as possible, then spritz the area with a carpet cleaning spray . Scrub the area with a paper towel to remove any residue. [6] X Research source For a deeper clean, shampoo the carpet after removing the wax."

      "content": "Get wax off wood flooring with an ice cube and buff away waxy residue. Wrap an ice cube in a plastic bag and rub it against the wax on the floor until it’s hard. Use a credit card or a dull knife to scrape up most of the wax. When you’re finished, buff the wood with a chamois cloth to remove any residue or scratches. [7] X Research source Wood flooring can get scratched easily, so be careful not to gouge your scraping instrument into the floor."

      "title": "Use mineral spirits and ice to wipe away waxy residue on vinyl.",
      "content": "Use mineral spirits and ice to wipe away waxy residue on vinyl. If you spilled some wax on vinyl flooring, rub an ice cube wrapped in plastic on top of the wax until it hardens. Use a plastic credit card to scrape the wax up (avoid using a metal butter knife, which can scratch the surface), then dab a cotton ball in mineral spirits and use that to wipe up the residue. [8] X Research source Heat can warp vinyl flooring, and chemical solvents can discolor it. It’s best to stick to gentle methods that aren’t too strong for vinyl floors. Make sure your space is well-ventilated before using mineral spirits. Mineral spirits can be toxic, and opening a window or propping up a fan can minimize your exposure. [9] X Research source Wear gloves when handling or cleaning with mineral spirits, as it can cause rashes or (in severe cases) burns."

When you’re done, mix up a little bit of water and detergent, then wipe the area clean. [10] X Research source Be careful: your tile will be slippery until the water dries."

      "content": "Use a vinegar mixture to remove wax on delicate surfaces. Wood and vinyl don’t do well with sharp tools scraping against their surfaces. To avoid scratching your floors, mix 1 part water with 1 part white vinegar and soak a cloth in it. Use the cloth to dampen the wax and peel it up slowly without damaging the surface. [11] X Research source Vinegar also won’t discolor light-colored wood."

      "content": "Heat wax on counters, tables, or other hard surfaces with a blow dryer. Sometimes, there’s no way you can put something in the freezer or cool it down enough to scrape the wax off. If that’s the case, try using heat instead. [12] X Research source Set your blow dryer to a hot setting and aim it directly at the stain. Keep the blow dryer a few inches from the surface to avoid scorching the material. Try not to blow the wax around—it's easier to wipe up if it's all in one puddle. [13] X Research source Never use heat on glass (which can break) or synthetic fabrics (which can melt). Avoid using heat on fabric, as it can melt the wax and spread the stain."

If there’s still wax left over, use a plastic credit card to help lift it up.

Squirt or spray an all-purpose cleaner on the area and wipe it up with a damp rag or sponge. If you're working on a fragile surface (like a fine wooden tabletop), use a gentle cleaner to avoid damaging the material. [15] X Research source If there’s still more wax left on the surface, try repeating the removal process until all the wax is lifted."

Remove wax from clothing or other fabric items by setting your iron to medium heat and placing a few paper towels over the wax. Gently rub the iron back and forth over the waxy area to gradually melt it. As the towels soak up the wax, replace them with new ones until all of the wax is gone. [16] X Research source Make sure you use white paper towels without any designs to avoid transferring color to your fabric."
