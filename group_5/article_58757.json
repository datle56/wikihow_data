      "content": "Sony claims that either placement is fine. According to Sony’s official PS5 Quick Start Guide , the official PS5 base can be used to secure the console in either a vertical or horizontal position. [1] X Research source In an interview conducted with Yasuhiro Otori (PlayStation’s Manager of the Mechanical Design Department) before the PS5’s release, Otori explains that the console can be safely placed in a vertical or horizontal orientation without damaging the cooling system. [2] X Research source The cooling system in question is a liquid cooling system that’s attached to the PS5’s Accelerated Process Unit (APU). The liquid metal is corralled in place by a secure, spongey seal that prevents the metal from touching the APU. The APU is an important console part that allows the PS5 to process graphics and video.

      "content": "Some claim a vertical placement can damage a PS5, but this isn’t proven. In recent years (notably in August 2022 and January 2023), people have claimed (like French repair gurus Ben Montana and 68 Logic) that keeping the PS5 upright allowed for liquid metal in the cooling system to leak out and damage internal parts of the PS5. [4] X Research source The Verdict: All the evidence that condemns the vertical PS5 orientation is anecdotal and not backed or confirmed by Sony. Ultimately, it’s up to you how you choose to set up your PS5 . Plenty of gamers have perfectly intact PS5 consoles that are stored vertically, but it never hurts to be careful. Keep in mind: While Sony offers PS5 warranties, these warranties are voided if you open up and/or alter your PS5 without the help of official repair channels . [5] X Research source If you suspect your PS5 could be damaged, always get a Sony-certified professional to inspect it."

      "content": "Set the PS5 sideways and arrange the base along the bottom. Flip the console so it’s sitting on its narrow, more tapered edge. The exposed screw hole should be aligned vertically and facing you. Then, line up the central screw hole on the base with the exposed screw hole on the console—the base’s hinges should naturally tuck into the wider end of the PS5. [11] X Research source"

Using a coin or a flathead screwdriver, carefully tighten the screw in place to secure your PS5. It’s now ready to be placed base-side-down in your gaming area! [12] X Research source To detach the mounted base, simply undo the screw and tuck it back into the bottom of the base. Put the screw cover back in its original position."
