      "content": "Look at the clothes in your closet that you hardly ever wear. You may not wear them because they are revealing, well, revealing can be sexy! Maybe you don't feel comfortable in some of your clothes because they are not what people are used to seeing you in - if your sexy outfit is for a situation where you're meeting new people, take the opportunity to make a sexy first impression. Something you've dismissed as too small or too big might flatter you now, try it on! You can use a belt to define your waist in bigger clothes or if things won't do up but still look good, a belt can keep them in place."

Feeling sexy can make you look sexy. If you've got a favorite pair of jeans, jacket or button--up shirt or blouse that you feel really good in, you can use that in an outfit you feel good and sexy in. Try ironing your jeans with a crease to make them more flattering and teaming them with dressy shoes. Wear your blouse or shirt with more buttons undone than usual. Try wearing only underwear under your jacket."

      "content": "Re-purpose clothes. Wear a long top as a dress or try a coat or a long jacket as a dress, put plain leggings on underneath it you feel exposed. Try a man's over sized shirt as a dress, if you've got any in your wardrobe. Try wearing a skirt, with a belt, around your chest to make a long top or a short dress. If you're very daring try tucking in the sleeve of a cardigan and wearing it buttoned it around you waist and legs as a skirt."

      "content": "Cut old t-shirts shorter to make them look sexy, shorten the sleeves, or cut the neckline for a more interesting look. You can also gather the fabric into loose (diagonal) folds and sew them into place at the side seam to make it more fitted. This works best with slightly stretchy fabrics."

      "content": "Wear a mini skirt that has been lying around forever. If you are self-conscious about your legs, wear it with a pair of leggings. Make sure the leggings end at the slimmest part of your leg for a flattering appearance. If you want, you can pair them with heels to make your legs appear longer. Team your mini skirt with some lacy tights or stockings or a simple pair of nude pantyhose if you dont want to be bare-legged."

      "content": "Check out your nightwear, swimwear and underwear. You might have a pretty camisole top you usually wear under a dress, try wearing it with fitted jeans, heels and a jacket or shrug. A bikini or tankini top could work under a floaty-blouse. Use a pretty slip or skimpy night dress as the base of your outfit, if you're very bold. Chance are, you will be the only person who knows that you're wearing any thing out of the ordinary."

      "title": "Wear underwear that makes you feel good, or, look good.",
      "content": "Wear underwear that makes you feel good, or, look good. Shapewear can be a great base for a sexy outfit making most dresses, skirts, trousers etc more flattering but isn't very sexy in and of itself. If you don't want to wear shapewear, choose underwear you feel good in. Try silk, satin or lace underwear in a shade you love. Your sexy outfit will look and feel better if you've got something nicer than your regular everyday underwear on underneath."

      "title": "Think about how you team textures.",
      "content": "Think about how you team textures. You might usually wear your cashmere sweater with sturdy denim, team it with satin trousers or a silky dress instead. Satin, silk and lace can all be sexy, mix them together for a sexy outfit or team them with something dressier than you usually would."
