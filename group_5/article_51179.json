Topical antibiotics are often combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce the chances of becoming resistant to the antibiotics.

You can make a simple warm compress by soaking a clean washcloth in warm to hot water (but be careful not to burn yourself). Apply a warm compress for just a few minutes at a time, and repeat the process as often as necessary throughout the day. For ice therapy, apply an ice pack or ice cubes wrapped in a cloth to the blind pimple for no more than 10 minutes at a time for up to 4 times each day."
