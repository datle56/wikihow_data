This GitHub is home to a third-party application entitled Deceive, which enables players to appear offline within games that do not otherwise allow you to do so. Valorant includes three options for player status: Online - players who are running the game and actively playing. Away - players who are running the game but have gone idle. Offline - players who are not currently running the game. Players cannot update their status manually within Valorant."
