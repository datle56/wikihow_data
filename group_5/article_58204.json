      "content": "Drive on to a toll motorway. These motorways are marked with the word \"PÃ©age.\" You should see this on signs for the motorway before you enter it, so you know you're getting on a pay road. Most major motorways in France have tolls, though, so keep that in mind. [1] X Research source Every vehicle on the road is subject to a toll. The main motorways that don't have tolls are bypasses around big cities."

      "content": "Grab your ticket as you enter the motorway. The French system is a closed one, so you enter a tollbooth right as you get on the motorway. Hit the button in the booth and pick up the ticket to take with you. [2] X Research source Don't lose the ticket, as it shows how far you've driven on the tollway. If you lose it, you'll likely need to pay the highest fee for the road."

      "content": "Enter a lane marked by a green arrow or credit card symbol to pay with a credit card. You'll enter the tollbooth when the toll road runs out or when you exit the toll motorway. As you approach, identify the lanes that take credit cards. Typically, these are marked with electronic symbols at the top. One symbol looks like a series of credit cards stacked together. Alternatively, find the lane with a single green arrow pointing down, which indicates all forms of payment are accepted. [3] X Research source Avoid the lane that just has a stylized \"t\" and a number next to it, as that's for the automatic payment system. The credit card lanes accept CB, Visa, Eurocard Mastercard, Confinoga, DKV, EuroShell, Essocard, Total GR, and Eurotraffic. [4] X Research source"

Avoid the lanes that just have credit card symbols or stylized \"T\" symbols, as they won't accept cash. [5] X Research source If you have a foreign credit card, you may want to pay with cash all the time. Sometimes, the machines have trouble with cards from other countries. [6] X Research source Euros are the preferred currency, but some areas accept Swiss francs, British pounds, and US dollars, as well as checks. [7] X Research source"

Attach the pass to the top of your windshield on the inside of your vehicle as per the instructions. Then, you can go through the toll without stopping and your account will automatically be charged. [10] X Research source To purchase a tag, visit https://www.emovis-tag.co.uk/ . The initial cost is about 40 EUR in 2019. The tag itself is 20 EUR, which is refundable if you return it to the company after you're done. It has a 6 EUR annual fee plus a 5 EUR fee for each month you use it, up to 10 EUR in a year. This initial fee also puts money in your toll account to cover the tolls you go through."

      "content": "Expect your tolls to be higher for heavier vehicles. French tolls are divided into 5 classes. The first class is \"lighter vehicles,\" which includes all sedans. To fall into this class, your vehicle and anything you're towing must be under 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall, plus the car and the towing vehicle can only weigh 3,500 tonnes (3,900 sh tn) together. The next class is \"intermediate vehicles,\" where the height of the vehicle and anything you're towing must be between 2 to 3 metres (6.6 to 9.8 ft); the weight for this class is the same as lighter vehicles. Class 3 is for trucks and buses with 2 axles. Vehicles over 3 metres (9.8 ft) tall and 3,500 tonnes (3,900 sh tn) fall into this category, unless they have more than 2 axles. Class 4 is for trucks and buses with 3 or more axles. Class 5 is motorcycles and tricycles. Every class is progressively more expensive with the exception of class 5, which is the cheapest."

Toll roads range anywhere from about 0.03 EUR to 0.53 EUR per 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) for lighter vehicles, depending on the road. However, the high end is the exception rather than the rule, so aim for the 0.10 EUR per 1 kilometre (0.62 mi), and you should get a good idea of what your vehicle will cost. [14] X Research source Keep in mind, the cost is about double for intermediate vehicles."
