      "title": "Take the measurements of your radiator.",
      "content": "Take the measurements of your radiator. Measure the depth, width and height of the radiator, taking care to add a couple of inches or centimeters to the dimensions. The idea is to make the cover large enough to easily slide over the radiator. For example, a radiator that is 10 inches (25cm) deep, 20 inches (50cm) tall, and 30 inches (76cm) wide, you might need 12 inches (30cm) clearance in depth, 22 inches (55cm) clearance in height, and 32 inches (81cm) clearance in width. This will give you a snug but still comfortable cover for your radiator."

      "content": "Go to your local hardware supply store and select a material to use for your cover. Lots of homeowners prefer the warm touch of wood over their radiator, but that doesn't need to be the case. Here are some options you might consider: Fiberboard. Fiberboard, or MDF (medium density fiberboard) is a combination of sawdust and resins packed tightly together. It is inexpensive, takes paint well, and won't require miters that plywoods require. On the downside, it doesn't take wood stains especially well. [1] X Research source Veneered plywood. Veneered plywood is incredibly sturdy and beautiful unfinished, but also takes a wood stain really nicely. On the flip side, it is considerably more expensive than MDF, and probably requires some mitering on the edges of the plywood so that you don't see the center of the plywood core."

      "title": "Find a sheet of grating to use in combination with your wood.",
      "content": "Find a sheet of grating to use in combination with your wood. Because the heat from the radiator needs to escape the box cover, many covers have detailed sheet metal with small holes. Choose a piece of sheet metal, like a stamped aluminum sheet, with a detail that suits both the rest of the cover and the room in which the cover will be placed."

      "title": "Get some cove molding for the grate.",
      "content": "Get some cove molding for the grate. Cove molding is relatively inexpensive and will go a long way in making your final piece look professional and impressive. If you don't have a miter saw (or a miter box and a handsaw) at home to cut the molding at a 45° angle with, be sure to get your molding cut before you leave the hardware supply store."

      "content": "Finally, choose a piece of sheet metal that will direct heat back out into the room. This piece of sheet metal can be galvanized steel, for example. You'll use it on the wall behind the cover to radiate heat back into the room and supercharge the efficiency of the radiator. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider cutting the panels of your cover at the hardware supply store.",
      "content": "Consider cutting the panels of your cover at the hardware supply store. If you don't have a skill or circular saw, a jig, or a workspace that will make cutting your wood and sheet metal easy, an easy way of getting your materials cut is to have them processed wherever you buy them. Most hardware supply stores will cut your materials for free if you supply them with the dimensions."

      "title": "Start cutting the two side panels.",
      "content": "Start cutting the two side panels. Double-check your measurements, clamp your wood down to a workbench, and measure two points at the top and bottom of the panel to ensure a straight line. Place a template or jig across the line to ensure a straight cut. Clamp the jig down to the workbench and move your circular saw across the wood slowly. If you're cutting from two smaller pieces of plywood or MDF and those pieces are identical, stack them on top of each other so that you only have to make one cut to produce both side panels.

      "title": "Cut the front panel.",
      "content": "Cut the front panel. Again, add 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7 cm) of extra room for clearance. Clamp your template or jig down and measure a top and a bottom point to ensure a straight line. Start the saw and move it over the panel slowly to produce an even cut of wood."

    {
      "title": "Cut the top.",
      "content": "Cut the top. Using the same technique, plan on cutting the top ½ inch (1cm) wider than the sides and 1 (2.5cm) inch longer than the width of the front. This will give the top an elegant differentiation."

      "title": "Decide how large you want your grate opening to be on the front panel.",
      "content": "Decide how large you want your grate opening to be on the front panel. Depending on how large your radiator is, draw straight lines that are between 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 cm) away from the sides and top, and slightly more (4 to 6 inches) from the bottom. This will make the screen grating the centerpiece of the front panel. If you wish to have grated openings on the side panels as well as the front panel, follow the exact same procedure."

      "title": "Cut the rectangle from the middle of the front panel using a plunge cut.",
      "content": "Cut the rectangle from the middle of the front panel using a plunge cut. Because the rectangle you want to cut out of the front panel is in the middle of the panel, you'll need to use this trick to preserve the outer framing. Place down your template to guide your circular saw along the straight line. Position the saw onto the template, with the saw's blade elevated in the air. Pull the guide up from the circular saw, turn the saw on, and slowly plunge the saw into the panel, making sure to leave a little bit of space on the corners. Slowly pull the circular saw along the line until you're about 1 (2.5cm) inch from the perpendicular line. Do the exact same for the side panels if you choose to fit them with grating."

      "content": "Measure the rectangle in the front panel and cut your cove molding to fit in all four sides. Cut two 45° inside miters in each piece of molding, so that the four pieces will form a mitered rectangle (reminiscent of a picture frame) when fitted into the front panel."

      "content": "Measure, cut, and fit the grate. Place the metal grating on the inside of the front panel. Leaving at least 1 and ½ inch clearance on each side of the center rectangle, cut the grading using a straight edge and a level as a guide. After placing the rectangular grating over the inside of the front panel, secure in place with some staples."

      "content": "Address the aesthetics of the radiator cover. Painting or staining the panels will help the radiator cover to blend into the room with relative ease. The choice of color may be the wall color, which aids in making the radiator cover more or less blend into the wall, or picking up one of the secondary colors in the room can help make the cover look like another accessory. For a more dramatic statement, consider painting stripes or other geometric designs on the cover to match patterns in the draperies, pillows or other elements within the room. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal the finish on the radiator cover.",
      "content": "Seal the finish on the radiator cover. Once the paint or stain is dry, use a clear lacquer or sealant to protect the finish of the piece. Allow the sealant to dry before moving the finished radiator cover into position. This will help minimize scratching and wear and tear on the cover from one year to the next, making it possible to get several years of use before needing to repaint the accessory."
