This is valid for up to six months. It can be renewed, and may be transferred from one car to another in case other people may be driving you around. Blue Placard - If your condition is permanent or will last longer than a year or so, you may apply for the permanent blue placard. This is renewable every four years, and is transferable from one vehicle to another as needed. Permanent license plate. The license plate, like the blue placard, is for someone with a permanent disability. It does not need to be renewed alone, but is treated as any other car registration. The license plate stays on the car and is not transferable if you travel in different vehicles."
