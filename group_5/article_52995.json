      "content": "Take a deep breath. Taking a deep breath can help you keep calm when your little sister is really getting on your nerves. Before you react, close your eyes and count to ten. Focus on your breathing to slow your heart rate and avoid yelling or reacting poorly. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't show your frustration.",
      "content": "Don't show your frustration. If your little sister is intentionally annoying you, showing your anger will only encourage her to continue her behavior. To hide how you're feeling , try not to yell, ball your hands into fists, or slam the door. If you look unbothered, your sister will eventually get bored and find something else to do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't hit her.",
      "content": "Don't hit her. You might feel really, really mad—so mad that you want to hit your little sister. It’s okay to be frustrated, but violence is never the answer. Remember that you’re bigger and older than she is, so she could get really hurt if you hit her. You’d also get in serious trouble with your parents. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Think before you speak.",
      "content": "Think before you speak. When you're frustrated, it can be easy to say something mean that you'll feel bad about later. Instead, take a deep breath and really think about what you want to say . This will give you a chance to calm down and prevent you from saying anything you don't mean. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk away.",
      "content": "Walk away. If your little sister is being really annoying and nothing you do seems to help, leave the room. Go somewhere else and do something that’s just for you—read a book or play with your favorite toys. Some time alone can help you calm down. If your little sister follows you into another room, leave the house to take a walk or go for a drive if you can. That way she can't follow, and you get time to cool down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell her what bothers you.",
      "content": "Tell her what bothers you. If your little sister doesn’t realize how much the things she does bother you, she might keep doing them. At a time when you’re not mad, explain to her why her actions bother you. If she’s a lot younger than you, try to use simple language that she can understand. [4] X Research source You could say something like, \"Amy, when you come into my room and touch my things, it really bothers me. I don't mind if you touch it, but I'd really like you to ask for my permission first, especially since some of my things are breakable. Will you ask from now on?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Set some ground rules.",
      "content": "Set some ground rules. If your little sister constantly does things that bother you, sit down together and decide on some rules. Tell your parents about the rules so they can help you both follow them. [5] X Research source For example, if your little sister takes your things without asking, one of your rules could be, “You have to ask for permission before you can touch or use my things. If you don’t ask permission, I can tell Mom and Dad.”"

      "title": "Don’t go out of your way to be mean.",
      "content": "Don’t go out of your way to be mean. You might be tempted to be mean to her, even when she’s not annoying you. Don’t tease her or mistreat her in any way. If you do, you’ll get the reputation as the mean older sibling, and it can make your relationship worse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize when you do something wrong.",
      "content": "Apologize when you do something wrong. If your sister gets on your nerves, the odds are you sometimes annoy her, too. No one is perfect, so if you’ve done something to hurt her feelings, apologize . Not only will this make her feel better, but it will help her become more open to apologizing to you, too.

      "content": "Deal with feelings of jealousy. If you know you don’t get along with your little sisters because of jealousy, taking some time to deal with those feelings can help improve your relationship. When you’re feeling a little jealous of your little sister, remember that you’re different people with different talents and interests. [7] X Research source Think about what makes you special. For instance, maybe you always win races at school, or maybe you get really good grades. To handle jealousy , remember that you’re older than your sister. While it may sometimes seem unfair, she has different needs than you do and often needs your parents’ help. Consider this a good thing! It means you’re mature and your parents trust you to do more things on your own."

      "title": "Talk to your parents.",
      "content": "Talk to your parents. If you’re constantly frustrated by your sister, talk to your parents about it. They can help you figure out what you're feeling and how to handle it. They can also plan to spend more time with you if you feel like your sister gets more of their attention. [8] X Research source Talking to your parents about your feelings can be scary, but remember they love you and want to help you. Try starting the conversation by saying something like “I know my sister needs more help than I do, but I’d feel better if we spent more time together.” If you’ve tried talking to your sister and nothing works, try asking your parents for help by saying something like “I’ve tried talking to my sister about how her actions bother me, but she still does the same thing. Can you help me get through to her?”"

      "content": "Compliment her. When your little sister does something great, tell her! She probably wants your attention, so when you compliment her, she’ll feel loved and appreciated. You’ll also probably feel good about making her so happy. [9] X Research source"
