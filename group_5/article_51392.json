      "content": "Find your phase angle. So you now have your hypotenuse which is your impedance. You also have your adjacent side which is your true power and you have your opposite side which is your reactive power. So to find the angle you can use any the laws stated earlier. For example we use the Tangent Law which is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side (Reactive/True). [4] X Research source You should have an equation that looks like this: (60/60 = 1)"

      "content": "Take the inverse of the tangent and acquire your Phase Angle. The inverse tangent is a button on your calculator. So you now take the inverse tangent of the equation in the previous step and this will give you your phase angle. Your equation should look something like this: tan ‾ ¹ (1) = Phase Angle. So your answer should be 45°."

The formula used for calculating current is Voltage divided by Impedance which numerically looks like this: 120V/84.85Ω. You should now have an answer around 1.414A.

To calculate apparent power you do not need to use the Pythagorean Theorem because your hypotenuse was considered your impedance. Remembering that apparent power is in the units of Volt-Amps we can calculate apparent power using the formula: Voltage squared divided by your total impedance. [6] X Research source Your equation should look like this: 120V²/84.85Ω. You should now get an answer of 169.71VA. ( 120²/84.85 = 169.71 )"

True power which is in the units of a Watt is calculated by multiplying your current squared (1.414²) by the resistance (60Ω) in your circuit. Your equation should look like this: 1.414² x 60 = 119.96 W."

[8] X Research source You have calculated this information in the previous steps. Your wattage is equal to 119.96W and your Volt-Amps are equal to 169.71VA. The formula for your power factor, also represented as Pf, is Watts divided by Volt-Amps. You should have an equation that looks something like this: 119.96W/169.71VA = 0.71Pf This can also be expressed as a percentage therefore you multiply 0.71 by 100 giving you a power factor of 71%.
