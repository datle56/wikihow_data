If you don’t have a cell phone, walk into an establishment, tell them you’re being followed, and ask if you can use their phone to call the police. If they won’t let you use the phone, ask them to call for you. Tell the police someone is following you and you are scared for your life.

By being in a group, you may deter the person that is following you from continuing to do so. In addition, your friends will make you feel safe and could help defend you. Ask your friends to meet you in a public area, like on the street, in a bar, or in a restaurant. Request that a friend picks you up in a public location as soon as possible."

By honking or simply yelling “help me,” you could both scare off the offender and get someone to come to your assistance. [1] X Research source If you’re in a car, consider honking and turning on your emergency lights. This will alert passersby and emergency service personnel that you need assistance. Remember that while making noise could alert others to the fact that you are in danger, it could also anger the person following you and cause them to hurt you."

      "title": "Cross the street or turn.",
      "content": "Cross the street or turn. Use the first safe opportunity to cross the street or turn. Doing this will make it harder for the person to follow you.

Do this until you think you’ve lost them."

      "title": "Stop frequently at unexpected places.",
      "content": "Stop frequently at unexpected places. If crossing streets and turning doesn’t lose the person, you might be able to lose the person by stopping several times at places the person wouldn’t expect you to stop. Avoid the route you’d normally take home and make your trip home as complicated as possible. [5] X Research source Stop to get a cup of coffee or a soft drink somewhere.

By moving fast, you might succeed in losing them and getting away where you’ve previously failed. When planning your getaway: Don’t box yourself in traffic. For example, at a stop light don’t pull all the way up so your bumper is close to the car in front of you. Leave yourself room to drive around the car in front of you. Avoid walking down any corridors, alleyways, or streets where there are only one or two ways in or out. The more open the street, the easier it will be for you to get to safety.
