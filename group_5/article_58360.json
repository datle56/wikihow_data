      "title": "Say “Jinx!” when you and a friend say something simultaneously.",
      "content": "Say “Jinx!” when you and a friend say something simultaneously. Jinx is simple! Any time you and a friend say the same word at the same time, the first person to say “Jinx!” starts the game, and is the jinxer, and the other person is jinxed. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t speak until the jinxer says your name, if you were jinxed.",
      "content": "Don’t speak until the jinxer says your name, if you were jinxed. The person who didn’t say “Jinx” has to remain silent for the rest of the day. [2] X Research source They can only talk again when the jinxer says their name. In some versions, the jinxed person can say “ebbs” to cancel the jinx, but it only works once a day. Keep in mind that not everyone might want to play. If someone keeps talking anyway, take that as a sign they’re not interested, and move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay a penalty if you talk before you’re unjinxed.",
      "content": "Pay a penalty if you talk before you’re unjinxed. In some versions, the person who called the jinx says, “Jinx! You owe me a Coke,” and the jinxed person has to buy them a soda. Or, they must give the jinxer a soda if they speak before the jinx is broken. Some say the jinxer can lightly punch the jinxed person if they speak before they’re unjinxed. Only “punch” your close friends, and make it a light tap! The point of Jinx is to have fun, not hurt anyone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play a variation, like Double Jinx or American Jinx.",
      "content": "Play a variation, like Double Jinx or American Jinx. If two people both called “Jinx!” at the same time, you can then say, “Double jinx!” to win the tie, or even “Triple jinx!” if you both say “double jinx” at the same time. Then, the jinxed person can only speak if the jinxer says their full name. Other variations include: American Jinx, where instead of just “Jinx!” you call, “American Jinx! Touch wood!” The first player to touch a bit of wood gets to lightly punch the other person. Some people say, “Jinx personal jinx,” then count to 10, and the jinxed person has to say the jinxer’s full name before 10 to stop the jinx."

      "title": "Gather 2-5 players and decide who goes first.",
      "content": "Gather 2-5 players and decide who goes first. The board game Jinx is played with 2-5 people, each trying to place pawns on the board to make a row of 3, like Tic-Tac-Toe. Gather a few friends, then, play Rock, Paper, Scissors or flip a coin to see who goes first. After the first player’s turn, players take turns clockwise around the table. [3] X Research source Or, take turns rolling both dice, and see who gets the highest number. This player goes first."

    {
      "title": "Roll the dice and play a pawn on the corresponding space.",
      "content": "Roll the dice and play a pawn on the corresponding space. On your turn, roll both dice and examine the numbers. Place one of your pawns on a grid square that corresponds with the number. For example, if you roll a 2 and a 4, place a pawn either in the square that’s 2 columns over and 4 rows down, or the one that’s 4 columns over and 2 rows down. [4] X Research source Notice that you always have 2 choices for where to place the pawn (unless you roll doubles). Choose wisely! After you place your pawn, pass the dice to the player on your left and let them take their turn."

    {
      "title": "Replace another player’s piece if you roll an occupied square.",
      "content": "Replace another player’s piece if you roll an occupied square. If you roll the dice and the numbers indicate a square on which another player has already placed a pawn, you may remove their pawn and put yours down instead. This is called a “Jinx!” Give their pawn back so they can play it on a future turn. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Move a pawn 1 space if you roll doubles, or a sum of 7.",
      "content": "Move a pawn 1 space if you roll doubles, or a sum of 7. If you roll two of the same number, or your roll adds up to 7, first place a new pawn in an appropriate space. Then, move any of your pawns 1 square in any direction. You may only move to a square that isn’t already occupied by a pawn. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove all your pieces if you jinx yourself.",
      "content": "Remove all your pieces if you jinx yourself. If you roll the dice and they tell you to play a pawn on a space where you already played a pawn, you just jinxed yourself! Remove all your pieces and end your turn. [7] X Research source Remember that you often have a choice between 2 squares—pick the square that doesn’t contain your pawn, if possible."

      "title": "Win the game by lining up 3 pawns in a row on the board.",
      "content": "Win the game by lining up 3 pawns in a row on the board. Jinx is a lot like Tic-Tac-Toe—the first player to place 3 pawns in a row, in any direction (including diagonal), wins! Time to clear the board and start a new game—the winner of the last game goes first. [8] X Research source If you like, keep track of how many games each player has won, and race to see who can rack up 5 wins first!"
