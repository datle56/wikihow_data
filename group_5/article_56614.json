      "title": "Stuff newspaper in the bottom of the chimney.",
      "content": "Stuff newspaper in the bottom of the chimney. Crumple the newspaper loosely and stuff it in the bottom of the chimney so it’s full but not tightly packed. Packing the chimney too tightly may suffocate the flame. [1] X Research source Try adding 1 teaspoon (4.92 mL) of cooking oil to every 2 sheets of newspaper before you crumple them into a compact, but not tight, ball. The oil helps the paper burn a little longer. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the chimney on the cooking grate and light the newspaper.",
      "content": "Place the chimney on the cooking grate and light the newspaper. Use a long match or stick lighter to light three sides of the paper so it burns evenly. The chimney draws fresh air as the paper burns to help the charcoal burn from the bottom up. [3] X Research source Wear heat-safe rubber gloves to protect your skin."

    {
      "title": "Let the charcoal burn until it’s white-gray with ash.",
      "content": "Let the charcoal burn until it’s white-gray with ash. Keep an eye on the charcoal at the top of the chimney. When it turns a greyish white, the charcoal is ready. It may take 15-30 minutes to reach the right temperature. [4] X Research source It takes about 10-15 minutes for the coals to get to high heat and 25-30 minutes to get to medium heat."

    {
      "title": "Wear heat-safe gloves to pour the charcoal into the grill.",
      "content": "Wear heat-safe gloves to pour the charcoal into the grill. Lift the grill’s grate and set it to the side. Then, use heat-safe rubber gloves to pour the charcoal from the chimney into the bed of the grill. Arrange the charcoal with tongs and replace the cooking grate on top. The charcoal will be very hot, so be careful not to spill. [5] X Research source The experts at Julian Beer Company recommend using tongs to evenly spread the coals onto the grill's bottom. Or, spread the coals out to different areas, so you have hotter zones, which will be directly underneath the coals."

    {
      "title": "Group the coals in a pyramid shape at the bottom of the grill.",
      "content": "Group the coals in a pyramid shape at the bottom of the grill. When you stack them this way, the heat rises from the bottom. The coals help light each other, spreading the heat from one coal to the next. [6] X Research source Pour out enough charcoal or briquettes to form an even layer on the bottom of your grill. Use more coal in cold or wet weather for a longer burn."

    {
      "title": "Pour a generous amount of lighter fluid onto the coal.",
      "content": "Pour a generous amount of lighter fluid onto the coal. Spray the lighter fluid all over the top of the charcoal pile. Let it soak in for 3-5 minutes so that when you light the grill, the lighter fluid doesn’t burn off the coal immediately. [7] X Research source Then, add a little more lighter fluid to help the coals light quickly. Pour carefully to avoid getting lighter fluid on yourself. If you spill any while pouring, change clothes or thoroughly clean up the spill before lighting the grill. If you don’t have lighter fluid, place a piece of newspaper doused in vegetable oil under the charcoal and carefully light it with a match or lighter."

      "title": "Light the charcoal carefully with a long match or long lighter.",
      "content": "Light the charcoal carefully with a long match or long lighter. Light it in several places around the pile of moistened coal. Allow the flame to spread to the drier coal. Keep lighting different spots until you have a steady flame over the pile. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the flames burn for 10-15 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the flames burn for 10-15 minutes. During this time, the coal heats up, and the lighter fluid burns off. You’re ready to start cooking once the coal is a white-gray color and glowing red at the center. If you start cooking your food before the lighter fluid burns off, your steak or chicken will taste like petroleum! [9] X Research source Don’t add more lighter fluid to your grill once the coals are burning. It won’t make the fire heat up faster, and you may burn your hands…or even lose your eyebrows."

    {
      "title": "Arrange your charcoal with tongs.",
      "content": "Arrange your charcoal with tongs. Spread the briquettes out on the bottom of the grill to allow for even cooking. For grilling vegetables and thinner meat like chicken, spread the charcoal evenly on the bottom of the grill. [10] X Research source To grill steak and other thicker pieces of meat, arrange the charcoal higher on one side than the other. Start cooking the meat on the side with more charcoal to get a good sear. When the outside is cooked to your preference, finish cooking the meat on the side with less charcoal."

    {
      "title": "Replace your cooking grate.",
      "content": "Replace your cooking grate. The cooking grate is what you place the food you’re grilling on so it's not directly on the charcoal. Now that your coals are heated and your grill is ready, it’s time to barbecue! [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Use briquettes for faster lighting and more consistent heat.",
      "content": "Use briquettes for faster lighting and more consistent heat. Charcoal briquettes are probably what comes to mind when someone says they’re grilling with charcoal. They’re uniform nuggets of densely packed sawdust. Many prefer briquettes because they’re easy to light, burn longer, and are inexpensive. However, the experts at Julian Beer Company feel that natural hardwood charcoal is superior to quick-lighting briquettes."

      "title": "Hardwood charcoal also gives grilled food a more intense flavor.",
      "content": "Hardwood charcoal also gives grilled food a more intense flavor. While it burns out faster than briquettes, it gives your meat a delicious, smoky flavor. [12] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a mix of briquettes and charcoal.",
      "content": "Use a mix of briquettes and charcoal. One way to get convenience and better flavor is to use briquettes and hardwood charcoal at the same time. You’ll still get the classic barbecue flavor of the charcoal, but combined with the long-lasting burn of the briquettes. [13] X Research source Just add equal parts of both types of charcoal to your starting pile or chimney."

      "title": "Remove the lid, cooking grate, and old ashes from your charcoal grill.",
      "content": "Remove the lid, cooking grate, and old ashes from your charcoal grill. This allows you to reach the bottom charcoal grate where you put the coals. Clean out any ash and dirt left from the last time you grilled before you start a new fire. Then, sweep out any leftover debris at the bottom of the grill and collect them in a trash bin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the bottom grill vent after placing the coals in the grill.",
      "content": "Open the bottom grill vent after placing the coals in the grill. This lets air get to the charcoal to help it burn. Use the vent as you grill your food to regulate the cooking temperature. Partially close the vent to lower the temperature and open it up for higher heat. Make sure you don’t close the vent completely to allow enough oxygen to reach the coal so the fire doesn’t go out. [14] X Research source Opening and closing the lid and the lid vents can also help control the fire’s temperature."

    {
      "title": "If necessary, clean the cooking grate once the coals are hot.",
      "content": "If necessary, clean the cooking grate once the coals are hot. A wire grill brush is a good choice for removing stuck-on pieces of burnt food and char. Simply scrub the brush over the grate until it’s free of debris. [15] X Research source Soak a pad of paper towels with vegetable oil, then use a pair of grilling tongs to rub the oil on the grate to prevent food from sticking to it."

    {
      "title": "Safely extinguish the fire when you’re done cooking.",
      "content": "Safely extinguish the fire when you’re done cooking. Charcoal embers can remain hot enough to restart a fire up to 24 hours after you finish cooking. Keep your home safe by closing all the vents and then spraying the charcoal with water. Use your tongs to stir the coals to make sure they are all saturated with the water. [16] X Research source Place the grill cover on the grill and allow it to cool for several hours before moving it or placing it in storage."

      "title": "How long does charcoal burn?",
      "content": "How long does charcoal burn? Different types of charcoal burn for different lengths of time. Hardwood charcoal lumps generally burn for about 2-3 hours. Charcoal briquettes can burn for up to 4-5 hours. However, these times can vary greatly. In general, use briquettes when you cook something “low and slow” and hardwood lumps for “hot and fast” cooking. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "How do you light a charcoal grill for the first time?",
      "content": "How do you light a charcoal grill for the first time? When lighting a charcoal grill for the first time, put on your protective gloves, load up your grill or chimney with charcoal, or get a container of lighter fluid. Before firing up the grill, open the vents, which supply the charcoal with the oxygen it needs to stay lit. Start the grill using the lighter fluid or charcoal chimney method, as outlined above."
    },
    {
      "title": "How do you keep your grill lit and hot?",
      "content": "How do you keep your grill lit and hot? Always start with fresh, dry, and fairly new charcoal, not the leftover bag from last summer. Make sure to empty the old ash in your grill before lighting a new fire, and then check how much ash is in the bottom of the grill as you cook. [18] X Research source Get an external grill thermometer to help you monitor the grill’s temperature. Extend the amount of time your grill stays hot by adding 3-5 lumps or briquettes every 30 minutes."
