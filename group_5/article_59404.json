Here's what you can do to fix it: Plug your Kindle into a power source that is not your computer, such as a wall charger. The charging light should illuminate—if it doesn't, or if it turns off after a few seconds, try a different charger, and make sure the light is steady.

If you still see the Critical Battery screen, disconnect the charger, hold the power slider for 20 seconds, and then release it. As soon as you release the power switch, hold down the Home button for 30-45 seconds—after about that long, the Kindle's screen will flash. Release the Home button when you see the flash. Your Kindle will now boot into recovery mode. Press and hold the R key until the Kindle's screen flashes again. Even if you see the Critical Battery screen again, plug the Kindle back in, then wait for your Kindle to restart to the Home screen. If this doesn't fix the screen, the Kindle is not restorable.
