Before you make any major changes to your exercise routine, such as adding cardio, it is a good idea to discuss these with your doctor. If you suffer from joint or back pain, diabetes, or heart disease, there may be certain cardio exercises that you should avoid. Your doctor might suggest completing your first few new exercises with a personal training professional, just to make sure that everything is okay."

Then, add an extra minute each day until you reach 10 minutes. At that point, assess your pace to make sure that you are moving briskly and with a purpose. Continue to add minutes until you have a 30-45 minute walking plan in place. [1] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 14 May 2020."

Position yourself on your back in the water and rotate your arms up over your head and through the water. Then, move on to the breaststroke or even using a kickboard.

Aim for a 15-30 minute ride. A recumbent bike machine, which allows you to fully sit down, will be easiest to start with if you are worried about pacing."

      "content": "Perform cardio in between weight sets. This is one of the best ways to make the most of a 45-60 minute workout. After each set, do 2-3 minutes of a quick cardio routine, such as jumping jacks or sprints. This cardio exercise essentially takes the place of your rest periods and keeps your heart rate elevated. [4] X Research source This approach is a good one if you are trying to break through an exercise plateau."

Then, concentrate on hopping at a slight angle from side-to-side, so that your feet don’t land in the same place. You can also pull your knees up high when jumping for a little extra muscle burn.

Aim to walk or jog up a single floor and then increase your floor goals over time as you get more fit. Stair walking is a great workout because you are essentially moving your own body weight at a continual vertical angle."

      "content": "Wear athletic clothing and comfortable shoes. If you are doing cardio, you may place added pressure onto your feet, especially if you are jumping up and down or running. Buy and wear shoes that have strong cushions and arch supports. If you sweat a bit while working out, getting lightweight clothing can leech the moisture away and make you feel more comfortable during cardio."

You can even do 5 minutes on the elliptical machine before moving on to your main cardio. Stretching properly can help prevent injury and also ensures continued mobility, range of motion, and flexibility. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Increase the length of your cardio sessions over time. If you are new to cardio exercises, it’s important that you start off slowly. Add 10-15 minutes of cardio to your existing workout routine. Then, try to add on an extra 5 minutes each week. Your goal should be to build up to around 30-45 minutes of cardio per workout session. [7] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. The same rule applies to the intensity of your cardio workouts. For example, don’t just jump right into running a mile. Instead, start out by walking with short sprints mixed in."

      "title": "Do cardio with small weights included.",
      "content": "Do cardio with small weights included. There are hand or wrist weights that you can buy to wear while working out. These 1-5 lb. (0.5 to 2.5 kg) weights are light enough to not encumber your movements, but heavy enough to increase the difficulty of your workout. You can wear them while walking or running on the treadmill or while jumping rope. Avoid wearing wrist or ankle weights for longer than 5-10 minutes at a time. Wearing them for extended periods can result in damage to connective tissues like tendons and ligaments."

      "content": "Figure out your target moderate heart rate. Pull out a calculator or a piece of paper and start with the number 220. Then, subtract your age. Multiply that result by 0.70 and the final number is your ideal target heart rate. This calculation works best for people who are new to cardio. If you are used to working out at a high intensity, then replace 0.70 with 0.80 or 0.90 at that stage. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you are 35 years old, you’ll subtract 35 (your age) from 220. You’ll get 185 (your target heart rate), which you will then multiply by 0.70 (for a moderate target). This shows that your target heart rate is 129.50 beats per minute. Remember that 220 beats per minute is considered the fastest human hearts are capable of beating, and is close to an infant's heart rate."

Some are pretty basic and will simply give you a heart rate readout, whereas others will also calculate burned calories.
