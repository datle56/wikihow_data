      "content": "While getting unbanned is rare, Bumble might reactivate your account in some situations. If you violated Bumble's policies, their decision is final. However, sometimes other peoples' shady actions can result in you being banned. If you think any of these situations apply to you, be sure to provide details when contacting Bumble: You recently got a used phone or phone number that was connected to a banned account. Your account, phone, or computer is compromised. People think you are catfishing. [4] X Research source For example, actress Laverne Cox was banned from another dating app, Hinge, because moderators didn't believe the profile was really hers. [5] X Research source Retaliation. Some dating app users might get banned because malicious people abuse the \"report\" feature to get back at them for not responding, blocking them, or reporting harassment. Moderators (or an algorithm) mistakenly thought you were advertising a service."

      "content": "You might be able to create a new account, but it's risky. When Bumble permanently bans you from their service, the ban is attached to all of your identifying information, including your phone number, email address, payment method, IP address, linked Facebook account, and photos. Unless you create a new account using all different information, including a new phone number and all new photos, you'll likely be banned again shortly after creating your account. Reddit users who've been banned by Bumble suggest that Bumble uses facial recognition to detect banned users. This means that even if your photos are different from the ones you were using at the time you were banned, they can still be linked to your old photos."
