      "title": "Light a charcoal disc with a match or lighter.",
      "content": "Light a charcoal disc with a match or lighter. Charcoal discs are molded pieces of charcoal specially made for holding incense or resin. Grip the disc with a pair of tongs so you don't burn your fingers, and hold it over a heat-safe surface, like a stovetop. Hold a lit match or lighter up to the disc to ignite it. [1] X Research source Most discs will ignite within 10-15 seconds, so hold the flame to the charcoal and slowly rotate it until it takes on an ashy gray color and begins to smoke. Some sparking is totally normal while igniting the disc, and pieces may also crumble away, which is why it’s important to do this over a stovetop."

      "title": "Place the lit charcoal disc in a metal incense bowl.",
      "content": "Place the lit charcoal disc in a metal incense bowl. Once the disc has begun to smoke, use the tongs to place it in the center of your incense-burning bowl (or “censer”), or any heat-proof metal container. [2] X Research source Make sure the indent on the disc is facing upward, forming a small “nest” for your frankincense. Let the charcoal heat for about 5-7 minutes. You might also use a cast-iron pan, a cooking sheet, or any other metal bakeware. Just be advised that it will not be food-safe afterward. To help dissipate the heat, consider pouring a small mound of sand into the bowl, then placing the charcoal on top of the sand. Also, place the bowl on a heat-proof pad so it doesn’t damage your table."

      "title": "Place a small piece of frankincense resin on top of the charcoal.",
      "content": "Place a small piece of frankincense resin on top of the charcoal. You don't need much of the resin to create a lot of smoke and scent. A tiny piece of resin, not much bigger than a grain of rice, will do to begin with—you can always burn more when it stops smoking. [3] X Research source Some people pour salt in the center of the disc, which helps the resin burn slower. [4] X Research source If you get too much smoke, use your tongs to take the resin off the charcoal and set it aside for a moment, until the smoke subsides."

      "title": "Let the charcoal burn out, or dowse it with water when you’re done.",
      "content": "Let the charcoal burn out, or dowse it with water when you’re done. Charcoal discs last about 45-60 minutes, so you can let it burn out naturally. Never leave it unattended; if you need to stop it from burning, pour water over the charcoal disc to extinguish it, then dispose of it 30-60 minutes later, when it’s cooled off. [5] X Research source Pouring water over the charcoal can create a mess, so do it in the sink or outside. When moving the container, always use oven mitts to protect your hands from the heat. After the charcoal has cooled, you might retrieve what’s left of the frankincense, let it air-dry, and use it later."

      "content": "Place the frankincense on the burner dish and heat it to 235 °F (113 °C). Frankincense may be burned in an electric burner, like any other resin. Place a pea-sized chunk of frankincense resin into the cup of the electric resin burner , and plug the burner into the wall. Turn the incense burner on to 235 °F (113 °C), and let the resin heat up. Be sure to turn it off when you're done and keep it away from kids and pets, as the burner will get very hot. [6] X Research source Electric burners can heat resins at lower temperatures, providing for a longer burn that doesn’t overheat or damage the resin, meaning a “purer” aroma. Use tongs or an oven mitt to take the lid off once it heats up, as it will be hot. Place a foil cup in the burner to keep the main burner bowl from collecting gunk over time."

      "title": "Place the resin in the top dish, and light a tea light beneath it.",
      "content": "Place the resin in the top dish, and light a tea light beneath it. Tea light burners have 2 tiers. Place a chunk of frankincense in the top tier, then place and light a small tea light candle in the bottom tier, beneath the frankincense. [7] X Research source Let the frankincense heat for about 5-10 minutes. If it doesn’t begin to burn, lower the top dish of the burner so that it sits just over the flame. Keep in mind that the tea light will heat the burner to a high temperature, so never touch it with your bare hands. Use a beeswax candle or place a coin underneath the tea light to increase its temperature."

      "title": "Heat the frankincense in a foil-lined pan over high heat.",
      "content": "Heat the frankincense in a foil-lined pan over high heat. Put a spare cooking pot or pan (one you don’t mind not using for food again) lined with foil, or just a piece of heavy-duty foil, over an electric burner. Turn the heat up to high, and let the burner heat up. Then, place a piece of frankincense on the cookware or foil to begin the burning process. [8] X Research source Never leave the stovetop unattended, and don’t use the pot or pan for food in the future, as it will no longer be food-safe. Turn the heat down to medium or medium-high to burn the frankincense more slowly. Avoid using a pan with a non-stick coating, as these aren’t meant to be heated on their own."

Thakur says that, in its oil form , frankincense can help ease sore or inflamed muscles or joints with a light topical application. She also says that a frankincense oil spray can “improve gut health, digestion, and ease digestive disorders such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.” Give your bedroom 1-3 spritzes of oil spray each day to passively breathe in and consume the oil to reap its health benefits."

      "content": "Frankincense is a resin harvested from trees. Frankincense is harvested from Boswellia trees, which are a part of the “torchwood” family, named for their sweetly burning saps, resins, and gums. Boswellia are native to Southern Arabia and Northwest Africa, which is where its use is most prominent. [11] X Research source Frankincense is harvested by cutting a hole in the surface bark of the tree, then peeling back and distressing the layers until frankincense resin seeps to the surface."

      "content": "Frankincense has a long history in health and spirituality. Frankincense was used for any number of things: headaches, hemorrhoids, and menstrual pains, to name a few. While medicine men of yesteryear touted it as a cure-all, we know today that its uses are a bit more restricted. But even so, it’s long been used in spiritual practices for purification, meditation, and getting in touch with divinity, which is something many people still use it for today. [12] X Research source Frankincense smoke is still often said to swirl directly up to heaven, carrying prayers along with it. Some people even read incense smoke as part of divination or fortune telling."
