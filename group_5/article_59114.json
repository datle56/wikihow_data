      "content": "A rubber eraser will wipe away pencil marks without damaging your walls. If there are only a few pencil marks that you need to take care of, grab a rubber eraser and gently swipe at the marks on your wall. If your walls are wallpapered, be extra careful when using an eraser on them. Rubbing too hard could shred or tear the wallpaper.

      "content": "Mild dish soap and water can wipe away pencil marks in no time. Fill a bowl with warm water, then mix in a few drops of dish soap. Dip a clean cloth into your mixture, then gently wipe away any pencil or colored pencil marks. Follow up by wiping with clean water, then let your wall air dry. [2] X Research source If you aren’t sure whether or not your wall is washable, try out your dish soap and water combination on a discreet corner of the wall first. If the paint or wallpaper seems fine and it doesn’t wipe off any color, then you’re good to go. If the soap and water makes your wallpaper or paint flake off, stop using it right away, and try a different method."

      "content": "Use baking soda to scrub your walls free of marks. If your walls are washable, mix about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water with 1/2 tbsp (14 g) of baking soda to make a paste. Gently rub the paste into the wall with a clean cloth, then wipe it off. [4] X Research source Baking soda is mildly abrasive, so it does have the potential to damage wallpaper or non-washable paint. If you aren’t sure whether or not your walls are washable, try using the baking soda in an inconspicuous spot on your wall. If the paint flakes off or you notice any color transfer onto your cloth, pick a different method."

      "content": "Try a non-abrasive eraser sponge to gently wipe away pencil marks. Magic Eraser is a popular brand, but you can buy any eraser sponge that you’d like. Simply wet the sponge to activate the cleaning agents, then wipe down the wall with the pencil marks. For best results, scrub in small, circular motions. [5] X Research source Eraser sponges are the perfect choice if your kids used both graphite pencils and colored pencils. Eraser sponges are not a good option if you have wallpaper, since it may cause the wallpaper to peel."
