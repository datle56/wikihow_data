      "content": "Surf around 129 to catch a Wailord in Pokémon Emerald. Fly to Pacifidlog Town and surf as far east as you can go (past Routes 131 and 130). Once you reach Route 129, continue surfing around the area to spawn wild Pokémon encounters. Wailord only has a 1% spawn rate in this area, so it may take some time before you run into one. [1] X Research source To boost your chances of successfully catching the Wailord, use an Ultra Ball or Net Ball when you battle it. Ultra Balls double your chance of catching a Pokémon overall, while Net Balls triple your chance of catching a Bug- or Water-type Pokémon. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fish for a Wailmer at Dewford Town with a Super Rod. Head east from the Pokémon Center and walk out onto the nearby dock. Using your Super Rod, fish in the nearby water until you catch a bite. When Super Rod is equipped, you have a 100% chance of catching a Wailmer that’s between levels 20 and 45. [3] X Research source Head to Mossdeep City and enter the house that’s right of the town’s Pokémon Gym. Chat with the Fisherman there to receive a Super Rod. [4] X Research source You can still catch a Wailmer with a Good Rod here, but it only has a 20% chance of spawning. Old Rods can’t catch Wailmer at all. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Level up the Wailmer to level 40 so it evolves. Use items like Rare Candy, Lucky Egg, or EXP. Share to raise your Wailmer’s levels more quickly. [6] X Research source Once Wailmer levels up to 40, it’ll automatically evolve into a Wailord. [7] X Research source Rare Candies automatically increase a Pokémon’s level by 1, while Lucky Eggs are held items to allow a Pokémon to earn some bonus EXP after a battle. An EXP. Share lets Pokémon in your party gain EXP from a battle, even if they didn’t actively participate. [8] X Research source If you catch a Wailmer that’s over level 40, level it up once to trigger its evolution. [9] X Research source"
