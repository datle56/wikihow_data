If you have an immediate or urgent concern, calling your local representative is the best way to make your voice heard. [1] X Research source Find a list of RNC staffers on the GOP website , then Google search their name with the words “contact info” to find their telephone number, if it’s available. Find telephone numbers for your elected representatives by visiting their campaign website, or at USA.gov/elected-officials . Tell the staffer who answers the phone your name and address and then tell them your message.

      "content": "Call to schedule a meeting with your elected officials. Many RNC staff members don’t take meetings with the public, but elected officials like senators and representatives are obliged to. Call your elected official’s local office and ask the person who answers the phone to direct you to the appointment scheduler or secretary. Ask the scheduler what the rules are for scheduling a meeting with the person you want to speak with. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that elected officials, who govern and make laws, are different from RNC staff, who develop and promote the Republican party’s platform. Persist when asking for a meeting. If your representative or state official is not available for a meeting within the next few weeks, you can ask for a meeting with a staffer. If you are able to schedule a meeting, prepare for the meeting by researching your representative's official position on the issue and prepare to talk about how this issue affects you personally and why it matters to your community. Personal stories are very powerful tools you can use to communicate your concerns to an official."

The best RNC officials to contact by letter or email are your elected members of Congress. Each member of Congress has their own website. Find this site by googling their name. Both forms of letter writing are effective ways to contact members of the RNC, but they may not as effective as making a phone call. Writing a letter or an email is a good way to contact the RNC if you want to express a more complex thought on an issue. It is also a good method to use if you have anxiety speaking over the phone or if you are unable to call the office Monday through Friday between 9am and 5pm."

If you want to write a typed or handwritten letter to send to your RNC state office, format your letter using a business template.

If you want to write a letter to your representative, use polite language and focus your letter one issue or action that matters to you. When addressing a government official, etiquette coach Tami Claytor says to always use their official title followed by their last name. Give your letter a personal touch by explaining why an issue is important to you and let the RNC know how an issue or action will affect your community. Make sure you include specific details about the issue you are writing about. For example, you may want to point out the positive or negative proposals within a single piece of legislation."

I have not yet heard your official position on the current education reform policy. This issue is important to me because I have 2 children who attend public school.

A tweet may say, for instance, “Chairwoman McDaniel, how will the GOP’s tax reform proposal affect families who earn less than $50,000/year?” Political figures and parties are more likely to respond to positive messages via social media. Social media is a good way to contact the RNC if you support one of their actions or positions. Use hashtags to link your message to other campaigns or issues.
