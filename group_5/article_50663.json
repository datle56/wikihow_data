Make it a challenge to get to know the full you—his competitive nature will keep him chomping at the bit to win you over.

If he gets bored or disinterested in pursuing you, he’ll set his sights on someone else. Use flirty phrases like “I’ll tell you about that another time” or “That’s for me to know and you to find out” to drive him wild with curiosity. Be aloof when he wants to see you. If you make yourself available every single time he asks, he might think he’s got you all figured out already."
