      "content": "Red temperature gauge One of the most obvious signs of low coolant is the temperature gauge on your dashboard pointing to the red, meaning your car’s engine is hot, possibly because of low coolant in the system. This can cause breakdowns if not addressed promptly. [1] X Research source Similarly, automotive repair specialist Duston Maynes says to keep an eye out for a “low coolant light” on your dashboard, which is a surer sign of low coolant."

      "content": "Malfunctioning heat or A/C Your car’s coolant enables the A/C system to run as it should. Without enough coolant, the fluids in your car can’t make it to the heater core, making any air that blows from the heater chilly. [2] X Research source This might also manifest as no cool air when you try to use the A/C system."

[3] X Research source That’s because coolant is often made with glycol, which often has a fruity scent.

      "content": "Coolant leaks Coolant leaks are both a cause and a symptom of low coolant. [6] X Research source If you notice puddles of liquid forming under your car after it’s parked for an hour or two, it may be coolant leaking from somewhere in the system. Leaks may also be accompanied by faint or apparent hissing sounds in the moments after you turn off your car’s engine. [7] X Research source Coolant comes in all colors, from blue to red to green and yellow. If the colors of your coolant brand and the liquid of the puddle approximately match, your problem may be a coolant leak. Coolant leaks often occur under the car’s engine bay, so check the ground immediately under the hood. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Add coolant if you don’t see severe symptoms like a leak. Usually, you just need to top up your coolant to fix things like finicky heating or a higher-than-usual engine temperature. To check your coolant , turn off your car and let it cool down for 20 minutes. Then pop the hood and locate and uncap your coolant reservoir. If the coolant level is below the “FILL” line, then pour in new coolant until it reaches that line. Then replace the cap. [9] X Research source A general-purpose coolant works with most vehicles, but check your car’s owner manual to see if it specifies a particular mixture or brand. Also, flush your car’s coolant once every 2 years to keep it clean and efficient.

If refilling the coolant didn’t help, you notice a persistent leak, your car seems to burn through coolant faster than usual, or your engine begins to produce white or gray plumes, low coolant levels may have damaged your engine, or you may have other serious problems that require a professional diagnosis and repair. [11] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source A simple coolant leak diagnosis usually costs around $50, but more serious repairs like a hose replacement or a head gasket repair may cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

Without coolant to regulate its temperature, your car’s engine may overheat or become damaged.
