      "content": "Start with a clean face, then apply some toner and moisturizer. Apply the toner first using a cotton ball, and the moisturizer using your fingers. The toner will help balance the pH of your skin. It will also help tighten pores and make them less noticeable. The moisturizer will help keep your skin feeling smooth and soft. It will also help prevent foundation (especially powder-based ones) from looking flaky. If you have very sensitive skin, try using a rosewater-based toner, witch hazel, or an alcohol-free toner. This will make it sting less. If you have oily skin, consider using a lightweight or an oil-free moisturizer.

Also, choose a product that works best with your skin type (hydrating or mattifying). [3] X Expert Source Alicia D'Angelo Makeup Artist & Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020."

Do not use the makeup sponge to apply loose powder. Powder foundation is a great option for touch-ups if you're wearing makeup in humid weather.

      "content": "Get out a foam makeup sponge or a foundation brush if you are using liquid foundation. Shake the bottle first. This will help mix up the pigments inside the foundation. Then, pour out some foundation onto the back of your hand or onto a little dish. This will help prevent you from accidentally picking up too much foundation. If you are using a makeup sponge, consider soaking the sponge in water first and then squeezing it to get rid of the excess water. This will keep the sponge from soaking up too much foundation and wasting it. Avoid using a powder brush with soft bristles. Try to get a foundation brush. It will have stiffer bristles that can hold the weight of the liquid foundation. You can also apply liquid foundation if you are in hurry. Use your fingers to help blend the foundation, as the heat from your fingers will warm the foundation and give you a smoother appearance. This will not give you full coverage, but it will give a nice, natural look."

They are made with slightly stiffer bristles than a powder brush. They are flat and have a slightly rounded tip. They will give you the most coverage. Use your fingers to apply liquid foundation if you are in a hurry. This won't give you the best coverage or the smoothest finish, however."
