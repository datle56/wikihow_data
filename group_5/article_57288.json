Choose your fleece according to needed warmth and personal style, using whatever patterns and colors you want. You can choose accessories such as buttons, sequins or gems to add later if you'd like."

      "content": "Measure the circumference of your head. Most adult heads are approximately 21 to 23 inches (53.3 to 58.4 cm) around. Fleece has some stretch to it, so you should be able to use a 23-inch (58.4-cm) hat pattern for most people."

      "content": "Feel the way your fleece stretches before you set it on your table to mark and cut. You want the stretch of the fabric to run across the width of your head, so that it will fit tightly. Check which direction the fabric stretches, too. What direction does it naturally pull towards? This is also going to show you where the back side of the fleece is -- if you stretch the fleece between two hands, the fabric will naturally curl towards the backside (the side touching your head) of the fleece.

      "content": "Download, print, and cut out a pattern for your hat online. You'll need a pattern to help you cut the right shapes and sizes out of your fabric. Search for \"fleece beanie pattern\" online and check out the shapes that you like. There are often subtle variations between hats, and this is your chance to choose the exact design you want. Make sure your print it \"to size.\" Do not print it to \"fit page,\" as the actual size of the pattern is crucial! Print at 100% or \"actual size.\" They often provide a 1-inch square on the design that you can check with a ruler. Most fleece beanie patterns differ slightly in their construction. They will have 4 side panels and a bottom band. Some patterns will allow you to work from one piece, while others will separate the fleece into up to five pieces."

Cut a rectangle of fleece that is approximately 23 inches (58.4 cm) wide by 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall. Reduce the measurements to 19 inches (48.3 cm) wide or 21 inches (53.3 cm) wide for a toddler or smaller adult, respectively. When in doubt, leave a 1/2 inch of excess -- you can always cut it later, but it can make construction easier."

Repeat on another stretch of fabric, preferably close to the first cut, so that you have 4 total domed pieces. Make sure the pattern doesn't move on the fabric as you cut. Pinning it down with sewing needles is a good way to keep everything straight. Use at least two pins, if so."

Some patterns simply attach the domed pieces into a beanie, but that classic \"lip\" of a beanie is easy to add. This will be a rectangular piece of pattern, which you cut right at the fold in your fleece. This leads to one piece of fabric that is twice as long as your pattern, but folded in half so that it appears the same size. You will need two of these. Remember to cut half in one pattern, half in the other pattern, if you're making a reversible hat."

Follow the curve with your sewing machine (1/4 inch seam allowance) to attach the two pieces, almost like a book. Use a straight stitch. Make sure the overlap goes wrong-side-out, on the side that will soon be the inside of your hat.
