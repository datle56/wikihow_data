      "content": "\"Periodt\" is an exclamation that emphasizes a point or ends a conversation. The meaning of \"periodt\"(or \"period’t\") comes from the word “period,” which is often used verbally to signify that someone has said the last thing on the subject (e.g., “You’re not going out this weekend, period” or “That skirt looks amazing on you, period.”). \"Periodt\" is often considered an even more emphatic phrase. [1] X Research source ​ For example, you might say \"Moose tracks is the best ice cream flavor, periodt!\" to show that you really love that flavor. \"Periodt\" is a purposefully misspelled version of “period.” The added “T” provides more emphasis and follows the speech patterns of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), from which the slang term derives. Other slang terms with a similar meaning to \"periodt\" include “that’s that,” “facts,” “end of story,” and “full stop.”"

      "content": "Some see the mainstream use of \"periodt\" as cultural appropriation. Despite the fact that this term originated with the Black community and represents their language patterns, white Americans have co-opted this term to the point that it’s no longer immediately recognized as a Black term. In fact, it’s more often referred to as “Gen Z slang” or “internet slang.” [10] X Research source Cultural appropriation becomes an issue when historically marginalized groups influence mainstream trends and are then erased from that trend. As a result, when a white American uses this term, it may be considered offensive or racially insensitive, especially if the individual’s natural dialect doesn’t include AAVE. An important aspect of respecting other cultures , including Black and LGBTQIA+ cultures, is understanding these communities have originated and influenced popular trends."
