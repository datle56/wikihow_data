      "content": "Begin with thoroughly cleansed hair and do a deep conditioning treatment. Before applying any protective hairstyle, do a deep conditioning treatment to ensure the moisture from the product fully penetrates your hair strands. [1] X Research source Well-conditioned hair is less likely to break during the twisting process. Before twisting, saturate your hair with a deep conditioner for 20-30 minutes. Blow-drying your hair can help stretch your curls before twisting, making your twists appear longer and more uniform. However, this stretching step is optional."

      "content": "Use a rat tail comb to horizontally divide the loose section into smaller 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) segments. If you’d like your twists to be smaller, opt for 1-inch (2.5 cm) segments, while 2-inch (5 cm) segments will provide larger twists. Apply a pea-sized amount of twisting custard or cream to the parted sections to prepare them for the twisting process. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Twist the two pieces together in a clockwise spiral. Beginning near the root, wrap the pieces around each other in a rope-like motion, continuing along the full length of the hair to the ends—think of a braid with only 2 strands of hair instead of 3.

      "content": "Wash your hair once a week. Thoroughly cleanse your scalp to promote optimal hair growth. Washing your twists in sections can also help reduce frizz and prevent the twists from rubbing against each other. [9] X Research source To wash, dilute 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 mL) of shampoo in water in an empty nozzle bottle. Gently apply this mixture to the twists and scalp, massaging the scalp with your fingertips before rinsing thoroughly. Repeat the process with a conditioner. Dry the hair using a microfiber towel, which absorbs more water than regular towels. You can also speed up drying with a blow dryer."

Because your hair is not exposed to daily styling, heat tools, or environmental effects, mini twists are a great way to protect your natural hair, giving it the opportunity to grow healthy and strong. However, it’s important to keep in mind that hairstyles alone do not directly impact the natural growth rate of hair, as that is determined by your own biological factors.
