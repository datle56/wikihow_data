      "title": "Identify the parties to the contract.",
      "content": "Identify the parties to the contract. The opening paragraph to the contract should set forth the names of the parties entering into the ghostwriting agreement. It is important to identify the role that each party will play, such as “ghostwriter” or client. If the parties are represented by agents or attorneys, those names should also appear. Lastly, the opening paragraph of the agreement should contain the date that the parties entered into the agreement. At the top of the document, the phrase “GHOSTWRITING AGREEMENT” should be centered on the page and appear in bold font. An example of an opening sentence could be: This Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement,” was entered into on [insert the month, day and year]. The next sentence could read: The parties to this agreement [insert the names and addresses of the people entering into the agreement] as described below, do hereby agree to all of the terms set forth in the Agreement. The next paragraph should be numbered “1” and identify the client. For example you could write: 1. [Insert name of the client] is hereinafter referred to as “Client.” The next paragraph should be numbered “2” and should state: 2. [Insert name of the ghostwriter] is hereinafter referred to as “Ghostwriter.” [1] X Research source www.findlegalforms.com/free-forms/files/ghostwriting-agreement.doc"

      "title": "Define the scope of work.",
      "content": "Define the scope of work. The paragraphs detailing the scope of work for the project should set forth what you are writing, for example a book or essay, it should identify if you need to work with any other people, such as illustrators, and should detail how you are receiving the content for the book. For example, if you are ghostwriting an autobiography, you should specify that you will be meeting with the client on certain occasions and the client will provide details and documents from his or her past. The paragraph that begins the scope of work section of the agreement should follow in numerical order from the previous paragraphs. Consider the following examples of a simple scope of work: [Insert number for paragraph]. Client is contracting with the Ghostwriter for a book-length project of at least 300 pages on the subject of the client’s life. [Insert number for paragraph]. The book will be written as an autobiography. [Insert number for paragraph]. The tentative title of the book shall be [insert book title]. The parties may agree to change the title but the client has final approval of the title."

In addition to specifying what the ghostwriter will write for the client, the contract should also establish any responsibilities that the parties must satisfy to complete the contract. These responsibilities can include writing, editing, providing background information, or research. The paragraphs in this section should continue in numerical order from the previous paragraphs. The following are examples of paragraphs outlining the parties’ responsibilities: [Insert number for paragraph]. Client agrees to meet with the Ghostwriter on at least five occasions to provide details of [her] life. [Insert number for paragraph]. During these meetings, the Ghostwriter should be prepared to ask the Client questions to assist in drafting the project. [Insert number for paragraph]. The Ghostwriter agrees to two (2) major revisions of the manuscript, if needed. Upon discussion, the Ghostwriter may agree to additional revisions for a specific fee. [Insert number for paragraph].

The client may be under a contractual obligation to his or her publisher and may suffer financial losses if the project is not completed on time. It is important to establish a realistic publishing schedule for the project. For example, it may be unreasonable to complete a book-length project in less than a year, depending on the Ghostwriter, the type of project, and the contribution of the client. The deadline paragraph should follow in numerical order and could state: [Insert number for paragraph]. The tentative deadline for completion of this project is [insert month, day, and year].

      "title": "Consider an appropriate fee.",
      "content": "Consider an appropriate fee. There are a number of factors that you should consider when negotiating the ghostwriting fee. It is important that you consider the length of the project, how quickly you are required to complete the project, and whether you are willing to accept a flat fee or if you will negotiate for a percentage of the royalties. When calculating a flat fee, you should estimate how many hours it will reasonably take you to finish the project (writing, researching, revisions, client meetings) and multiply that by your standard hourly rate. This may help give you a starting point in determining an appropriate fee for the work. If a ghostwriter negotiates for part of the royalties, he or she may be required to take a smaller up front fee. If you believe that the book will be widely read, for example you are writing an autobiography of a well-loved celebrity, it may be in your best interest to take a smaller flat fee and negotiate a percentage of the royalties, if possible.

The provision should also discuss any future royalties that you are accepting as part of your compensation. It should also specify the manner of payment. [6] X Research source The following are examples of compensation paragraphs that you could include in your agreement: [Insert number for paragraph]. Client agrees to pay Ghostwriter a total sum of [insert total amount of compensation] for completion of the project. [Insert number for paragraph]. Client will pay the fee as follows: 50% in advance to begin the project, which will be sent to Ghostwriter by [insert date]; and 50% of the fee will be paid within 10 days of Ghostwriter completing the project. [Insert number for paragraph]. Additionally, Client agrees to pay Ghostwriter [insert percentage] of royalty fees generated from the sales of the project. If you will not be paid royalty fees, you can include a sentence that states: Ghostwriter is not entitled to royalties or commissions related to the sale of the project.

Most clients will require that the agreement contain a confidentiality provision in which the ghostwriter agrees not to disclose any information about the project, including his or her participation. Essentially, the confidentiality and nondisclosure provides the client with legal assurances that the ghostwriter will not disclose any details that were shared, the nature of the collaboration, or speak about the project in any way. A client may also ask you to enter into a separate non disclosure agreement. A simple confidentiality provision could include the following language: [Insert number for paragraph]. Ghostwriter acknowledges that [he/she] will be given access to certain personal, confidential, and/or proprietary information while working on the project.

Either party may terminate the agreement before the deadline so long as they provide the other party 30 days advance notice of the termination.
