      "title": "Plan ahead to ensure you snag the tickets you want.",
      "content": "Plan ahead to ensure you snag the tickets you want. If there’s a concert you really want to see, block out the time in your calendar even if you don’t have tickets. This way, if you come across a last minute ticket at an excellent price, you can grab it with no worries. For instance, say you want to see Taylor Swift, and she’s playing 3 shows in your town. Take off work and cancel your plans for those 3 days, just in the event that you do end up scoring tickets the day of or before."

      "title": "What is the cheapest place to buy concert tickets?",
      "content": "What is the cheapest place to buy concert tickets? The cheapest place to buy concert tickets is through the concert’s primary sale. There are no scalpers (or people who resell tickets for a profit) during primary sales hiking up the prices—it’s only you and other fans. While it may be possible to get a reasonably priced ticket outside of the general or primary sale, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get it at face value."

    {
      "title": "Do concert tickets get cheaper last minute?",
      "content": "Do concert tickets get cheaper last minute? Yes, they do. More often than not, concert tickets get cheaper as the concert approaches, especially on the day of the concert. This is because resellers want to make some money off their tickets, even if that means buckling down. Keep in mind that sometimes ticket prices soar right before a concert’s date. This is because resellers are trying to profit on those making somewhat last-minute plans. The price typically drops within a day (or even hours) before the concert."
