      "content": "Some people aren’t comfortable holding hands until they’re alone. If you’ve never held hands with this person before, don’t try it in a public place. Instead, wait until you’re by yourselves or in a more secluded area. [1] X Research source For instance, if you were in a coffee shop, wait until you’re taking a stroll through the park to make the hand-holding move."

      "content": "Let them know that you’re okay having your hand touched. If the person you’re with celebrates an accomplishment or says something cool, offer them a high-five. Afterwards, let your hand linger for just a few seconds to give them a subtle message. [2] X Research source This is a good way to test the waters and get a read on their body language. If they also let their hand linger and didn’t pull away immediately, it’s a good sign!"

      "content": "It might encourage them to reach out and grab your hand. Get your hand as close to theirs as you can without actually touching. If you’re sitting at a table, place your hand on top of the table next to theirs. If you’re sitting side by side, place your hand down by your lap so it almost touches theirs. If they’re feeling bold, they might even reach out and grab your hand first. [3] X Research source This is a super subtle way to ask someone to hold hands. If your date isn’t picking up on it, don’t worry! They probably just missed your clue. If you're worried about having sweaty palms, just wipe your hand on your pants before you put your hand near theirs. [4] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019."

      "content": "You can do this while you walk and talk. Swing your arms back and forth and “accidentally” brush your hand against theirs. Or, if you’re sitting down, place your hand on the table but brush your hand against theirs first. [5] X Research source If they “accidentally” brush your hand with theirs, try not to flinch! They might be trying to send a signal right back at you."

      "content": "It’s the best way to make sure your date wants to hold hands. If you can’t quite read their body language or you’re worried that you’re overstepping your boundaries, just ask! If they say yes, you can confidently take their hand and hold it for as long as you’d like. [6] X Research source You might say, “Is it okay if I hold your hand?” Or, “Will you hold my hand?” Or, “Would you like to hold hands?” If they say no, that’s fine, too. They might not be comfortable with physical touch, or they might want to get to know you a little more before holding hands."

      "content": "Then, ask them to feel it for you. This is a cute and flirty way to get someone to hold your hand. If they feel your hand and say that it does feel cold, ask them to warm it up for you by hanging onto it. [7] X Research source This is a great hack to use during the chilly winter months. You could say something like, “Brr, my hands are super cold! Here, feel.” Or, “My hands are super chilly. Could you warm them up for me?”"

If you know how to read palms , tell them what’s going to happen in their future! If you don’t know how to read palms, you can just make something up. [9] X Research source You could even turn this into an opportunity to ask about holding hands. As you trace a line down their palm, say something like, “In your future, I see you holding hands with your cute date.”"
