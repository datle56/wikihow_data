Resist the temptation to press more firmly on the string. Note the tuning on the electronic tuner. If this note is sharp (above the tone of the harmonic), then the string length from the nut to the bridge needs to be increased. If the fretted note is flat (below the tone of the harmonic), then the string length from the nut to the bridge needs to be decreased."
