      "content": "Have one player start the game by asking the rest of the group who they think is most likely to do something. On the count of 3, everybody in the group must simultaneously point to the person they think is most likely to do whatever thing was said—and anybody who gets pointed at must take the same number of drinks as there are fingers pointed at them. [1] X Research source Number of players: 4 or more For example, if somebody says, “Who would be most likely to go viral?” and 3 people point at you, you’d have to drink from your glass 3 times. Example questions include: Who is most likely to check an ex’s Instagram? Who is most likely to have over 50 browser tabs open? Who is most likely to borrow something and not return it? Who is most likely to fake their own death?"

Then, the next player must say, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing…,” repeating the previous statement and adding their own item as well. Continue going around the group until someone messes up—and they have to take a drink. [2] X Research source Number of players: 3 or more Bonus rule: If the group all agrees that an item named by one player isn’t appropriate for a picnic, they can also force that player to take a drink. If “picnic” isn’t up your alley, you can always swap it out for some other activity—like going to a club or going on vacation."

Then, the person to their left must try to guess which statement is the lie; if they guess correctly, the player who invented the lie must take a drink, and if they guess wrong, they (the player guessing) must drink.

The player who has to say “21” loses the round, and the rest of the group gets to come up with a dare for them. The losing player must either do the dare—or, if they refuse, they can take a drink instead. Number of players: 3 or more Depending on how creative you want to get, dares can be anything from a silly challenge (like eating a snack without using your hands) to something embarrassing (like letting the group DM someone from your Instagram)."

When you reach 21, everyone must say “Cheers to the governor!” and take a drink. Then, the person who said “21” must make up a new rule for the next round of counting—and in subsequent rounds, anyone who forgets a rule or messes up must also take a drink. [4] X Research source Number of players: 2 or more Example rules include: Dance when you say the number 5. Say 7 in Spanish. Skip the number 15. Make an animal sound instead of saying 11."

      "content": "Interested in drunken trivia? Have one player say “I drink and I know…” followed by a statement about what they know (without saying the fact itself). If someone else knows the fact being referenced, they can blurt it out, and everyone has to drink (including the first player). Then, the person who got the answer right can make a statement of their own. If nobody gets the answer, the entire group must drink, and the original player can make another statement. Number of players: 3 or more For example, you might say something like, “I know what the smallest dog breed is.” If somebody else correctly calls out “Chihuahua,” that means you’d have to drink along with the rest of the group. However, if nobody guesses “Chihuahua,” you could make another statement after taking a drink."

To start, have one player start asking questions to another; the questions should start off fairly innocent and get increasingly more personal as time goes on. When it reaches a point where the other player doesn’t want to answer a question, they must take a drink. Number of players: 2 or more"

      "content": "This simple and classic game of questions is an easy way to find out about someone else’s preferences. Take turns posing a question that starts with “Would you rather…” and presents two challenging (or silly) scenarios. The rest of the group must choose one of the two options—and anybody in the minority (who chose the less-popular answer) must take a drink. Number of players: 4 or more Example questions include: Would you rather be on a dating show or a survival show? Would you rather have a pause or a rewind button in your life? Would you rather run into an alien or Big Foot? Would you rather be royalty 1,000 years ago or an average person today?"

The last person with alcohol still in their cup wins the game! [5] X Research source Number of players: 3 or more Sample Never Have I Ever questions include: Never have I ever left the country. Never have I ever finished an entire pizza by myself. Never have I ever prank-called someone. Never have I ever run into a glass door."

When the player returns, they must try to guess what trait the rest of the group is thinking of, and for every wrong guess, they have to take a drink. Number of players: 3 or more Don’t play this game unless everyone playing is on the same page and knows it’s all in good fun. It’s better to play this with close friends rather than casual ones! When coming up with someone’s “problem,” don’t get mean-spirited. It should ideally be something they can laugh about along with everyone else. For example, you could say someone’s worst trait is the fact that they always ask questions about the plot of a movie DURING the movie, or that they pour milk before their cereal."

However, while you’re thinking of a name, you must drink continuously—and if you can’t think of a name, you must finish your drink.

Number of players: 4 or more You can also take a drink (to indicate that you want to know what question was asked) even if your name wasn’t said, but you’re just curious. Potential questions include: Who is most likely to wear the same pants for an entire week? Who would die first in a zombie apocalypse? Who eats the most garbage food?

From there, teams must take turns trying to toss a ball into their opponent’s cups—and when a ball goes into a cup, the opposing team must drink the cup’s contents.
