If that makes your dog nervous, have them stand on the floor while you crouch or sit down so you’re on their level.

      "content": "Conditioner helps break up mats and tangles before you brush. Since poodle hair is so curly, you may run into some problem areas within your dog’s coat. Before you start brushing, grab a spray conditioner made specifically for dogs and spray it all over your pup. [2] X Research source Not only do conditioners help break up tangles, but most of them make your dog smell good, too. If your dog has sensitive skin or allergies, talk to your vet before using a conditioner spray."

      "content": "Pin brushes have small, straight bristles to work through mats. When you’re brushing a curly-haired dog, it’s super important to use the right tools. Pick up a pin brush from your local pet store to quickly brush your dog’s hair with the least resistance possible. [3] X Research source If you take your dog to a groomer, you may have seen them using a slicker brush. Slicker brushes are similar to pin brushes, but they can hurt or scratch your dog’s skin if used incorrectly. Unless you’re a professional, it’s better to stick with a pin brush."

      "content": "Use your hand to pull the hair and skin taut as you go. You can start brushing your dog anywhere: the head, back, or legs is usually a good place to start. Hold your brush in one hand and gently press their fur up with the other, creating a line in the fur. Use the brush in small strokes to brush downward, making sure to brush through all layers of the fur (and not just the topcoat). [4] X Research source Brushing in sections is a good way to keep track of what you’ve brushed already and what you still need to get to."

      "content": "A metal comb will pick out any knots or tangles. Once you’ve brushed a section of hair, put down your pin brush and grab a metal comb. Gently run it through the section you just brushed. If the fur is fully brushed out, your comb will slide through no problem. However, if your comb gets caught on a knot or tangle, go back in with your pin brush to gently loosen the knot. [5] X Research source Be gentle and very careful when using a metal comb. If it gets caught on a knot, you could hurt your dog by pulling too hard."

      "content": "These sensitive areas can get hurt easily. Dogs have sensitive skin, and their fur isn’t as thick in these areas as other places on their body. As you work your way around your dog, brush them carefully when you get to these sensitive areas. If your dog jerks back or snaps at you, give them a break from brushing for a couple of minutes.

A dog’s ears are sensitive, and they don’t have much hair inside of them to brush anyway. If your dog’s ears are dirty, you can clean them with a mixture of white vinegar and rubbing alcohol."

It can be tempting to stop once you’ve gotten their back and head brushed out, but don’t forget about the feet, legs, and tail, too!

Using a bristle brush on your poodle is optional, but it’s a great way to fluff their hair out even more.

      "content": "Dogs with curly hair need daily (or almost daily) brushing. You might notice that your dog’s fur naturally clumps up and forms small mats. This is because curly fur clumps together to trap dead fur that’s being shed. Try to brush your poodle every day to reduce matting and keep them looking great. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If your poodle has short fur, you can brush them every other day. While you should brush your poodle every day, you can save bathing them for about once a month. Bathing your dog too often strips their fur of natural oils, which can lead to dry skin and other issues."
