Keep your leg bent and toes pointed forward. Do not let your toes point towards the floor. Ensure your toes are together. Be careful not to let one toe separate from the others; to prevent a broken toe. This move, lifting the leg, is the most important of any to make the kick powerful. Practice, to make sure it is fast.

Some of your practice should involve kicking a makiwara or other target so you can get the feeling of impact/snap back. Snap back is important for several reasons. It makes the kick more effective, prepares you for the next technique, and ensures your opponent does not grab your leg."
