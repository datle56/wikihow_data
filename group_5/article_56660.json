Shuffle the card decks together, including the Jokers, so the cards are thoroughly mixed. [1] X Research source Aces count both as higher than a King or lower than a 2. From highest to lowest value, cards rank A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A. Jokers are considered Wild cards and can be counted as any value."

      "content": "Deal out 10 or 12 cards depending on the current game round. Choose a player to be the first dealer. Have the player to the right of the dealer cut the deck before dealing. If you’re just starting the game, deal out 10 cards face-down to each person. Players can look at their own hands, but keep them hidden from everyone else. [2] X Research source During rounds 1-4, deal 10 cards to each player. For rounds 5-7, deal 12 cards to each player instead."

Flip the top card of the deck face-up and set it nearby to form the discard pile. [3] X Research source If the cut cards were the exact amount needed to deal out hands and start the discard pile, the player who cut the deck subtracts 50 points from their score as a bonus. If it’s the first round, it’s okay to have negative points."

Either take the face-up card on top of the discard pile or draw the next card from the deck to add it to your hand. [4] X Research source If a player chooses to draw from the deck, all other players have the opportunity to buy the card on top of the discard pile. If a player wants the card, they may take it from the discard. However, they must also take the top card of the deck as a penalty. If multiple players want the top discard, whichever player is next closest in turn order gets the card."

Melds are either sets of 3 or more cards with the same rank, or sequential runs of 4 or more cards of the same suit. Players may only meld once per round, and it must follow the current round’s requirements. Play the meld cards face-up on the table. The round requirements are: [5] X Research source Round 1: 2 sets of 3 Round 2: 1 set of 3 and 1 run of 4 Round 3: 2 runs of 4 Round 4: 3 sets of 3 Round 5: 2 sets of 3, and 1 run of 4 Round 6: 1 set of 3, and 2 runs of 4 Round 7: 3 runs of 4 with no cards remaining in your hand You may use Jokers to replace any card, but you must have at least 2 “natural cards” in a set (ex: A-A-Joker) or 3 natural cards in a run (ex: 3-4-Joker-6)."

Once a player lays down the required meld for the round, then they’re allowed to play any number of cards to melds that are on the table. Players can add to their own melds or melds from another player. [6] X Research source If there’s a Joker in a meld, a player can replace it with the correct card as long as they’re able to play it to a meld by the end of their turn. For example, if a run has the 7 spades - 8 spades - Joker - 10 spades, you could replace the Joker with a 9 of spades."

As soon as you gain a Joker, try to lay it down in your meld or put it in another player’s meld so you aren’t caught with it at the end of the round. While you can discard a Joker at the end of your turn like a normal card, another player could potentially use it right away.
