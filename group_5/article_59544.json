      "content": "Use the Bend Will shout. Once you're near the dragon, open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Shouts” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen and select “Bend Will.” Aim at the dragon and press the “Action” button to use the shout against the monster. The dragon will land on the ground without attacking you. If you don't have the Bend Will shout, you can get it by completing the “Garden of Men” quest—the sixth mission in Skyrim's main storyline."

Once you find a target, press and hold the “Lock” button on your game controller to fix your camera focus on the mark. Once you've locked on your prey, press and hold the “Attack” button to make your dragon breath fire at your target. You can incinerate and kill your mark in one attack, depending on its character level."
