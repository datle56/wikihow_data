      "content": "Slice off the top and base of the pineapple. Turn the pineapple on its side, and cut off the crown about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the fruit part. Flip the pineapple around and cut off the base, as well. [1] X Research source Use a sharp chef's knife to slice it."

      "content": "Cut off the skin in long strips. Place the pineapple on one of its flat sides. Cut from top to bottom along the outer edge, slicing off the skin in strips. Turn the pineapple and keep cutting off strips as you turn. [2] X Research source If any eyes are left in the pineapple, use the tip of your knife to dig them out."

      "title": "Slice the pineapple into coins.",
      "content": "Slice the pineapple into coins. Turn the pineapple on its side. Cut the fruit into thin coins by slicing into the side of the pineapple. Each one should be about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide or slightly less. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Take the core out with a knife or icing tip.",
      "content": "Take the core out with a knife or icing tip. Look for the round circle in the middle of the coins you just made, which is the core. Run the knife tip around the core and then push it out with your finger. [4] X Research source You can also use a wide icing tip or a very small, round cookie cutter to cut the center out."

      "title": "Slice off the top of the fruit.",
      "content": "Slice off the top of the fruit. Turn the pineapple on its side, and use a sharp knife to cut off of the crown where the leaves are. Slice the fruit 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the main part of the fruit. [5] X Research source A large, sharp chef's knife works best for this process. Try to get the top as level as you can. If it's slanted, the corer will have a hard time moving straight down through the fruit, and it may want to push out through the left or right side."

    {
      "title": "Set the base of the corer on top of the pineapple.",
      "content": "Set the base of the corer on top of the pineapple. It should go along the cut you just made with the handle at the top. Press down on the corer slightly to get it started in the pineapple. [6] X Research source The base of the corer is the round circular part with the blade."

    {
      "title": "Turn the handle and press down to cut and core the pineapple.",
      "content": "Turn the handle and press down to cut and core the pineapple. Grab the pineapple with one hand, and twist the corer clockwise with the other hand by turning the handle at the top. As you do, apply light pressure downward so that the corer continues to move through the fruit. Keep going until you hit the bottom. [7] X Research source If your corer tries to move off center, gently redirect it back to the middle."

      "content": "Take the pineapple out of the skin by lifting out the corer and slices. Pull upwards on the handle while holding on to the fruit with your other hand. The corer will bring out the core and the sliced pineapple all in one go. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Release the core and the slices by taking off the handle.",
      "content": "Release the core and the slices by taking off the handle. The handle of the corer should have 2 small buttons. Push the buttons at the same time to pop the handle out. Slide the pineapple off the center pole, and use a butter knife or other handle to push the core out of the center. [9] X Research source Sometimes, the core will just stay attached to the inside bottom of the pineapple as you pull the slices out, so you can just toss it with the skin. You can slice down one side of the pineapple slices from top to bottom to make rings, as it comes out of the corer in one, long curlycue."

With a very sharp knife, slice off the stem of the pineapple about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the brown part. Toss the leaves and top of the pineapple. Turn the pineapple around, and slice off the bottom the same way. [10] X Research source Grasp the pineapple while you're cutting so it doesn't slide around on the board, and make sure to get your fingers out of the way!"

      "content": "Place the pineapple on one of its flat ends to cut off the skin. Use one of the cut sides as a base, and then slice down the edges of the pineapple to chop off the skin. Keep turning the pineapple, slicing a strip of skin each time you turn. [11] X Research source Try not to cut too much of the fruit off with the skin, but get in at least a quarter inch, since the spines are a bit deep."

As you cut off the inside edge, you'll get a triangle shape. Move from top to bottom to cut it all out. [13] X Research source You can toss the core or save it for other uses."

With the pineapple on its side, slice off the top of the pineapple where the leaves are, coming about 0.5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) into the main part of the pineapple. Flip the pineapple around and cut off the bottom the same way. [14] X Research source You should have a flat top and bottom now, which makes it easier to cut the pineapple."

The core is the long piece in the middle, which will be a slightly different color than the rest of the pineapple. [16] X Research source The core is a slightly paler yellow."

Cut from the outer edge of the core on one side of it, going down and towards the middle as you do. Cut from the other edge of the core, and go down and towards the middle, ending up in the same spot you did when cutting from the other side. [17] X Research source You'll end up with a triangular-shaped wedge that has the core in it. You can just pull it out with your knife or your fingers."
