      "title": "Isolate your pet from people and other animals.",
      "content": "Isolate your pet from people and other animals. If you’ve noticed fleas on your pet, act quickly so that they don’t spread to other animals or people. Place your pet in a bathroom, mudroom, or another space without a lot of soft surfaces where fleas can easily hide. It's best to do this in a room with a door so that your pet won't get near other animals or people. This will keep the fleas from spreading as you work on cleaning the house. [1] X Research source Make sure your pet is comfortable. Place water and a favorite toy or blanket in their enclosed space so that they feel safe and calm. Keep your pet isolated until you have finished bathing them and cleaning the house."

      "content": "Comb your pet to get rid of their fleas. Spread a sheet on the floor and have your pet sit on it. This will catch any fleas that escape the comb. Use a fine-tooth comb to go through all of your pet’s hair, frequently dipping the comb into a bowl of water that contains a few drops of dish soap. The dish soap will immobilize the fleas. [2] X Research source After you’re done combing, empty the bowl of water down the drain. Flush the drain with some extra water to make sure you've gotten rid of all of the fleas. Bundle the sheet in a plastic bag and close it tightly. This will prevent any living fleas from escaping when you carry the bag to the washing machine."
