Shaving cuts the hair off at the surface of your skin, rather than pulling the hair and follicle out completely. Dark spots after shaving can be caused by these freshly shaved hair follicles peeking out from just under your skin. Consider waxing or plucking the affected area to remove dark follicles.

      "content": "Treat ingrown hairs and prevent scarring from them. After shaving, a strand of hair that’s starting to grow back can curve downward and grow back into the skin. These raised discolored spots are called ingrown hairs, and they can also lead to scars and hyperpigmentation. Treat ingrown hairs as soon as they appear to create a smooth, spot-free surface and prevent scarring. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Apply warm compresses to open up the pore and encourage the ingrown hairs to release. Leave the warm compress on the area for 10-15 minutes at a time. Exfoliate the skin gently with a wet wash cloth and warm water. Gently rub the area with circular motions to release the hair. If the looped hair is visible on the surface of your skin, you can gently pull it out with sterilized tweezers. Apply rubbing alcohol to the area first to prevent infection. Your doctor may also prescribe antibiotic ointment or pills to prevent infection if your ingrown hair is severe. Don’t pick, scratch, or pop ingrown hairs, as this can lead to scarring.

If you’re noticing a lot of small, dark spots on your legs after shaving, you might be dealing with “strawberry legs.” This occurs when the pores on your legs get clogged with dirt, oil, or dead skin after shaving. “Strawberry legs” isn’t an official medical diagnosis, and it’s completely harmless, but some people prefer to get rid of the tiny spots for cosmetic reasons.
