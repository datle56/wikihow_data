If you haven't already done so, you'll need to install the latest version of Python (which is 3.12 as of 10/02/2023), which comes with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called IDLE. Here's how to get it: If you're using Linux, use your distribution's package manager to install the latest version of Python 3 and then move to Step 2. If you're using Windows or macOS, keep reading. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ . Click the Downloads link at the top of the page and select your operating system. Click the Latest Python 3 Release link at the top of the page. Scroll to the \"Files\" section at the bottom of the page. If you're using a Mac, click the macOS 64-bit installer link. If you're using Windows, click the Windows x86-64 executable installer link. Once the download is complete, double-click the installer (it has a name like python-3.8.3-macOS10.9.pkg/exe ) and follow the on-screen instructions to install. If you're using Windows, make sure you choose the option to install IDLE when prompted. [1] X Research source"
