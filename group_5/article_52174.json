      "content": "Mix the juice from 1 lemon and 1 cup (240 mL) of water in a bowl. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze as much juice as possible from each half into a microwave-safe bowl. Then, pour the water over the lemon juice and stir with a spoon to mix thoroughly. [1] X Research source If you don't have a lemon available, use another citrus fruit like a lime or an orange."

      "title": "Chop the halves into smaller pieces and place them in the lemon water.",
      "content": "Chop the halves into smaller pieces and place them in the lemon water. Once you've squeezed all the juice out of the lemons, use a sharp knife to cut the lemon into quarters or eighths. Put all of the pieces into the water and stir the mixture with a spoon again. [2] X Research source This ensures that any juice still in the lemon will evaporate in the microwave to help remove dirt and debris."

      "title": "Microwave the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Microwave the mixture for 3 to 5 minutes. Place the bowl in the microwave uncovered and set it on high for about 3 minutes (or longer for extra dirty microwaves). The water should bubble and boil and may evaporate out of the bowl. After 3 minutes, leave the door closed so the steam from the water can't escape. [3] X Research source If there's still some water left in the bowl, microwave it for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until almost all of the water has evaporated."

      "title": "Let the water cool for 15 minutes, then remove the bowl from the microwave.",
      "content": "Let the water cool for 15 minutes, then remove the bowl from the microwave. Keep the door to the microwave closed until most of the steam has settled and condensed on the walls of the microwave. Then, carefully open the door and remove the bowl so you can start cleaning.

      "title": "Wipe down the microwave and turntable with a clean towel.",
      "content": "Wipe down the microwave and turntable with a clean towel. Lift the turntable out of the microwave and wipe it with the towel. Set it aside and wipe the sides and ceiling of the microwave, using the water as your cleaning agent. Don't forget to wipe down the inside of the door. The food and markings on the inside of the microwave should wipe off easily. [5] X Research source If you don't want to use a towel, use a damp sponge with a scrubbing pad to wipe the inside of the microwave. If the bowl and turntable are still warm to the touch, put on oven mitts to remove them. Remember to replace the turntable once the microwave is clean."

      "content": "Add white vinegar to the lemon juice to dissolve caked-on food. If you know your microwave is particularly dirty, add 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar to your lemon juice and water mixture to create a stronger cleaning agent. Be sure to stir the mixture thoroughly, as vinegar can have a strong smell that may linger in your microwave. [6] X Research source If you don't have any caked-on food in your microwave, you probably don't need to add any vinegar to the lemon water."

      "content": "Use baking soda to remove particularly stubborn stains. Sprinkle baking soda over a stain or piece of crusted-on food and let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes. Then, dip a cloth in the lemon water and scrub the stain vigorously. The baking soda acts as a gentle abrasive to chip away at baked-on food and the lemon water helps dissolve the food as it comes off. [7] X Research source Wipe the area clean with a damp cloth so there's no baking soda left behind on the interior of the microwave."

      "content": "Dip a towel into the lemon water and scrub if the microwave is stained. If there's a spot that just won't come off, wet the corner of a towel with any leftover lemon water. Then, scrub the spot to remove the stain. If the stain won't budge, spray on a multi-surface spray for extra cleaning power. [8] X Research source If you don't have any lemon water left, microwave a new batch for 2 minutes and let it stand for 5 minutes in the microwave. Then, use the leftover water to help remove the mark."

      "content": "Clean your microwave at least once a week. Wipe down your microwave more frequently if you notice it collecting stains or food debris. To avoid splatters and increase the time between cleanings, cover your food with a microwave-safe cover. [9] X Research source Paper towels, wax paper, plastic wrap, glass covers, and silicone lids can all be used to safely prevent splatters in the microwave."

      "title": "Clean a microwave quickly by steaming it with lemon and vinegar.",
      "content": "Clean a microwave quickly by steaming it with lemon and vinegar. Lemon and vinegar are both mild acids. When these ingredients are added to a bowl of water and heated, the combination of steam and acid easily and effectively loosens any food residue in the oven. Using lemon and vinegar is also a healthy option, as they’re natural, food-safe ingredients that won’t affect the food you later eat out of the microwave. [10] X Research source You can also opt to use lemon or vinegar. Most people prefer the scent of lemon, which is why it’s the more popular option for cleaning microwaves . Baking soda also works well for baked-on items that need to be scrubbed away. However, it must be rinsed more thoroughly to remove any powder residue."

      "title": "Remove odor by steam cleaning with a lemon and vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Remove odor by steam cleaning with a lemon and vinegar solution. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice or white vinegar in a microwave-safe container. Heat the solution in the microwave for 3-4 minutes. [11] X Research source Let the mixture cool slightly, then dip a cloth into the solution and use it to wipe down the inside of the microwave. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe away the solution, then use another clean cloth to dry the interior. Leave the microwave door open until the inside dries completely. If your microwave odor still lingers, leave a bowl of baking soda in the microwave for about 12 hours. The baking soda should absorb any strong odors and leave your microwave smelling fresh."

      "content": "Avoid cleaning your microwave with abrasive cleaners or sponges. Avoid any harsh chemicals, cleaners, or cleaning wipes—especially those that contain bleach, ammonia, or oven cleaner. These cleaners can release toxic fumes into your microwave and potentially contaminate your food, as well as create an unpleasant smell. [12] X Research source Similarly, avoid using abrasive sponges or steel wool to wipe down the microwave, as they may scratch the interior of the appliance."
