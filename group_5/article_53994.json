      "content": "Eros (eh-rows) love is feelings of sexual desire and passion. This kind of love is filled with lust, passion, and romance. Many consider eros to be the type of love closest to the modern-day concept of romantic love, and its most defining characteristic is the presence of sexual desire. [1] X Research source Some describe eros as being the emotions and sensations felt in the very early stages of love, characterized by physical and sexual attraction, idealization, and nervousness. [2] X Research source The Greek philosopher Plato also described eros as one’s desire to seek an ideal beauty that transcends the individual and reminds people of the beauty that exists in the world. [3] X Research source The Greek god Eros was the equivalent of the Roman god Cupid, the god of love. The word “erotic” originates from the word “eros.”"

      "title": "Sexual attraction",
      "content": "Sexual attraction This is the defining characteristic of eros love. If you’re experiencing eros, you may feel a strong desire to interact in a sexual manner with the person you’re attracted to. [4] X Research source However, the sexual desire felt with eros is often likened to feelings of lust; intense feelings of sexual and physical attraction that often don’t last more than a few months. For example, if you’ve just started dating someone, you might feel sexually attracted to each other even before you really get to know one another. Of course, sexual attraction can develop into a deeper romantic love as people get to know one another better and show more commitment to each other."

      "title": "Idealization",
      "content": "Idealization When it comes to eros and romantic love, people often view the person they’re attracted to as perfect and flawless. They highlight their partner’s positive qualities and might neglect to see the negatives. To them, the person they desire is unique and irreplaceable. [5] X Research source Idealization is often seen in the very beginning of romantic relationships before partners really get to know one another. For example, if you have a crush on someone, you might consider the other person to be absolutely perfect even though you haven’t interacted with them much. Unfortunately, idealization can often lead to a person having unrealistic expectations about their partner or their relationship as a whole."

      "content": "Physical dependency When you feel eros love, you often want to be around the person you desire as much as possible. You likely want to feel connected to the other person in as many ways as possible, and being physically close to each other is just one way to strengthen your bond. [6] X Research source For example, you might constantly want to hang out with your significant other and plan dates together as often as possible. When you’re away from the other person, you might miss them a lot and want nothing more than to be with them as soon as possible.

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Euphoria also brings along feelings of security.

You might break out into a nervous sweat when you’re near them or find yourself blushing a lot more than normal. Even if you don’t know them that well yet, the person you feel eros love for can still elicit plenty of physical responses, and this is often what people go through when they’re experiencing infatuation and are in the early stages of romance.

      "title": "Risky behavior",
      "content": "Risky behavior Sometimes, eros and romantic love can blind a person to certain dangers as they pursue the object of their affection. In fact, some ancient Greeks even considered eros to be one of the most dangerous types of love, since people are often willing to take many risks out of the passion and desire they feel for someone else. [10] X Research source For example, you might be willing to quit your job and move to a completely different city for the person you love. Even agreeing to go on a date with someone you don’t know all that well can be a risk, but you might still do it anyways because you feel attracted to them."

      "content": "Emotional connection This kind of connection happens when people feel truly aligned with one another and are able to feel bonded in a way that goes beyond just surface-level attraction and sexual desire. While eros is heavily characterized by the presence of sexual attraction, it’s also marked by intense feelings of passion. This passion can translate into a desire to know a person on an even deeper level and form a strong emotional connection. [11] X Research source For example, you might be willing to open up about your innermost thoughts and emotions so that your partner can better understand you. Emotional connections also form when people spend quality time together and listen to each other with their undivided attention."

      "content": "Commitment While brief feelings of lust and infatuation are traits of eros and romantic love, commitment and a passionate desire to be with another person for a long time are also important characteristics. At its core, eros is all about passion, and that passion can turn into commitment as you get to know another person on a deeper level. [12] X Research source Many people consider eros to be the type of love found between married couples. Eros is also described simply as a passionate desire for something, which, for some people, might mean a desire to be with a person in a committed relationship. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Eros likely refers to physical love within marriage in the Bible. The Song of Solomon in the Old Testament shows how eros love was meant to be celebrated when in the context of marriage. And while the term eros is never explicitly mentioned in the New Testament, there are some verses that allude to the idea of physical love being exclusive to marriage. [14] X Research source These verses are: “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.” —Hebrews 13:4 (English Standard Version) “Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.” —1 Corinthians 7:5 (ESV)"

Unlike eros, philia usually doesn’t involve feelings of sexual desire and more so centers around mutual respect, trust, and companionship. [15] X Research source Plato argued that the best kind of friendship forms when eros turns into philia. In other words, when sexual desire becomes a deeper feeling of companionship."

Many describe storge as being a natural love. In other words, families feel naturally connected to one another and love each person unconditionally. [17] X Research source On the other hand, types of love like eros and philia are somewhat conditional. With eros, you likely only feel attraction and desire for someone you find physically attractive. For philia, a sense of camaraderie and understanding is needed to form a strong bond."
