To add the first field to the label (e.g., the name of the person you're mailing to), select the desired field from the menu (e.g., Name ). This will add the column header name to the label between two angle brackets like this: <<Names>> . You can add multiple fields to each line on the label. For example, if you have separate columns for first and last names, you can add <<First>> <<Last>> to the first line. Place each field on the lines on which you want them to appear. For example, <<Names>> on the first line, <<Address>> on the second line, and <<City>><<State>><<Zip Code>> on the third line. You can also use the buttons below the fields to make text bold, justified, centered, and more."
