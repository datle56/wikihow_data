      "content": "Mosquitoes love to nest in tall vegetation. Try to keep your grass short and your shrubs and plants trimmed down so they have fewer spots to hang out in. Depending on how fast your grass grows, you may have to trim it back once a week. Focus on the vegetation near your home, since that will draw mosquitoes closer to the entrances where they can slip inside."

      "content": "Mosquitoes and other insects are attracted to incandescent lighting. To keep mosquitoes away and out of your yard, change your outdoor lights to yellow “bug lights” so they aren’t as interested. [1] X Research source You can find these bug lights at most garden supply stores. These lights aren’t a repellant, but they won’t attract mosquitoes, either."

      "content": "Mosquitoes are pretty weak fliers, and you can use that against them. Place a few large box fans just outside your home to blow the mosquitoes away from your yard. [2] X Research source If you have a deck, set the fans on it and point them away from your seating area. This will blow them away as you relax outside. You don’t have to keep your fans on all the time; just turn them on when you want to hang out outside."

[3] X Expert Source Joshua Bloom Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. Your yard might look okay at first glance, but mosquitoes are tricky! Puddles, watering cans, and even bottle caps can be the perfect home for mosquito eggs.

[4] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If you notice any of those areas are a breeding ground for mosquitoes, consider taking them inside or getting rid of them.

      "content": "You can use foggers, aerosols, or sprays. Use foggers and aerosols to kill mosquitoes in the air, and use sprays to attack mosquitoes where they’re laying eggs. You can find these foggers, aerosols, and sprays at most department stores or online. Pyrethrin and pyrethroid sprays work the best for getting rid of breeding grounds. Every product is slightly different, so make sure you read the label before using it in your yard. Pyrethroid can be dangerous to other helpful insects such as bees and butterflies. To reduce harm, spray your treatments just before dusk on clear days that aren’t rainy or windy. [8] X Research source"

Bats probably won’t be entirely effective on their own, but when combined with other efforts, they can seriously help reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard."
