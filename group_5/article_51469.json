Provide tarps and rope , then set a timer for 30 minutes and let everyone forage outdoors for other materials to make the perfect survival shelter . Judge each fort on how well it would keep you dry if you actually slept in it overnight. Before starting, talk about the different types of shelters you could build. If you find a fallen tree against a rock, cover one side with sticks and bark to create a triangular shelter with one large opening in the side (also known as a lean-to shelter). [1] X Research source You can also tie a rope between 2 trees and drape a tarp over it to build a simple (but effective) emergency tent."

Then, let the campers tie their shirts with rubber bands however they want. Pour the dye into squirt bottles and have the campers squirt as much as possible onto the shirts. [3] X Research source After the shirts are all dyed, let them sit for 24 hours. Throw them in the washing machine with hot water, then put them in the dryer. Now the shirts are ready to wear!

Look for green flashing lights in long grasses and have campers use a net to capture them. Place the fireflies into a clear jar with a lid and a couple of air holes. At the end of the night, release them into the wild for a parade of lights. [5] X Research source To make catching the fireflies easier, try placing a piece of blue construction paper over a couple of flashlights and have the campers try to mimic the fireflies’ flashing patterns. Have campers work in pairs to catch the fireflies—one holds the jar while the other uses the net."

[6] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source While starting a fire , outdoor educator Britt Edelen recommends “putting your sleeves over your hands or [wearing] a pair of gloves or something that will just keep your hands from getting cut or burned.” If your campers are younger, try throwing magic fire powder into the flames when no one is looking."

While you’re talking, you can also ask campers to make different sounds that add ambiance to the story, or give a few campers lines to say ahead of time. [7] X Research source For example, if part of the story takes place in a creaky cabin on a windy night, you might ask the campers to make sounds that the house would make. If you’re not sure what stories to tell, try leaning on books from your childhood or stories that you’ve heard as a kid."

Campers can stand behind a line on the ground to toss the bean bags in. For a ring toss, set up some glass soda bottles and have the campers stand behind a line and try to throw plastic rings over the openings.

[13] X Research source Slightly above the stick perch, cut a slightly larger hole for the birds to get the seed out of. Pour birdseed inside the bottle. Poke a hole near the top of each bottle and thread string through it, then tie the string up in a sheltered location outside. Alternatively, spread peanut butter around a cardboard toilet paper roll and roll it in birdseed. Then, punch a hole near the top and tie a string to hang it somewhere up high."

[14] X Research source Meteorologists mainly classify clouds based on how they look—these are the three main types: [15] X Research source Cumulus: These look like puffs of cotton, and the bottom of them tends to be close to the ground. If they grow tall, they turn into thunderstorms. Stratus: These look like flat sheets. They can signal an overcast day or steady rain, and they can stay in one place for several days. Cirrus: These are super high and wispy clouds that are actually made of ice particles. When against a clear blue sky, these clouds indicate fair weather."

Whoever is “it” throws a ball as high as they can while shouting a number of one of the players. The player who was assigned that number has to get the ball and yell “SPUD” as fast as possible. [18] X Research source All the other players have to run away from the ball, but as soon as the player yells “SPUD,” they all have to freeze. The player can then take 3 steps and throw the ball to get someone out of the game. If the player hits another player with the ball, they get the letter “S.” As soon as a player gets all 4 letters in “SPUD,” they’re out of the game. The game continues until only 1 player is left."

[19] X Research source Set the boxes outside on a sunny day when the temperature is at least 85 °F (29 °C). Let the “ovens” preheat for at least 30 minutes. Break graham crackers in half, then place a marshmallow on one of the pieces. Put the unfinished s’mores in the preheated oven and place the plastic wrap tightly over the opening. Let the s’mores bake for 30 to 60 minutes, then open the oven and place a piece of chocolate and the other half of the graham cracker on top of the marshmallows.
