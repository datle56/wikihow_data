As a Capricorn , this should be easy for you since you're a pro at looking refined in clothes that are nice but not over-the-top! Try a flattering skirt or stylish pants paired with a comfortable sweater. Feel free to wear sensible heels if they won't slow you down, but if they do, opt for a pair of ballet flats instead. Virgos tend to prefer neutral tones and earthy shades of blue. In fact, you might share this taste as a fellow earth sign. Stick with one piece of elegant jewelry, such as your favorite necklace or a delicate pair of earrings."

If you need an excuse not to tell a story or give details right away, you could say, \"I'll tell you the next time we hang out!\" to make him want to see you again."

While you're building your friendship, show him how sweet and nurturing you can be. Capricorns may not seem to be either of those things at first glance, but deep down, you're thoughtful and want to help the people you like."
