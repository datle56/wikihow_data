      "content": "Decide why you want to breed ducks. You may want to keep ducks as pets, for meat, for egg production or as an organic way of controlling pests in the garden. There are four main types of duck: domestic, dabbling, diving and sea ducks. Domestic ducks are the type most people choose for their needs. All breeds of domestic duck are descended from the common Mallard duck except the Muscovy duck. Non-domestic ducks, or “Wildfowl”, spend a long time on the water and will need their wings pinioned when they are very young or else they will fly off. They require a large pond or lake and are unlikely to tame."

      "content": "Consider call, cayuga, pekin, rouen or muscovy ducks if you want a pet. All of these breeds are visually appealing and make good pets. Call ducks are named for the noises they make so be careful of getting a call duck if you do not want to upset your neighbors. They are small and gray or white, and many people choose them for their smallness of size but they are good fliers and will need their wings clipped every so often. Cayuga ducks have beautiful iridescent green plumage and are very quiet, but can be hard to find. Pekin ducks are large and white and one of the most popular breeds of ducks. They are calm and have a relaxed temperament. Rouen ducks have the same coloring as mallard ducks (green neck and head and iridescent areas on the body) and are very calm and sociable. Muscovy ducks are very quiet and have been bred in many different colors. They are descendants of tree birds and thus might need their wings clipped periodically to keep them from flying away."

      "title": "Consider Pekin, Muscovy, Rouen or Aylesbury ducks for meat production.",
      "content": "Consider Pekin, Muscovy, Rouen or Aylesbury ducks for meat production. You will want to choose a breed that matures quickly, produces tasty meat and are heavier. Many people prefer ducks with a white plumage because it is easier to get a clean looking carcass. Pekin ducks are one of the most popular ducks for meat production because they are ready to butcher at 7 weeks, high meat-yielding and have a white plumage. At 7 weeks you can expect a 6lb bird, they are much bigger at 12 weeks (9lbs) but the feathers become very hard to remove. They also lay a decent number of eggs in the year (varies according to location- in the UK they are low layers) so they are a good general purpose duck. They can be crossed with Aylesburys for great meat-producing ducklings. Muscovy ducks produce tasty dark meat that is leaner because their oil glands are underdeveloped. They are poor egg producers whose eggs take 35 days to hatch as opposed to 28 days but are very good brooders and mothers and so do not require an incubator. They can be crossed with Pekin for a very good meat-producing duck but their progeny will be sterile. They must be butchered by 16 weeks of age or their meat becomes too firm. Rouen ducks are good meat-producers but take 12-15 weeks until they are ready to be butchered. They also are decent egg layers (~100 eggs per season) but have colored feather shafts and the carcasses will be harder to clean. Aylesbury ducks are prized for meat production due to their large size and while plumage but true Aylesburys are very rare and most are rather mixes of Aylesbury and Pekin, which also makes a good duck for meat production. White crested ducks are said to be a mix of Aylesbury and Pekin ducks. They are not great egg layers."

      "content": "Consider Khaki Campbell or Indian Runner ducks for egg production. These breeds can sometimes even surpass the production levels of egg-laying chicken breeds and ducks produce a larger, more nutritious egg than chickens. [1] X Research source The Khaki Campbell duck is quite hardy, excellent foragers can produce over 300 eggs a year and do not require special care or lighting to produce many eggs. They produce a pearly white egg and are the main breed used for commercial egg production. Their meat has a typical “game” flavor and is not usually eaten. Indian Runner ducks are upright birds that have a running gait. Some strains can produce over 300 blue-tinted eggs a year. They are great foragers, small in size and hardy. The Welsh Harlequin duck is a rarer bird but a good egg-layer as well as good meat bird and has a placid nature."

      "content": "Consider Indian Runner, Khaki Campbell, or call ducks to biologically control pests. All ducks will eat snails, slugs and insect pests in gardens but certain breeds are better foragers and cover a large area. Ducks will also clean algal slime and duckweed from ponds. Indian Runner ducks are very active and some of the best foragers and have been known to even eat flies from the air. They cover large areas of land and can be used to control pests in fields. They are often used in rice paddies in Asia and have even been used to control pests at an organic wine farm in South Africa. Khaki Campbell ducks are also good foragers. They can control pests on both land and water and eat large quantities of slugs, snails, insects, algae and mosquitoes. Call ducks are also decent foragers but are of smaller size than other ducks and so will eat smaller prey."

Heavy breeds such as the Muscovy and other meat production breeds will usually have a ratio of one drake to five ducks maximum. Lighter breeds such as the Khaki Campbell and Indian Runner can have a maximum ratio of around one drake to ten ducks. [5] X Research source Keeping too many drakes with too few females can cause injury to the females as they can be mated too often. If you are attempting to cross breed, be careful about the size difference between the drake and ducks because this can also potentially cause injury. If you have too many drakes you can keep them in a separate pen during the breeding season. You can mate ducks as a pair if you choose. The problem comes when there are multiple drakes and not enough space and females."

If you want to create particular crosses you must keep breeds separate that you do not want mixed in. If you do not want your ducks mixing and you have multiple breeds then you should separate them during breeding season. Muscovy ducks that mate with another domestic ducks will produce mule ducks. Mule ducks are sterile but can be good meat producers. [7] X Research source Mixes between other domestic ducks will not be sterile."

They have no tear ducts and rely on this water to wet and clean their eyes. You can use a small kiddies pool or other plastic tub to hold water. Plastic tubs are actually better for your ducks because the water can be replaced easily, keeping it clean from mud and feathers. Move the plastic tub around so that your grass does not turn to mud."

While some breeds are good at foraging for food, they will still require additional feed. Feed ducks commercially prepared duck pellets. If you feed chick crumbs they must not be medicated as this can seriously harm your ducks. Ducks used for production will need a higher protein content (~16% and can come from raw oats but no more than one-fourth of diet) than other ducks. Egg layers will also need higher calcium content to effectively produce eggs and you can supplement this in their feed. [8] X Research source Provide a clean source of drinking water close to the feeding areas. It helps to raise this off the ground to avoid it getting filled with mud."

They do not need perches but the doorway should be as wide as possible to accommodate the whole flock going in together. It is important that this area be kept well-ventilated. The house should have about four square feet (3700 square cm) of floor space per duck and be at least 3.5 feet (1 m) tall. They can be spooked by lights at night so face openings away from the moon or lights if possible. Place the enclosure against a wall or fence to help herd ducks indoors at nighttime. Use a layer of clean straw as bedding and change it out regularly to keep it clean. If you want to collect the eggs then you should provide nest boxes. These make it easier to find the eggs."

The heavier meat-producing ducks cannot jump very high but some of the lighter breeds such as call ducks can get up to 6 feet (1.8 m) in the air. Ducks can be kept in the same enclosure as chickens. Different breeds of duck can also be kept together but be careful when keeping the smaller breeds with a male of a bigger breed because he can injure the ducks. [9] X Research source"

This helps to check that it is keeping an even temperature. Humidity can usually be maintained by filling the water pans on the incubator and following the instructions. You can also spray the eggs with water every time you turn them. Muscovy ducks are very good brooders and mothers and will not necessarily need their eggs incubated.

Food is not required in the first 24 hours but after that you can provide starter crumbs from your local feed shop. After ten days on starter crumbs, switch to growers pellets. If your duckling is particularly weak or won’t eat, try feeding it a little mashed boiled yolk. This can help it start to eat its starter crumbs. After 16 weeks you can switch the ducklings to normal pellets as you would feed an adult. If you wish to allow your ducklings to swim then you must supervise them so they do not drown. Additionally ducklings do not yet produce the oil on their feathers that protects adult ducks from the cold so the water must be warm rather than cold.
