      "content": "Measure the ingredients into a container. Add 107 pounds (49 kg) of whole maize meal, 41 pounds (19 kg) of soya, 28 pounds (13 kg) of fish meal, 31 pounds (14 kg) of maize bran, and 13 pounds (5.9 kg) of limestone powder into a container. This recipe makes 220 pounds (100 kg) of chicken feed, so you will need a large bucket or barrel to mix and store the feed in. Use organic ingredients if you want to make the chicken feed organic. Purchase the ingredients from a bulk goods store or a farm shop."

      "content": "Mix the ingredients until they are thoroughly combined. Stir the feed with a shovel until all the ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the container. This ensures that the chickens will receive the nutrients from the different ingredients when they are fed. Make sure that you mix the ingredients that are in the bottom of the container. This may take a few minutes if you have made a large batch. Allow 2-3 minutes to mix a large bucket. If you have made a very large batch of chicken feed, use a spade to mix the ingredients."

      "title": "Give each chicken 0.28 pounds (0.13 kg) of feed per day.",
      "content": "Give each chicken 0.28 pounds (0.13 kg) of feed per day. Multiply the feed needed per chicken by the number of chickens that you have. For example, 6 chickens x 0.28 pounds (0.13 kg) = 1.68 pounds (0.76 kg) of feed in total. Place the food into a feeder or sprinkle it on the ground in front of them. If you are using a feeder, simply pour the feed into the hole at the top and let it trickle down into the feeding plate. Purchase a feeder from a farm store or make your own chicken feeder ."

      "content": "Store the chicken feed in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months. Garages or barns are ideal places to store chicken feed. Check the feed for mice, bugs, and mould before you give it to the chickens. If the feed has been contaminated, it is safest to throw it away. If you don’t have a shed to store the feed in, put a lid on the container and keep it out of direct sunlight."

      "title": "Mix the cracked corn and ground roasted soybeans in a container.",
      "content": "Mix the cracked corn and ground roasted soybeans in a container. Measure 250 pounds (110 kg) of cracked corn and 150 pounds (68 kg) of ground roasted soybeans into a large container, such as a barrel or feed container. Mix the ingredients with a shovel until they are thoroughly combined. [1] X Research source Choose a container that has a lid. This will make it easier to store the feed. If you don’t have a big enough container, halve the recipe. This feed works well for broiler chickens as it has lots of protein to help the chickens grow. Use organic ingredients if you want to make organic feed."

Measure 25 pounds (11 kg) of rolled oats, 25 pounds (11 kg) of alfalfa meal, and 25 pounds (11 kg) of fish or bone meal into the container. Mix the ingredients into the cracked corn and soybeans until all the ingredients are evenly distributed in the container.

      "content": "Add the aragonite and poultry nutri-balancer to the container. Measure 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of aragonite (calcium powder) and 15 pounds (6.8 kg) of poultry nutri-balancer into the feed. Mix the ingredients thoroughly so that the powders are thoroughly distributed through the feed. The poultry nutri-balancer is an important addition to the feed, as it ensures that the chickens receive the nutrients that they need to grow quickly. [3] X Research source If you can’t find these ingredients at your local farm shop, look online or ask your vet to recommend a distributor. Aragonite is mineral found in limestone and is a great source of calcium."

      "content": "Feed each chicken 0.6 pounds (0.27 kg) of the mixture each day. Multiply the amount of feed per chicken by the number of chickens in the coop. Place the feed into a feeder or throw it on the ground once per day. Use 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of feed for every 5 chickens. It is important not to over-feed this mixture to cornish boilers as this can cause fatal heart attacks. This is uncommon as the chickens do not tend to eat more food than they need."

This will help to stop the feed from going mouldy or being contaminated by bugs. [4] X Research source If you see any signs of mice or bugs in the feed, it is best to throw it away and make a new batch."
