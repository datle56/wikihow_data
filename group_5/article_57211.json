For this type of bracelet, you will need seven strings in the color you want your letters to be, and one string only in the color you want your background to be. [1] X Research source Each string should be about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Choose durable string, yarn, or cord rather than thin embroidery floss so the string doesn't break."

Then, look carefully at the leftmost grid column of your chosen letter. Note how many boxes are empty and how many are filled in, as well as what order they occur in. Each box corresponds to the type of knot you will make on one of your 8 strands of thread. If you're knotting across the bracelet to your left, the top box represents the string that's directly adjacent to the string that you're weaving with when you start a row. If you're knotting across the bracelet to your right, the bottom box represents the string that's directly adjacent to your starting string."

So, tie a right knot with your background string on the letter color string directly to its left to start your first row. [5] X Research source To tie a right knot, follow the same procedure as a left knot, but start by looping the background color string around the letter color string directly to its left, and loop counterclockwise instead of clockwise."

If the box is empty, tie a right knot, as described above. If the box is filled, it indicates that you should tie a left downward knot onto the background string with the adjacent letter string. [6] X Research source To tie a left downward knot, position the background string horizontally underneath the letter string you'll be tying with. Then, loop your letter string under and over the horizontal string from the front. Tuck the end of the letter string through the resulting loop, but make sure you're tucking it through the part of the loop that's to the left of the vertical part of the letter string.

Now, instead of tying right knots, go back to tying left knots with your background thread when you see an empty box, and tie right downward knots onto your background thread with the adjacent letter thread when you see a filled box.

You should aim to cut a length of string that fits comfortably around whichever wrist you have in mind, with a couple of inches of extra length so you can tie a knot when it's complete. Since the elastic string is stretchy, you don't need to worry about making your measurements exact. However, it's usually better to have more string than less, because you can always trim off the excess when your project is complete."
