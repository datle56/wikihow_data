      "content": "Move around One of the best and simplest ways to speed up dilation is to get up and move. We know this is easier said than done when you’re pregnant, but a little extra movement can help move labor along. Increasing blood flow can make you dilate faster, and moving around can help the baby’s weight put pressure on the cervix. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try walking around the room every time a commercial comes on. Set a timer for every 30 minutes or so to change positions in bed. Put on some groovy music and dance or sway to the beat. Sit on an exercise ball and softly bounce or make circles with your hips."

[3] X Research source This can ease your worries and help you destress, ultimately aiding dilation. Put on a funny movie and relax with a cozy blanket. Ask your partner or friend to tell you a funny story. Look up funny animal videos online for a good chuckle."

      "content": "Relax Tensing up can hinder labor and make it harder for your cervix to dilate. Relaxing your body and taking time to rest may seem counterintuitive, but it can help speed up dilation. So, don’t hesitate to sit back and put your feet up—you and your baby deserve it! Practice breathing exercises to calm your mind and body. Light a few candles and cuddle up on the couch with a movie or good book. Schedule or ask your partner to give you a massage.

      "title": "Have sex",
      "content": "Have sex Having sex with your partner may help speed up the labor process and encourage your cervix to dilate because it naturally helps you release prostaglandin (a hormone that induces labor). [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In most cases, having sex is safe during pregnancy as long as your water hasn’t broken. Even so, it’s always best to consult your doctor before trying this method. Although studies to support the connection between sex and cervical dilation aren’t entirely conclusive, many doctors still recommend this method to patients who are becoming impatient with their pregnancy.

[7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In a 1999 study, experts found that some patients needed a dose of synthetic oxytocin to help labor progress after nipple stimulation, as the body wasn’t able to naturally produce enough of the hormone on its own.

The most common medications used are prostaglandins, dinoprostone, mifepristone, misoprostol, and oxytocin. These drugs stimulate the body to soften the cervix, relax cervical muscles, and aid dilation. Typically, they’re administered as a gel, vaginal insert, or pill.

      "content": "Mechanical dilation A mechanical dilator may be used to forcibly ripen and dilate the cervix. With this medical method, a Foley catheter is inserted to drain the bladder and inflate a small balloon with water. The balloon is left in the cervix, causing it to soften and dilate over time. [21] X Research source The balloon is typically left inside the cervix for 12 hours or until it falls out on its own. Doctors often use this method if the pregnant individual wishes not to use medication or their cervix is “unripe” or “unfavorable.”"

      "content": "Membrane sweep Sometimes, a doctor may gently dilate the cervix by stripping the membrane. [22] X Research source During a membrane sweep, the doctor will sweep a gloved finger around the cervix to help separate the amniotic sac from the uterus wall. This can only be done once the cervix has started to dilate and is often performed to help speed up natural labor before scheduling an induction. [23] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There’s no guarantee that a membrane sweep will induce labor; however, many individuals have seen satisfactory results. Know that membrane sweeping can be uncomfortable for some patients, as it does involve a physical (and somewhat invasive) examination."

      "title": "Amniotomy",
      "content": "Amniotomy Forcibly breaking a pregnant individual’s water may help speed up labor. When labor starts, the amniotic sac around the baby ruptures, causing the water to break. Some doctors will advise patients to have an amniotomy to intentionally rupture the sac and induce labor. This is done by inserting a thin, plastic tool inside the vagina to tear a hole in the sac. [24] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This procedure can only be done when the baby is low in the pelvis and pressed against the cervix. Most people don’t feel anything during an amniotomy, only a trickle or gush of water once the sac is torn. While mildly invasive, risks still come with an amniotomy, such as infection, intense contractions, and umbilical cord prolapse."

      "title": "Labor is typically induced when a pregnancy is pre- or post-term.",
      "content": "Labor is typically induced when a pregnancy is pre- or post-term. Since the dilation of the cervix happens when labor moves from “early” to “active,” intervening in the process instead of letting it occur naturally is essentially the same as inducing labor. [25] X Expert Source Jennifer Butt, MD Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 13 March 2020. Induction may be advised for several reasons, but more often than not, it’s because a pregnancy is at risk with one or more of these reasons: [26] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re 2 weeks past your due date with no signs of early labor. If your water broke but no contractions have occurred. If you have an infection in the later stages of pregnancy. If there's a problem with the placenta. If you have a medical condition that might pose a risk if you wait too long to have the baby. If you're undergoing a dilation and curettage procedure."

In some instances, induction is necessary, but the risks still include: [27] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Failed induction. When an induction method doesn’t result in a vaginal delivery after 24 hours, a C-section may be performed. Low fetal heart rate. Induced contractions might cut off the baby’s oxygen supply. Infection. Rupturing the membrane can pose a risk to the pregnant individual and baby. Uterine rupture. When the uterus tears and needs to be removed. Bleeding after delivery. When induction methods cause the uterine muscles to work overtime, making it harder for them to contract naturally after birth."
