Just the fact that you have the scoop and he doesn’t will bring him back to you over and over until he finds out what it is. Say teasing things like: “Well, I’m really not supposed to tell anyone about this. Maybe later…” “That’s for me to know and you to find out!” “You don’t know about Alicia’s drama? Interesting…”"

If he thinks he’s got you figured out right away, he might get disinterested in pursuing you. Tease him with phrases like “...but that’s a story for another time” or “Maybe I’ll tell you about it…later.” He’ll be dying to know what you’re keeping hidden!"

A crisis documentary or a psychological thriller would make a great choice for a Netflix-and-chill night (the more complicated twists and turns, the better). Strategy games like Settlers of Catan or chess also appeal to him (and to your fun competitive streak, too!). Going to a museum, art exhibit, or a live performance would also be a great idea if you’re looking to meet up in a neutral space that’s not either of your home. If you need a gift, look for something along the same intellectual lines—mystery novels, history books, or anything about the hidden and unknown workings of the world will thrill him.
