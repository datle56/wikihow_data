      "content": "Boil milk or cream. Bring your milk or cream to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan, stirring frequently. The type of dairy you choose affects both the flavor and texture of the cheese. For a richer cheese, use heavy cream. Alternatively, opt for milk if you want to make a lighter cheese. Just be sure to choose high-quality milk or cream—the fresher, the better!

      "title": "Add acid to curdle the dairy.",
      "content": "Add acid to curdle the dairy. Different recipes call for different acids, including vinegar, lemon juice, buttermilk, citric acid, or rennet. Once your milk or cream is boiling, stir in the acid and watch as the curds and whey begin to separate before your very eyes—it may take 10 minutes or so. [2] X Research source The curds are solid chunks of milk protein, while the whey is the remaining liquid. Using the right amount of acid is really important. If you add too much, the flavor will be off, but if you don't add enough, the milk won't curdle. That's why it's best to follow a recipe until you have some experience with cheese-making."

      "title": "Strain the mixture and add salt and other seasonings.",
      "content": "Strain the mixture and add salt and other seasonings. Pour the mixture through a few pieces of cheesecloth into a strainer. The goal is to catch the curds and let the whey drain out, which may take around 15 minutes. Then, use your hands to press excess liquid out of the cheesecloth, sprinkle salt over the curds, and mix it in. [3] X Research source At this point, you can also add other seasonings, including herbs, if you want."

      "title": "Press the cheese if desired.",
      "content": "Press the cheese if desired. After straining and draining the mixture, your cheese will have a texture similar to ricotta. If you prefer a firmer cheese, wrap the cheese in cheesecloth, shape the curds into a disk, then press the disk between 2 plates. Leave it in the fridge for a few hours or a few days, depending on the texture you're aiming for. [4] X Research source"

After 30 seconds or so, gently stir the culture into the milk. Then, put a lid on the double boiler and wait for 40 minutes.

[12] X Research source Completely stir in each ingredient before adding the next. Once all the ingredients are incorporated, gently stir the milk for up to 1 minute. Annatto adds color, rennet is the acid in the recipe (which separates the milk into curds and whey), and calcium chloride adds calcium to the cheese."
