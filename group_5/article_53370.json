Just play around with the volume and pitch of your voice until you find the perfect combination that’s cute and bubbly. [1] X Research source Need inspiration?

      "content": "Wink, blink, and flirt with your eyes. A huge part of doing aegyo is using your eyes to appear more cute and shy. Make eye contact with the other person, blink a little more rapidly than usual, and flutter your eyelashes. If you’re feeling extra bold, flash a flirtatious wink or widen your eyes to look more engaged during conversation. If you see something cute, you could make a fist and clench it to your chest, then point at what you’re seeing and say, “Aww, that’s so cute!” or “Geugeo neomu gwiyeowo (그거 너무 귀여워)!”"

      "title": "Stretch the final vowels of your words.",
      "content": "Stretch the final vowels of your words. If a word ends in a vowel, exaggerate the vowel so it sounds almost baby-like. For example: “Annyeong Oppa (안녕 오빠)” can turn into “Annyeong OpPAAA,” with the letters in capitals being the sounds that are more pronounced. [2] X Research source \"Annyeong\" means \"hello,\" and \"Oppa\" is a word that girls use to address their older brother or a close older male friend. If you're speaking to an older girl, you can say, “Annyeong Noona (안녕 누나)” instead."

      "content": "Add an ieung (ㅇ) or mieum (ㅁ) at the end of your words. For words that end in a vowel, feel free to attach either consonant at the end to sound even cuter. An ieung (ㅇ) sounds the most similar to “-ng” in English, while a mieum (ㅁ) is the closest to a traditional “-m” sound. Older brother: Change “Oppa (오빠)” to “Oppang (오빵).” I’m hungry: Change “Baegopa (배고파)” to “Baegopayong (배고파용)” Where are you?: Change “Eodiya? (어디야?)” to “Eodiyam? (어디얌?)” I miss you: Change “Bogosipeoyo (보고싶어요)” to “Bogosipeoyong (보고싶어용)” What are you doing?: Change “Mwohaeyo? (뭐해요?)” to “Mwohaeyong? (뭐해용?)” Thank you: Change “Gamsahabnida (감사합니다)” to “Gamsahabnidang (감사합니당).”"

Flowering face: Put the top of your wrists together, then place your palms underneath your chin (so your face looks like a blooming flower)."

      "content": "Define your aegyo-sal with makeup. Your aegyo-sal (애교살) is the puffy area of fat under your eyes that makes you look more cute and innocent. Smile to see the natural shape of your aegyo-sal, then use the contour side of an aegyo-sal pencil to create a shadow below your eye puff. Use the lighter side to highlight your inner corner and the area below your lash line. Blend any harsh lines with your finger. [3] X Research source Alternatively, use a neutral eyeshadow to define the crease of your aegyo-sal, then highlight the puffy area with a champagne or glittery eyeshadow ."
