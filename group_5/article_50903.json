      "content": "Acknowledge your feelings instead of trying to drown them out. When you feel something, take a moment to figure out exactly what you're feeling instead of trying to push it down or numb yourself. Try to find a label for your emotion and express it in some way, even if it's only to yourself. For example, if you've had a bad day, you may want to just drown it out with ice cream. While a little ice cream never hurt anyone, first figure out what you're feeling and why, which will help you deal with the emotion. For instance, maybe you're upset and frustrated because your boss didn't acknowledge your contribution and also wouldn't give you your requested time off. [2] X Research source Expression can mean saying it out loud to another person, but it can also mean doing things like screaming into a pillow when you're angry or having a good cry because you're sad. Understanding and acknowledging your emotions is a big part of being more self-aware, which in turn is a part of being spiritual."

It helps you sort through your feelings about events even if you don't realize it in the moment. For instance, if you're writing about going home to visit family, you may realize you're feeling resentment because they don't reciprocate by coming and visiting you."

Sit down somewhere you're comfortable and close your eyes or lower your eyes to the floor. Check in with yourself while you take a few deep breaths. Feel any pains and aches you have in your body and acknowledge any emotions you might be feeling. Now, focus on what your body can feel. Think about the weight of your body in the chair or on the floor, the cool or warm air surrounding you, the feel of the carpet or clothing on your skin, and anything else you can feel. Try to keep your mind focused on just being aware, not drifting off into thoughts. When one pops up, just acknowledge and gently push it aside to go back to the feelings in your body.
