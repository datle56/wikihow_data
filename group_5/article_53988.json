      "title": "Make jokes",
      "content": "Make jokes that work well in a texting format. These should be jokes that are short and don’t need to be told in person. If you can, try to make jokes that incorporate things that are uniquely available to texts, such as emoticons or gifs. [1] X Research source An example of a joke that works well over text would be: “Where do cows like to go on dates? To the moo-vies.”"

      "title": "Ask questions about her, but don’t overdo it.",
      "content": "Ask questions about her, but don’t overdo it. People tend to enjoy talking about themselves, so be willing to ask her questions about her so that the conversation is enjoyable for her. However, if you focus too much on this type of question-asking, she may start to feel like you’re interrogating her. Be willing to talk about other things too! [2] X Research source For example, if you’ve been talking a lot about her for the last few text messages, try changing the conversation to one of your shared interests and talk about that for a while. Feel free to talk about yourself too! As much as she’ll enjoy talking about herself, she’ll also appreciate being able to learn more about you."

      "content": "Be willing to flirt a little bit when it seems appropriate. If you’re interested in seeing this girl romantically and you think she may want to date you as well, you should move the conversation towards the goal of scheduling a date. In the meantime, do some light flirting to pique her interest and make her feel excited. [3] X Research source For example, if she says something about her hair, tell her how pretty you think her hair is. Choose opportune times to flirt. For instance, say something flirty when the conversation is on a casual topic, but not when you’re discussing something more serious."

      "title": "Aim to keep your exchanges brief at first to keep her interested in you.",
      "content": "Aim to keep your exchanges brief at first to keep her interested in you. Avoid overwhelming her with lots of texts or lots of information; this will make her less likely to be entertained by the conversation. Instead, send relatively short texts that she doesn’t have to spend a lot of time reading. Don’t send more than 1-2 texts at a time. [4] X Research source At the same time, don’t be terse just for the sake of it. Feel free to send a more lengthy text when it’s appropriate (e.g., if she asks you a detailed question), but stick to shorter texts the rest of the time."

      "title": "Spruce up your home to make it more inviting.",
      "content": "Spruce up your home to make it more inviting. Pick up any clothes, books, or other items on the floor and put them away. Straighten up things like chairs, pillows, and kitchen appliances so your place looks neater. This will make your home feel like a more inviting and relaxing space for the girl you’re entertaining to hang out in. You don’t have to deep clean your home (unless it’s really dirty!). Focus right now on making it look nice and decluttering the space. If you’re pressed for time, focus first on those tasks that can be done most quickly (e.g., picking up stuff off the floor). Then, use whatever time you have left to try to tackle bigger tasks (e.g., re-organizing your bathroom counter)."

      "title": "Vacuum and wash your sheets to give your place a cleaner look.",
      "content": "Vacuum and wash your sheets to give your place a cleaner look. Your carpet and sheets are probably a lot dirtier than they look, especially if you don’t clean them on a weekly basis. Vacuuming your floors and washing your sheets will make your place look and smell cleaner on a more subtle level than just organizing your things will. If you have hardwood floors, sweep them with a broom and dustpan first, then vacuum them on the hardwood setting. If you have time, mop them as well to make them look even cleaner."

      "content": "Set the mood by lighting candles or putting out flowers in a vase. Candlelight is especially effective if you want to set a romantic mood for a date. Or, if you just want your place to have a splash of color, put out some flowers or hang some art on the walls. [5] X Research source Whatever you choose to display in your place should not only set the right mood, but also reflect your personality. For example, if you’re really into music, put up some pictures of your favorite musicians."

      "title": "Play board games together for a relaxed but exciting date night.",
      "content": "Play board games together for a relaxed but exciting date night. Choose a board game that’s easy to play with 2 people, instead of a game that requires 3 or more participants. For best results, have a variety of games on hand so you can switch it up from time to time. [6] X Research source For example, have games like Battleship, Connect Four, and Trivial Pursuit in your place. You can play any of these games with just 2 people and they’re also all different types of games. If you have a deck of cards, you can also play a bunch of different 2-person card games as well!"

      "content": "Watch movies or listen to music together for a low-energy activity. This is a great way to just sit on the couch together and have light conversation as you watch a movie or listen to music. Be sure to have access to a variety of different genres so you can switch things up depending on the mood. [7] X Research source For instance, be ready to watch either an action movie, a romance movie, or a comedy. Similarly, prepare a few different playlists that are based around different music genres."

      "content": "Cook and eat a candlelight dinner for a more romantic evening. If you’d like to show off your cooking skills and give her a “pampered” experience, tell her to sit back and relax while you do all the work. Or, if you want to make it a more involved activity, work together to make an interesting meal that you’ll enjoy eating together. [8] X Research source If you’re cooking together and you’re pretty confident in your abilities in the kitchen, try to cook something that neither of you have had before. This will make your dinner even more entertaining for the both of you."

      "title": "Dress nicely for the occasion",
      "content": "Dress nicely for the occasion to make yourself more confident. If you’re entertaining a girl on a date at a fancy restaurant or an upscale venue (e.g., a play), put on something formal like a shirt and tie. If you’re going on a casual date or just entertaining a friend, wear something that you feel comfortable in but that still looks like you put some effort into how you look. [9] X Research source If you wear something that makes you feel more attractive, you’ll be more comfortable and feel more confident while you’re entertaining her. This is especially important if you’re on a date! Don’t dress for the wrong occasion. If you’re going out on a hike, don’t wear a shirt and tie. At the same time, if you’re going to a fancy restaurant, don’t wear a t-shirt, shorts, and open-toed sandals."

      "title": "Plan an activity around something she’s passionate about.",
      "content": "Plan an activity around something she’s passionate about. This can be something you go out and do or just something you can talk about over coffee or dinner. Whatever it is, as long as it’s something she enjoys, she’ll love doing it. [10] X Research source For example, if she’s really into baseball, go see a baseball game. If you can’t afford that, go to the park and throw a baseball around. If you don’t have a baseball, just ask her about her favorite team or player while you’re eating ice cream! If you’re not sure what she’s passionate about, ask her! It may feel a little awkward, but it’s much better than running the risk of her being bored with whatever activity you plan to do."

      "title": "Take her to do something that she’s never done before.",
      "content": "Take her to do something that she’s never done before. This will be very exciting (and thus very entertaining) for her, especially if it’s something she’s wanted to do for a long time. However, don’t do something that you don’t think she’d actually enjoy. This will probably just make her bored. [11] X Research source For example, don’t take her to a death metal concert if she’s never expressed any interest in this or similar genres of music. Sure it’s something that she’s never done before, but that doesn’t necessarily mean she’ll like the experience of a death metal concert."

      "title": "Surprise her with a trip to an interesting location, if she likes surprises.",
      "content": "Surprise her with a trip to an interesting location, if she likes surprises. This should be a place that you think she’ll enjoy visiting, not just a place that you think is interesting. Try to take her to a place she’s always talked about visiting to make sure she’ll be entertained. [12] X Research source For instance, if you live along the coast of Georgia and she loves historical cities, take her on a day trip to Savannah. Avoid going anywhere that takes a lot of time or money to travel to. Wherever you go should be somewhere you can drive to in 2 hours or less. Otherwise, she may be in for a very boring car ride. Note that you should only go this route if she likes surprises. If she prefers to have more control over the things she does, she may not like being taken somewhere by surprise."

      "content": "Do something creative together if you want to build a better connection. Activities where you work together to create something or accomplish some task are a great way for you two to bond together over that shared experience. If you’ve never done this type of bonding activity before or you haven’t hung out before, opt for something simple at first. [13] X Research source For example, if this is a first date, do something like cook a small meal together or put together a small jigsaw puzzle. If you’re entertaining someone that you’ve known for a while or who you’ve been on a first date with already, try a larger project like painting a room together."

      "content": "Don’t talk about exes or other sensitive topics, at least in the beginning. These topics run the risk of alienating her or making her feel uncomfortable instead of entertained. Some topics you should avoid at first include: Politics & Religion (though for some people, these make for the best conversations) Sexually Transmitted Diseases Previous relationships (hers or yours) [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Refrain from having too much to drink when you’re with her.",
      "content": "Refrain from having too much to drink when you’re with her. Although having a beer or two may help you feel more relaxed, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself if you drink too much. Avoid having more than one drink beforehand and don’t go out for drinks if you feel you may end up drinking too much. [15] X Research source Becoming too drunk can also lead to a problematic sexual encounter, depending on the circumstances. If you’re drinking together, make sure you stay in a public place and practice safety at all times."

Remind yourself that it’s ok if things don’t work out or if the date isn’t perfect. Keep your mind on the present and focus on having a good time, and don't worry about trying to impress her.
