      "content": "It's common knowledge that intelligent people tend to use longer words. However, when someone intentionally warps their speech into a bunch of--ahem--sesquipedalian, loquacious verbiage--it looks silly, and is obviously fake. Intelligent people use longer words because they're more precise and efficient, and they help explain things in a way that's more easily understood (if you can get a handle on the vocabulary, at least). Avoid slang terms. Using slang terms generally doesn't improve your image, and it may make some people less likely to see you in an intelligent light."

      "title": "Make sure people can understand you.",
      "content": "Make sure people can understand you. When people can hear what you're saying, they're more likely to pay attention and respect you because you sound intelligent. Avoid covering your mouth when you speak. This can muffle your voice and make you seem uncertain and confused."

      "title": "The less you say, the less room there is for people to judge you.",
      "content": "The less you say, the less room there is for people to judge you. If you don't know much about the subject, or feel uncomfortable with the topic at hand, avoid chiming in to the conversation. This leaves you vulnerable to making mistakes that could tarnish your intelligent reputation."

      "title": "Sentence fillers are words like 'umm', 'errr', and 'like'.",
      "content": "Sentence fillers are words like 'umm', 'errr', and 'like'. They make you appear as if you don't know what you are talking about or just appears as less mature. The best way to avoid sentence fillers is to plan out your next statement. By taking a few seconds to gather your thoughts before speaking, you'll lessen the chance that you'll stumble over your words."

      "title": "Your best option is a 'smart-casual' wardrobe.",
      "content": "Your best option is a 'smart-casual' wardrobe. You will need several blazers (preferably tweed), various shirts/blouses and smart-looking trousers. Maintaining your appearance will help create the illusion that you're an intelligent and precise person. While a neat haircut isn't quite indicative of intellect, it shows that you want to look smart but low-maintenance (i.e. not wanting to style your hair every morning, but still caring about your appearance)."

      "content": "Want to carry on a conversation with your well-read friends? If you don't have much patience for the classics, read CliffNotes or watch a film adaptation so you at least know what they're about. Familiarise yourself with famous authors and popular philosophies. Get abbreviated, crash-course lessons on a couple different topics of your choice. Search on the Internet. Mildly interested in psychology? Try the book Psych101--it's a small book that'll familiarize you with the basic theories and theorists, and you can pick it up and read little bits at your leisure. Many quick explanations of higher-level topics can be found on video-streaming websites, such as Youtube . You could begin by searching for \"Quick Philosophical Topics\" and perusing what shows up!"

      "content": "The primary reason to swear is to use shock tactics. Using language that society has deemed inappropriate is supposed to add meaning to your statements. Intelligent people have better ways to make their point than bad language, and they tend to look down upon profanity. Rather than use foul language, try to explain your emotions using more efficient terminology. In addition to avoiding profanity, you'll impress your friends with your newfound vocabulary."
