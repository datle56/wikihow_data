      "content": "Born between April 17-23, this cusp is brave, confident, and driven. The Aries-Taurus cusp is also known as the Cusp of Power—so it’s really no wonder that people born under this cusp are true forces of nature! When Aries’ fiery passion and energy meet Taurus’ steady endurance, the result is a cusp sign with tons of strength, authority, and the overwhelming drive to succeed in life. In short, this combination of sign energies is nearly unstoppable! [1] X Research source If your birthday falls within the Aries-Taurus cusp, it means you were born during the time of year when the sun moves from Aries to Taurus—and, as such, you’re heavily influenced by both signs. Aries is a high-energy fire sign ruled by Mars, the planet of action. Meanwhile, Taurus is a practical earth sign ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty and love. Famous Aries-Taurus cusps include George Takei, Kate Hudson, Conan O'Brien, Jack Nicholson, John Cena, Victoria Beckham, and Kourtney Kardashian."

      "content": "Courageous Aries-Taurus cusps inherit their boldness and bravery from fiery Aries; they’re never afraid to stand up for themselves, speak their mind, or take on a challenge. In fact, they’re thrilled by the prospect of a challenging task or project! Taurus’ influence also gives this cusp a more grounded form of courage; as bold as they can be, they’re more likely to think through a situation carefully before making a decision.

      "title": "Motivated",
      "content": "Motivated Because Aries-Taurus cusps are influenced by Mars, the planet of action, they often have a strong sense of motivation and the determination to achieve their goals. They also have a thick skin (thanks to the pull of Taurus) and can handle a lot of work without getting overwhelmed, giving this cusp the high potential for success. They’re high achievers with the drive to chase their ambitions. [3] X Research source Aries is a cardinal sign, meaning they’re the “initiators” of the zodiac. Aries specializes in being a trendsetter and coming up with brilliant new ideas. Taurus is a fixed sign, meaning they’re the “stabilizers” of the zodiac. That makes Taurus a dedicated, loyal, and very focused sign. Because Aries-Taurus cusps feel the pull of cardinal sign Aries and fixed sign Taurus, they often have the power to both initiate new projects and singlehandedly see them through to completion."

      "title": "Authoritative",
      "content": "Authoritative Because they’re born on the Cusp of Power, an Aries-Taurus cusp has the makings of a great leader. They have the ambition and motivation to get ahead in life, the power to influence other people, and they’re highly likely to have a successful professional life . Venus’ influence (as Taurus’ ruling planet) makes Aries-Taurus cusps very persuasive, and other people often come to them for advice and inspiration. If you’re an Aries Venus cusp, you also have the tendency to be very forceful and have strong opinions. When people come to you for advice, make a point to be kind and thoughtful when you respond. Your forcefulness and blunt honesty may sometimes rub others the wrong way, but you can easily soften it with a smile and an upbeat, friendly attitude."

      "title": "Energetic",
      "content": "Energetic Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet of action, which means Aries-Taurus cusps have tons of energy, both figuratively and literally. They have the passion and enthusiasm to excel in their professional life, and they tend to be very active, adventurous people. They love being out and about, and while they know how to work hard, they play hard, too. If you’re an Aries-Taurus cusp, you’re probably very outgoing. You have tons of energy for socializing and can figure out a way to have fun just about anywhere. As an Aries-Taurus cusp, odds are you have a bit of an “athleisure” aesthetic. Taurus loves feeling comfy, while Aries is always on the go—so cozy clothing designed for an active lifestyle is right up the Aries-Taurus cusp’s alley."

      "title": "Independent",
      "content": "Independent Aries-Taurus cusps love spending time with friends and family but rarely rely on other people for support. They value their independence and typically have the ability to protect and care for themselves. Plus, with such an energetic and fun-loving nature, an Aries-Taurus cusp is often their own best friend; they have no trouble making their own fun and prefer to solve problems independently. If you’re an Aries-Taurus cusp, remember not to let your independent nature create distance between you and those you care about. Try to ask for help from time to time or seek out someone else’s advice on an issue you’re dealing with. It’s not a sign of weakness to let others help you, and it’ll bring you closer to the people you love!"

      "title": "Sensual",
      "content": "Sensual Mars (Aries’ ruling planet) represents raw desire and passion in astrology. Meanwhile, Taurus is ruled by Venus, which is an extremely romantic planet. Because Aries-Taurus cusps feel the pull of both signs, they tend to be extremely passionate and have high libidos in relationships. Aries inspires lust, while Taurus makes them sultry and seductive; thus, a healthy and happy intimate life is very important to Aries-Taurus cusps."

      "title": "Good-natured",
      "content": "Good-natured Because they’re fixed signs, Tauruses are reliable and loyal friends. Meanwhile, Aries is more impulsive and wild—but they have huge hearts and are always ready to cheer up friends and loved ones with their upbeat attitude. Thus, Aries-Taurus cusps are known for being amazing friends and very good-natured people: they’re steadfast, dependable, and a constant source of positive energy. Aries-Taurus cusps are also funny! They tend to have a sassy sense of humor—and because they’re thick-skinned, they can also take a joke."

      "title": "Stubborn",
      "content": "Stubborn Individually, Taurus and Aries both have a reputation for stubbornness, so an Aries-Taurus cusp can be extremely obstinate. They tend to dig their heels in and refuse to budge when they feel strongly about something, whether it’s an opinion or a project idea. They like doing things their way and aren’t usually interested in alternatives. They also move at their own pace and absolutely refuse to be rushed (or held back). [4] X Research source Impulsive, free-spirited Aries can be impatient. Meanwhile, methodical Taurus is naturally stubborn because they’re a fixed sign. That’s why Aries-Taurus cusps always insist on moving at their own pace, whether they’re rushing to finish a project or taking things slowly, one step at a time. If you’re an Aries-Taurus cusp, try compromising more often, and listen actively to other peoples’ ideas, even if you don’t always agree with them."

      "title": "Controlling",
      "content": "Controlling It can be tough for an Aries-Taurus cusp to share their responsibilities with other people. They tend to prioritize their independence so much that they have a hard time letting anyone else take control of a situation. They can even be a little pushy, especially when it comes to sharing their opinions and dictating how something should be done. For an Aries-Taurus cusp, it’s their way or the highway! [5] X Research source If you’re an Aries-Taurus cusp, remember that letting someone else step up and take the reigns sometimes isn’t the end of the world. Make a point to collaborate with other people rather than doing everything solo. A little flexibility can go a long way toward making you more of a team player—and a better leader. Additionally, try delegating some of your tasks or projects to other people. Learn to let go and resist the urge to control every situation that arises."

      "title": "Self-centered",
      "content": "Self-centered Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and it’s reflected in Aries’ “me-first” attitude. They’re energetic and determined to go far in life—but because they prefer to do things their way, they may forget to consider other people’s feelings along the way. Thus, Aries-Taurus cusps (which are heavily influenced by Aries) may also struggle with selfishness and be a little oblivious to other people’s needs. If you’re an Aries-Taurus cusp, practice being more empathetic to the feelings of those around you. You’ve already got the makings of a great leader, and with a little empathy and understanding, you can become an approachable leader who inspires others!"

      "title": "Aries-Taurus cusps are compatible with earth and air signs.",
      "content": "Aries-Taurus cusps are compatible with earth and air signs. Earth signs tend to be compatible with one another. Since Taurus is an earth sign, Aries-Taurus cusps tend to get along great with fellow earth signs Virgo and Capricorn . Practical and hardworking earth signs can easily understand an Aries-Taurus cusp’s ambition and desire for success. Meanwhile, air signs Libra, Aquarius, and Gemini are free-spirited, so they’ll easily understand an Aries-Taurus cusp’s desire for autonomy.
