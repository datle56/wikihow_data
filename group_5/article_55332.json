      "content": "“Good to know” shows appreciation for learning something useful. When someone says “Good to know,” they’re letting you know that they’re thankful for something you told them or made them aware of. For example, you might've updated your friend when your plane lands or shared a cool fact about the movie you’re watching—whatever you told them was helpful, so they’re grateful. [1] X Research source You : “FYI my plane is landing at 4 instead of 3 now.” Your friend : “Okay, good to know. I’ll be there to pick you up.” You : “Apparently this whole movie was filmed on a phone camera and won a lot of awards.” Your friend : “Oh cool, good to know!” You : “I heard Ms. Thompson is collecting our homework on Monday.” Your friend : “Good to know.

      "content": "“Good to know” can be a polite way to simply acknowledge information. Sometimes, “Good to know” is just a neutral response to something you said.

In this case, their “Good to know” might sound indifferent instead of appreciative or enthusiastic. You : “I really love this yogurt because it has a lot of protein.” Your friend : “Huh, good to know.” You : “My relatives are over in Italy right now, it looks like they’re having a fun time.” Your friend : “That’s good to know.” You : “I’m always cold, so I’d bring a jacket to the restaurant.” Your friend : “I don’t typically run cold, but good to know.”"

Apparently, they weren’t on the same page.” Your friend : “No way! That’s so good to know.” You : “Hey, I just checked the forecast and it’s supposed to storm in a few minutes.” Your friend : “Wow, good to know. I couldn’t tell due to all that thunder in the distance.” You : “Don’t forget to put the milk back in the fridge, it’ll spoil if you keep it out.” Your friend : “Really?! Good to know.”"
