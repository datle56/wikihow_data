      "content": "Determine whether it is business or non-business bad debt. The IRS distinguishes clearly between business and non-business types of bad debt. Business bad debt is a worthless (uncollectible) debt that was created or acquired during the course of business. This might includes loans or credit sales to customers or vendors, or business loan guarantees. Nonbusiness bad debts are defined more broadly as all other bad debts (not related to business). To be a bad debt, the debt must be considered \"worthless.\" That is, reasonable efforts must have been made to collect the debt. A debt is considered a bad debt when, even after attempting collection, there is no expectation that the debt will be repaid.

This might include a schedule, payment amount, interest rate, fees, and other details. Check the agreement again to be sure that the debtor is in violation of its terms. Debts without a signed agreement will be more difficult or impossible to collect, as it may seem that they are a gift. [3] X Research source"

These step may be laid out in a debt collection policy on the lender's side. For example, a lender might work with the debtor to accept a payment gap or create a payment plan. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine which treatment method is used.",
      "content": "Determine which treatment method is used. As a lender, there are two major treatments that can be used when dealing with business bad debt. The first, the direct write-off method, accounts for bad debts only when they are confirmed to be uncollectible. This is the simpler of the two methods, but sometimes must be amended if the borrower eventually does pay the debt. The other method is the allowance for doubtful accounts. This method sets aside an amount to account for bad debts before the debts are deemed uncollectible. The amount is set using estimates from historical bad debt percentages. [7] X Research source Use the method established in your bookkeeping procedures. If there is no existing method, use the direct write-off method to start. You can always use the allowance method once you know how much bad debt to expect."

    {
      "title": "Write off bad debt",
      "content": "Write off bad debt expenses. The direct write-off method requires the creation of an expense account that will record the bad debt expenses experienced throughout the period. When a bad debt is recorded, it is recorded as a debit to Bad Debt Expense and a credit to Account Receivable, both for the amount of the bad debt. [8] X Research source For example, a $2,000 bad debt would be recorded as a debit to Bad Debt Expense for $2,000 and a credit to Account Receivable for $2,000."

      "title": "Establish an allowance for doubtful accounts.",
      "content": "Establish an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts operates as a contra-asset account to Accounts Receivable. This means that it is presented on the assets portion of the balance sheet. The account is used to hold money that will cover bad debts throughout the period. The amount of the allowance can be calculated in several different ways, including as a percentage of Accounts Receivable, a percentage of total sales, or through a more complex account aging schedule.

For the allowance method, the journal entries will reflect a reduction in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts account for each bad debt expense. This would be reflected as a credit to Accounts Receivable and a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, both in the amount of the bad debt. [10] X Research source For example, a $1,000 unpaid account balance would be recorded as a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and a credit to Account Receivable, both for $1,000."

Under the allowance method, the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is presented as a contra-asset account under Account Receivable on the Balance Sheet. This means that under Accounts Receivable, the following line is used: \"Less: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.\" This line shows the allowance for doubtful accounts and is used to reduce Accounts Receivable to arrive at a third line, Accounts Receivable, net. As the allowance is drawn down, Accounts Receivable goes down as well, meaning that net Accounts Receivable remains the same. [11] X Research source"

Short-term debts should be handled using the bad debt allowance method, which predicts in advance that a portion of the debts will need to be forgiven. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Attempt to restructure the debt before writing it off.",
      "content": "Attempt to restructure the debt before writing it off. Debts should only be forgiven (written off) if the possibility of collection is impossibly low. Before proceeding with a write-off (which harms both the lender, who loses money, and the borrower, whose credit rating is damaged), reasonable efforts should be made to restructure the debt. For example, consider a company that has issued a long-term note to a customer with a face value of $10,000, an annual interest rate of 12 percent, and a length of 5 years. If the customer cannot pay the note, the company might consider allowing the customer to swap the note for one with a smaller interest rate or longer term. This would ease the burden on the customer. All actions taken to restructure debt should be recorded in the notes section of the financial statements."

This entry shows a debit to Bad Debt expense and a credit to the associated receivable account. Continuing with the example above, assume the customer owes $10,120 upon the note's maturation (the face value plus the last year's interest). If the entire debt is forgiven, the lender should debit Bad Debt Expense for $10,120, credit Notes Receivable for $10,000, and credit Interest Receivable for $120. [13] X Research source For notes issued to customers for the purchase of the lender's products, it is also appropriate to transfer the Notes Receivable balance to Accounts Receivable, where it can be handled using the allowance method. In this case, the lender would debit Accounts Receivable for $10,120, credit Notes Receivable for $10,000, and credit Interest Receivable for $120."

You may not be required to pay taxes if your debts were forgiven through bankruptcy proceedings, if you are financial insolvent, or on certain farm or non-recourse loans.
