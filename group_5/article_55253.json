      "title": "Reach level 45.",
      "content": "Reach level 45. Before you can unlock (and travel to) Argus, your character must be at least level 45. Simply playing the game will eventually get you to level 45 if you aren’t there already! [1] X Research source For example, playing the Exile’s Reach area starting at level 1 is an easy way to get to level 10 relatively fast—and then, playing through an old World of Warcraft expansion like Battle for Azeroth, Wilds of Pandaria, Legion (which is also needed to reach Argus), or Fall of the Lich King can take you from level 10 to 60. Don’t worry if you start a different expansion and need to switch to Legion at level 45 to get to Argus; you can jump between WoW expansions as often as you like!"

      "title": "Travel to Dalaran.",
      "content": "Travel to Dalaran. As mentioned above, completing parts of the Legion expansion is vital to reaching Argus—and to do that, you’ll need to go to the floating city of Dalaran. Luckily, there are multiple ways to get to Dalaran. You can get there quickly by taking a portal in Valdrakken’s town square (outside the Seat of the Aspects) or by taking a portal to Azsuna from your character’s capital city and then flying to Dalaran . [2] X Research source If you haven’t been to Dalaran before, you can also get to Dalaran by starting the Legion expansion questline in your faction’s capital city; the questline will eventually lead to Dalaran. Additionally, using any of the above methods to get to Dalaran will help you earn a Dalaran Hearthstone, allowing you to teleport to Dalaran at will. Your character’s capital city depends on their faction; it’s Orgrimmar if they’re in the Horde and Stormwind City if they’re in the Alliance."

      "content": "Speak to Khadgar and get the “Uniting the Isle” quest. Once you arrive in Dalaran, visit Khadgar in the Violet Citadel (on the city's west side) to pick up “Uniting the Isles,” an extensive quest with multiple objectives. It involves reaching a “friendly” reputation with the 5 main Legion factions by completing quests and objectives in each faction’s zone. Finish “Uniting the Isles” to get one step closer to reaching Argus! [3] X Research source The factions you’ll need to appease include: The Court of Farondis in Azsuna The Highmountain Tribe in Highmountain The Nightfallen in Suramar The Dreamweaves in Val’sharah The Valarjar in Stormheim"

      "title": "Complete the Broken Shore introduction quests.",
      "content": "Complete the Broken Shore introduction quests. With “Uniting the Isles” complete, speak to Archmage Khadgar again, and he’ll give you a series of introductory quests that eventually lead to Broken Shore. Make sure you finish (and turn in) the “Armies of Legionfall” quest, followed by the “Assault on Broken Shore” quest. Once you complete both and return to Khadgar, you’ll be a step closer to Argus. [4] X Research source For “Armies of Legionfall,” you’ll find Khadgar Krasus’ Landing on the east side of Dalaran, near the flight path (rather than at the Violet Citadel) at the coordinates 69, 43. “Assault on Broken Shore” is simply the next step in the “Armies of Legionfall” scenario; the first quest leads directly into the next one."

      "content": "Acquire and complete “The Hand of Fate” quest. When you’re done with the previous quests, return to Khadgar at the Violet Citadel (which is the same place you went for “Uniting the Isles”) and he’ll give you a new quest: “The Hand of Fate.” To get to Argus, all you need to do from there is finish “The Hand of Fate.” At the quest's end, Argus will be unlocked for you and your WoW character! [5] X Research source Once on Argus, complete its associated campaign to earn the “You Are Now Prepared” achievement. You can also play Antorus, the Burning Throne, a raid located in the central-west region of the Antoran Wastes fragment on Argus. You can find the raid’s entrance south of the bridge to the Burning Breach, close to the Felfire Armory. Reaching Argus also unlocks two allied races: the Void Elves and Lightforged Draenei. To get the Lightforged Draenei intro questline, complete Argus’ campaign first."

      "content": "Go to Krasus’ Landing and use the lightforged beacon to get to Argus. Want to get back to Argus in the future? Make sure you complete the Argus storyline at least through “Rendezvous,” the 11th quest in the overall quest progression (which begins with “The Hand of Fate”). Completing “Rendezvous” calls down a lightforged beacon on Krasus’ Landing (near Dalaran), which you can use to teleport back to Argus whenever you want! [6] X Research source If you don’t see the lightforged beacon, you may have left Argus before completing “Rendezvous.” Don’t worry: there’s still a way to get back. If you’re in the Alliance faction, speak to Veressa Windrunner at the Stormwind City docks to return to Argus. If you’re in the Horde faction, speak to Lady Liadrin at Orgrimmar’s docks to return to Argus."

First introduced to the game with patch 7.3.0, Argus has 3 main zones for players to explore: Krokuun, Eredath, and the Antoran Wastes. Once described as a utopian world, Argus is now located within the Twisting Nether, marred by demonic energy and the current home of the Burning Legion (an army of demons dedicated to eradicating all life). [7] X Research source Like the Isle of Thunder , Argus is a no-fly zone (meaning flying is restricted there). The Argus storyline (a series of quests related to the world of Argus) involves heroes of Azeroth traveling to Argus to fight the Burning Legion and end its threat once and for all!"
