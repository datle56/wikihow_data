[1] X Research source To quickly wipe only the file system headers, use: sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdX To overwrite all the data on the hard drive, use: sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=1M . You will not see a progress bar or any other output, but if your external hard drive has a lamp that blinks when the drive is written to, it should start blinking. If the external hard drive is big, expect that you will need to wait a long time. While it depends on the device and the hard drive, a possible speed is 30 MB per second, taking about 2½ hours for 256 GB. If you want to see the progress, find out the process ID of the dd , then open another terminal and use sudo kill -USR1 pid ( pid being your process ID). This will not terminate the process (as kill without the -USR1 parameter would do), but just tells it to print how many bytes it has copied. Using sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M to overwrite with zeroes instead may be faster, but is somewhat less secure than overwriting with random data [2] X Research source ."
