      "content": "Wipe up wet paint spills immediately. Wet paint is easier to clean, so work fast so the paint doesn’t have a chance to dry. Dampen a cloth or paper towel and use it to wipe up the paint. If you clean it up immediately, you can usually remove all traces of paint. [1] X Research source Take care that you don’t spread the paint to the grout as you clean the tile. If you get wet paint on grout, wipe it up as soon as possible so it doesn’t dry."

      "title": "Scrape off dried paint with a utility knife.",
      "content": "Scrape off dried paint with a utility knife. This is a great option if the paint is thick or already peeling. Hold your utility knife (or another scraper) at a 45-degree angle and work it across the edges of the paint spill. By pushing the blade at this angle, the paint will come off without scratching the tile. [2] X Research source Use caution if you’re cleaning glass or marble tiles, as it’s easy to accidentally scratch these materials. If you don’t have a utility knife, use a putty knife , razor blade, or painter’s knife . Always be careful when handling a sharp utility knife or other blade."

      "title": "Soften dried paint with heat.",
      "content": "Soften dried paint with heat. If you’re struggling to scrape off the paint, use a heat gun or hair dryer to loosen it. Turn the heat to high and direct it at the paint until it liquefies. Then, simply wipe it off with a rag or scrape it off with a utility knife or other scraping tool. [3] X Research source Open a window or turn on a fan to improve ventilation so you don’t breathe in paint fumes."

      "title": "Use vinegar for a natural and effective solution.",
      "content": "Use vinegar for a natural and effective solution. Vinegar is an amazing cleaning product—mix equal parts vinegar and hot water. Then, dip a sponge or scouring pad into the solution and scrub the tile. The vinegar will break up the paint so you can wipe it away. [4] X Research source Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the solution for even deeper cleaning. Baking soda is naturally abrasive, so it can remove the paint without scratching your tile. Do not use vinegar if your tiles are made of limestone. Acidic products can wear the material out. Mendes says, “Always test any product in a small area first to ensure it doesn't cause any damage to the tile.”"

      "title": "Use a paint remover or thinner on latex or oil-based paint.",
      "content": "Use a paint remover or thinner on latex or oil-based paint. Latex and oil paints are often harder to remove than acrylic, so opt for a paint remover product or paint thinner to get rid of stubborn stains. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply the product correctly; usually, you’ll spray the product onto the tile and let it sit before wiping it off with a cloth. Rinse the area with clean, soapy water when you’re done. [5] X Research source Before using a commercial paint remover, test it on an inconspicuous area to see how it reacts with the tile. Some paint removers can irritate or burn skin, so wear rubber gloves, protective eyewear, and a dust mask when using it. If the paint is tough, it may be necessary to scrape it off after applying the paint remover. In some cases, Mendes says dried paint “may require professional cleaning or cleaning devices.” If nothing you do seems to work, consider hiring a professional cleaner to get the job done."

      "title": "Apply nail polish remover to oil or water-based paints.",
      "content": "Apply nail polish remover to oil or water-based paints. Acetone, which is in most nail polish removers, can effectively remove both wet and dry oil-based paints as well as water-based. Pour some nail polish remover onto a microfiber cloth and dab it on the tile. Let it sit for a few minutes to soften the paint, then scrub the tiles to remove excess paint. Rinse with soapy water to remove any remaining acetone. [6] X Research source Mendes says, “The best products for removing dried paint from tiles include rubbing alcohol, acetone, or nail polish remover containing acetone. These solutions effectively break down the paint without damaging the tile surface.”"

      "content": "Scrub away small flecks or minor residue with soapy water. Use the rough side of a scouring pad to remove lingering traces of paint. Dip the scouring pad into a bucket of warm, soapy water and scrub the tile until all the paint is gone. Avoid using an abrasive pad like steel wool or sandpaper, as these can damage even the sturdiest ceramic tiles. [7] X Research source"

Then, work the solution of your choice into the grout with the brush to clean it . Rinse the grout with warm water and let it dry. [8] X Research source To dilute bleach, combine 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 ml) of bleach with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water in a large bucket. Do not use bleach if you have colored grout, as it could discolor it. Do not mix bleach with other cleaning products."

      "content": "Blot water-based paint with rubbing alcohol. Alcohol (or acetone) can also be an effective way to remove paint from grout, as it can be used to get paint out of most surfaces. [9] X Research source Dip a cloth into the alcohol and dab at the stained grout until the paint comes off. Avoid rubbing the paint, as this can make the stain worse. Rubbing alcohol may not remove oil-based paint. Acetone usually does a better job at this."

      "title": "Apply epoxy if you can’t remove the stain.",
      "content": "Apply epoxy if you can’t remove the stain. Grout’s porous surface often soaks up paint quickly, making it difficult, or even impossible, to remove it entirely. If you don’t want to scrape and regrout the area, consider applying a colored epoxy to the grout instead. This can restore the grout’s color and help seal its surface. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to apply it correctly. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Will rubbing alcohol remove paint from tile? Rubbing alcohol can remove water-based paint but not oil-based. Dab a cloth in rubbing alcohol and rub it on a small, inconspicuous area. If the paint comes off easily, it’s water-based. Make sure the alcohol doesn’t damage the tile’s surface before applying it to the rest of the stained area. [11] X Research source"
