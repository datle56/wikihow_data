      "content": "An Aquarius is loyal if there’s mutual respect. Aquariuses have a reputation for being free-spirited and a bit flighty when it comes to facing expressions of emotion from others. However, when they feel truly respected and accepted by someone, their trust in and loyalty to that person becomes stronger. It may just take a bit of time, but keeping an open mind and being accepting of an Aquarius’ desire for freedom is what will ultimately earn their loyalty. [1] X Research source Aquariuses are very protective of their independence and freedom, so being in relationships or friendships can sometimes make them feel like their individuality is being threatened. As an air sign, Aquariuses are naturally curious and creative individuals, so it can be hard to stand still for long. However, Aquariuses also dislike feeling lonely and will seek out connections with other people. They’re ruled by Saturn, which is the planet of commitment and longevity. As a fixed sign, those born under Aquarius are also very steady in their beliefs and relationships."

      "content": "Aquariuses value independence over blind loyalty and faith. When an Aquarius finds a partner that they truly trust and respect (and vice versa), they’ll remain loyal.

Aquariuses believe in equality and mutual independence, and they give love based on what they think is beneficial for both partners. [4] X Research source Aquariuses tend to blur the line between friends and lovers, so they can be very casual about commitment until they find someone they truly care about. Aquariuses value honesty and integrity. If they feel like something isn’t working out in a romantic relationship, they’ll likely tell you."

      "content": "Aquariuses need time to establish closeness with friends. People born under Aquarius are very social individuals. They love to meet new people and learn from them since it’s a way to add to their own intellect. It can take a bit of time for an Aquarius to establish a genuine sense of closeness with a friend, but when they do, they’ll do whatever it takes to support and help that person. [5] X Research source To an Aquarius, friendships are the best kind of bond because they don’t often demand emotional commitment like a romantic relationship might. As someone who has a more difficult time opening up and being vulnerable, this is ideal for an Aquarius. However, even with friends, Aquariuses may pull away and act distant when they get too lost in their own thoughts or obsessed with projects. [6] X Research source Aquariuses take disappointments in friendship very seriously, and feeling betrayed by a friend can be very hard on them. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Be open and honest with them. Aquariuses are great communicators, and they’re always ready to speak their minds, especially if something’s bothering them. If you want an Aquarius to stick by you and stay loyal, show them the same respect and be honest with them. Keeping secrets and being dishonest can feel like a betrayal to an Aquarius, and it can be hard to get back into their good graces once they’ve deemed you as someone they can no longer trust. For example, if you want to date an Aquarius , practice good communication and be direct about your wants and needs. Avoid lying just to spare their feelings. They’d rather hear the truth than be given a white lie that’s meant to make them feel better."
