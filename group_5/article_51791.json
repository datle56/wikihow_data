      "content": "Put the watch face down on a folded cloth or towel. Spread the cloth onto a flat surface, such as a table or countertop, that you will use as a workspace. This protects the face of your watch and helps you avoid scratching the glass. Always remove the spring bar from the back to avoid scratching the crystal covering your watch’s face.

      "content": "Locate the spring bar and detach it from the watch case. Look closely at the area where the watch band connects to the watch case. The vast majority of watch bands are connected by a spring bar, which passes through a loop or hole in the band and fits into indents on the shoulders of the watch, says Green. Insert the forked end of a spring bar tool between the band and where the spring bar connects with the watch shoulder or lug. Gently push the spring bar down and release it from the lug. [2] X Research source If you don't have a spring bar tool, try removing the spring bar using a small flathead screwdriver or something similar. You may also be able to remove it without any tools, just by using your fingernail, but this will be trickier. Another option is trying to use a paperclip to compress one end of the spring bar and then carefully lever out the band. When using any tool, be careful not to scratch your watch or damage the band."

      "title": "Remove the spring bars from the band.",
      "content": "Remove the spring bars from the band. Once you detach the band from the watch, slide the spring bar out of the loops at the ends of the band and put them to one side. Do this for each half of the band. You may need these bars to attach the new band, so it's important you don't lose them. [3] X Research source Check if your watch has end caps before removing the spring bar by looking at the space between the lugs. If it appears that the band flows into the watch case and there are no gaps, you probably have end caps. If uncertain, turn it over and look from the back. A watch with end caps has an extra metal piece at the end of the band with two parts protruding out like wings on either side. [4] X Research source The spring bar also attaches the end caps to the band and watch case, so once you release the spring bar, they may fall, so keep an eye out for them."

      "content": "Thread the spring bar through the ends of the new band. When you’re ready to attach your replacement watch band , you basically go through the same process, but in reverse. Start by carefully threading the spring bars through the loop or hole at the top of each side of the band. [5] X Research source Your new band may have come with its own spring bars. Make sure they fit the indents in your watch lugs."

      "title": "Insert the bottom end of one spring bar into the watch lug indent.",
      "content": "Insert the bottom end of one spring bar into the watch lug indent. Take one half of the band, and carefully place the bottom part of the spring bar into the indent in the shoulder, or case lug, of the watch. Put the spring bar back into the place where it was before you took off the old band. [6] X Research source Once the bottom end of the spring bar is in the hole, carefully apply pressure downwards on the bar so you can slide the top part into the corresponding lug indent or hole. You may find it easier to use your tool to compress the spring bar when you are maneuvering it."

      "title": "Place the second spring bar to install the other side of the watch band.",
      "content": "Place the second spring bar to install the other side of the watch band. Now repeat the process with the other half of the band. Begin by slipping the bottom part of the spring bar into the small hole in the watch case’s lug. Then, gently press down and slide the other end of the bar into the opposite hole. [7] X Research source Listen for a slight clicking sound that indicates the bar is fixed in the place in the hole. Once both parts of the band are in, check they are securely positioned and your band is not likely to fall off. If the watchband has end caps, slide the spring bar into the end caps first. Then move it into position between the lugs, pressing the bottom of the spring bar into the lower lug. Depress the spring bar, and after some maneuvering, click it into the hole in the top lug. [8] X Research source Bands with end caps have less regular sizing than flat-ended bands, so it is advisable to check with a watchmaker or jeweler to ensure your new band will fit."

Green says that with the right tools and some practice, it is quite simple to change the band, so the jeweler will be able to do it very quickly. If you are buying a new band, the jeweler will often offer to change the band for you for free."

For instance, many of the Rolexes, you have to unscrew.” If there are small holes on the outside of the lugs, this means that your band is attached with small screws that pass through the lugs. Insert a small jeweler or watchmaker’s flathead screwdriver or another similar tool into the lug hole at the 12 o’clock side of the watch until you feel it catch on one end of the set screw, the small screw that secures the end of the screw pin. Turn the screwdriver counter-clockwise until the set screw is loose. [9] X Research source The set screws are identified by a small arrow on the back of the watch case near the lugs. [10] X Research source Repeat this process on the set screw on the 6 o’clock side of the watch."

Consider replacing the worn screws, especially in valuable heirloom pieces that often have bands secured with screw pins."
