      "title": "Search newspaper archives for old articles.",
      "content": "Search newspaper archives for old articles. If you have a specific case (or even a specific time period) in mind, a digital newspaper archive could be a great way to glean extra information from journalists who covered the case at the time. Be sure to have the victim’s name on hand for your search, as well as the location where they were murdered. Here are a few sites to get you started: Chronicling America (Library of Congress) , Newspapers.com (offers free trial), Google News Archive Search Some sites offer state-specific digital newspaper libraries, including Michigan , Pennsylvania , Arizona , and many more places. If you have a specific case in mind, look up the digital newspaper library for where the corresponding homicide took place. If you don’t have a specific case in mind that you’re looking up, enter homicide-related keywords into the search bar, like murder , stabbing , and so on. Warning: The older the homicide case is, the more difficult it might be to find lots of credible information on it. Recent cases (ones that occurred in the age of the internet) will likely have more info available."

      "title": "Visit government sites dedicated to unsolved cases.",
      "content": "Visit government sites dedicated to unsolved cases. Many states have created databases that compile information on a variety of their unsolved homicides. While these sites won’t be helpful if you’re researching a closed case, they can be an invaluable resource for anyone looking to study unsolved cases. Search the name of your state plus “unsolved crime database” and see what comes up. States like Texas , Virginia , Maine , and many more have this type of site widely available."

      "title": "Investigate public records online for more information.",
      "content": "Investigate public records online for more information. US public records are often kept and organized on a state level rather than a federal one, so it helps to have a specific case in mind before hitting a particular database. Different state sites are operated and organized in different ways, so you may need to follow a slightly different process depending on which state’s site you’re using. You’ll need to know specific information about the case to get more accurate search results this way, like the name of the suspect, the case number, or the name of the attorney associated with the case."

      "title": "Check out federal websites for death records.",
      "content": "Check out federal websites for death records. There are tons of different databases out there with comprehensive lists of death records like Find A Grave and Online Searchable Death Indexes . [1] X Research source Keep in mind that these lists will include people who died both violently and from natural causes, so be sure to have a specific name in mind (as well as the date/time they died) before you start searching. Check out the National Archives’ Vital Records page for even more resources. Genealogy sites (like Ancestry.com , MyHeritage , and FamilySearch ) can also be useful resources for finding death records—just keep in mind that these sites often require a subscription of some type."

      "content": "Call up the police department or District Attorney (DA). The police and/or DA’s office are sure to have information on old homicide cases, even if they didn’t happen recently. Google the number of your local police office (the non-emergency line) or DA—or, if you’re looking up an old homicide case in a different area, look up the police department or DA number for that area. “Hi, I was calling in regard to the unsolved 1998 homicide case of Jane Doe. I was wondering if I could ask a police officer for some information about the investigation?” “I’m researching an old homicide case that DA Evans prosecuted back in 2017, and was wondering what information his office had about the case that was available to the public.”"

Plenty of people consider themselves “citizen detectives,” or civilians doing online research in their free time to help solve cold cases. [9] X Research source Veterans in the citizen detective community strongly advise following the guideline of “do no harm”—in other words, don’t do anything that would slow down the actual investigation or cause greater emotional pain to a victim’s family. [10] X Research source Any new evidence or leads always need to be turned over to the police department presiding over the case. Check out this guide to learn the basics and best practices of being a citizen detective. A citizen detective’s primary goal is to conduct digital research—not to conduct interviews, collect evidence, or do any physical police work."
