      "content": "This can help you digest the information faster. For example, if you’re learning a new language, you could break it down into nouns, verbs, adjectives, and tenses. It helps the information feel less overwhelming, and it gives you a path forward on how to study it. [1] X Research source If you’re learning from a textbook, it may be organized like this already."

      "content": "Make your goals specific and time-based to cover the most ground. It will help break up the subject so you aren’t overwhelmed by an entire field of knowledge. You could also set smaller goals throughout the weeks to work up toward learning an entire subject. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re studying math, try making it a goal to nail down basic algebra by next week. Then, you can move on to tougher concepts, like calculus. You can also split things up by chapters in a textbook."

      "title": "Great notes make studying much easier.",
      "content": "Great notes make studying much easier. Listen to the information being presented and write it down in your own words. Write down key information in short phrases rather than using complete sentences. Leave spaces in your notes to jot down comments or questions later on. [3] X Research source For example, instead of writing down, “The food chain is a hierarchical series of organisms each dependent on the next as a source of food,” you could write, “Food chain: series of organisms eating each other.” Try developing a shorthand that’s easy to write down and understand. For example, if you’re learning about chemistry concepts, you could shorten catalyst to cat, chromatography to chrom, or stoichiometry to stoich. If you're taking notes on how to do something sequential, like how to solve a math problem, write your notes down in steps. That way, it will be easier to remember how to apply those same steps to different problems. [4] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020."

      "content": "Studies show that writing notes by hand solidifies information in your head. Try going a little old school and whip out a sheet of paper and a pencil. If you want to keep your notes organized, type them up later and save them on your computer. [5] X Research source Writing your notes out by hand can take a little longer than typing them up, so it’s important to write in phrases and use shorthand."

If you’re in a classroom setting, approach the teacher or a fellow classmate. [6] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020.

      "content": "Lengthy cram sessions don't help you retain information in the long-term. Instead, try to space out your study time so you’re doing a little bit every day. Try studying for 10 to 15 minutes every evening or whenever you have time. [8] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Studies show that trying to cram a bunch of knowledge into your mind right before a test will only help you retain it in the short term. If you’re limited on time, you might not be able to spread your studying over multiple days. If that’s the case, just make sure you take lots of breaks to give your brain a rest."

      "title": "Grab a friend or a classmate and pretend you’re a teacher.",
      "content": "Grab a friend or a classmate and pretend you’re a teacher. Go over the basic concepts of what you’re learning, and answer any questions they might have. If you get stuck or struggle at any point, go back and revisit the stuff you’re having trouble with. [9] X Research source If you can teach a subject to someone else, you’re probably pretty close to mastering it."

      "content": "Read a portion of the material, then say what you just learned. You don’t need to be talking to anyone—you can do this alone in your home if you want. Speaking the information out loud helps you memorize it faster and keep it in your mind for longer.

If you missed anything or struggled in one area, go over it a few more times."

      "content": "What will this knowledge help you do in the future? What is it helping you do right now? Connecting a subject to something you’re doing outside of a classroom setting is a great way to keep your interest peaked. Oftentimes, people connect subjects to what they’re doing career-wise. If you’re learning chemistry, maybe you’ll use it when you work in a lab later on. If you’re studying math, maybe you’ll crunch numbers at an accounting firm in the future."

For example, if you want to remember the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), you could use the mnemonic device Roy G. Biv. It’s much easier to remember, so you can memorize it faster and use it to retain information.

If you’re in a classroom setting, you can also ask your teacher to see if they have ones you could practice with. Make sure you check your answers, and go over anything that you struggled with.
