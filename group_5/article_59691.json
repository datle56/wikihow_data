      "content": "No is a full sentence, and you never have to explain yourself. If you don’t feel comfortable having sex, simply tell your partner, significant other, or spouse no. Feel free to follow up with an explanation if you want to, but you don’t have to. [1] X Research source The best way to say “no” is to look into your partner’s eyes and say it clearly and firmly. Be confident when you say it so they know you won’t be swayed. For example, if your partner starts to go a little further than you’re comfortable with, you can pull back and say “please stop” or “no.” Or, if your significant other asks if you want to head to the bedroom, just say, “not right now.”"

      "content": "If you aren’t ready to have sex, tell your partner why. While they should always respect your decision, they might find it easier to understand if you let them in on your reasoning. You can tell your partner this at the beginning of a new relationship so they know where you’re coming from. For example, “I’m actually waiting until marriage to have sex. It’s important to me and to my faith.” Or, “I’m just not ready to have sex yet. I feel like I’m still a little too young.” Or, “I’d like to be in a committed relationship before we have sex. We don’t have to be married, but I’d love it if we were at least monogamous.”"

I’m down to make out a little bit, though.” Or, “I really like you, I’m just not comfortable with having sex just yet. Could we just cuddle and watch a movie?”"

[3] X Research source Try something like, “Hey, I’m having super bad cramps and I just don’t really feel good. Maybe we can have sex tomorrow.” Or, “I’d really like to just chill and watch a movie tonight. It’s nothing to do with you, I just had a bad day at work.”"

I have the day off, so I’ll have way more energy.” Or, “Could we pick this back up in a day or two?”"
