      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Most ovens take about 20 minutes to heat up but it will depend on how efficient your model is. Let the oven start heating while you prepare the almonds. [1] X Research source Trying to set the oven at a higher temperature to cook the almonds faster will likely burn the almonds or not cook them thoroughly."

      "title": "Spread the almonds in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet.",
      "content": "Spread the almonds in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. You don’t need to grease the baking sheet because the nuts contain so much natural oil. To help them cook evenly, make sure they are in an even layer and not piled on top of each other. [2] X Research source Substitute a 9 in × 13 in (23 cm × 33 cm) baking dish for the baking sheet if you'd like. If you want to coat the nuts in olive oil and other seasonings, toss them in your choice of oil and spices directly on the baking sheet or beforehand in a separate mixing bowl."

      "content": "Place the almonds in the oven for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Use a spatula to stir the almonds or gently shake the baking sheet to move the almonds around. Roast them until they’re golden brown and fragrant. [3] X Research source The almonds on the edges tend to cook faster so move them to the middle and vice versa when you stir. This allows all of the nuts to roast evenly. Check the nuts often to ensure they aren’t burning or browning unevenly. If they're cooking unevenly, stir them. If they're burnt, remove them from the oven."

    {
      "title": "Remove the nuts from the oven and place them on another baking sheet.",
      "content": "Remove the nuts from the oven and place them on another baking sheet. The high oil content of the almonds means they’ll keep cooking outside of the oven, especially if they’re left on the hot baking sheet. Pour or spoon them onto a cool baking sheet. [4] X Research source Leaving the almonds on the hot baking sheet will burn them or scorch the bottoms. If you don’t have another baking sheet, a plate or even a paper towel will do."

    {
      "title": "Let the almonds cool completely before pouring into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Let the almonds cool completely before pouring into an airtight container. Storing almonds while they’re still warm increases their risk of molding or going bad because it creates excess moisture. Wait until they’re cool to the touch, then place them in a sealed plastic or glass container. [5] X Research source You can use a resealable plastic bag or glass jar, too."

      "content": "Store dry roasted nuts for 9 to 12 months in the pantry. Place your almonds in a cool, dark place that’s dry to keep them fresh for longer. Throw them away if you notice a rancid odor or if they taste stale. [6] X Research source If you coated the nuts in oil, they won’t last as long. A good rule of thumb for those is 3 to 4 weeks at room temperature. To keep the nuts for up to 2 years, place the airtight container in the freezer if it’s freezer-safe."

      "content": "Toss the almonds, olive oil, and sea salt together. Combine the 3 ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Use a spoon to mix the almonds until they are evenly coated with olive oil and salt. Swap olive oil for a different type of oil based on your taste preferences. You could use avocado oil, sesame oil, or an herb-infused oil, for example. You can also use water or lemon juice instead of oil. Another mixing option is to put the 3 ingredients in a resealable plastic bag. Shake it vigorously to coat the almonds."

      "content": "Heat a skillet on the stove top over medium-high heat. You don’t want the pan to be so hot that it burns the almonds. If your stove top dial has 9 settings, medium-high heat would be anywhere from 5 to 7. Choose a skillet that’s big enough that the almonds won’t be overcrowded. A cast iron skillet or a frying pan with high edges will also work. To determine what medium-high heat is, hold your hand 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above the burner. If you can hold it there for a few minutes before it gets too hot, it’s medium to medium-high. [7] X Research source"

Stir them frequently with a spatula so they don’t stick to the bottom of the skillet. Sample 1 almond after the 5 minutes is up. If it doesn’t taste fully roasted, continue cooking the almonds."

Spread them in a single layer on the baking sheet for the fastest cooling time. You can use a sheet of parchment paper instead of a baking sheet. Don’t leave the almonds in the pan to cool as the heat will continue cooking them."
