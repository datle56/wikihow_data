      "content": "Order the correct action for your rifle. Contact the manufacturer of your rifle. Work with a company representative to determine the type of action you require. Place an order for your rifle’s action and wait for it to arrive. [1] X Research source The action is the part of the rifle that loads, fires, and ejects the cartridge. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Dry fit the stock to ensure the parts fit.",
      "content": "Dry fit the stock to ensure the parts fit. Before bedding your rifle—coating the stock’s interior with an epoxy resin—complete a dry run. Make sure all of the pieces fit together properly before applying the bedding material. Insert the action, followed by the trigger, magazine box, bolt, and bolt release. To ensure that the action feeds correctly, place dummy shells into the magazine. [3] X Research source Do not force the pieces to fit together properly. If the action or another piece does not sit correctly in the gun, contact the manufacturer and order a new part."

      "content": "Photograph the gun to use as a guide. If you are unfamiliar with the rifle, consider documenting the assembled firearm. Use a camera or your phone to take pictures of the assembled rifle. Documenting the assembled gun will provide you with a reference source. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Disassemble the gun and examine the previous bedding job. Take the action out of the stock. Remove the rifle’s small parts. These include the magazine and trigger. Examine the existing bedding job. Note where the epoxy was placed and how the stock was bedded. [5] X Research source If the bedding is still in good condition, you can use the same method. If the bedding is cracked, excessively worn, or softened, look into alternative bedding methods."

      "title": "Cover your work area with newspapers and elevate the stock with vise grips.",
      "content": "Cover your work area with newspapers and elevate the stock with vise grips. Place newspapers on top of your flat work space. Retrieve your vise grips and set them on your work space. Insert the stock between the loosened vise grips and tighten. [6] X Research source Vise grips will secure the stock in place and prevent the stock from rotating. If you do not have vise grips, use a gun holder instead."

      "title": "Degrease the action.",
      "content": "Degrease the action. Degreasing the action will allow other materials to adhere to the gun. Put on a pair of latex gloves. Dip a cotton ball or swab into denatured alcohol. Use the saturated cotton ball to wipe down the action and recoil lug."

      "content": "Place masking tape over the recoil lug. Placing tape over and around the recoil lug creates a small gap, which ensures the easy release of the action from the stock. Wrap the top, bottom, and sides of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape. Cover the front and back of the recoil lug with two layers of masking tape. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply release agent to the rifle’s metal parts. Put on rubber gloves before coating the action and barrel with a release agent. Be sure to coat the action screws, foot plate, and every part that will be reinserted into the stock. Allow the release agent to dry. There are several release agents on the market. Use an aerosol spray to liberally cover the barrel and action. When using a wax, dip your fingertips into the wax. Spread the wax over the action and barrel with your fingers. Err on the side of caution—cover everything with release agent."

To prevent the epoxy from seeping into places it shouldn’t cover, fill the action’s nooks and crannies with modeling clay.

Add dye to the mixture so that it matches the color of the stock. Use the stick to stir the mixture until it is a peanut-butter like consistency. [9] X Research source To avoid air bubbles, do not whip the mixture. Always follow the instructions on the product! Apply the mixture with a popsicle stick. Put on disposable rubber gloves. Place a dime sized amount of the mixture onto the end of a popsicle stick. Use the stick to coat the recoil lug area and the rear screw area with a thin, even layer of the mixture.

Tap the action with a mallet to “pop” the action out of the stock. Observe the stock—you should see an exact replica of the action. [13] X Research source To remove a stubborn screw, insert the screwdriver and tap on top of the handle with a rubber mallet. If you are struggling to remove the action, insert a ⅝ inch dowel into the back of the receiver. The dowel will function as a lever.
