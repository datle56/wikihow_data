      "title": "“It was a pleasure speaking with you” means you enjoyed talking with someone.",
      "content": "“It was a pleasure speaking with you” means you enjoyed talking with someone. This is a rather formal expression that you might use when talking to someone in a higher position than you, such as your boss or a hiring manager, or someone you’re not that close with. You use this expression to let someone know you had a pleasant time talking with them, and it implies that you’d be happy to speak with them again in the future. The phrase “It was a pleasure speaking to you” carries essentially the same meaning. However, the preposition “with” implies that you and the other person engaged in a two-way conversation, while “to” often implies that the conversation was more one-sided and you were doing most of the talking. For example, you might say “It was a pleasure speaking to you” at the end of a speech where you did most of the talking to the audience. Nevertheless, these two expressions are interchangeable for the most part."

It’s best to use this expression when talking to someone you have more of a formal relationship with or are speaking to for the first time, such as when you’re talking to your boss or making an appointment with your doctor. For example: “Thank you for calling. It was a pleasure speaking with you.” “It was a pleasure speaking with you, and I’ll see you for my appointment on Friday.” “It was a pleasure speaking with you like this. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule.”"

      "title": "“Speaking” is slightly more formal than “talking.”",
      "content": "“Speaking” is slightly more formal than “talking.” While many people use both phrases interchangeably for the most part, “It was a pleasure speaking with you” is slightly more polite and formal than “It was a pleasure talking to you.” For example, it’s much more customary to use “It was a pleasure speaking with you” when writing a post-interview thank you note instead of “It was a pleasure talking to you.” [2] X Research source The word “pleasure” makes both expressions rather formal, so there won’t be any issue if you switch between using the two in most circumstances. It’s more common to use the verb “talk” when addressing people close to you, such as friends or family. To make the expression more casual, you might say something like, “It was good talking to you” or “It was nice talking to you.”"

I hope we can talk again soon.” “It was great speaking with you. I hope we can talk again sometime soon.” “Thanks for the helpful advice. I really hope we can talk again soon.”"

    },
    {
      "title": "“It’s always a pleasure.”",
      "content": "“It’s always a pleasure.” This is a shortened way of saying, “It’s always a pleasure to speak with you” or “It’s always a pleasure to see you” when you talk to someone you see often.
