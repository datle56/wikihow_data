      "content": "Yes—Turnitin can tell if Chat GPT is used. Turnitin has built-in plagiarism-detection tools, and it can provide professors with an overall score of how closely submitted work resembles AI-generated content from 0% to 100%. However, as AI technology is always evolving , these tools constantly adjust with it. In some cases, Turnitin may flag assignments with \"false positives.\" This is when the AI-detection tool incorrectly identifies human-written text as AI-generated. [1] X Research source There are ways to check if something was AI-generated , such as looking for inaccurate statements, fake or inaccessible sources, unlikely wording, and more."

      "content": "Turnitin can detect AI-generated content with 98% accuracy. This means that most cases flagged to be AI-generated by Turnitin are usually correct. However, Turnitin states that the scores received should be used as an indication rather than an accusation. False accusations of plagiarism can harm both parties' reputations, so it's important to use Turnitin's educator resources to proceed cautiously. [2] X Research source Turnitin's AI writing detector model has been trained specifically on \"academic writing sourced from a comprehensive database\" rather than public content you can find on the web. [3] X Research source Because of this, Turnitin is more tuned to finding plagiarism in student assignments as opposed to other AI detection tools ."

      "content": "If you want to avoid getting caught , use AI tools with caution. There is no way to 100% guarantee your work won't be flagged by Turnitin if you do use Chat GPT or another AI. However, there are some ways to help prevent it. Use AI as a tool for writing outlines for essays rather than the entire essay itself. Avoid copying and pasting exact phrases or paragraphs, as AI speech patterns can easily be identified. Some third-party programs, such as QuillBot, claim to scan text and paraphrase it completely. This can help pass Turnitin's AI detection, but be aware that both AI generation and AI detection are constantly updating to bypass the other. What has worked in the past may not work next time."
