      "content": "Legendary Resistance lets powerful creatures succeed on failed saving throws. If a creature has the Legendary Resistance feature and fails to make a saving throw against a threat, they have the choice to change it into a success instead. The creature ignores the effect of the spell or attack and continues combat. [1] X Research source Legendary Resistance usually has a limited number of uses each in-game day. For example, if the feature lists (3/day) , then the creature can only use this ability 3 times per day. Using Legendary Resistance does not count as one of the creature’s Legendary Actions , which are usually powerful abilities or attacks that can be used each round."

When you look through the D&D 5e Monster Manual or browse D&D Beyond , check for the Legendary Resistance ability listed underneath their stat block. The stat also lists how many times a creature can use Legendary Resistance during an in-game day."

      "content": "Clue your players in that a creature has Legendary Resistance. Your players may get frustrated if they cast a powerful spell and a creature blocks it with Legendary Resistance without warning. When your players go into combat with a Legendary creature, hint that something is different about the encounter so they can think of different plans for how to fight. [2] X Research source Example : If your players are encountering a big boss battle against a dragon, you might say something like, “This dragon is renowned for defeating even the most challenging opponents, and it’s considered a local legend to the surrounding villagers.” If you want to keep it a surprise that a creature has Legendary Resistance and add more drama to your D&D campaign, then it’s okay to keep the stat a secret. Typically, players only fight 1 Legendary creature at a time so they don’t get overwhelmed. D&D experts from Legends of Avantris mention to keep in mind the balance between the creature’s difficulty and their players’ skill levels so the fight doesn’t feel impossible."

      "content": "Use Legendary Resistance to add drama and challenges to combat. If a failed saving throw would knock out or incapacitate a creature early in the fight, use one of its Legendary Resistances to make the monster survive longer. If using a Legendary Resistance raises the stakes of the combat while still making it fun for your players, then it will work great in your campaign. [3] X Research source Example : If your players are about to deal a finishing blow to a monster, you can use Legendary Resistance to block the attack so the creature can take another turn. Remember that a creature can choose when to use their Legendary Resistances, so you can pick which saving throws to turn into successes."

      "content": "Describe how the creature reacts in the narrative. Rather than just saying a creature uses its Legendary Resistance ability, tie it into the story and how the creature reacts. Describe how the creature responds to the attack and how they were able to defend themselves so players feel more satisfied with the battle. [4] X Research source Example : If you have an arrogant Lich King, you could say, “The Lich King holds up their hand and the magic absorbs into their armor without causing any damage. The Lich looks at your party and says, ‘Oh ho ho, you thought it would be that easy?’” Example : If you make a surprise attack on a dragon, you could explain, “The dragon is caught off guard, but your spells bounce off the tough scales on its underbelly. The dragon scowls in your direction, a new anger lit behind its eyes.”"

Many creatures already have resistances to magic or conditions that could weaken them, but don’t be afraid to give them more immunities. Keep in mind what types of magic and weapons your players are using, and add a couple more resistances to your creature so they’re more difficult. If one of your Rogue players uses poisoned blades to deal extra damage, give a challenging monster a poison immunity."

Instead of automatically succeeding a saving throw, spend one of the luck points to roll another die. Choose either roll to use for the creature’s saving throw. Using Luck points still makes creatures feel threatening, but it leaves any successes or failures to chance so it feels more fair to the players."
