      "content": "Golden child syndrome is a family dynamic where parents excessively favor one child. [1] X Research source In the parent’s eyes, the golden child can do no wrong. Their attributes are exaggerated, and their faults are excused. The parent showers the child with attention and praise, whether or not they're actually displaying exceptional behavior. [2] X Research source The golden child's sibling often becomes the scapegoat, who gets blamed for all of the family’s problems. [3] X Research source If there are more than two siblings, one can become the lost child. This child is neglected because the parent is focusing on the golden child and scapegoat.

      "content": "You get special treatment from your parent. Your parent might be quick to forgive your faults, which means you can get away with a lot more than your siblings. If you feel like your parent brushes off your mistakes, but your siblings don’t get the same benefit of the doubt, you might be the golden child. [5] X Research source You struggle with feelings of guilt. As you grow older, you could start to gain some insight into the treatment your scapegoat sibling went through, which could bring on feelings of guilt. [6] X Research source Remember, you aren’t at fault for this dysfunctional family dynamic. Your parent was the one in charge of setting the tone. While experiencing these feelings of empathy toward your sibling, remember to extend them toward yourself, as well. You both did the best you could in a tough situation! You have an intense need to achieve. If you were the golden child, you received excessive praise all the time, and your parent expected you to be good at everything. As a result, you likely chase achievements in order to satisfy a craving for external praise. [7] X Research source This could manifest as a need to be super successful in your career as an adult. You’re a perfectionist. Because you grew up with a parent who saw you as perfect, you could feel a lot of pressure to maintain that image. [8] X Research source You're likely very hard on yourself and see failure as completely unacceptable. You might also put pressure on yourself to be good at everything you try. You’re a people pleaser. Because a difficult parent can be angry and unpredictable, you likely felt the need to be cheerful at all times to avoid the next big explosion. [9] X Research source As an adult, this could cause you to neglect your own needs in order to avoid conflict with friends or partners. Remember, it’s normal to feel unhappy or upset sometimes, and you deserve affirmation even when you’re having difficult emotions. You have identity problems. A self-centered parent likely saw you as a projection of all their idealized notions about themselves and claimed your successes as their own. [10] X Research source This could make it hard to separate your identity from your parent's. You might neglect your own needs and desires to focus on fulfilling your parent’s dreams. You have an inflated or deflated sense of self. Due to your parent’s excessive praise, you might have developed an inflated sense of your capabilities. On the other hand, your parent’s high expectations might have made you critical of yourself, leading to low self-esteem. [11] X Research source If you’re dealing with super high or super low self-esteem, you’re not alone. It’s completely normal to struggle with self-image after being the golden child, and there are many ways to overcome these feelings."

      "content": "Cause : Golden child syndrome comes from bad parenting. It's especially common in families where one parent is a narcissist . The self-absorbed parent projects their good self-image onto the golden child, and their bad self-image onto the scapegoat. [12] X Research source These roles are unrelated to the children's actual qualities. It doesn't matter how talented or well-behaved the scapegoat child is, nor how many flaws or bad behavior patterns the golden child has. The parent isn't interested in reality. Effects : Golden child syndrome has a negative effect on mental health. Former “golden children” often struggle with perfectionism, self-esteem issues, codependency, relationship struggles, and anxiety. [13] X Research source They may even be at increased risk of being entitled or developing narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), just like their parent. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Establish healthy boundaries. If you have a self-absorbed or narcissistic parent, they likely see you as an extension of themselves and demand constant access to your life. [15] X Research source Establishing healthy boundaries with your parent can help you gain the space you need. Communicate your boundaries in a clear, direct way. Don’t try to over-explain or engage in a back-and-forth. Simply say your boundaries are not up for discussion. Enforce your boundaries if your parent isn’t honoring them. This might mean taking a break from communication with your parent. Examples: “Dad, I understand that you want to spend time together, but I’ve got a lot going on. I am free to have lunch every other week, if you want to catch up.” “Mom, I know you want to know what’s going on in my life, but I’m not comfortable introducing you to my partner yet. I’ll let you know when I am.” Go no-contact. Sometimes, a self-absorbed parent can’t respect your boundaries, no matter how hard you try to enforce them. [16] X Research source If your relationship with your parent is having a negative effect on your mental health, you could decide to go no-contact. This is a hard decision, but the most important thing is that you’re able to heal and take care of yourself. Selfish people and narcissists are prone to manipulation and guilt-tripping, so your parent might try to fight you on this decision. [17] X Research source Remember, you deserve peace and stability, and you are completely justified in cutting off contact. Let go of expectations. A difficult or narcissistic parent might be unable or unwilling to recognize your needs. [18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source No matter how well you explain your emotions, they still might not understand where you’re coming from. Letting go of expectations can help you move forward and prioritize your own needs. Be kind to yourself. If you're the golden child, you're likely super critical of yourself, and you might even blame yourself for the family's dynamic. Remember, your parent’s behavior isn’t a reflection of you, and the dysfunctional dynamic of your childhood wasn’t your fault. [19] X Research source Practice self-compassion, which involves recognizing when you’re going through something tough and being kind to yourself in those moments. [20] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try out some mindfulness exercises , like meditating or reciting positive affirmations to show yourself some love. [21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Seek out treatment for mental health conditions. Golden children (and children of narcissists in general) are prone to issues like insomnia, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. [22] X Research source If you’re struggling with any of these issues, you’re not alone, and there are many treatment options to help you manage symptoms. If you’re struggling with your mental health, scheduling an appointment with a therapist is a good first step. Ask trusted friends or family members for a referral if they see a therapist, or check out online directories.
