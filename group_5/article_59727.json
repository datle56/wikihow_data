Wear a standard surgical head cover or hood provided by the hospital. Make sure the material is free of lint and is large enough to fit all of your hair. If you have sideburns and/or facial hair, you should wear a surgical hood to cover these areas. Avoid surgeons' skull caps, which do not adequately cover your hair. [3] X Research source"

After your shirt is on, put on your scrub pants. Tuck your shirt tail into the waistband to prevent billowing or skin shedding into sterile areas.
