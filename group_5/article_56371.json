      "content": "Flea eggs are small white specks that resemble grains of salt. Flea eggs are white, slightly oblong, and are about 1 ⁄ 2 millimetre (0.020 in) long. [1] X Research source They can be mistaken for dandruff or grains of salt, so check potential eggs with a magnifying glass. Hold them to a dark background to make it easier to see. While you may know what they look like, they are very hard to find. If you know your house has an infestation, it’s better to just clean and spread insect growth regulators in areas where eggs might be to get rid of the fleas. Fleas like to lay eggs in out-of-the-way areas, like under furniture, in cracks in the floor, dusty corners, under rugs, between floorboards and tiles, and at the edge of baseboards."

[4] X Research source You can use a flea collar , but some can irritate your pet, and they don’t work as well as topical IGR medications. Speak to your veterinarian about what medication is right for your pet. You can also feed your pet oral medications—just check with your veterinarian first."

As soon as the wash is done, dry the load on the highest heat setting your fabric can take. Things to wash include blankets, bedding, clothing, curtains, pillowcases, cushion covers, rugs, pet toys, and pet bedding. For best results, clean everything multiple times, as flea larvae hatch in waves. Keep your clean clothes and bedding in a separate area of your home that’s away from the fleas and your pet so they don’t get infested again."

Go over the same area multiple times and use the hose with a crevice tool attachment to get into corners and tight areas of your carpet and furniture. Anywhere that dust collects is likely to have flea eggs. Vacuum under your rugs and large pieces of furniture. Pay attention to corners, cracks, and the edges of your baseboards. Dispose of the vacuum’s contents or bag in an outdoor garbage can. Fleas can’t escape your vacuum, but they could re-infest your house if they’re thrown away inside."

Put diatomaceous earth all over your house—on carpets, furniture, baseboards, bed skirts, etc. If you use a spray, spray your furniture and floors in long, overlapping strips. Essential oils can also deter fleas, but Parker recommends buying “a product like Essentria …[which is] specifically formulated as an insecticide… [but d]o not put it on your animal. Essential oils can be toxic to animals.” [10] X Expert Source Chris Parker Founder, Parker Eco Pest Control Expert Interview. 15 January 2021.
