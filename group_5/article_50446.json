Keep the conversation focused on you, what you did wrong, and what you’re going to do to fix it. [1] X Research source For instance, you could start with, “I need to talk to you for a minute” or “I have something I need to talk with you about.” Avoid saying something like, “You and I need to talk” or “Your daughter says I need to talk with you,” which shifts the focus off of yourself and could make you look insincere."

      "content": "Show him that you’re fully acknowledging your mistakes. Avoid using vague or general terms or he may think that you’re just going through the motions and don’t really mean what you’re saying. Get as specific as possible. [4] X Research source For instance, if you and your girlfriend got into a bad fight, say, “I was wrong to raise my voice and shout at your daughter, no matter how angry we were.” Even if it’s for something relatively small, take the time to acknowledge your specific mistakes. You could say, “It was my fault we were late to the airport” or, “I should have stopped to pick up the ice and drinks like I said I would.”"

      "title": "Keep the conversation focused on you.",
      "content": "Keep the conversation focused on you. Avoid bringing in anybody else to your apology. Instead, talk about your actions and how they contributed to the problem. If your girlfriend's dad asks you questions about your behavior, answer him respectfully and honestly. He'll likely really appreciate that you aren't trying to excuse what you did or blame anybody else. [5] X Research source For instance, say, \"I really messed up\" or \"It was my mistake\" instead of something like, “I'm sorry this happened, but it wasn't my fault\" or “She pushed me too far.” If he asks you for clarification about what happened, avoid getting defensive and answer him truthfully. He may just want to understand the situation better."

      "title": "Even if he isn’t ready yet, let him know that you hope he will.",
      "content": "Even if he isn’t ready yet, let him know that you hope he will. Depending on how upset your girlfriend’s dad is, he may be ready to forgive you right away. But he may also need some time. If that's the case, avoid pressuring him to forgive you. Instead, respectfully ask for his forgiveness and let him know that you understand if he needs time to think about it. [7] X Research source Just simply saying that you’re sorry without asking him to forgive you could make it seem like your heart isn’t really in the apology. You might say, \"I understand that what I did was wrong, but would you be able to forgive me?\" or \"Can you forgive me for what I've done? If you need time to think about it, I understand.\""

      "content": "Express your regret, then give him space. Try not to ramble on or make friendly conversation with your girlfriend’s dad. He may not be interested in continuing to talk with you or he may think your apology is insincere if you carry on like nothing happened. Instead, make your apology and then take your leave so he can think about it. [11] X Research source You could try, “I just wanted to apologize, and now I’m going to get out of your hair.” If he seems like he wants you to stay or he continues to talk to you, by all means, stick around!

If you say you’re going to do something to make amends, do it! Your girlfriend’s dad will definitely notice."
