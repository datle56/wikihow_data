      "content": "“Leave and cleave” is when a couple leaves their family to be together. This Biblical principle comes from Genesis 2:24: “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.” [1] X Research source The notion is that a serious marriage cannot grow and become fully committed without stepping away from family. “Leaving” indicates that the couple is ready to start a new family together and prioritize each other. “Cleaving” means that each partner recognizes they are joined or united. An example of “leave and cleave” would be a couple deciding to move out of their parent’s home and get their own place together. They’re cutting ties with their family to create their own life together, setting clear boundaries and establishing independence. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "In the Bible, “leave and cleave” can also signify a relationship with God. Many Christians believe that “leaving and cleaving” also represents unity with the Lord. Christians leave other gods and temptations behind to follow God and submit to His almighty power. As Deuteronomy 13:4 says, “It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set healthy boundaries with your spouse about family needs. Talk to your spouse about what you both are seeking within the marriage. Are there traditions you’d like to uphold from your side of the family? Are there certain familial obligations you can’t get out of even when married? Being open and honest with your spouse about what you both want and need can help you set boundaries and cultivate a strong marriage.

      "content": "Prioritize your spouse over familial relationships. To “leave and cleave,” you must put your marriage and partner’s needs above other relationships. When you get married, your priorities shift. While you may have put your parents' and siblings' needs first before, now you can prioritize your spouse. This can look like attending your spouse’s work event over a family dinner or staying in with your spouse if they’re unwell. Keep in mind that this doesn’t mean you should neglect your other relationships—find a healthy balance! While your marriage should come first, you’re still allowed to cultivate and nurture other relationships in your life.

While you may have been together for a long time, marriage is a new beginning—it’s a different kind of partnership. Be there for your spouse no matter what to show them your support. In turn, this will establish a level of trust . [9] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

As a child of God, you are taught to obey your parents and please the Lord: “Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord” (Colossians 3:20). [10] X Research source When you get married, your obedience to your parents transitions to honoring them, as the Lord wants you to continue life with their blessing under His guidance: “‘Honor your father and mother’—which is the first commandment with a promise” (Ephesians 6:2). [11] X Research source In the Christian faith, “leaving and cleaving” is a sign of opening yourself up to God and drawing yourself closer to Him, your spouse, and your faith."

      "content": "“Leaving and cleaving” can be hard on parents and siblings. While marriage is a happy moment in a Christian’s life, the concept of “leaving and cleaving” may be difficult for a wife or husband’s family at first. Think of it this way: they’re letting go of a son or daughter or brother or sister. They’re likely incredibly happy for you, but that doesn’t mean they won’t grieve the relationship they’ve had with you before marriage. Don’t think of “leaving and cleaving” as an end but rather as a new beginning. Your family is growing, and while things may be different moving forward, it doesn’t mean there won’t be more good times ahead. As the Lord says in Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you…plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” [12] X Research source"

When you’re married, you’re joined spiritually and physically with your spouse—this is an act of “cleaving.” You’re connecting and bonding with another person. Along with this, you’re making a commitment and adhering to Christian doctrine, putting your relationship in the name of the Lord. [15] X Research source As Romans 12:9 says, “Love must be sincere.
