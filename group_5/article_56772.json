      "content": "Certain MacBook models develop a faded and shiny keyboard with use. The issue arises in MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models released within the last 5 to 6 years. The more you use your MacBook keyboard, the more faded and shiny the keyboard becomes, giving the keys an almost greasy appearance. Apple has not commented on this issue, but many users who are experiencing it speculate that the MacBook Magic Keyboard has keycaps made of ABS plastic, which is cheaper than PBT plastic. [1] X Research source ABS plastic is known to get shiny over time when you use them due to wear and tear. [2] X Research source Note that Apple has not confirmed the material used to make MacBook keycaps, so this information is anecdotal. Some users have found that their MacBook keyboards start to look faded because the paint appears to be wearing off . Over time, some wear and tear is expected, but many users state their keyboards are faded, shiny, and flaking paint after only a few months of use."

      "content": "Clean the keycaps. If the shininess on your keyboard is due to wear and tear, cleaning the keyboard, unfortunately, can't reverse the damage, but it can make the keys feel better to use temporarily. According to Luigi Oppido, computer and tech specialist, the best way to clean your keyboard is to spray an ammonia-free window cleaner on a microfiber cloth (never spray directly on the keyboard) and use the slightly dampened cloth to wipe off your keyboard. \"Any ammonia-based cleaners will eat plastic,\" Oppido stresses. \"Do not use any type of ammonia.\""

      "content": "Get a keyboard covering. If your keyboard is really faded, shiny, or worn down, you can use a keyboard covering. Keyboard coverings usually have the letter printed on them, so if the letters on your MacBook keyboard have worn off, you'll be able to know which key is which again. The keyboard cover also acts as a barrier, which might be beneficial if your keyboard feels perpetually greasy. There are a couple types of keyboard coverings: Keyboard skins are made of thin silicone and rest on top of your keyboard. They can be removed as needed since they aren't stuck on your keys and come in various colors. Keyboard stickers are decorative stickers you can place on top of your keycaps. Since they're stickers, they are harder to remove than a silicone keyboard skin. However, they come in more colors and designs than keyboard skins."

      "content": "Replace the keycaps yourself. MacBook keycaps can be removed from the keyboard base with a small, thin, rigid tool (like a jewelry-sized flathead screwdriver) and replaced by snapping the new keycap into place. You can buy new keycaps on sites like Amazon for a very reasonable price. Before you get started, power your laptop down and unplug it to avoid any accidental electric shocks. Learn more about replacing keycaps in this wikiHow article ."
