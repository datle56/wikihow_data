Then, hold the coil horizontally between your thumb and pointer finger. Put 1 drop of e-liquid onto each cotton hole located on the coil. [2] X Research source There will most likely be about 6 holes for you to put drops into. This is called coil preparation, and preserves the life of the coil. [3] X Research source"

Then, hold the dropper part of your e-liquid bottle up against the inside of the tank. Squirt in e-liquid until it reaches the horizontal hash mark on the side of the tank, which indicates fullness. [4] X Research source Be careful to not get liquid into the center tube of the tank, as this is the airway. Accidentally dropping liquid here may cause you to inhale the e-liquid in its liquid form."
