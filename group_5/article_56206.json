      "content": "Yes, if you use commercial products with low concentrations. Commercial skincare products sold to the public can't have a concentration of more than 10% glycolic acid. Products that are designed to be a regular part of your skincare routine, such as cleansers and toners, generally have even lower concentrations of 5% or less. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Expect your skin to tingle a little after you use glycolic acid. If it looks or feels like a sunburn, though, lay off the glycolic acid for a few days. When you go back to it, cut back to 2-3 days a week instead of every day and see if that helps. To avoid irritating your skin, go with the lowest concentration you can find that will get you the results you want. This might take a little trial and error to find the right product for you."

Wait 24-48 hours to make sure, but if your hand still looks the same, you're fine! [3] X Research source It's true that the skin on your face can be more sensitive, so doing a patch test doesn't guarantee you won't have any reaction. You might still see some redness or irritation, but that's normal. Definitely keep products with glycolic acid away from the skin around your eyes, which is the most delicate and sensitive skin on your face."

Higher-concentration peels can also stabilize oily skin and improve your overall skin tone.

      "content": "Start with a cleanser or toner at night. You don't want to use glycolic acid during the day until you know for sure how your skin will react to it. Use it maybe 3 nights a week to start—just wash your face as normal and follow up with a moisturizer. If your skin handles it fine, you can bump up to daily use. [7] X Research source If you decide to add a glycolic acid product to your morning routine, make sure you follow up with sunscreen. [8] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Glycolic acid makes your skin extra sensitive and it's easy to get a sunburn, even if you're not outside for very long. Masks, serums, and other treatment products typically have a higher concentration of glycolic acid than cleansers and toners do. Save these for once or twice a week at most. Read the instructions on the package carefully, because some of them have specific recommendations."

      "content": "Yes, it's safe to combine them, but they might irritate your skin. It's a common misconception that you should never mix glycolic acid and retinol products. Because they're both exfoliants, they can actually complement each other if used in tandem. But the one-two punch of double-exfoliation might seriously irritate your skin. Using both at the same time also makes your skin even more sensitive to the sun's rays, so you can get sunburned pretty easily if you're not wearing sunscreen every time you go outside. [9] X Research source Another thing to consider is the \"skin purging\" effect. Both retinol and glycolic acid products tend to cause breakouts when you first start using them as your skin releases impurities that were clogging your pores. [10] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. These breakouts can be more intense if you're combining the two products. If your skin is already prone to irritation, it's probably a good idea to use these products separately rather than combining them. [11] X Research source"

It can also cause the top layer of your skin to become dry and flaky if you don't follow up with a moisturizer. [12] X Research source Moisturizer can also help cover and reduce the signs of peeling that are common after a high-concentration peel with glycolic acid. If you get a peel from a dermatologist, you'll usually peel for several days afterward. [13] X Research source"

[16] X Research source You might find products marketed as \"peels,\" but they're little more than peel-off face masks and won't contain a concentration of more than 10% glycolic acid. These products aren't a substitute for an in-office peel applied by a dermatologist, so don't expect similar results."

They have a really low concentration and don't stay on your skin for very long. If you get a peel from a dermatologist, your favorite toner or cleanser might end up being too much.
