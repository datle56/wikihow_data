      "content": "Shut down your device and check the port with a flashlight. This helps you get a feel for what you’re working with. Shine a flashlight into the port, and examine it for any obvious debris. If you see gunk or particles, you know what you’re dealing with. Even if you don’t, go ahead and give it a clean anyway. Also, if your device has a removable battery, take it out as an extra safety measure. This method works to clean USB-C or Lightning ports, as well as most any other charging port."

      "content": "Blow compressed air into the charging port in 1 to 2-second bursts. Position the straw to the left or right side of the charging port, and hold it about 4–5 in (10–13 cm) away. Press down on the nozzle for 1 to 2 seconds to blow air into the port while holding the straw steady. You can find cans of compressed air at most electronics retailers, including Amazon . Be advised that some manufacturers don’t recommend this, but it’s a well-known and widely used method anyway. Do this with caution, and at your own risk. To avoid damaging the port, don't hold down the nozzle for more than 2 seconds. Too much air pressure can disrupt the device’s delicate internal structures. Resist the urge to blow into the port with your mouth. This could add moisture to the port and potentially break your phone or tablet."

      "content": "Swab the port gently with a cotton swab or toothpick. Consumer tech expert Mitch Harris says to slightly dampen a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol, then “gently wipe the area.” [1] X Expert Source Mitch Harris Consumer Technology Expert Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. If a cotton swab is too large, wrap a small bit of cotton from a cotton ball or tissue around your toothpick to make a smaller cotton swab. Insert the toothpick into the port and very carefully wipe all the way around it. If the port has small pins or other protruding, sharp hardware inside, avoid the cotton and opt for a plain toothpick, as the cotton may get stuck on the pins and add debris. Also, avoid touching the pins with the toothpick. If a toothpick doesn’t fit, take your device to a professional to have it cleaned."

      "title": "Spray away loosened debris with more compressed air.",
      "content": "Spray away loosened debris with more compressed air. Hold the device so that the charging port faces downward toward your working surface—this will allow the dirt to fall freely from the port to the surface instead of getting stuck inside. Spray a few quick bursts inside the port again until it is clear of debris. If it's difficult to get the remaining dirt out of the port, wrap double-sided tape around the end of a sewing or a syringe needle and gently nudge it free. If there is visible debris that you can't remove using these methods, take your device to a service center. If you are still having trouble with your charging port, check your charging cable—it could be dirty or damaged. If you have another charging cable, give that one a try."

      "content": "Set your phone somewhere with good airflow for 1-2 hours. Leave your phone near an open window, or in a room with a running fan, with the charging port exposed. Let it air dry for 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours, until the problem is resolved. [3] X Research source Avoid using compressed air on a wet charging port, as the air may force the liquid further into the electronics. If charging problems persist, take your phone to a local IT service for help."
