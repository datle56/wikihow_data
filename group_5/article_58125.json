      "title": "Remove any accessories and cords.",
      "content": "Remove any accessories and cords. When getting your TV ready to be packed, you should first unplug the TV and remove the power cord from the TV, if possible. Then remove the cords that attach any accessories, such as streaming devices or DVD players. Coil them up and tie the coil together with a rope or ribbon. [1] X Research source Leaving cords attached to your TV can cause the cords or the cord attachment points on the TV to be damaged during moving. If you have a lot of components and cables, it's a good idea to label them before you pack them. [2] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Certified Professional Organizer & Senior Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. Put a piece of tape around the cord and write what the cord is used for on the tape. This will make it easier to put your TV system back together once your move is over. Put the cords in a separate box or in the box you are using to pack up your components. Putting them in the same box as the TV could damage it if they move around. Wrap up attached cords. If there are cords that can't be detached from the TV, you should wrap them up neatly. You don't have to wrap up the cords all the way to the TV. You simply need to wrap up the majority of the cord so it can be contained and won't be a tripping hazard while you are packing up the TV."

      "content": "Clean your TV with a microfiber cloth. Take the time to clean all the dust and debris off of your TV before you pack it up. Not only will this help keep you clean as you move the TV, it will also prevent dust and dirt left on the screen from scratching it during the move. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Unmount",
      "content": "Unmount your TV. If your TV is mounted on a wall, it needs to be taken down. Typically, you will first detach the TV from the bracket and then take the bracket off the wall after the TV is removed. Look at the instructions for the mounting bracket if you are unsure about how to detach the TV. [4] X Research source If your TV is large, it's a good idea to have someone help you take it down. Even if the TV is relatively light, a large TV can be awkward to handle by yourself. If your TV sits on a base, this should also be detached from the TV in order to pack it effectively. This typically requires the use of a screwdriver. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep all packaging when you purchase your TV. When you purchase a new TV, it's a good idea to keep all of its packaging so you can use it for future moves. A TV's packaging is specially made to protect it, so using the original packaging is the easiest and most effective way to protect it during a move. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Place protective cushioning on the TV. Remove all of the protective packaging inside the box and put it back on your TV. The packaging was made specifically for your TV, so it should fit perfectly. [7] X Research source You may have to play around with the foam or cardboard protective pieces that cushion the TV. Take your time and just make sure that they are placed on the TV correctly."

      "title": "Put the TV in the box.",
      "content": "Put the TV in the box. Slide the TV into the box and make sure it is placed correctly. If it is, it should not move around much when the box is closed. Once the box is closed up, seal it with tape. Some TV boxes can be closed with tabs and do not need to be taped shut. However, without tape, there is always a chance of the TV coming out of the box by accident."

[8] X Expert Source Marty Stevens-Heebner, SMM-C, CPO® Certified Professional Organizer & Senior Move Manager Expert Interview. 14 January 2020. [9] X Research source In many cases, you can use materials that you are already going to move, such as blankets, clothes, and other linens. They can pad your TV and get moved in the process, and then you don't have to spend extra money buying additional packing materials."

      "content": "Wrap the whole TV in cushioning. Wrap the TV in the soft packing materials you have found. Once the whole TV is totally wrapped, tape the padding in place. Wrapping the entire TV before taping ensures that the tape does not get on the TV, which could damage the screen. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Place heavier protection over the face of the TV.",
      "content": "Place heavier protection over the face of the TV. Once you have cushioned the face of the TV, it's a good idea to put a harder layer of protection on top of the cushioning. Use a piece of cardboard or thin plywood to protect the face of the TV. Regardless of whether you have a flat screen TV or another type, you should measure the entire front. Then cut the cardboard to size and tape it on the TV by wrapping tape all the way around it. [11] X Research source If you have a large TV, you may need to use several pieces of cardboard to cover the face of the TV. You can use the cardboard from a flattened moving box or any spare plywood you have around. If you can, construct a makeshift box out of pieces of cardboard. This will protect the TV more effectively than just protecting the front of it."

      "content": "Move the TV carefully. If you haven't put your TV in a secure box, you need to be careful when moving it. Make sure that it is in a very protected spot in your moving truck, such as next to a mattress or other soft surface. You may even want to take the TV and move it in your own car. Taking it in the back seat of your car will help ensure that it gets to its destination safely."

These are available from most moving companies and at many home improvement stores. [12] X Research source Packing kits typically include a box that can hold TVs in a range of sizes. Look at the packaging before you buy the kit to make sure your TV will fit in it. Kits should include a box and corner cushioning for the TV. They may also include padding, such as bubble wrap."

This protective layer can consist of soft padding, such as a thin blanket, or packing material, such as bubble wrap.

      "content": "Fill empty space with cushioning. Because packing kits are made to fit many different TVs, there may be a lot of empty space in the box. Try filling this space with packing material, such as newspaper or bubble wrap, to ensure that your TV is kept secure.
