      "content": "Select a game option. Select the current game type (e.g., SQUADS ), then, in the resulting menu, select one of the following game types: Solo — 100 players fight each other. Duo — You and a teammate versus 49 other teams. Squads — You and three teammates versus 24 other teams. Soaring 50's — You with 49 other players battle 50 other players. In this mode, Gliders can be re-deployed. (This is a Limited Time Mode(LTM))"

    {
      "title": "Understand the premise of Fortnite.",
      "content": "Understand the premise of Fortnite. At its core, Fortnite is an elimination-style shooter which emphasizes being the last person, duo, or squad standing. To this end, successful Fortnite players are often cautious and situationally aware. Surviving in Fortnite is much more important than killing other players."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with basic Fortnite conventions.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with basic Fortnite conventions. There are a few main conventions Fortnite uses to add a twist to its gameplay: Entry — All Fortnite players start in the same location (a flying bus) out of which they must jump in order to land on the island below. Pickaxe — Fortnite players all start with a pickaxe in their inventories. This pickaxe can be used for anything from offence to resource gathering. Resources — Resources such as wood can be gathered by using your pickaxe on things like houses and trees. These resources can then be used to build structures such as towers or barricades. Storm — The storm is a convention which slowly makes outer parts of the map unplayable as the game goes on. It does this by expanding inward at certain points in the match (e.g., 3 minutes in). Getting caught in the storm will cause you to die slowly."

    {
      "title": "Avoid the storm.",
      "content": "Avoid the storm. Once a Fortnite game has progressed past the 3-minute mark, a storm will appear on the outskirts of the map. This storm will progressively grow, thus shrinking the playable area and forcing the remaining players together. If you get caught in the storm, it will rapidly drain your health, eventually resulting in death if you remain in the storm long enough. The storm will usually kill several players in the mid-to end-game part of a match, so make sure you're aware of the storm's position as the match goes on."

    {
      "title": "Try playing conservatively at first.",
      "content": "Try playing conservatively at first. To win in Fortnite, all you have to do is stay alive until everyone else is dead. While this is significantly easier said than done, the best way to stay alive is by avoiding unnecessary risks and encounters. Aggressive strategies aren't out of the question in Fortnite, but they tend to work best for quicker, more experienced players."
    },
    {
      "title": "Jump to Tilted Towers.",
      "content": "Jump to Tilted Towers. Many Fortnite players will jump out of the bus near the beginning of the match, or when they spot a large settlement below. Instead of following suit, try to exit the bus at the very last second, and aim for a small house or village rather than larger establishments. This will place you on the outskirts of the map, so you'll need to move further than other players to avoid the storm later in the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Acquire a weapon as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Acquire a weapon as soon as possible. While your pickaxe can be used as a last-ditch weapon if necessary, weapons such as assault rifles, sniper rifles, and shotguns tend to dominate Fortnite's conflicts. Keep in mind that any weapon is better than no weapon, so picking up a pistol or an SMG if you can't find your preferred weapon is perfectly fine—you can always switch out your weapons later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use resources to build shelter as needed.",
      "content": "Use resources to build shelter as needed. Using your pickaxe on things like wood or rocks will net you resources which can be used to create towers, barricades, walls, and so on. Player-made shelters tend to be conspicuous, but they're good for putting a few layers of cover between you and an enemy player if the player already knows where you are. An alternative to using resources for shelter is hiding in existing shelters (e.g., houses) or taking cover inside of hiding places such as bushes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your back to the water.",
      "content": "Keep your back to the water. Staying faced toward the centre of the map with your back to the ocean will decrease the risk of someone sneaking up on you, especially if the storm has begun to develop. The water/storm is one section from which you can literally never be attacked, making it the only true \"corner\" you can back yourself into. Be careful not to get stuck between a conflict and the storm, as this will force you to enter a fight you might not be qualified for."
    },
    {
      "title": "Communicate with your team if necessary.",
      "content": "Communicate with your team if necessary. If you're playing a Duo or Squad match, it's incredibly important for you to talk to your teammates about known enemy locations, discovered resources, and the like. Naturally, you'll skip this step if you're playing the Solo game type. You can also let your teammate(s) know when you've been downed, making it easier for them to come find and revive you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evaluate enemies before engaging them.",
      "content": "Evaluate enemies before engaging them. You can usually tell which kind of weapon an enemy has from a distance; this is important if you're struggling to find decent power weapons, as going up against a player who has an assault rifle while you have a pistol will almost certainly prove fatal for you. Consider hiding instead of fighting if the enemy is better-armed and/or better-positioned. It's also important to keep an eye on a prospective target's behaviour. If the enemy is running around looking for loot, you have a better chance of catching them off-guard than if they're holed up in a bunker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for enemies in common hiding spots.",
      "content": "Look for enemies in common hiding spots. Bushes, houses, and other easy hiding spots are likely to contain enemies, especially later in the game when more of the players are in the same location. Fortnite players tend to be fairly creative when it comes to hiding spots. If you hear a player inside a house and you can't find them, your best bet is to run away rather than spend more time searching for them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep playing.",
      "content": "Keep playing. Like any other online shooter, Fortnite has a steep learning curve at first, and the only way to improve is by continuing to play. Once you've played a few games, you'll most likely have a handle on the basics of Fortnite, making it easier to secure a win."
