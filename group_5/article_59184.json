      "content": "Disconnect your garbage disposal appliance from the main power source. This is to ensure it's not switched on by accident while you're removing the glass, which could result in serious injuries. If you can see its connection to the power outlet, simply unplug the power chord. Otherwise, break the power connection at the fuse box or circuit breaker."

      "title": "Dislodge the glass.",
      "content": "Dislodge the glass. [2] X Research source If you can't move the glass at all, you'll need to dislodge it first. Determine whether there's an Allen-wrench port at the bottom of the disposal, which is located under the sink. If there is, insert an Allen-wrench into the port and turn it back and forth to move the masher plate and dislodge the glass. If you can't find an Allen-wrench port, insert the handle of a broom or a hammer into the top of the garbage disposal and wiggle it around to try to dislodge the glass. Remove all pieces of glass you can easily reach with the pliers."

      "title": "Vacuum the garbage disposal.",
      "content": "Vacuum the garbage disposal. [3] X Research source Use a wet-dry vacuum cleaner to remove any smaller shards of glass. Simply hold the opening of the hose over the top of the garbage disposal and allow the vacuum to run until you can't hear anything be sucked up anymore. If the sink isn't particularly wet, you can use a regular vacuum, covering the end of the extension tube with a nylon stocking secured with a rubber band. If your sink is double, cover the holes; to maximize suction on dispenser. For example, if have a two-part sink: use nylon wrap to stuff the second hole; this is to block the air from escaping. Also put nylon around the vacuum rod; this is to block air from escaping there; now more pressure will be on bits of glass. After you're done, clean the vacuum too; likely there will be water in it too; this is to avoid mold forming in there."

      "title": "Reset your garbage disposal.",
      "content": "Reset your garbage disposal. Reconnect the garbage disposal to the power source. Partially cover the drain with an old plate. This will prevent any objects from flying up, but still allow the water to drain out. Turn on the cold water faucet. Turn the garbage disposal on. Any remaining small pieces of glass will now be chopped up and washed down the drain. If the garbage disposal still jams, there's probably still glass stuck in it. Turn it off immediately, turn off the cold water, and repeat the process from the beginning."

If necessary, enlist the help of a family member or friend, as garbage disposals are usually quite heavy. Once you've removed the disposal, carefully remove any remaining pieces of glass. Reinstall the garbage disposal following the instructions in the manual. [5] X Research source"
