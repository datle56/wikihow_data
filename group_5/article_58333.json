You will also need to place Daddy into bed before attaching the headboard. Daddy also needs to wear his yellow bed cap (unless it falls off). Place Daddy's bed on the board. On the newest copies of games, there's a dashed line that forms the \"border\" to the place of where to put the bed and in what direction to put it. Snap Daddy into bed. Prepare the spinner. Not only will you need the cardboard with the color, but you'll need the spinner arrow and the spinner base, which attaches to the bottom of the card. If you've already fixed this, you may just need to get this spinner out from the box."
