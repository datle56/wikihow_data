      "content": "Clean the carrots. Before cooking carrots, they require minor preparation, as follows: New, smaller carrots: Don't peel or cut. Simply scrub clean with a stiff vegetable brush. Cook whole. Older, larger carrots: They can be scrubbed clean (in cold water) but if the skin is very blemished or the recipe calls for it, they can be peeled and scraped off too. Larousse Gastronomique advises that carrots should not be scraped or peeled if maximum nutritional content is to be retained; simply brush them if you're aware of their organic origins but do peel or scrape if concerned about pesticides. [1] X Research source These carrots can be sliced, diced or cut into julienne strips for cooking. Grate the carrot where the recipe requires. In cooking, grated carrot is often used inside puddings, cakes and savory baked dishes."
