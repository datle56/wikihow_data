      "title": "If your north node is in Pisces, your south node is in Virgo.",
      "content": "If your north node is in Pisces, your south node is in Virgo. The south node is said to represent holdovers from a past life. Virgo is an earth sign, marked by inflexibility and preciseness. You may have difficulty with your emotions, so your Pisces north node is there to help you overcome this struggle. [2] X Research source Unlike the planets in astrology, your north node and your south node aren't actually physical objects. Instead, they refer to the two points where the orbit of the moon crosses the orbit of the sun. Your south node falls directly across the chart from your north node. Virgo south nodes are thought to come from a more rigid and structured past life, which can sometimes be expressed through self-criticism. As a Virgo south node, you may feel a need to set high standards for yourself, just be careful to not let them overwhelm your creativity."

      "content": "Build your trust in others. Having innate intuition can lead you to have an overdeveloped sense of danger, which can make it hard to trust other people. Although clear perception is a strength of yours, releasing the fears you have around other people helps you build loving, supportive relationships. [4] X Research source Taking people at face value can be hard, but the first step to trusting people is believing in what they say. If you’re not sure of someone's intentions, ask them directly about how they feel. Keep in mind the times that people have come through for you.

      "title": "Balance compassion toward yourself and others.",
      "content": "Balance compassion toward yourself and others. Having Pisces placements lends itself well to your compassionate abilities, but you may find it difficult to accept love for yourself. Being vulnerable enough to take love from other people without feeling you’ve earned it can be scary, but it’s all about trusting those around you. To build healthy relationships, let other people’s kindness in. [6] X Research source Feeling worthy of love starts with accepting who you are. Think about the people who you love despite their flaws, and extend that grace to yourself. Keep a list of your strengths and add to it every day. Receiving loving comments from other people can help your self-esteem, but that’s not the same as self-love. Take time to think about things you like about yourself, and write them down."

      "content": "Be wary of destructive relationships. Your love of community and interconnectedness might lead you to a diverse array of relationships, but it also can make it hard to leave people you feel connected to. Pay attention to relationships that may be causing you more harm than good, and release them with love . North node in Pisces is an incredibly adaptable placement, so be aware of where you are allowing your boundaries to be crossed. It’s okay to change your boundaries , but only when the new ones still reflect your wants and needs. Don’t be afraid to be open with your feelings! Talk to your partners about what you want from them so you can all be on the same page. For example, you may gravitate toward partners who are as social and community-oriented as you. However, you might need someone more introverted who can really ground you and remind you of how important it is to take alone time to recharge. Reader Poll: We asked 708 wikiHow readers with a Pisces placement, and only 4% said their biggest deal breaker is their partner being less social than them . [Take Poll] So, having a partner who's not super social may be your best choice."

      "title": "Accept that you can’t control everything.",
      "content": "Accept that you can’t control everything. Sometimes the natural empathy of the Pisces north node can lead you to take things into your own hands to get the best outcome. Even when your intentions are pure, you can put yourself at risk of engaging in manipulative behaviors when you act behind the scenes. It’s easier to work as a team than alone. Communicate with those around you and work on reaching goals together. For example, if you feel a project would be better if you changed what someone else wrote, think about how that would make the other person feel. If you have an idea you can share it, but be sure everyone knows what you’re thinking upfront."

Instead of being overly critical of how you express your ideas, relax any rigid standards you carry and allow yourself to be less precise, and more spiritual and intuitive with your words. This goes both ways! As you open up your own standards, rethink the criticisms you may have of other communication styles and belief systems. Prioritize practice over idealism. Instead of thinking about what you should do and say, go out into the world and say and do what you think! Let conversations come naturally from within and don’t get too in your head."
