      "title": "Saw off both ends of a Crayola marker.",
      "content": "Saw off both ends of a Crayola marker. Remove the marker’s cap and cut off both ends of the marker with a hacksaw. On the end with the marker tip, be sure to cut off the narrow plastic part, too, so you’re left with a plastic tube that’s uniform in diameter. [1] X Research source You can make this gun with 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) PVC pipe, as well. A marker is a great (and cheap) substitute since most people have one laying around the house. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a hacksaw handy, use a Dremel tool for this. Be careful using sharp cutting tools since they can be dangerous. If you're a kid, ask an adult to help you out with this part."

      "content": "Remove the ink cartridge inside the plastic tube. Once you saw off the ends, the cartridge should pop out easily. You can use a screwdriver to pop the ink cartridge out if it’s being stubborn. Watch out, though! Handling the ink cartridge can get a bit messy. [3] X Research source Do this part outside or over a trash can to prevent any messes. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Push a drill bit through the tube to smooth out the inside. You’ll see a few small plastic prongs inside the tubing; those need to be removed so your darts launch properly. Use a drill to quickly file down the prongs so the inside of the tube is perfectly smooth. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a drill, use a file to smooth out the prongs. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach a regular balloon to the tube’s narrow end. One end of the marker is slightly narrower than the other end, but you have to look closely to tell! Once you identify the narrow end, slip the round lip of a regular balloon over the end and pull the balloon neck up the tube about 1 in (2.5 cm). [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure the balloon in place with a zip tie.",
      "content": "Secure the balloon in place with a zip tie. Wrap a zip tie around the plastic tube to hold the balloon firmly in place. One regular zip tie should do the trick. [8] X Research source If you want to make your gun look cooler, wrap the plastic tube with black electrical tape to hide the white areas and the Crayola logo."

      "content": "Blow a puff of air into the tube’s open end to partially inflate the balloon. Once the balloon is attached, bring the plastic tube up to your mouth. Blow a puff of air into the open end of the tube so the balloon inflates about halfway. You don't need to fully inflate the balloon for this. [9] X Research source Be sure to load and shoot the dart right after you inflate the balloon! The balloon will slowly deflate on its own."

For older darts, push it all the way into the tube. [10] X Research source Don’t push the dart beyond the other end of the tube. It won't work if the dart falls into the balloon.

Use a table saw, hacksaw, or Dremel tool to cut down the pipe so that it’s 2 ft (0.61 m) long. [14] X Research source You can buy regular white PVC pipe at any home improvement store.

You only need to drill through one side; don't drill all the way through to the other side. [15] X Research source The most common nail sizes are 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) in length."

Make sure the nail fits snugly and superglue it in place. [16] X Research source The nail prevents Nerf darts from falling into your mouth when you’re shooting your blow gun. If you're using a nail that's shorter than 1 in (2.5 cm) long, you probably won't have to file it down much (or at all)."

Use a hacksaw, table saw, or Dremel tool to cut 6 pieces of leftover PVC; make each piece 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Hold the longer piece of PVC about 6 in (15 cm) from the end. Pack the 6 short pieces lengthwise around the long pipe until it's completely surrounded. Then, use 2 zip ties to hold everything in place.
