      "title": "Lace your shoes, leaving the top eyelets open.",
      "content": "Lace your shoes, leaving the top eyelets open. The very top eyelets on running shoes are usually off to the side of the eyelets second from the top. They’re off-set to allow you to lace them with the runner’s knot. The placement helps pull the top of the shoe tighter to the heel when it’s laced. [1] X Research source If your shoes are already laced up, you don’t have to re-lace them as long as the shoelaces are laced from the inside out in the second-to-top eyelet. Standard criss-cross lacing is the most common lacing style. It crisscrosses the shoelaces as you thread through the eyelets. There are additional running shoe lacings that help address common fit issues like incorrect foot width."

      "content": "A runner’s knot locks your heel into the shoe to prevent slipping. Not only does the runner’s knot make your shoe feel more secure on your foot, but it also helps to minimize the wear and tear on the back of your shoe. Always start by choosing a running shoe that fits your foot to help prevent injuries and keep your feet healthy. [4] X Research source Because a runner’s knot only tightens the collar of your shoe, you don’t have to try to squeeze your foot into a smaller shoe size to get a more secure fit. The runner’s knot is also called a Heel Lock Knot, Lace Lock, or Runner’s Loop. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Tying runner’s knots in your shoelaces helps prevent blisters.",
      "content": "Tying runner’s knots in your shoelaces helps prevent blisters. As your foot sweats and your shoe moves around on your foot during a run, it creates friction. Excess friction is one of the main causes of blisters from shoes. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Customizing the fit of your running shoes with a runner’s knot helps to hold the shoe in place. To prevent blisters , wear socks made of moisture-wicking fabric and apply athletic tape to your heel and other blister-prone spots before your run."

      "title": "Runner’s knots provide more ankle support.",
      "content": "Runner’s knots provide more ankle support. Because this knot pulls the shoe’s collar tight and prevents your heel from slipping around in the shoe, it helps keep your ankle straight as you run. A secure shoe is less likely to cause your ankle to twist or roll, which causes your ankle ligaments to stretch too far or even tear, resulting in a sprain. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re prone to ankle sprains or are recovering from a sprain, you may need more support than a runner’s knot can provide. Wrapping your ankle with athletic tape or wearing soft ankle braces provides more support for weak and healing ankles.

Pull the ends of both shoelaces tight to make the starting knot. Then, make a loop with the left shoelace and wrap the right shoelace around the base of the loop. Instead of wrapping the lace over the top of the loop as with a standard shoelace bow, wrap it under the loop and then over the top to make a more secure knot. [9] X Research source For an alternate secure knot called the Better Bow Knot , wrap the shoelace over the top of the first loop twice instead of once. Make a second loop by pulling the shoelace below the first loop. Hold both loops and pull them tight. [10] X Research source"

Starting with your shoes already laced up and on your feet, find the spot on the top of your foot that rubs against your shoe. Unlace the shoe to the set of eyelets just below the painful spot by pulling the ends of the shoelaces out of the eyelets. [13] X Research source Window Lacing is ideal for people wearing the right shoe size but still experiencing pain or discomfort on the tops of their feet. This is usually due to having high insteps and arches. Creating a “window” or gap lets you lessen the pressure on the top of your foot while keeping the rest of the lacing secure. [14] X Research source Starting with your shoes already laced and on your feet helps you find the exact spot where your shoe causes pain."

By leaving a “window” over the painful spot, you put less pressure on the area, which helps lessen the irritation."
