      "content": "Dehydrate your mushrooms. If you have fresh mushrooms, arrange ⅛ a cup on a parchment paper-lined baking tray. Keep half an inch of space between each piece for air circulation. Slide the tray into a dehydrator at 125ºF (52ºC) for 3-8 hours until the mushrooms are breakable. [1] X Research source Or, use an oven at its lowest temperature setting. Keep the door propped open for steam to escape, and flip the mushrooms every hour until they're dry. You can also lay the mushrooms flat on a paper towel for 2 to 4 days until they are brittle and breakable. If using store-bought dried mushrooms, you can skip this step."
