These are the most common surfactants in dishwashing liquids. Nonionic Surfactants are milder and ideal for people with sensitive skin. These include Fatty Alcohol Polyoxyethylene Ether (AEO-9) and Cocamide DEA. Amphoteric Surfactants include Cocamidopropyl Betaine and Cocamidopropylamine Oxide. [9] X Research source"
