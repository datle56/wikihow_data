      "content": "The Bible doesn’t mention tarot cards, but it condemns divination. The earliest known usage of tarot cards dates back to 15th century Europe, so tarot cards didn’t exist when the Bible was written. However, because tarot cards are a form of divination, most Christians include them in the Bible’s references to the occult, which is forbidden according to Scripture (Deuteronomy 18:10-12). [1] X Research source Divination comes from a Latin word that means “from the gods,” similar to “divine” and “divinity.” Because of this, it is interpreted to mean that you’re looking for answers from false gods rather than trusting God with your future."

      "content": "The Book of Enoch states that occultism comes from fallen angels. In the Book of Enoch, a non-canonical writing quoted in the New Testament, it is said that fallen angels taught humanity how to use charms, enchantments, astrology, divination, and mind-altering drugs. Because of this, the early church was very aware of occultism. Here are some examples of where these practices are mentioned: [2] X Research source “The demons were the inventors of astrology, soothsaying, divination…oracles, necromancy, the arts of magic, and whatever evil practices men exercise in addition to those things.” (Lactantius) “Magic and sorcery derive their power from evil demons…” (Origen) “My child, do not be an observer of omens, for it leads the way to idolatry. Likewise, do not be an enchanter or an astrologer.” (Didache)"

      "content": "Tarot cards are cards meant to divine wisdom and guidance. A tarot deck features 78 cards, each with a unique image and meaning. When shuffled and laid out into a spread, the cards are meant to reveal any personal challenges and how to overcome them, as well as insight into what the future might hold. [3] X Research source Tarot readings are focused on self-awareness and self-discovery. They are not associated with evil, and they do not invoke black magic, demons, or other spirits and entities. Because tarot cards are a form of divination, many Christians believe using them is sinful, while many nonbelievers see nothing wrong with the cards and do not believe they’re evil."

      "title": "Most Christians do not support the use of tarot cards.",
      "content": "Most Christians do not support the use of tarot cards. Because using tarot cards is a form of divination, most Christians believe they are sinful. Many believe divination comes from demons or fallen angels, so they believe tarot cards are evil and that Christians should not interact with them, or other forms of divination or the occult, in any way. [4] X Research source That being said, not all Christians believe this, and some even consider themselves Christian witches and use tarot cards in their practice. It is ultimately up to you and your personal convictions to decide how you feel about tarot cards and if you should use them as a Christian. If you believe tarot cards are sinful and discover another Christian has been using them, remember to treat the person with love and kindness. Do not assume they’re evil, and kindly let them know why you’re concerned."

However, most tarot readers will say that the cards are a tool for self-awareness and guidance. They offer insight into the present and potential paths for the future, but the future is ultimately shaped and determined by our actions and choices. [5] X Research source"
