If you want to change your ticket within 24 hours, the airline will first see if there are any available seats on alternate flights. If there are, the airline will charge you $75 to change your flight and you will be confirmed for the new flight. If there aren't flights available, then you'll be given the option to get on the standby list for free. While you wait for your ticket to be changed, you'll keep your seat on the original flight. Note that if you'd like to change your flight before the 24-hour mark, you can change and confirm a new seat on the Delta website anytime. For non-members, Silver Medallion Members, and General SkyMiles Members, you'll have to choose a flight that is earlier than the one that you booked. Diamond, Platinum, and Gold Medallion Members can pick a flight any time that day. Delta's standby service is available for all flight classes except for Basic Economy. You can get on the standby list for multiple-segment flights, but you'll have to sign up for the standby list for each segment."
