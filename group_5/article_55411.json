      "content": "Grow mangoes in warm, humid climates for the best results. Mango trees are tropical plants that thrive best in high heat, and can handle both humid/swampy or arid areas. Most mangoes are grown near the equator, and in the United States they are primarily grown in Florida, California, and Hawaii. Climates with average temperatures of 75–86 °F (24–30 °C) and frost-free winters are perfect for growing mangoes. [1] X Research source Mangoes thrive in USDA hardiness zones 10B through 1. Find the hardiness zone map here . [2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Temperatures below 30 °F (−1 °C) damage mango trees, and temps below 40 °F (4 °C) interfere with flowering and fruiting. [3] X Research source Mangoes prefer 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rainfall (or less) per year."

      "content": "Select a roomy planting area that gets 6 hours of sunlight daily. Grow mangoes in large pots or pick a spacious area outside that receives full sun (6 or more hours of light per day). Tree size varies by species, but most mango species get quite large and trees can live 40+ years. Choose a spot 12–15 ft (3.7–4.6 m) away from other trees so the mango has room to thrive. [4] X Research source Since they prefer heat and direct sunlight, mangoes don’t grow well indoors (although it's fine to bring potted mango trees inside for the winter)."

      "title": "Pick a planting location with loose, well-draining soil.",
      "content": "Pick a planting location with loose, well-draining soil. Mango trees can adapt to most types of soil (including sandy, loamy, etc.) as long as there's good drainage and adequate space for growth. To prepare and loosen up the soil, till it about 3 ft (0.91 m) deep. Check the pH of your soil; mango trees grow best in soil that has a pH of 4.5 – 7 (acidic). Incorporate peat moss into your soil on a yearly basis in order to keep the acidity high . [5] X Research source Avoid using chemical fertilizers, salts, boron and, lawn herbicides since mango trees are sensitive to them. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Plant mango trees in late spring or early summer.",
      "content": "Plant mango trees in late spring or early summer. Wait until the weather is warm and all danger of frost has passed so the mango tree can establish itself in temperate conditions. Planting time may depend on the species, so check online or with your local nursery if you need more specific details. [7] X Research source For example, some mango varieties, such as the Beverly and Keitt don’t need to be planted until August/September. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Get mango seeds from large, ripe polyembryonic mangoes.",
      "content": "Get mango seeds from large, ripe polyembryonic mangoes. Polyembryonic seeds produce clones of the parent tree. If you live in an area that grows mangoes, visit local orchards to select a fruit. If you don’t have access to a healthy mango tree, visit a local grocer or farmer's market to select a fruit. Ask the salesperson for help in choosing a fruit that is polyembryonic. [9] X Research source If you don't want to grow from seed, consider buying grafted saplings from a nursery. Mango seeds typically take 8 years to produce fruit. Grafted saplings take 3-5 years to produce fruit. Seed-grown trees tend to be much stronger and hardier, but they may not be as reliable as grafted trees when it comes to fruit-bearing."

Position the seed concave side down and cover it up with soil. Dampen the soil and place the container in a warm, shaded area until the seed sprouts. This process usually takes 2-3 weeks. [12] X Research source Keep the soil moist until the seed sprouts. Put the seedling in a warm place that doesn't drop below 60 °F (16 °C) to make sure it keeps growing. The leaves may drop off if the temperature gets lower than that."

After the first week, slow down watering to 1-2 times per week until the seedling is established. As your seedling grows, transfer it to larger pots so it doesn't become root bound. Mango tree seedlings are ready to plant into the ground when they're 4-6 months old. [13] X Research source Anytime between 4-18 months is a good time to transplant a young mango tree."

Remove any dead or sucker branches growing from the main structural branches. Cut branches 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the trunk if there's too much crowding near the center, typically after the last fruit of the season (in the fall). To limit outward growth, simply cut off branches that are too tall or wide. [21] X Research source Be sure to prune off any damaged branches, as well, especially following winter freezes.

Fruits should be hard and green when pick them. Pull or cut each fruit leaving a 1 in (2.5 cm) stalk attached. [24] X Research source Because mangoes vary in color, shape, and size from species to species, you can’t tell if the fruit is ripe until you cut it open. When the meat is yellow through to the core, it's ready to eat. If the meat still very white and hard, wait 1-2 weeks to ripen the mango and then check it again."
