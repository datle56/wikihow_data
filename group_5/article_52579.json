[1] X Research source If you don't have an elevated rack, crumple up several sheets of aluminum foil and scatter them across the bottom of the baking dish. You'll need to keep the pork belly elevated as it cooks to help the fat render more readily."

[2] X Research source Pierce through the tough skin and the top layer of fat, but do not cut too deeply into the actual meat lying beneath the two. Scoring the meat in this manner will allow more of the fat to render out during the roasting process."

      "content": "Rub in the oil, salt, and pepper. Place the pork belly on your prepared baking rack with the skin side facing up. Rub the top with oil, then liberally season the meat with salt and pepper. [3] X Research source In addition to seasoning the meat, the oil and salt make it easier for the fat to render out, resulting in crispier skin. Apply the seasonings by hand, and work the salt and pepper into the slits across the skin. Note that salt and pepper should withstand the roasting process without deteriorating, but other spices and herbs might burn. If you decide to add others, do so within the final 30 minutes of cooking."

Optional: Slice the belly and then sear the slices in a hot pan (preferably cast iron) for about a minute on each side. This will provide an even crispier finish and allow the flavor to develop even further. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator for 3-4 days.
