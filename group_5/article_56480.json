      "content": "Place your child around cats in temporary situations. Go to a friend or family member's house where you know a cat is living and get the child to interact with the cat. This way, you can watch for signs of a cat allergy. Be aware that cat allergies can arise from contact with the skin, fur, dander, saliva and urine of the animal. It is important to note here that you should not try exposing your child to cats, or any animals, without knowing if they do or don’t have an allergy if your child suffers from asthma. Simple allergic symptoms can trigger potentially deadly asthma episodes. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Have an allergist test your child. Observational and anecdotal evidence may be enough to determine a cat allergy in a child. However, you will want to visit the doctor and get an allergy test. Keep in mind, though, they aren't always accurate, so if your child tests negative, you should still observe the child for signs of allergies when he is exposed to a cat.

      "content": "Spot more severe allergies. Most allergic reactions are limited to redness, itching, hives and nose stuffiness, but signs of more severe allergic reactions may become apparent when exposing your child to a cat. Swelling of the throat can occur in severe allergic reactions, which can lead to the constriction of airways. If this happens, get your child to a medical professional immediately and do not expose them to any more cats in the future.

      "content": "Note whether your child experiences a mild or severe allergy. If your child’s allergy symptoms are mild, you can probably control them with over-the-counter medication and proper sanitation around your house. If the symptoms are severe, such as breaking out in body-wide hives, or swelling of the throat or other airways, you will need to ensure your child is no longer exposed to cats. If you already have a cat and find out that your child is severely allergic, you will likely need to rehouse your cat."

They also help relieve itching, sneezing and runny nose. You can purchase these medications over-the-counter or acquire them with a prescription. [4] X Research source Antihistamines come in pill form, as nasal sprays or in syrups, which are specifically designed for children.

These shots, usually administered once or twice a week by an allergist, can help a child overcome the symptoms of allergies that can’t be controlled with either antihistamines or decongestants. Allergy shots \"train\" your immune system by desensitizing it to specific allergens. This is typically called immunotherapy. The initial shots expose you to very small doses of the allergen, in this case, the cat protein that causes an allergic reaction. The dose is, “gradually increased, usually during a three- to six-month period. Maintenance shots are needed every four weeks for three to five years.” [8] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source Also, be sure to ask your doctor or allergist about age and dosage restrictions as they may apply to your child.
