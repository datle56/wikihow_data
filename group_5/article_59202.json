      "content": "Moles, warts, and other skin conditions might look like a skin tag. The concern here is that some of these conditions indicate a more serious risk, including cancer. Even if you're pretty sure that it's a skin tag, only a doctor or dermatologist can tell you for sure. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Usually, a doctor only needs to look at the growth to identify it as a skin tag. If they're not sure, they might take a biopsy (a small sample of tissue) and send it to a lab for testing. Never attempt to remove a skin tag without first confirming that it's a skin tag. If it happens to be something else, you can potentially do serious damage to your skin."

      "content": "Dip scissors and tweezers in rubbing alcohol to disinfect them. Grasp the end of the tag with your clean tweezers and pull it away from your skin, then snip across the base. Have a piece of sterile gauze ready because it will likely bleed a little. [3] X Research source Any sharp scissors will work, but small scissors, such as cuticle scissors, tend to work best because you have more control. You usually won't feel more than a pinch when you do this, but if you're worried about it hurting, numb your skin with a piece of ice first. Get a friend to help if you're not sure if you can do it by yourself. Clean the wound with soap and warm water, pat your skin dry, and cover it with a small bandage for a day or so. Small tags are typically only a couple of millimeters (a fraction of an inch) or less in diameterâ€”the size of the point of a sharp crayon.

This also won't work for flat tags that aren't hanging off the surface of your skin."

      "content": "Use tweezers to pull the tag away from the skin. Tie a loop of dental floss around the base and pull it tight. You might want to tie a knot to make sure the loop stays tight and in place, then cut off the excess floss and release the tag. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source A thin piece of thread, like you would use for sewing, can also work. [6] X Research source Leave the floss tied around the base of the tag to deprive it of blood. It will turn red, then black, and then it will drop off. Usually, the skin under the tag is already healed at this point. The whole process can take several days, so if the floss or thread happens to come off during that time, simply tie another strand back on."
