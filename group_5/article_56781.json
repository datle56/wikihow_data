You can make a DIY lumbar support by using a rolled up towel or pillow and placing at the base of your spine. Lumbar support add-ons can also be purchased for a marginal price if you don't want to buy a whole new chair."

If your posture is good, then there should be a space about the width of a hand between your back and hand.

If there is less space and your back is touching your hand, arch your back until it is no longer touching your hand. Once you have corrected your posture, walk away from the wall.
