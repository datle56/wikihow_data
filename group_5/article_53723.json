      "content": "Opt for rich fabrics like wool and silk to seem more put-together. To project the confidence and authority of a CEO, try to dress in high-quality materials whenever possible. Wool is the most popular option for suits, and flowy silk blouses never go out of style. Even though these materials cost a little more, you’ll typically be able to get a lot more wear out of them than you would if you purchased clothing made from cheaper fabrics.

If you live somewhere with very hot weather, you might opt for linen or seersucker fabrics, instead. It's worth spending the extra money to invest in a few quality pieces for your wardrobe. When you're shopping for investment pieces, make sure you choose classic styles that won't go out of fashion anytime soon.

      "content": "Avoid tight-fitting or low-cut clothing. As a CEO, it’s important to project confidence and competence. If your clothing is too tight or you’re showing too much cleavage, you can send the wrong message, and the focus will be on your body, rather than your accomplishments. To avoid this, opt for clothing that skims your figure without being form-fitting or baggy, and cover up your décolletage. [12] X Research source If the top you’re wearing is too low-cut, wear a sleeveless shell underneath it, or take it to your tailor and have an extra stitch sewn into the neckline to close it. Also, when you’re choosing button-down shirts, make sure they fit comfortably and don’t gape across your chest."

Whenever you buy new work clothes, consider having them professionally tailored so they fit you perfectly. A jacket that’s too bulky in the waist will seem messy and unprofessional, but if you take that jacket to a tailor and have it taken in a couple of inches in the waist, you’ll look put-together and stylish. [13] X Research source You can also have pants, skirts, and dresses tailored to be the perfect length for you. A tailor can help your clothes fit you perfectly, no matter what your body type is.

Also, straight-leg and boot-cut styles should cover most of the back of your shoe and should graze the top. [15] X Research source Avoid low-rise pants, which look very informal. If you’re wearing skinny jeans, the hem should land right at your ankle. If they’re longer, they’ll bunch up at the bottom, which looks messy."

      "content": "Opt for skirts that hit at, just above, or just below your knees. Knee-length skirts are the most professional-looking, and they’ll also help you avoid any embarrassing faux-pas due to showing too much skin. A skirt that hits just above the knee is very flattering for most body types, but if you’re very tall, a skirt that’s hemmed just below your knee may be a more flattering proportion for your height. [16] X Research source Ankle-length skirts are acceptable too, but they can be difficult to style in a way that looks professional. If you want to wear one, try to pair it with pieces like a tailored button-down and stylish ankle boots."

When you’re shopping for shirts, be sure to try them on to make sure you get a perfect fit, since a shirt that’s too tight or low-cut can send the wrong message in the office. Whether you prefer button-down styles, polo shirts, or flowy blouses, stay away from styles that show too much skin, and if a shirt is see-through, always wear a shell or cami underneath.

Whether you’re wearing pants, a skirt, or even a dress, you can take your outfit from business casual to ready for the boardroom by tossing on a structured jacket or blazer. Look for a jacket that is slightly squared in the shoulders and nipped-in at the waist for the most professional look. [18] X Research source For instance, if you’re wearing a camel-colored pencil skirt, a yellow blouse, and a pair of loafers, try topping it with a cream-colored structured blazer to pull the look together. If your office is more informal, or you have a Casual Friday policy, you can even dress up dark-colored jeans with a jacket and a pair of ankle boots."

You can dress it up or down by layering, making it just as perfect for a busy day full of paperwork as it is for an important meeting. Layer your sheath dress with a structured jacket, a comfortable pair of heels, and a low bun for an easy way to look put-together all day. Take your hair down, lose the jacket, and switch to a pair of strappy sandals to go from day-to-night in a snap! Sheath dresses are a great way to stay cool in hot weather, too."

Even if you won’t be wearing it all day, you’ll make a great impression as you’re heading into the office each day. [19] X Research source A pea coat looks perfect on top of sleek wool trousers and a pair of leather boots, for instance! If the weather is cool, rather than cold, try tossing on a leather jacket to look edgy but put-together."

Avoid tight-fitting shapewear that will leave visible lines, as this can make even the most put-together outfit look unprofessional and messy. Instead, opt for styles that will lift and support your figure. Not only will you look your best, but you’ll feel more confident and comfortable all day.

If you want to be the boss, you’ll need to be able to hustle and get things done all day, and shoes that pinch your feet or make it hard to walk won’t help you accomplish your goals. Boots, pumps, loafers, and dressy flats are all great options for the office. [21] X Research source Your shoes should be neatly polished to ensure they’re work-appropriate. Avoid open-toed shoes, as these typically come across as unprofessional. If your office is very casual, a pair of nice-looking sneakers may be acceptable, but they should still be free from scuffs."

Even if you’re running your own business, it’s best to follow the same guidelines that others in your industry abide by. Typically, this means wearing darker colors, suits or jackets, and conservative footwear to work.

      "content": "Wear more informal styles if you work at a startup or in the tech industry. The tech industry, non-profit organizations, and other startups typically don’t require you to look quite as buttoned-up. To dress like a CEO, try to dress a little nicer than the rest of the employees in your office, since the CEO typically sets the tone for the company. [26] X Research source For instance, if it’s fine for employees to come to work in jeans and sneakers, you might opt for dark-wash jeans and a pair of flats, instead. Keep in mind that you’ll still need a nice suit or dress for meetings with investors or other professional occasions. If you’re not sure about the formality of an office, arrange a visit before you start work, or call the head of the Human Resources Department and ask them what style of dress is preferred."

In fact, people will likely expect you to have a more eclectic style than would be acceptable in a typical office. However, if you want to wear a basic uniform of jeans and a T-shirt every day, that’s fine too. [27] X Research source For instance, if you worked as the CEO of a fashion magazine, you would probably be expected to look stylish every day. If you want to look like you’re in charge, opt for smart, versatile pieces from your favorite designers, like tailored trousers, on-trend blouses, and outerwear with interesting details, like a suit jacket with a contrasting lapel or a stunning red trench coat."
