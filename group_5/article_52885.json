      "title": "Divide your hair into three or more sections.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into three or more sections. You want to make sure that you curl all of your hair, so there aren’t any stray straight pieces. To ensure that you don’t miss any pieces, it's best to section your hair. Separate it into three or more sections depending on how much hair you have, and clip the sections that you're not curling at the moment out of the way."

    {
      "title": "Choose a curling iron that's at least one size smaller than usual.",
      "content": "Choose a curling iron that's at least one size smaller than usual. The tighter your curls are, the longer they’ll usually hold -- and the smaller the curling iron barrel is, the tighter your curls will be. Opt for a curling iron with a barrel size that's one size or more smaller than you usually use. That way, if your curls start to fall, you’ll still be left with some wave and texture rather than just flat, straight strands. [1] X Research source For example, if you usually use a 1 ½-inch (4-cm) curling iron, opt for a 1 ¼-inch (3-cm) barrel instead. If your curls look tighter than you’d like after curling, don’t worry. You can comb through them with your fingers once they’re cool to loosen them up."

      "title": "Grab a small section of hair.",
      "content": "Grab a small section of hair. When you’re ready to curl, take a 1-inch (2.5-cm) piece of hair from the section that you've left unclipped. Clamp the iron onto the end of it, holding the tool vertically. If you are using an iron that does not have a clamp, you can position it near the roots and work downward. [2] X Research source You can curl your hair is sections that are a little larger than an inch (2.5-cm), but keep them around that size. That will ensure the curls are a little tighter so they don't fall out as easily. Try not to curl your hair in sections that are larger than the diameter of the tool you are using. Doing so could result in uneven curls."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the hair around the iron.",
      "content": "Wrap the hair around the iron. With the end of the hair clamped onto the iron, roll the tool towards your head. Be sure to stop far enough away from your scalp that you don't burn it. [3] X Research source It’s best to start with curling with the section closest to your face. When you’re curling the hair around your face, wrap it around the iron in the direction away from your face for the most natural look."

      "title": "Hold the hair on the iron for several seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the hair on the iron for several seconds. You don’t want to burn your hair, but you want to make sure that the curl holds. Hold each section of hair around the iron for 5 to 10 seconds before releasing the iron. [4] X Research source If you have fine, thin, or short hair, 5 seconds is usually long enough. Be sure to keep the iron on a low to medium heat. For thick, coarse, or long hair, you’ll usually need to keep your hair on the iron for 10 seconds. This type of hair is best curled on a medium to high heat."

      "content": "Pin up each curl immediately after curling it. As you release the curl from the iron, coil the curl back up with your fingers and pin it to your head with a bobby pin or a single prong hair clip. That will help the curl keep its shape as it cools. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow your curls to cool completely. To ensure that your curls stay in place without any hair spray, you must allow them to cool fully before you take out the pins. Let your hair cool for 10 to 15 minutes so the curls set completely. [6] X Research source You can also use the cool setting on your blow dryer to hit the curls with cold air and help them set more quickly. Just know that this could cause some fly aways and frizz, and is best for a more beachy or effortless look."

      "content": "Avoid washing your hair for a day or two. The natural oils in your hair can actually help curls hold better so you don’t want to wash them away. Skip shampoo for a couple of days before you plan to curl to allow the oils to build up for added grip. [9] X Research source If your scalp gets too oily, use some dry shampoo at the roots to soak up the grease. Leave the length of your hair alone, though. [10] X Research source"

The cream will play up any natural texture in your hair to help it hold the curl more easily. You don’t necessarily have to use a curl enhancing cream. There are sprays, gels, and mousses that are also designed to prepare the hair for curling."

Hair is more fragile when it's wet so you can do serious damage if you try to use a curling iron when it's wet. Air drying your hair is best when you're curling it because you don't want to use any more heat than is necessary to style it."
