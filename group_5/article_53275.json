      "content": "Monitor the kitten’s belly button after birth. Umbilical hernias are very easy to detect. After birth, check the abdominal area of the kittens. An umbilical hernia will be a bulging area of tissue around the belly button. This hernia will feel soft. If you push it in, it will pop back out immediately. [1] X Research source If an umbilical hernia gurgles when you press on it, take your kitten to the vet immediately. A gurgling umbilical hernia can be a sign that part of your kitten's gut has passed through the hernia. Some kittens may also vomit and refuse to eat. They develop soon after the kitten is born if the opening in the abdomen that was connected to the umbilical cord does not close properly."

      "content": "Correct complicated hernias with surgery. Complicated hernias occur when abdominal organs shift through the hernia and past the muscle. This generally leads to death of some tissue and part of the intestine. This type of hernia will not fix itself, so the kitten must undergo an emergency surgery. [5] X Research source The vet will remove dead and scar tissue and then close the hernia with sutures. Most kittens have a complete recovery after this procedure if the complications are caught early enough. If you think your kitten has a complicated hernia, don't wait to visit your vet."
