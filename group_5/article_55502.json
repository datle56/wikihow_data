Leaves are typically ready between 45 and 70 days after seeding. [2] X Research source You can pluck individual leaves even before then if you want without damaging the plant. Regular picking means more leaves, so pick as often as you like!

      "content": "Pick leaves one by one or cut stems 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) long. If you want to leave the plant to continue to grow, cut exterior leaves and use them as you need them. Your cilantro will continue to grow for at least a few weeks, producing more leaves. [4] X Research source If you're harvesting individual leaves, pick them from the top of the plant. That will keep the cilantro looking thick and full as it grows, rather than tall and lanky. [5] X Expert Source Artemisia Nursery Plant Nursery & Garden Shop Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. To harvest the whole plant, cut with a small sickle-type knife just above the soil. Form a bunch of leaves and wrap a rubber band around the stems to secure the bunch together. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "You can harvest cilantro as often as possible until the plant bolts. The nice thing about cilantro is that once you pick the leaves, it'll immediately start growing new ones. As long as the plant hasn't started flowering, it'll just keep growing leaves and you can just keep picking them. [7] X Research source While most cilantro plants only live a few months, this should still guarantee you at least 2 or 3 harvests from the same plant if you've timed your seeding right."

      "content": "Your cilantro will stay fresh for as long as 14 days if you keep it cool. As soon as you pick your cilantro, immediately put it in a cooler or another container with ice or stick it in the fridge. Commercial cilantro is kept at temperatures between 33 and 35 °F (1 and 2 °C) to maintain peak freshness. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that a little cilantro goes a long way. You probably don't need to plant several rows of cilantro in your garden to have enough cilantro to last you a while."

      "content": "For short-term storage, place cilantro in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Cover it with a couple of layers of paper towels to help absorb moisture. This will keep your cilantro fresh for at least 3-5 days. [9] X Research source If you need to keep your cilantro fresh for a week or longer, place the cilantro stem-down in a container of water, like you would a bouquet of flowers. Loosely cover the leaves with a plastic bag and put the whole thing in the fridge. Change the water every couple of days."

      "content": "No, once cilantro flowers (bolts), you can no longer harvest the leaves. After your cilantro flowers, the leaves won't have the flavor you want anymore. On top of that, the plant will die (go to seed) within a few days after bolting. So if you want those tasty cilantro leaves, keep it from bolting for as long as possible. If you harvest by cutting the main stem about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the soil, you can postpone the process. [10] X Research source Planting cilantro in a cooler part of your garden with partial shade can help keep it from bolting early. If you've already planted your cilantro, make a shade to partially cover the plants during the day when the sun's the hottest. [11] X Research source There are also some \"bolt-resistant\" cilantro varieties available. These will get you more cilantro from your plants, especially if you live in a warmer climate with hot summers.

The plant will continue to produce leaves for a month or two before it dies. [13] X Research source Cilantro doesn't live for very long (only about 3 months at most), but you can usually get several good harvests out of one plant."

      "content": "Yes, if you leave it to flower and don't harvest the seeds. Cilantro is an annual plant, meaning it doesn't \"come back\" from the same seeds every year. But it does re-seed itself if you let it, which makes your job as a gardener a lot easier! Just wait for it to flower and let it drop the seeds to the ground. Leave those seeds alone and they'll grow into new plants for you next year. [14] X Research source This only works if you have a dedicated bed for your cilantro (or if you're growing it indoors in a container). If you're growing your cilantro in a larger garden alongside other herbs and vegetables, it's probably better to seed it yourself each year."
