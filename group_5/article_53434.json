      "content": "For most titles, yes, PlayStation Plus is required for online multiplayer. The exception is that most free-to-play or subscription-based games with some degree of online multiplayer gameplay don't require an active PlayStation Plus (PS Plus) membership. While most free-to-play and subscription-based games don't need PS Plus for online play, you may still find some games in these categories that require a PS Plus subscription (i.e., some Destiny 2 modes require PS Plus despite being free-to-play). If a game requires a PS Plus subscription, it will be noted in its description in the PlayStation Store . PS Plus is also not required to use the internet browser on your PlayStation console."
