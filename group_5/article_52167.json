      "content": "Look for an aquarium with grating or holes at the top to provide ventilation. Ventilation is important, as it allows clean air to circulate into the cage. Your cage must allow your gecko to get fresh air, but make sure the top is sturdy, particularly if you have other pets in the house. You want to keep your geckos in and your other pets out! [2] X Research source You can even use plastic storage boxes for a cage, but make sure you drill ventilation holes in the top."

Pour the water off and repeat a couple of times. With the last round, use a water conditioner in the water you rinse with, one meant to remove chlorine and heavy metals. You can find water conditioners in the aquarium section of most pet stores, and it's the same type you'd use for your geckos' drinking water. You just add droplets to the water in the ratios given by the manufacturer. [5] X Research source To dry the sand out, spread it in a single layer in the oven at 225 °F (107 °C) for 30 minutes."

It's essentially dry, so picking it up is not that messy. You can also do this every other day instead, but you don't want to let it build up, as the cage will get messy very quickly. If you're using paper towels as a substrate, you should replace the paper towel in that corner daily or every time you find feces on it."
