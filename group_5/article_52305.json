      "content": "A comma hairstyle involves curling the bangs inward to resemble a comma. The hair is usually trimmed short around the sides and back but left longer and more voluminous on top. The longer pieces are then curved down and toward the face with a straightening iron, so that they look almost like commas. [1] X Research source The hairstyle originated in South Korea, and it exploded in popularity when Korean celebrities, such as members of the K-pop band BTS, started wearing it. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your hair stylist or barber for a two-block haircut. The name “ two block ” refers to the way that the hair is cut into two different sections—the long, voluminous top portion around the crown of the head, and the short, trimmed section around the sides and back. [3] X Research source To get this cut, ask your barber for an undercut on the sides, a light taper or fade in the back, and longer texture on top. Like the comma hairstyle, the two block haircut originated in South Korea and was popularized by Korean celebrities and K-pop artists. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Leave your hair wavy and tousled on top.",
      "content": "Leave your hair wavy and tousled on top. The classic comma hairstyle usually features straight hair that’s subtly curved into the comma shape. However, if you have naturally wavy or curly hair, you can achieve a more chilled-out, tousled version of comma hair. Just follow the steps above, but without using the straightener to create the curved shape. You can also use any products you typically use on your waves or curls, like mousse , gel , or styling wax . [10] X Research source If you have straight hair but you want to achieve the wavy look, consider getting a perm. Sanderson explains that a perm may dry your hair out a little bit, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing—it will also help you achieve the tousled texture you’re going for."
