      "content": "The jaw and chin reflect a person’s will and resilience.

Square chin : A square chin belongs to the power-hungry, stone-willed, and physical strength. Asymmetrical jawline : An uneven chin reflects a shrewd character. You may make a great negotiator, but you may not be trustworthy with sensitive information."

      "title": "Your nose represents your potential and relationship with freedom.",
      "content": "Your nose represents your potential and relationship with freedom. Will you follow your nose and snuff out every opportunity you can, or are you more interested in quitting the rat race and smelling the roses? The nose is among the most complex facial features to analyze because there are a lot of variations and dimensions, but there are some general rules. [12] X Research source Big nose : A big nose indicates you’re a perfectionist who is prone to focus on work. You follow social norms, meaning you likely have good manners and come off as gracious.
