Afterward, remove the casing and bullet from the puller. [4] X Research source You can reuse or recycle the bullet and casing once they’re separated. Kinetic pullers are generally safe, but trying to separate bullets with other tools can be dangerous. To be safe, never use a tool that's not intended for bullets to try this.
