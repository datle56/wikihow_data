      "content": "Get comfortable. To properly work on your breathing, it needs to be your main focus – not on how uncomfortable your legs are, or how you want to hang a picture on the wall you’re staring at.

In a chair, sit with your back straight, your feet flat on the ground, and knees shoulder width apart. On the floor, choose either a cross-legged position or kneeling."
