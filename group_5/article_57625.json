      "content": "Transfer the barley to a large food-safe bucket. You can malt as much barley as you like. It’s important to work in manageable batches depending on your equipment. Malting barley requires a large bucket, a strainer, baking sheets, and a dehydrator. A good quantity of barley to start with is between 1 and 4 pounds (450 and 1,810 g). Don’t fill the bucket more than halfway; otherwise, there won’t be room for water and expansion as the grains absorb water. Make sure to use whole raw barley, and not pearled, hulled, or other types of grain that have been processed. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill the bucket with cool water and soak the barley for 8 hours. Add enough water to completely cover all the grains. The water will kick start the germination process. During soaking, store the barley, uncovered, somewhere cool. The temperature should be between 50 and 60 °F (10 and 16 °C). [2] X Research source During soaking, dirt and components from the husk will dissolve in the water, and these will be drained out later. Getting rid of these particles will make for a better tasting malt. You can soak the barley for longer than 8 hours if necessary, but don’t soak it for longer than 16 hours at a time. The barley can drown if you leave it in the water for too long."

      "title": "Drain the water.",
      "content": "Drain the water. Pour the barley into a large strainer or colander to strain out the water. As the barley is draining, clean the soaking bucket with hot, soapy water. Rinse the bucket well to remove any soap residue. This will help to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi. It’s important to drain and air dry the barley between soakings, because the barley will die if it doesn’t get enough air. [3] X Research source"

These are chits, and they're rootlets that appear when the barley has absorbed enough water. [6] X Research source The soaking and air drying cycles are complete when about 95 percent of the grains have chitted. Continue soaking and air resting the barley in 8-hour periods until most of the grains have chitted. Chitting could require between 2 and 3 soaking and air-drying cycles. [7] X Research source If the barley doesn’t chit after 3 or 4 soaking and drying cycles, it may not be viable, which means it won’t sprout. Discard the barley and start again with a new batch."

Barley that’s too cold or dry won’t germinate properly."

Remove the baking sheets from the bags and mist the barley with cool water. Turn each grain over by hand as you mist. Return the baking sheet to the garbage bag and refold the opening of the bag under the baking sheet. Repeat the misting and flipping 3 to 6 times a day. [10] X Research source If the barley is being germinated somewhere warm or dry, you may have to mist 6 times a day to keep it cool. However, if the barley is somewhere cool or damp, you may only have to mist 3 times a day."

Flip the grain to the smooth side and use a knife to cut open the husk lengthwise. Look for the sprout at the bottom growing upward (away from the roots). The germination process is complete when the acrospires are about as long as the barley grain itself. [11] X Research source The full germination period typically takes 2 to 5 days. [12] X Research source The acrospire is the first sprout that appears during the germination process. Don’t confuse the acrospire with the roots, which are visible and growing out of the bottom of the barley grain. Return the grains you tested to the baking sheet with the other barley."

Place the baking sheets in the oven and dry the grains for 6 to 8 hours. Test the rootlets to see if they fall off easily, and continue drying the barley until they do. Don’t dry the barley in an oven that can't go as low as 125 °F (52 °C), because drying the barley at too high a temperature will destroy the enzymes in the grain."

Bring the barley in at night to protect it from predators, and return it to a sunny location in the morning. The drying process could take 2 to 3 days, depending on the outdoor temperature.
