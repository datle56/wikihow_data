      "content": "Asphalt takes up to 5 days to dry and 6-12 months to fully cure. “Dry” means that your asphalt is no longer sticky and soft to the touch. “Cured” means that it’s fully hardened. You can safely drive and park on dry asphalt. But it’s best to avoid parking in the exact same spot every day until your driveway is fully cured. [2] X Research source Ask your contractor for an estimate of the curing time. When in doubt, it’s best to err on the side of caution and assume it’ll take 12 months. Factors that speed up the curing process include dry air, high temperatures, air circulation, and sunlight. A faster curing process makes your asphalt harden more quickly. Factors that slow down curing include high humidity, cold temperatures, poor airflow, and a lack of sunlight hitting the asphalt. A slower curing process means your asphalt will take longer to fully harden. A thicker layer of asphalt will take longer to cure than a thinner one."

      "content": "You can safely drive and park on asphalt once it’s dry. You’ll know it’s dry when it’s no longer soft and sticky to the touch. This usually takes about 5 days. At this point, you won’t risk leaving tire marks or damaging your new driveway. You can usually walk on asphalt 2 days after it’s applied. However, you’ll still have to wait 5 days before driving on it. [3] X Research source Your contractor may give you specific instructions for when it’s safe to walk, drive, and park on your new driveway."

      "title": "Park your car in different spots each day for the first 6-12 months.",
      "content": "Park your car in different spots each day for the first 6-12 months. This prevents indentations from forming in a single spot due to the weight of the car. After 6-12 months, the asphalt will be fully cured—that is, fully hardened—and you can park wherever you like. If you have a narrow driveway, try parking your car farther up or down the driveway each day. If you can’t avoid parking your car in one spot (for example, if you park it in a very small driveway), try parking it on large wooden planks. This will distribute your car’s weight and prevent indentations in the asphalt. If you park in a parking lot, choose a slightly different spot every day. Avoid turning your tires while your car is stationary, as this could leave impressions in the asphalt. [4] X Research source Try not to leave kickstands, barbeques, and other items on your asphalt for long periods of time. These tend to leave indentations. [5] X Research source Your contractor can give you a specific estimate for the curing time. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and assume it’ll take 12 months."

      "content": "Fix cracks and holes as they appear. While they’re a nuisance, cracks and holes occur naturally as your asphalt settles and cures. You can prevent them from spreading by filling them in with fillers and sealers . [7] X Research source Put a “retainer” on the edges of the asphalt to prevent it from over-expanding and cracking. A retainer can be made of gravel or a combination of soil and grass seeds."

      "content": "Adding a sealcoat helps your asphalt last longer. Sealcoating fixes cracks and prevents chemicals, rain, and debris from penetrating the asphalt. Your contractor will give specific advice, but generally speaking, a sealcoat should first be applied at least 90 days after your asphalt is installed, once the ambient air temperature is below 80°F (26°C). Apply another sealcoat 1 year after the asphalt is first installed, then every 2-4 years after that. [8] X Research source"
