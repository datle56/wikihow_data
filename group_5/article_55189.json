      "content": "Your man craves lots of praise and attention. Leos need to feel appreciated and loved at all times. Men born under this sign are also notorious flirts, so if he isn’t getting the praise and attention he wants from you, he might seek it elsewhere. You can nip that kind of behavior in the bud and keep him hooked by keeping the compliments flowing. [1] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. You might say something like, \"You are hands-down the hottest guy in this room! I feel so lucky to be here with you.\" You could also try, \"How are you so good at bowling!? Normally, I'd be upset about losing, but you look so cute when you bowl a strike...\" One of the worst things you can do to a Leo is withhold affection. Your man needs to be noticed and his pride simply can’t handle being rebuffed. Reader Poll: We asked 1075 wikiHow readers what they would do if a Leo in their life opened up and shared something personal. 86% agreed that the best way to respond is by showing empathy, understanding, and kindness (like with a thoughtful compliment!).

      "title": "Leos are the most passionate sign of the zodiac.",
      "content": "Leos are the most passionate sign of the zodiac. Fiery lions tend to have impressive libidos, so let the passion flow freely between the two of you. Fun fact: Leos are especially into mates that are uninhibited and sexually adventurous. Be open to experimentation, let loose, and have some fun behind closed doors! [2] X Research source Make an effort to surprise him. For example, ask him to share one of his fantasies and find a way to indulge him. Leos are typically dominant in the bedroom, but once you gain his trust, don’t shy away from taking the reins every now and then."

      "content": "Men born under this zodiac sign can be a bit old-fashioned. Leos are coming from a sincere place, though—the comfort of their loved ones is extremely important to them. In general, they prefer to be the breadwinners, but that doesn’t mean your man doesn’t want you to work! That said, if you happen to make more money than him, try not to flaunt it too much."

      "title": "Leos are extroverts, so their social lives are very important to them.",
      "content": "Leos are extroverts, so their social lives are very important to them. At parties and gatherings, your man probably bounces around the room, mingling with everyone. He’s a charming conversationalist and wants nothing more than to have his mate by his side as he works a room. If you can keep up with him, he’ll see you as his ideal partner in crime. [3] X Research source For example, if he invites you to a party or event, make sure he knows you’re super excited about it. Dress to the nines and enjoy yourself—he'll love it."

      "title": "Leos are always truthful and expect the same from their partners.",
      "content": "Leos are always truthful and expect the same from their partners. Since your relationship is in the early stages, even a little white lie might make your Leo suspicious of you. It can be tough to earn back a lion's trust once you lose it, so do your best to be honest and forthright no matter what. [4] X Research source If he asks you to share your thoughts or opinions, be an open book. Tread carefully when it comes to criticism, though. Leos can be sensitive in that respect. For example, instead of saying, \"That orange shirt doesn't suit you at all,\" try something more tactful like, \"I really love that blue button-down. You look so handsome in it! Will you wear it for me tonight?\""

      "title": "Leos want to be the life of every party.",
      "content": "Leos want to be the life of every party. Your man is a bit of a show-off—he can’t help it, it’s in his nature! He wants a mate who loves socializing as much as he does, but at the end of the day, he wants to be the one to sparkle at every event. Give him space to shine and he’ll fall head over heels for you. For example, if you’re chatting in a group and the conversation rolls around to something your man is good at, encourage him to talk about it. You could say, “You know, Robert is so good at chess. He used to compete! Bob, tell everyone about your time as a chess champion...”"

      "content": "Lions want to be dominant in most situations. Leos are the kings of the zodiac, which makes them natural born leaders. In other words, your man can be a bit of control freak! Since he prefers to be in the driver’s seat, try to indulge him. That doesn’t mean he isn’t open to sharing the reins with you, but initially, he wants to feel like he’s in control. For example, he’d prefer to plan most of your dates and outings. If you try to plan a surprise date for him, he might fret about details or feel a bit emasculated. He needs to know where you’re going, how you’re getting there, and so on. If you're at a restaurant that he's familiar with, ask him for entree or wine suggestions. You could even ask him to order for you."

      "content": "Leos are energetic go-getters when it comes to their careers. Men born under this zodiac sign tend to have ambitious career goals. They tend to be key players in a professional team setting and often prefer to take the lead. Your man will love it if you support his ambitions, encourage him move up the corporate ladder, or even start his own business so he can be the boss. [5] X Research source For example, you might say, “Derek, have you thought about asking the CEO for a promotion? You’re basically running that department and you have been for months. I think you should go for it.” Or, “You’re woodworking skills are incredible. Have you considering making this a full-time career? You have the talent to do that, I’m sure of it.”"

      "content": "Focus all of your attention on him and don’t let your eye wander. Leo is a fire sign, which means your man can be possessive and a bit jealous, too. A Leo needs to know that you're loyal to him and only him before he commits, so take every opportunity to show him you’re all in. [6] X Research source You can do things like: Keep your gaze fixed on him no matter how many cute guys are in the room Shower him with plenty of attention (especially in social situations) Reject any guy that approaches you without hesitation"

      "title": "Leos are strong willed and need to be right about everything.",
      "content": "Leos are strong willed and need to be right about everything. Once a Leo makes up his mind about something, you’ll be hard pressed to get him to change it. Additionally, the very notion that he might be wrong about something really ruffles your man’s mane. If you need to correct him, tread carefully so you don’t hurt his pride. For example, if you’re arguing about directions, avoid saying, “I’ve been to this restaurant before and I’m certain you took the wrong exit.” Instead, go with, “We can take this exit if you’re sure. I trust your sense of direction. I’ll check my map app in the meantime just in case, though.”"
