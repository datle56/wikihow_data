      "content": "Keep track of when you’re pulling your hair. Consider what kinds of situations cause you to resort to hair-pulling. Do you only do it when you're depressed? Angry? Confused? Frustrated? Understanding what triggers your hair-pulling can help you find other, more positive ways of coping. Carrying ziplock bags and putting pulled hair in the bags will also help you understand how much hair you are pulling out and tracking progress. Over two weeks, jot down every time you catch yourself pulling your hair. Document what happened just prior to the hair-pulling, as well as your feelings. Also, note the time of day and the activity."

      "content": "Make note of how you feel when you pull your hair. When learning the triggers, try to pin down what could be reinforcing the behavior. If you pull hair when you are anxious and this relieves the anxiety, then the hair pulling is positively reinforced by the feelings of relief. [4] X Research source Snorrason, Berlin, &amp; Han-Joo, 2015 Take stock of how you feel during and immediately after you pull your hair. Knowing this can help you cope because the next time you feel anxious, you can try to find another coping strategy that brings you relief and work to make that your conditioned response to anxiety or your go-to coping strategy rather than hair pulling. There are three distinct phases for sufferers of trichotillomania. Not all sufferers go through each of the three phases. You may experience one or more of these phases: [5] X Research source 1.You initially experience tension accompanied by a desire to pull out some hair. 2. You start pulling out hair. It feels really good, like a sense of relief, as well as some excitement. 3. Once the hair is pulled, you might feel guilt, remorse, and shame. You might attempt to cover the bald patches with scarves, hats, wigs, etc. But eventually the bald patches become obvious to everyone and you tend to start hiding at this point. You might start to feel intensely humiliated."

For example, one person might pull hair compulsively when they find grey hairs because they don’t like grey hair and “all greys must go.” [6] X Research source Snorrason, Berlin, &amp; Han-Joo, 2015 One way to work on this trigger is to re-frame your perceptions of those hairs. No hair is inherently bad--all hair serves a purpose. Attempting to change your thought patterns about these hairs can help reduce the urge to pull."

      "content": "Consider your childhood influences. The initial cause of trichotillomania could be genetic and/or environmental. Researchers see similarities with the triggers for obsessive-compulsive disorder and consider that chaotic, distressing childhood experiences or disturbed early relationships with parents or care-givers might be behind the development of this disorder. One study has shown that over two-thirds of sufferers had experienced at least one traumatic event in their lives, with a fifth of them diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. [7] X Research source This has led to speculation that it is a form of self-soothing for some sufferers, a way to cope."

Record the date, time, location, and number of hairs you pull and what you used to pull them. Write down your thoughts or feelings at the time, as well. This is a good way of getting the shame out, and of expressing how the hair-pulling is impacting your life in general. When you tally up the amount of hair you've pulled out, this can serve as a reality check on how much hair you're removing; is the result surprising to you? What about the amount of time spent on it, was it more than you thought? [10] X Research source Snorrason, Berlin, &amp; Han-Joo, 2015"

For a physical barrier, consider wearing ankle weights on the arm that pulls, or a rubber glove, to discourage pulling. There are also finger covers and acrylic nails that can help act as a barrier to pulling. You might even have Post-It notes placed in areas where you tend to pull your hair a lot. These can act as other physical reminders to stop."

Is your girlfriend the cause behind most of your episodes? Perhaps it's time to reconsider your relationship. Is it your boss who's causing you all this stress? Maybe it's time to find a new career opportunity. Of course, for many, the triggers aren't as simple to identify or get away from; for some, change of schools, abuse, newly realized sexuality, family conflict, the death of a parent, or even pubertal hormonal changes are behind compulsive hair-pulling. These triggers are very hard - if not impossible - to get away from. If it is the case that you can’t get away from a trigger for any of the above or other reasons, continue to work on self-acceptance, retraining your habits and enlisting social support to help you cope with your disorder."

Use an all-natural oil to soothe the follicles and reduce itching, but more importantly to modify behavior from picking and pulling to stroking and rubbing. Make sure to use all natural products such as a mix of essential oils and castor oil. Try a cooling or numbing hair product to work as a \"competing response\" during Habit Reversal Training with your therapist. There is no quick fix to trichotillomania, but with training, patience, and practice, you can reduce your hair pulling behavior. You can also talk to your doctor about a prescription numbing cream to use on your head, but some are not safe.

[13] X Research source Use mindfulness techniques to help yourself become more accepting of these negative or uncomfortable emotions as a natural part of the human experience. They don’t necessarily need to be avoided. [14] X Research source When the insistent urge to avoid discomfort abates, hair pulling will also decrease. To do a mindfulness exercise, sit in a quiet, comfortable spot. Take deep breaths. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. As you continue to breathe, your mind will likely wander. Acknowledge these thoughts without judgment and let them go. Return your attention to your breath."

Put-downs, fear of failure, and other negative thinking will keep you feeling as though you are not enough. Start changing these mental habits to begin to build yourself up and increase your confidence.

The complete adult psychotherapy treatment planner. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Say you have a thought such as, “I don’t have anything interesting to say, so I can see why people think I’m pathetic.” Catch unkind thoughts like this and make a conscious effort to change these thoughts by correcting yourself. Tell yourself: “Sometimes I don’t have much to say, and that is okay. I don’t have to keep others entertained or take on the entire responsibility for this conversation.” Replace critical thoughts with productive thoughts. For example, here is a critical thought: “There is no way I am meeting everyone for dinner. Last time I went, I was so embarrassed at my off-topic comment. I am so stupid.” Replace this with a productive thought: “I was so embarrassed at the last dinner, but I know that I make mistakes and that is okay. I am not stupid. I just made an honest mistake.” As you practice catching these thoughts and changing them, you will notice that your self-esteem will increase along with your confidence.

For example: Learn to say no. If people are making requests of you that you don’t want to fulfill, assert your own needs and wants by saying no. Don’t be a people pleaser . Don’t do things just to secure someone else’s approval. Figure out what is really important to YOU. Ask for what you want. Use “I” statements. These types of statements help you convey responsibility for your own emotions and reactions. For example, instead of saying, “You never listen to me,” you can say, “I feel ignored when you are looking at your phone when we talk.”"
