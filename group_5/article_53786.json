      "content": "Scrape excess adhesive with a putty knife. If the layer of adhesive is too thick, it will take more time to dry. By scraping off any additional adhesive, you allow the air to get to the adhesive and shorten the drying time. If you don’t have a putty knife, you can use a butter knife to get rid of the excess adhesive. The same goes for sealant. The more caulk you have, the longer it will take to cure. Remove extra sealant with a putty knife or finishing tool . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Open windows near the adhesive to properly ventilate the room. Your adhesive must dry in room temperature conditions and in a well-ventilated area. Open the windows and doors around the adhesive to ensure there is air, moisture, and heat coming in and out of the room. [2] X Research source There is a misconception that the hotter the room is, the quicker the adhesive will dry. The reality is that humidity will halt the drying process, so always keep the room well-ventilated. Sealant, however, requires moisture to fully dry and cure. Using a humidifier in a dry room can help speed up the curing process. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a fan to dry the adhesive.",
      "content": "Use a fan to dry the adhesive. Place the fan about 3 feet (0.91 m) from the adhesive. If you’re using a fan, keep it at a medium setting, rather than high speed. Keep the fan by the adhesive for about 1 hour. [4] X Research source Home renovation and repair specialist Art Fricke says you can also use a blow dryer at a low temperature to speed up the process. [5] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. However, be sure to stay at least 1 ft (0.30 m) away from the adhesive when blow-drying it. If you use high heat, it could actually make the silicone take longer to cure. Only use the blow dryer for between 5-10 minutes."

      "title": "Buy a special low-temperature adhesive if you’re working in the winter.",
      "content": "Buy a special low-temperature adhesive if you’re working in the winter. Silicone-based adhesives don’t freeze in cold weather, so you can use them even if the temperature drops. These adhesives dry faster in cold or damp environments, making them extremely versatile. [6] X Research source You can also buy low-temperature sealant , but be wary of using it in very extreme cold. A low-temperature sealant will hold up between 32–40 °F (0–4 °C), but caulk usually won’t cure well below freezing."

      "title": "Purchase adhesive with a “Quick Drying” label on the bottle.",
      "content": "Purchase adhesive with a “Quick Drying” label on the bottle. Most brands have a quick-drying version of their product. Some products advertise that the adhesive dries quickly or differently than others, so a bottle can be the quick-drying variety even if it doesn’t say that specific phrase. Look for descriptions like “30-minute water-ready” or “fast cure.” [7] X Research source Another description the product could have is “instant adhesive”. Fricke says that you can also buy fast-drying silicone sealant “that's water ready in 30 minutes” and isn’t “any more expensive than any other silicone caulk.” [8] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. Some silicone sealants come with 2 parts—the silicone and the catalyst. If your sealant isn’t drying as fast as you’d like, add a little more catalyst using an airless mixing system before applying it. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure the adhesive isn’t expired by checking its expiration date. If the tube is out of date, the adhesive will take longer to dry. If the adhesive takes longer to dry than it says on the tube, this is most likely because it has gone past its shelf life. Most sealants are good for about 18 to 24 months. [10] X Research source Many adhesives say they come with a lifetime guarantee. This isn’t wrong, because expired adhesive will still dry, but it will take much longer than you’d like to do so."

      "title": "Avoid storing your adhesive in extreme temperatures.",
      "content": "Avoid storing your adhesive in extreme temperatures. The optimal temperature for storing your adhesive is 68 °F (20 °C). Fortunately, you can store it in a wide range of temperatures. As long as the temperature is between 59–80 °F (15–27 °C), your adhesive should be in good shape. [11] X Research source Try to avoid storing the adhesive in your garage when it’s hot outside. If this happens, the adhesive can become thick and lumpy and may not dry quickly."

      "title": "Sealants and adhesives take 30 minutes to dry and 1 to 10 days to cure.",
      "content": "Sealants and adhesives take 30 minutes to dry and 1 to 10 days to cure. Regular silicone adhesives and caulks become dry to the touch in about 20 to 30 minutes, but they don’t fully cure until at least 24 hours after application. [12] X Research source However, the temperature, humidity, and brand can vary the drying time. [13] X Research source Check the label on your product to see how long it takes to dry or cure. “Fast-dry” silicone sealants usually take around 24 hours to fully cure."
