Check the side of the package—if you find an expired date, toss out the product.

Unfortunately, both of these chemicals create an unpleasant chemical reaction when they’re exposed to high heat. Examine your storage area—if it’s consistently over 75 °F (24 °C), toss out the dye and pick up something new. [7] X Research source This chemical reaction causes the dye to separate, which isn’t good. [8] X Research source"
