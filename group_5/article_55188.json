      "content": "Your Leo will be intrigued if you don't reveal too much. Chances are, he's surrounded by people who want to be with him. They probably overshare in trying to get him interested in themâ€”nothing bores a Leo more! Instead, pique his curiosity by keeping to yourself. Sure, you can answer his questions, but don't tell him too much in the early days. For instance, if he asks you what you like to do in your free time, don't give him a huge list of everything you enjoy doing and why you like the activities. Keep your answer simple and say something like, \"I can't say no to laser tag or paintball. I suppose you'd say I'm competitive.\""
