      "content": "Take a 6-inch (15 cm) cutting from the top of a healthy stem. Look for a healthy, green stem on your rubber plant that has several leaves. Then, put on a pair of gloves. Use a sterilized pair of scissors or shears to cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the leaf at a 45° angle. [1] X Research source Cutting the stem at an angle can help it soak up more water and root faster. Warning : Wear gloves when making a rubber plant cutting. Rubber plants secrete a white, sticky sap that can be irritating to your skin. [2] X Research source Glynn recommends sterilizing your pruning shears with isopropyl alcohol. He says this ensures “you're not spreading any potential disease from one plant to another.” Taking a top cutting is also a great way to prune your rubber tree and encourage new growth. Glynn says the plant will branch out and grow bushier at the cut spot."

      "content": "Remove the lower leaves and place the cutting in a glass of water. Pull or cut off the leaves at the bottom of the stem, making sure at least 1 leaf remains at the top. Then, fill a clear glass with enough water so the bottom half of the stem is submerged. Then, place the cutting in the water. [3] X Research source Optional tip : Dip the end of the stem in rooting hormone to help it root faster. Propagating rubber plants in water might be a slower and less successful method compared to soil propagation. However, it does allow you to monitor the roots as they grow."

Simply refill the glass with fresh water about once per week, or whenever the water looks dirty. [4] X Research source Do not place the cutting in direct sunlight, as this can burn the leaves and prevent the cutting from rooting."

Just make the cut deep enough to expose the woody center of the stem. Then, make a second deep cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the first. [13] X Research source Air layering is a more involved but very successful way to propagate rubber plants. With this method, you grow roots while the “cutting” is still attached to the mother plant. Be careful when making the cuts. While you want the cuts to be deep, you do not want to completely cut the stem off of the plant. Warning : Wear gloves when cutting the rubber plant’s stem. The stem might drip sap which can be irritating to your skin."
