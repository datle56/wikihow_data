      "content": "Love is a positive emotion that means you adore someone or something. This is a strong, powerful word that refers to liking someone romantically or in a purely friendly way. It’s common to feel love towards people, animals, places, and even inanimate objects. [1] X Research source When love is used as the noun or adjective \"loved,\" it refers to or describes people and things that you have a strong affection for. For example, use \"loved\" in sentences like: [2] X Research source #*“My son brings his well-loved blanket everywhere.” This sentence uses \"loved\" as an adjective. It describes the noun “blanket.” “Her loved ones wanted to know how she was doing.” Here, loved forms the noun “loved ones” to refer to people the subject adores. “I’d like to introduce you to my much-loved friends,” in which \"loved\" is an adjective. “My toys were my loved companions when I was growing up,” with \"loved\" used as an adjective."

      "title": "Beloved means you love someone or something very dearly.",
      "content": "Beloved means you love someone or something very dearly. It is an intense sort of love that describes a person or thing that you care for deeply, whether that’s romantically or platonically. Beloved is typically used less casually than love or loved, so when someone calls you “beloved,” you’ll know they have very strong feelings for you. It’s often used in formal contexts, like funerals, to describe the weight of love felt for someone. As an example, you’ll see \"beloved\" in sentences like: [3] X Research source “His beloved daughter could do no wrong in his eyes,” in which \"beloved\" is an adjective. “I hugged my beloved as soon as he walked in the door.” In this sentence, \"beloved\" is a noun that refers to a person. “We are sorry to hear of your aunt’s passing. She was a beloved mother and wife,” with \"beloved\" used as an adjective. “The music didn’t sound as great because he wasn’t using his beloved guitar.” Here, \"beloved\" is an adjective."

      "title": "Beloved typically conveys more passion than love.",
      "content": "Beloved typically conveys more passion than love. It has a charming, tender quality that captures your pure adoration for someone, whether that’s for your beloved partner or dog. [4] X Research source Love describes strong affection, but it doesn’t convey emotions that are as warm or as deep as beloved. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Beloved describes specific people and things; love is general or specific.",
      "content": "Beloved describes specific people and things; love is general or specific. There’s an endless list of things you can love, from your family, friends, and pets, to more shallow things like coffee, fuzzy socks, and novelty pens. Beloved is usually only reserved for people, pets, and objects that you’re devoted to and find very meaningful. It typically describes a singular, specific person or thing, rather than describing multiple people or things. [6] X Research source For example, you don’t typically say “beloved ones” or “beloved people.” Instead, you refer to a specific person or thing you adore, like your “beloved mother” or your “beloved book collection.” When you use love as an adjective, which is a word that describes a person, place, or thing, you refer to people and things more generally. You say “they are my loved companions” rather than “this is my loved father.”"

      "title": "Love is a verb, noun, or adjective while beloved is a noun or adjective.",
      "content": "Love is a verb, noun, or adjective while beloved is a noun or adjective. It’s easy to describe your love in multiple ways, whether you’re using love as an action (“I love running”), as a thing (“My love for you is strong,”) or as a descriptor (“My dog is well-loved by the neighbors”). [7] X Research source Beloved is simply used as a descriptor. You use it as an adjective to say, “He is my beloved father,” or as a noun to say, “She is my beloved.” [8] X Research source Verbs, nouns, and adjectives are all parts of speech in the English language. A verb is a word that defines an action, like “to run” or “to sleep.” A noun is a word that names a person, place or thing, such as “boy,” “city,” and “tree.” An adjective is a word that describes a noun, like “ tall boy,” “ big city,” and “ green tree.” Loving is another adjective form of love. Loving describes how caring or thoughtful someone is. For example, you might have a loving family or think your friend is a very loving person."

      "title": "You typically add a modifier in front of loved, but use beloved by itself.",
      "content": "You typically add a modifier in front of loved, but use beloved by itself. A modifier is a word or phrase that adds meaning to another word. When you use loved as an adjective, you typically tack on descriptors like “well” or “much” in front of it. Saying someone or something is “well-loved” or “much-loved” adds information about how they are loved. [9] X Research source It’s generally understood that someone who is beloved is deeply adored, so you don’t typically use a modifier with it. [10] X Research source"
