      "title": "Not in most cases.",
      "content": "Not in most cases. Most DLL files do not contain any source code that can be edited. The code contained within most DLL files has already been compiled into binary or machine code. If the DLL file contains any intermediate language (IL), you can view the IL code using the IL Disassembler tool, which is installed alongside Visual Studio. You can also use CIL Disassembler to view common intermediate language within a DLL file. CIL Disassembler does not come with Visual Studio, but it is free to download from the Microsoft Store. If a DLL file is not functioning correctly and you need to edit it, you can do so by editing the original source code that was used to create the DLL file. This will be on a separate code file. You can use the original source code to create a new DLL file, which can be used to replace the DLL file that isn't working."

      "content": "You can try to reconstruct it using a decompiler program. A decompiler program can take the machine language within a DLL file and convert it into a high-level language, such as C++ or C#. Warning: Any code you extract from a DLL file using a decompiler will be a reconstruction. There is no guarantee that it will match the original source code. If you attempt to replace a DLL file using code extracted from a decompiler program, you will likely need to do lots of testing to make sure all programs that depend on the DLL file still function correctly."
