This is because you would be sharing the electricity, water, and fuel costs to keep your dwelling up and running. [1] X Research source If you live alone, then add 14 points to your carbon footprint. If you share a house or apartment with 1 other person, then add 12 points. If you share a house or apartment with 2 other people, then add 10 points.

You will have a higher carbon footprint if you eat meat from domesticated animals regularly, and you will have a lower carbon footprint if you eat no meat or animal products at all. [3] X Research source If you eat domestic meat on a daily basis, then add 10 points. If you eat domestic meat a few times per week, then add 8 points. If you are a vegetarian, then add 4 points. If you are a vegan or only eat wild meat, then add 2 points. You would also add 12 points if most of the food you eat is prepackaged convenience food, such as frozen pizza, cereal, and potato chips. If you have a good balance of fresh and convenience food, then just add 6 points. If you only eat fresh, locally grown, or hunted food, then add 2 points."

Consider how many times per week you run your dishwasher and/or washing machine. If you run your dishwasher or washing machine more than 9 times per week, then add 3 points. If you run it 4 to 9 times, then add 2 points. If you run it 1 to 3 times, then add 1 point. If you don't have a dishwasher, then add nothing.

If your score is less than 60 points, then you are making a small impact on your planet. If it is higher than 60, then you might want to look for some ways that you can reduce your impact. For instance, you can replace old appliances with energy-efficient ones, purchase items with less packaging, use public transportation or carpool, compost, and recycle."

However, keep in mind that the total production footprint of your car is for the lifetime of your car. Therefore, the longer you drive it, the lower the impact will be over time. Start by adding between 5 and 12 tons of CO2 emissions depending on the size of your car. [6] X Research source If you have a hybrid or electric vehicle, add 2 tons of CO2 emissions. If you have a compact or economy-sized car, then add 5 tons of CO2 emissions. If you have a medium-sized car, such as a sedan, then add 9 tons of CO2 emissions.

For example, 1 tree can absorb a ton of carbon over its lifetime, so if you have a mid-sized sedan, then planting 9 trees could offset the production footprint of your car. [9] X Research source Check out non-profit groups, such as Carbonfund.org Foundation , that plant trees to help offset emissions. You can donate to have a tree planted and offset some of your emissions."
