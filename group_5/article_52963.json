      "title": "Guys want you to be open and honest about yourself.",
      "content": "Guys want you to be open and honest about yourself. Use your first date to get to know the guy and to let him get to know a little bit about yourself. Be confident and talk about your job, your interests, hobbies, passions, or whatever else comes up. Be honest, too. Don’t try to be mysterious or keep him in the dark or he may think that you aren’t interested in him. [1] X Research source You don’t have to tell him everything about your life, but if you’re interested in getting to know him, you should also let him know things about you, too. It’s totally normal to feel nervous ahead of your first date with a guy. But once the conversation gets rolling, if there’s a real connection, you won’t feel so worried."

    {
      "title": "Ask questions so you can learn more about each other.",
      "content": "Ask questions so you can learn more about each other. Really, asking questions is a great strategy all around. It shows him that you’re interested in him and that you’re listening to what he says. It also gives you a chance to learn more about him and keep the conversation going. When in doubt, ask a question! [2] X Research source Try to keep your questions related to him. Ask about his job, his friends, his family, what he likes to eat, and so on. People love to talk about themselves, and there won’t be any awkward silences during your date."

      "title": "Be kind and warm so he feels comfortable getting to know you.",
      "content": "Be kind and warm so he feels comfortable getting to know you. Guys want to feel like you enjoy being around them. Try to be as friendly as you can when you meet him. Throughout the date, respond to what he says and act interested. Remember, first dates can sometimes be awkward and a little uncomfortable. But by being kind and friendly, you can show him that you’re interested. [3] X Research source Also, if you don’t think you want a second date, being friendly can help you survive the first date more easily."

      "title": "Make him feel appreciated and respected.",
      "content": "Make him feel appreciated and respected. Maintain a meaningful emotional connection by fulfilling his emotional needs. Show him that you care about his feelings. Ask him how their day went or if anything is bothering them. If you do disagree about something, it’s okay! Just make sure you do it respectfully and resolve any conflicts without insults or humiliation.

      "title": "Allow him to keep their other friendships and interests alive.",
      "content": "Allow him to keep their other friendships and interests alive. While you do want your guy to give you time and attention, it’s also important that you let him live his own life. Don’t make him choose between you and their friends. Allow him to do the things he likes to do. If he doesn’t feel like you’re taking things away from him, he’ll feel happier in your relationship. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For instance, if your guy likes to golf or go to the gym, let him! It may mean some time away from you, but in the end, he’ll be happier and your relationship will benefit from it. Giving him his space doesn’t mean you need to condone unhealthy or hurtful behavior. If he’s doing something that bothers or hurts you, tell him how you feel about it."

      "content": "Be honest and tell him what you want. Communication is key to a healthy and happy relationship. Vocalize things that you want so he isn’t confused. Tell him what you like and what you don’t like. He can’t give you what you want if he doesn’t know what it is! [6] X Research source Your partner can’t read your mind. If you want flowers or a date night, tell him. If you want to try something new in the bedroom, tell him. If something is bothering you, tell him!"

      "content": "Dating is figuring out if someone is right for a committed relationship. When 2 people are dating, they’re basically assessing the other person to try to figure out if they’re “the one” that’s worth a long-term commitment or possibly even marriage. Dating essentially boils down to one thing—do I want to be with this person? [7] X Research source How guys view dating can vary a bit depending on their personalities. Some guys may have difficulty opening up about their feelings while others may be ready to commit from the get-go. If you’re worried that the guy you’re dating may have different views about your relationship, try talking to him about it. Honest communication can be a great way to make sure you’re both on the same page."

      "title": "By the 4th date you may know if a guy really likes you.",
      "content": "By the 4th date you may know if a guy really likes you. The first date is mostly just getting to know each other. If you’re going on a 2nd and 3rd date with a guy, it means he’s starting to get to like you more and more. If he’s asking for a 4th date, it’s a clear sign that he’s into you and may want a relationship with you. [8] X Research source He wouldn’t keep seeing you if he doesn’t like you! Don’t worry so much about how many dates you’ve been on with him. If he keeps wanting to be with you, he definitely likes you."

      "content": "Most new relationships start with an initial mutual attraction. Maybe you met at a party, online, or through some friends. The initial attraction can be largely physical and can develop into a full-blown infatuation with each other. Usually, this stage lasts about 3-4 months before you may be asking yourself whether or not they’re right for a long-term relationship. [9] X Research source In this stage, you may be more willing to overlook any differences or traits that you may not desire for a committed relationship. For instance, it may not bother you that your new guy spends so much time going out with his friends, but you may start to question it as the relationship progresses."

      "title": "As you become a couple, you’ll develop a deeper connection.",
      "content": "As you become a couple, you’ll develop a deeper connection. After a few months, if you’re both still into each other, you may choose to be an exclusive couple. During this stage, you can start asking each other questions about the future and what you want out of the relationship. You’ll also learn to trust each other and learn more about each other’s desires and needs. You may also start to notice each other’s flaws and either complain or work together to resolve them. [10] X Research source It’s important to make sure you’re both on the same page about what your relationship means. If he’s not interested in commitment but you are, you definitely want to discuss it so neither of you gets hurt."

      "content": "Include things about you and what you want in your profile. In the bio or profile description of your dating profile, make about ¾ of the info you provide about yourself. List facts about yourself, your interests, and your hobbies. The other ¼ can be about what you’re looking for. That way, any guy that sees your profile will have a clear idea of who you are and what you want. [11] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “I’m a nurse so I work a lot, but I enjoy watching cheesy horror movies and horseback riding in my free time. I”m looking for a guy I can have some fun with.”"

      "content": "Use a good profile pic. Take a few shots from different angles and take a look through them to find one that looks nice. Choose a good-looking photo so any guys that come across your profile see a flattering, but realistic image of what you look like. [12] X Research source It’s totally normal to feel a little awkward or self-conscious taking and choosing photos of yourself. But the guys checking out your profile won’t know that you’re nervous. They’ll just see you!"

Start up a conversation with him and see where it goes. It could lead to a great exchange that may turn into a date. [13] X Research source If you’re using a dating service like eHarmony or Tinder, when you message the guys that you like, the algorithm will suggest similar guys.

      "content": "Find out if their vision for your relationship matches your own. You don’t have to tell him that you want to get married or anything, but you should still have a clear idea of what he wants to get out of the relationship. Talk to him about what he wants so you can see if it lines up with what you want. [14] X Research source If he’s not looking for commitment, but you are, you may want to either adjust your expectations or move on to a guy that shares your vision. Honesty and open communication are important in any relationship. If you’re about something, talk to him about it."

      "title": "Try not to make him feel older than he actually is.",
      "content": "Try not to make him feel older than he actually is. Because he’s older, there will likely be times where he won’t know a song or a reference that you make, and vice versa. Don’t make a big deal out of it or make fun of him for being older. He may not like it, and it could hurt your relationship. [15] X Research source For instance, if he makes a reference to an older movie that you’ve never seen, don’t say something like, “Oh, that came out while I was in middle school!” That doesn’t mean you should feel nervous about joking around with him about his age. Just try to keep things fun and lighthearted and he’ll appreciate your sense of humor."

      "title": "Be yourself and include him in your activities.",
      "content": "Be yourself and include him in your activities. Just because he’s older doesn’t mean he’s not interested in the things you like to do. Don’t change your personality because you think he’ll like you more. Instead, keep doing the things that you like to do and let him be involved in them. He’ll love being included and it’ll likely make him want to get to know you even more. [16] X Research source For instance, if you like to go workout on the weekends, ask him to join you sometime. He may really enjoy seeing a different side of you."

They also want a partner who celebrates their successes and supports them when they’re struggling. Be there for him and he’ll love you for it. [17] X Research source Your guy may also have specific things that he wants and needs in a relationship. Try talking to him about it. Ask him what would make him happy.
