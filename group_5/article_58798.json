      "content": "A triangle rack keeps the balls organized and packed tightly. Locate the black and white dot, called the “foot spot,” in the center of one end of the table, about halfway between the corner and side pockets. Position the rack so the top point is directly over the foot spot, which is known as the “apex” of the rack. Align the base of the rack so it’s parallel with the edge of the pool table. [1] X Research source The rack is an equilateral triangle, so it doesn’t matter which point you put over top of the foot spot. Make sure to straighten the base of the rack, or else the balls on one side have a greater chance of going into a pocket. If the table doesn’t have a marked foot spot, use the markings around the edge of the table to determine its location. Stand on the short end of the pool table, and find the second set of marks on the long edges between the corner and side pockets. Place the rack so the top corner lines up with those marks and the centerline of the table. Avoid using a diamond-shaped rack for 8-ball because they’re typically used for playing 9-Ball ."

      "content": "Any striped or solid ball works as the first ball in the rack. Choose one of the 7 striped or 7 solid balls, and position it on top of the foot spot inside of the rack. While many players like to use the 1-ball at the top of the rack, there are no official rules about which numbered ball has to go at the apex. [2] X Research source When you’re playing 9- or 10-ball pool, both require the 1-ball at the apex of the rack."

      "title": "Any numbers besides the 8-ball can go in the back corners.",
      "content": "Any numbers besides the 8-ball can go in the back corners. Place any one of the remaining striped balls in one corner, and choose a solid ball for the other corner. This gives both solids and stripes an equal chance of going in a pocket during the break. It doesn’t matter which number the ball has on it, as long as it isn’t the 8-ball. [3] X Research source When you’re playing a game of 8-ball , if both the striped and the solid balls go in a pocket on the break, the player who shot first gets to choose which type of ball they’d like to continue playing for. If only one ball gets pocketed on the break, the player can choose to keep shooting for that type of ball, or they can choose the other. Example: If the solid 6-ball went in the pocket on your break, you could keep shooting for solids or you can choose to shoot stripes instead."

      "content": "Any color or number except the 8-ball can fit along the edge. Place the balls randomly, or try to alternate solids and stripes as best as you can so they break evenly on the table. Once you fill in the edges, position a solid and a stripe ball in the lower 2 spots of the remaining space. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Keeping the 8-ball in the middle prevents it from being pocketed early. Find the open space left in the third row from the top and set the 8-ball there. The 8-ball will align vertically with the apex ball. [5] X Research source If a player pockets the 8-ball on the break, the other player receives an automatic win for the game."

      "title": "Rolling the rack up and down ensures the balls are packed tightly.",
      "content": "Rolling the rack up and down ensures the balls are packed tightly. Push your fingers into the rack under the bottom row of balls, and then slightly push the rack forward. Pull the rack back again so that the apex ball is aligned with the foot spot and the base is parallel to the back of the table. Then, gently lift the rack up off the table to avoid touching or shifting the balls. [6] X Research source If the balls shift when you lift the rack, rerack them to tightly pack them again. Then, try picking up the back end of the rack and pushing the apex forward and away from the balls before you lift it up. If the table has flaws and you can’t place the apex ball directly over the foot spot, use the rules for the United States Professional Poolplayers Association (UPA). Place the ball within a dime’s radius (half the width of a dime) of the foot spot."
