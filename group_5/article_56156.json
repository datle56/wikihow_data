      "content": "Identify if the function you want to integrate can be solved by integrating by parts. If the function can be solved using integration by parts, it can also be solved by using tabular integration. For example, the function f ( x ) = x 2 c o s ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}cos(x)} can be solved by integrating by parts. Then, determine the substitutions for u {\\displaystyle u} and d v {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} v} in the function. In this example, let u = x 2 {\\displaystyle u=x^{2}} and d v = c o s ( x ) d x {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} v=cos(x)\\mathrm {d} x} ."

If you keep taking the derivative and it reaches 0 {\\displaystyle 0} , then you can use tabular integration to find the antiderivative. For this example, when you take the first derivative of u = x 2 {\\displaystyle u=x^{2}} , you get 2 x {\\displaystyle 2x} , then the second derivative is 2 {\\displaystyle 2} , and the third derivative is 0 {\\displaystyle 0} , meaning that the tabular method will work with this example."
