Mention your hopes, your dreams, and what you want to do in 5 years. The more you can tell her about yourself, the more she’ll feel like you two are truly bonding. [3] X Research source This is a great way to spend time after sex. Doing pillow talk builds your connection and helps you and your partner feel closer after intimacy. If you’re a man, you may have learned growing up that expressing your emotions isn’t “manly.” However, talking about your emotions with someone you like is a great way to connect, and it might even help you feel better, too."
