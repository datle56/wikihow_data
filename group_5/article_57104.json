      "content": "Put on your protective equipment and choose a safe area. This project is dangerous, so wear your personal protective gear at all times. At a minimum, wear work gloves and protective eyewear. Additionally, it’s best to wear long sleeves, long pants, and close-toed shoes. Go outside and choose a spot far away from heat sources. Keep your protective gear on at all times to stay safe. It's best to work on a rubber mat, which will prevent static build up and won't conduct electricity, which can trigger your propellant."

      "title": "Roll the end of the paper around the dowel.",
      "content": "Roll the end of the paper around the dowel. Fold the edge of the paper up over the dowel, then roll the dowel across the paper until it's covered. Just cover the dowel in 1 layer of paper at this point because you need to add glue. [3] X Research source You don’t want to create several layers of paper because it may tunnel out of your rocket body, since it’s not glued down."

      "content": "Add 14 grams of potassium nitrate to a plastic container. Potassium nitrate is also called KNO 3 . It helps supply a steady stream of oxygen to your sugar fuel so that it keeps burning. Measure out your potassium nitrate using a standard kitchen scale. [12] X Research source You can buy pure potassium nitrate online. Alternatively, look for potassium nitrate at your local home improvement or gardening store. It’s often sold as stump remover. You may need to refine your potassium nitrate if you bought it as stump remover. If it's not 100% KNO 3 , dissolve it in boiling water and strain it through a paper filter. Discard the filter and solids, then boil off remaining water to get mostly pure KNO 3 . Leave in a hot area or minimum-temperature oven until completely dry. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure out 7 grams of powdered sugar and add it to the container. Zero out your kitchen scale, then add 7 grams of powdered sugar to the container of potassium nitrate. Handle the container carefully because the materials are combustible. [14] X Research source While it's optional, adding 1% dextrin to your mix may help make your propellant more stable. If you decide to add it, reduce your potassium nitrate and powdered sugar measurements by .5% each. For the mix above, you can just add 1 gram of dextrin to the mix since the measurements are so small."

      "title": "Mix your propellant in a rock tumbler for 6-10 hours for best results.",
      "content": "Mix your propellant in a rock tumbler for 6-10 hours for best results. A rock tumbler will mix your ingredients more thoroughly so your rocket has better thrust. Put the potassium nitrate and powdered sugar into a rock tumbler. Then, bring your rock tumbler outside while you mix the propellant. Turn the rock tumbler on and set a timer for at least 6 hours. It's best to place your mixer in a hole in the ground so that accidental blasts are controlled. Leave the top of the hole open to direct the blast upward. Make sure the rock tumbler is far away from other heat sources. Work in small batches until you're very experienced in working with propellant. This will reduce the risk of a fire or explosion."

      "content": "Shake the container to mix the ingredients as an alternative. Shaking won't mix your ingredients as well, and you'll need to do it for at least an hour total. With the lid on the container, manually shake it back and forth to mix up your rocket fuel. Be sure to stand away from heat sources and open flames. Remember, this mixture is highly flammable. [17] X Research source This is an easy way to mimic the action of “ball milling,” which is how pyrotechnicians mix combustibles."

      "content": "Tape a stick or skewer to your rocket so you can put it in the ground. Choose a thin stick or skewer that will be easy to poke into the ground. However, make sure it’s thick enough to support your rocket. Place the stick or skewer against the rocket body, then apply several layers of masking tape or electrical tape. [23] X Research source You might prefer to glue the stick or skewer onto the rocket base first to make it more stable. However, this isn’t necessary."

      "content": "Insert a fuse into your core, leaving the end sticking out. Use your 6D nail to gently push the fuse up into the core, leaving a long end sticking out. If the fuse is smaller than the core, you may want to fold it over first so that it sticks up inside the rocket. Pack a wad of paper behind the fuse to keep it in place. [24] X Research source If you're not using the rocket right away, fit a small piece of plastic wrap over the base of your rocket, then use a tiny amount of hot glue or white school glue to seal around the edges. This will keep it airtight. The fuse should go up into the core of the rocket so that it lights the fuel. Additionally, you want a long tail on your fuse to allow you time to move to safety."
