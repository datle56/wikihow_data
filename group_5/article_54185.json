When you multiply two binomials together in the FOIL method, you end up with a trinomial (an expression with three terms) in the form a x 2 + b x+ c , where a, b, and c are ordinary numbers. If you start with an equation in the same form, you can factor it back into two binomials. [2] X Research source If the equation isn't written in this order, move the terms around so they are. For example, rewrite 3x - 10 + x 2 as x 2 + 3x - 10 . Because the highest exponent is 2 (x 2 ), this type of expression is \"quadratic.\""

These are the factors of the term x 2 , since x times x = x 2 . [3] X Research source Our example x 2 + 3x - 10 just begins with x 2 , so we can write: (x __)(x __) We'll cover more complicated problems in the next section, including trinomials that begin with a term like 6x 2 or -x 2 .

      "content": "Use factoring to guess at the Last terms. If you go back and reread the FOIL method step, you'll see that multiplying the Last terms together gives you the final term in the polynomial (the one with no x). So to factor, we need to find two numbers that multiply to form the last term. [4] X Research source In our example x 2 + 3x - 10, the last term is -10. What are the factors of -10? What two numbers multiplied together equal -10? There are a few possibilities: -1 times 10, 1 times -10, -2 times 5, or 2 times -5. Write these pairs down somewhere to remember them. Don't change our answer yet. It still looks like this: (x __)(x __) ."

      "title": "Test which possibilities work with Outside and Inside multiplication.",
      "content": "Test which possibilities work with Outside and Inside multiplication. We've narrowed the Last terms down to a few possibilities. Use trial and error to test each possibility, multiplying the Outside and Inside terms, and comparing the result to our trinomial. For example: Our original problem has an \"x\" term of 3x, so that's what we want to end up with in this test. Test -1 and 10: (x-1)(x+10). The Outside + Inside = 10x - x = 9x. Nope. Test 1 and -10: (x+1)(x-10). -10x + x = -9x. That's not right. In fact, once you test -1 and 10, you know that 1 and -10 will just be the opposite of the answer above: -9x instead of 9x. Test -2 and 5: (x-2)(x+5). 5x - 2x = 3x. That matches the original polynomial, so this is the correct answer: (x-2)(x+5) . In simple cases like this, when you don't have a constant in front of the x 2 term, you can use a shortcut: just add the two factors together and put an \"x\" after it (-2+5 → 3x). This won't work for more complicated problems, though, so it's good to remember the \"long way\" described above."

There's only one possible option here: (3x __)(x __) . List factors of 8. Our options are 1 times 8, or 2 times 4. Test these using the Outside and Inside terms. Note that the order of the factors matter, since the Outside term is being multiplied by 3x instead of x. Try out every possibility until you get an Outside+Inside result of 10x (from the original problem): (3x+1)(x+8) → 24x+x = 25x no (3x+8)(x+1) → 3x+8x = 11x no (3x+2)(x+4) → 12x+2x=14x no (3x+4)(x+2) → 6x+4x=10x yes This is the correct factor."

Your math book might surprise you with an equation with a high exponent, such as x 4 , even after you've used simple factoring to make the problem easier. Try substituting a new variable that turns it into a problem you know how to solve. For example: x 5 +13x 3 +36x =(x)(x 4 +13x 2 +36) Let's invent a new variable. We'll say y = x 2 , and plug it in: (x)(y 2 +13y+36) =(x)(y+9)(y+4). Now switch back to using the original variable: =(x)(x 2 +9)(x 2 +4) = (x)(x±3)(x±2)"

In the problem 3x 2 +10x+8, 3 is a prime number, so the binomial must be in the form (3x __)(x __). For the problem 3x 2 +4x+1, the only possible solution is (3x+1)(x+1). (You should still multiply this out to check your work, since some expressions can't be factored at all – for example, 3x 2 +100x+1 has no factors.)"

For non-quadratic trinomials, use Eisenstein's Criterion, described in the Tips section."
