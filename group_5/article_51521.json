      "title": "Yes—but only after 12 months.",
      "content": "Yes—but only after 12 months. When you sign up for an Urban Air membership, you agree to enter a 12-month contract term with the company. However, once the contract expires a year after you sign up, your membership automatically switches to a month-to-month contract. This allows you to cancel any time after your 12th month is paid. [1] X Research source If possible, cancel your membership at least 10 days before your next payment is due to avoid paying for an additional month. [2] X Research source If you add another person or upgrade your membership within that 12-month term, your contract automatically extends for another 12 months."

Whether it be a cross-country move, a severe injury, or the loss of a loved one, you can't always predict what's going to happen in life. Upon these scenarios, your membership may be canceled during the 12-month contract with written proof to privacy@urbanairparks.com. You may provide a utility bill, a signed lease, an obituary, or a medical letter from a doctor. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can send written proof by mail. Send it to Urban Air, Attn: Membership Support, 2350 Airport Freeway, Suite 505, Bedford, Texas 76022. Memberships for a residential move can only be canceled if there is no Urban Air within 25 miles of your new location."
