Since your pumpkin plants are indoors and have no access to pollination by bees or other insects, you are in charge of pollinating blossoms so that your plants can produce pumpkins. [4] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Learn how to identify female and male blossoms. Pumpkins produce both male and female blossoms on the same vine. Male blossoms are longer, thinner, and look like trumpets. They have a stamen (little stem with pollen on it) on the inside. Female blossoms are wider, shorter, and more open, like little bowls. They do not have stamens in them. Watch (and possibly collect) your male blossoms carefully. It is possible for the vine to produce male blossoms first. They might wilt before a female blossom develops. If they wilt, don't throw them away , but save them until a female blossom is open. Pollinate the female blossoms. This can be done in two different ways: if your male blossoms are still on the vine and alive, use a clean paintbrush (or baking brush/basting brush) to carefully pick up some pollen (yellow powder) off of the stamen (little stem in the inside middle of the blossom) of the male blossoms. Use your brush to gently touch the pollen to the base (inside) of the female blossom(s). If your male blossoms are wilted, open them up carefully and pull out the stamen (stem in the middle of the blossoms with the pollen on the end). Take the stamen and gently push it with the pollen end into the female blossom until it touches the bottom and some pollen comes off. You can just leave the stamen in there, if you want, or remove it afterward."
