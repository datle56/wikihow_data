      "content": "Choose a calm, private setting to end things face to face. If you have questions for your situationship partner or want some closure, having a face-to-face conversation is probably the best choice. Try to find a neutral spot where you can both be comfortable and where you won't have to worry about getting disrupted or fielding a lot of distractions. This signals that you're taking the conversation seriously. [1] X Research source If the two of you are more casual, you might not feel like this is necessary. When that's the case, a text is fine—just use your best judgment. Saying something is usually the better than ghosting, though. Even though your relationship might have been undefined, that's no reason to leave the ending undefined as well."

      "title": "Use \"I\" statements to tell your partner how you feel.",
      "content": "Use \"I\" statements to tell your partner how you feel. When you use \"I\" statements , you take ownership of your own feelings instead of blaming your situationship partner for them. This helps your partner feel less attacked and less likely to go on the defensive. The two of you can have a calm, respectful conversation that doesn't escalate into something ugly. [2] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I have really enjoyed our time together and I believe I am ready to explore another level of commitment with you, but I don't think you're ready to take that step yet. Is that accurate?\" If you're ending things over text, keep it simple. For example, you might say, \"I've really enjoyed spending time with you but I think our situation has run its course. We want different things and it's not fair to either of us to keep doing this.\" If you want to pump the brakes because you think your partner might have started catching feelings for you, you might say, \"I have really enjoyed our time together, but I'm not ready to take this relationship to the next level. If that's something you want, it would be really unfair for me to continue things between us under these circumstances.\""

When you listen actively , you show them that you respect them and validate their feelings . [3] X Research source Keep in mind that, most likely, your situationship partner won't agree with you. There wouldn't be any need to have this awkward conversation if they did. At the same time, though, it's certainly possible that they've been feeling the same way as you have and were just trying to hide it. There's only one way to know for sure! If you're ending things over text, let them know that you're open to having a more involved conversation if they want to. For example, you might say, \"If you want to meet for coffee and talk about this more, I'm open to that.\""

If you simply ghost them, they'll likely wonder what happened or if they did something wrong. When the situationship is no longer serving your needs, it's time for it to go—and you both deserve to have some closure on that. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you've decided that you no longer want to have any contact with them, you might say, \"I feel as though our relationship has run its course, but I've enjoyed my time with you. I wish you nothing but the best.\" And just leave it at that."

      "content": "Set clear boundaries regarding any future contact. Situationships are typically characterized by a lack of boundaries. So, if you don't want any further issues with your situationship partner, it's a good idea to set those boundaries now. What those boundaries are will depend on how the two of you have decided your relationship will look going forward. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you've decided that you want to end the situationship but still want to remain friends, you might set a boundary that you won't go over to their house alone late at night."

      "content": "Take a step back and focus on self-care. Be compassionate to yourself if you find yourself thinking you don't have a right to feel bad because the two of you weren't even dating. You had a close connection and the lack of definition in the relationship is part of what makes it so tough to get over. Turn your focus inward and do things to take care of yourself and get yourself ready for the next phase of your life. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's okay if you feel the need to take a couple of days, or even a couple of weeks, away from dating, putting yourself out there, or even being very social in general. This is a good time to nurture yourself with plenty of love, gentleness, and kindness. Keegan emphasizes that \"it's a loss just like all losses, just like when you lose a committed relationship. Nonetheless, it's a loss. And it's really important to honor that.\""

      "content": "Seek support if you need it. Ending a situationship can hurt just as much as a regular breakup—the problem is you often don't have the support you need. You might have friends who didn't even know about the relationship, which can make it hard for them to understand how to comfort and support you now. Your most empathetic friends will support you emotionally, even if they don't quite understand how you feel or what your situationship partner meant to you. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Situationships often involve a lot of idealization. If you've caught feelings for your situationship partner, chances are you believed a \"real\" relationship between the two of you would be perfect, if only you could just get it off the ground. During this time, remind yourself that your feelings are real and legitimate and you have every right to feel them. Acknowledge that you're grieving a loss, even if in this case it's more of a loss of what might've been. Keegan notes that one of the reasons \"you can't get over it is because you kind of hoped it would turn into something more or at least something ongoing. And now that hope is over. So, it's just like, let it go and then go out and meet someone next.\""

There's no reason to be in any kind of relationship with someone who treats you badly. If you can see red flags during a situationship, the person is not likely to act any differently if you do happen to end up in a committed relationship with them. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if the person you're in a situationship with makes fun of you or belittles you, it's best to end things with them completely and go no contact so that they can't continue to damage your self-esteem. Keegan emphasizes that \"you should definitely consider [leaving a situationship] if you're feeling anxious [because] that's your instinct, your intuition telling you 'Something's not right about this for me.' And you don't always have to know why.\" Keegan adds that \"the best thing you can do is to really in life learn to listen to your intuition, learn to listen to the deeper thing. And anxiety is a sure sign that something's off.\""

Even worse, you feel as though you have no right to be upset because it's not like you're in a real relationship. [9] X Research source Recognize that you have the right to feel however you feel.

This is especially likely if the two of you are sleeping together—and folks in situationships typically are. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your partner doesn't have the same feelings for you, it's unfair to you to continue in a relationship where your feelings aren't being reciprocated. You deserve to be with someone who shares your feelings on the same level. Once you start having feelings for someone, it can be very hard to cut those feelings off without at least a brief period (say, a couple of weeks) of no-contact."

You might feel like they're intentionally excluding you from part of their life. This is typically an indication that it's time to call it quits. [12] X Research source If they're adamant about keeping their relationship with you separate from the rest of their life, you might even start to feel as though they're ashamed of or embarrassed by you—and you deserve to be with someone who's proud of you and wants to show you off to everyone they know. Reader Poll: We asked 1014 wikiHow readers who've been in a situationship, and only 12% of them said they realized they were in a situationship because their partner hasn’t introduced them to friends and family. [Take Poll] While this can definitely be a red flag, your partner may not realize how it makes you feel. Talk to them about the situation and see if things change before making a rash decision."

It could be that you've brought up the relationship topic before, and your situationship partner said something noncommittal and abruptly changed the subject. Or they might've simply claimed that it wasn't the right time to talk about that (and somehow, it's never the right time). Either way, you're not going to have a healthy relationship with someone who isn't able (or willing) to have a serious talk about the relationship or define their level of commitment to you. [13] X Research source People are naturally uncomfortable with ambiguity, so it's totally normal that you want a solid framework for your relationship with someone you're spending a lot of time with. If your situationship partner seems completely unwilling to have a relationship talk, it's probably best to go ahead and end things before they get too serious."

      "content": "A situationship is a casual relationship without commitment. Because of their lack of commitment, situationships typically have an expiration date, whether you can pinpoint it exactly or not. This is the kind of relationship you often just end up in when you enjoy hanging out with someone a lot but haven't quite taken it to the next level in terms of establishing the boundaries of a committed relationship. [14] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keegan notes that typically in a situationship, \"you had some intimacy with that person or felt a deep connection in some way, whether it's sexual or just the companionship or whatever or just having someone to go back and forth with.\" A situationship is often similar to other types of causal relationships, such as a \"friends with benefits\" (FWB) relationship. The biggest difference between the two, though, is that there are things that are defined about an FWB relationship that aren't defined in a situationship. Situationships can also look similar to the \"talking\" phase of a relationship. But in the talking phase, it's understood that this is a phase leading up to a committed relationship eventually, while a situationship doesn't have that goal."

[16] X Research source Neither of you really goes out of your way to hang out with each other either. If something comes up or if it seems like it would be even the slightest bit troublesome, you'll just call it off. It's also likely that the situationship itself started out of convenience.

You just don't have much with the person that's unique to the two of you as a couple—there's no song you call \"our song,\" no cutesy little in-jokes, no \"our restaurant\" or \"our bar.\" The two of you just aren't in a place where you're attaching significance to things. [17] X Research source A part of this is because you don't go on actual dates.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This inconsistent communication is part of the reason that most people end a situationship by simply ghosting the other person. Once they've decided they're done, they simply stop calling or responding to calls or texts. Sometimes this might not even be a conscious act of ghosting. It could simply be that one person stops texting the other and doesn't think to text again (and the other does the same)."

You might not be seeing anybody else, but not because of any clear agreement between the two of you that you were exclusive. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It could also be that one of you has brought up the concept before and the other responded negatively or changed the subject. Frequently, people who start situationships tell each other from the outset that they're either not ready for or aren't looking for a serious relationship.

[21] X Research source If you do talk about doing things together in the future, it's likely just a vague mention without making any actual plans.
