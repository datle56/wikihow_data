      "content": "Pluto’s transit through the 7th house brings change to relationships. During a transit, a planet (like Pluto) passes through a particular sign or house (like the 7th house) on its journey around the sun. This transit affects everyone and often signifies transformation, encouraging humans to resolve any lingering conflicts or problems in their relationships. During this time, you may find that relationships that don’t serve you anymore come to an end. New relationships may also reveal themselves, leading to better and more authentic connections. You may encounter power struggles or especially strong emotions during this time, so it’s important to communicate openly with your partner so they understand what you’re going through. Pluto takes over 200 years to complete a single trip around the sun, so it transits houses slowly. To track Pluto, you can check a transit calculator ."

A connection between your Pluto and someone else’s 7th house (or vice versa) signals the potential for growth in your relationship. You may each provoke the other’s inner wounds, which can bring emotional release and healing. [5] X Research source Similarly, if someone has your star sign in their 7th or 8th house, this indicates a great match, according to Garbis. However, Pluto in a partner’s 7th house can cause power dynamics and a struggle for dominance in a relationship. To make a relationship like this work, you must embrace change with an open mind and be willing to work through your inner turmoil, with the ultimate goal being personal growth. You can easily find out if you share a synastry connection between Pluto and the 7th house by using a synastry calculator like this one on Astro-charts ."
