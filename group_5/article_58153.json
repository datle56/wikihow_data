      "title": "Sand your laptop if it has scratches or indents.",
      "content": "Sand your laptop if it has scratches or indents. If you’re painting your laptop to cover up scratches or gouges, use a piece of 400-grit sandpaper to remove the top layer of paint. Once the initial layer of paint is off, you can move onto adding your cool design. [4] X Research source Be careful not to sand too far down! You just want to take the paint off here, not any layers of metal. Sanding your laptop first works best before spray painting. If you’re going to use acrylic paint, don’t worry about sanding it."

      "content": "Yes, if you don’t mind a little texture on your laptop. Acrylic paint tends to dry in clumps or globs if you don’t smooth it out first.

      "content": "Use tape to make fun stencils and shapes. If you’re going for a geometric look, paint a base layer of white acrylic paint all over your laptop.

[8] X Research source Painter’s tape will pull easily off your laptop, so you don’t have to worry about any smudges or stickiness. You could even recreate pieces of art, like the Starry Night or The Great Wave of Kanagawa."

      "content": "Yes, if you paint each key individually with a small paint brush. This might take a little time, so make sure you start this project when you have an afternoon free.
