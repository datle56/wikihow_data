As a rule, it’s best to exhale during the part of the movement where your muscles are doing the most work.

Breathe in again as you lower your leg. If you have trouble remembering when to breathe, memorize the phrase “Exhale on Exertion.”"

[3] X Research source When you’re done, bring your foot back down to the floor. Touch down lightly on the ball of your foot. [4] X Research source Keep your hips and shoulders square, and make sure your leg swings straight back instead of out to the side."

[7] X Research source Don’t forget to pump your arms at the same time! [8] X Research source While you’re still learning how to do butt kicks, focus on proper form instead of speed. For example, you might do 20 or 30 reps without worrying about how long it takes to complete the set. As you pick up speed, keep focusing on form. Keep your back straight and your shoulders and hips square. When you’re using butt kicks as part of a dynamic warmup, aim to do them for about a minute before moving on to another stretch or exercise."

      "content": "This will increase the intensity and the fun level. Start out at a jogging pace with your arms bent at your sides. Then, alternate raising your arms to the ceiling and bringing them down to your sides with every kick. [9] X Research source Turn on some lively workout music and kick along to the beat!"

      "content": "Try this to improve your running posture and technique. Instead of swinging your heel up and around to kick the back of your butt, pull it straight up beneath you. Try to touch the bottom of your butt, where you feel your ischium (or “sit bone”). [10] X Research source In this variant, your knee will stick out slightly in front of you as you complete the kick, rather than pointing down at the ground. Focus on letting each foot land softly instead of stomping down hard when you complete the kick."

      "content": "Turn your butt kicks into a dynamic running drill. Instead of standing in one place as you do your kicks, jog forward. As you lift each leg off the ground, bend your knee sharply to kick your heel back toward your glute. Land on the balls of your feet. [11] X Research source Running butt kicks are a great way to get more spring in your step and improve the form of your footfalls for better shock absorption. This exercise is also great for strengthening your quadriceps (a group of muscles in the front of your thigh)."

      "content": "Butt kicks work best when combined with other warmups. Before you start running or doing any other cardio exercise, spend 5 minutes doing dynamic stretches and exercises, including butt kicks. To target other muscles in your legs and improve your flexibility, try a routine that also includes about 1 minute each of: [12] X Research source Rotation running. Jog straight ahead, but twist your torso around to look behind you every 2-3 steps. Walking or jogging backwards. High knees. Bring your knees up toward your chest as you jog forward or in place. Side shuffles. Stand with your shoulders and hips square and move sideways, springing lightly off the balls of your feet. Cariocas. Run sideways while alternately crossing your legs in front of each other."
