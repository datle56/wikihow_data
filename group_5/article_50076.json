[3] X Research source To start, work on making genuine connections with all sorts of people (not just potential lovers). Practice being vulnerable and opening up to others a little bit at a time.

      "content": "For twin flames Angel number 456 is a sign that your twin flame is nearby and wanting to connect. The angels may be guiding you to meet your twin flame for the first time, or they may be hinting your twin flame reunion is coming if you’ve met but are currently separated. In either case, prepare for your twin flame’s arrival by releasing any negativity or baggage you’re holding onto. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re separated from your twin flame because of an argument, do your best to let go of any grudges you’re holding or forgive them (or yourself) for past mistakes. If you haven’t met yet, release your negativity anyway. This gives you a clean energetic slate to receive and begin a deep twin flame relationship. Twin flames are partners (romantic or platonic) who share a soul and who push each other to grow, typically by enduring a separation and then reuniting."

      "content": "Journal about your 456 sightings to help interpret its meaning for you. Every time you see 456, write down where you saw it, what you were doing or thinking, and how seeing it made you feel.

Instead, work on centering yourself and being open to new opportunities to put the angels’ plan for you into action. You might try some of the following: Say “yes” to opportunities that align with your values. Even if you don’t know your purpose yet, do things that make you feel right, help others, or make you feel like you’re making a difference in the world. [9] X Research source Make more family time. Whether biological or chosen, your support system will buoy you through life’s ups and downs and stabilize you as you experience change. [10] X Research source Self-reflect regularly. Journal, meditate, or go for quiet walks in nature to develop your self-awareness and analyze your progress toward your goals. Give everything your best shot. When you choose to do something, follow through and put in an honest effort to reap the rewards. A mediocre or unfocused job leads to dead ends. Trust in the universe’s divine timing. You may feel impatient, but remember that the angels will reward you at the time when it benefits you the most. Until then, enjoy the process!"
