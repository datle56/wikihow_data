This middle number will be the average of the series. For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the middle number is 6. It has three numbers to the left of it, and three numbers to the right of it. So, in this series of numbers, 6 is both the mean and the median."

To find the average, add these two numbers together and divide by two. Their average will be the average of the series. [1] X Research source For example, in the sequence 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, the middle pair is 5 and 6. It has two numbers to the left of it, and two numbers to the right of it. So, to calculate the average of the series, calculate the average of these two numbers: 5 + 6 2 = 11 2 = 5.5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {5+6}{2}}={\\frac {11}{2}}=5.5} So, in this series of numbers, 5.5 is both the mean and the median."

For example, if you were finding the average of sequential numbers beginning with 15 and ending with 45, your formula will look like this: Average = ( 15 + 45 ) 2 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Average}}={\\frac {(15+45)}{2}}} ."
