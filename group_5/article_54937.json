Whether you inherited a propensity toward getting bunions from one of your parents or your bunions are the result of a lifetime of wearing shoes that are too tight, spending as much time as possible walking barefoot can prevent and even heal bunions. Walking barefoot strengthens the muscles in your feet and helps the bones realign in their natural position, rather than having to conform to the shape of your shoes. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source However, if your bunions are advanced and very painful, walking barefoot can make them feel worse. If this is the case, only walk barefoot on thickly carpeted floors. Otherwise, wear padded socks when you're walking around the house and doing your daily activities. Wearing thick, comfortable slippers around the house is another option to help ease the pain of your bunions without subjecting your feet to the pressure of wearing shoes."

Also, use a brannock device to measure your feet each time you buy shoes, because your shoe size can change over time.
