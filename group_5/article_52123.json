Squirt a drop or two of mild dishwashing liquid onto a soft, non-abrasive cloth or sponge and lather it up with warm water. [1] X Research source Wring it out a bit and scrub in gentle circular strokes around the sides and basin, moving with the grain of the sink. Avoid using harsh, acidic cleaners or scratchy scrubbers like steel wool since these can damage the composite material. A quick wipe with soapy water is enough to remove daily buildup and keep your sink looking clean throughout the week. If there's any dry debris on the sink, wipe it off with a cloth before washing the sink with soapy water. Green cleaning expert Alicia Sokolowski says, “Always remove dust and dry dirt first, before adding water. Use a microfiber cloth for that since it’s most effective.” [2] X Expert Source Alicia Sokolowski Green Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020."

      "content": "Use a 50-50 mix of vinegar and water for heavier buildup. If you spot calcium deposits, limescale, or soap scum buildup, go for a stronger cleaner. Mix equal parts water and distilled white vinegar in a spray bottle. Spray the solution on soap scum, stains, and spots (especially around the drain). [3] X Research source Use a clean, soft cloth or sponge and move in gentle circular strokes. If you notice a grain in the sink, move with it to avoid damaging the surface. If the sink is particularly dirty, Sokolowski says to “let [the vinegar] sit for a few minutes or longer if necessary” to make the buildup easier to remove. [4] X Expert Source Alicia Sokolowski Green Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. For an even stronger cleaner, add a squirt of dish soap to the vinegar mixture . [5] X Research source Or, Sokolowski says you can combine a natural bathroom cleaner with baking soda and a few tablespoons of white vinegar for a tougher clean. [6] X Expert Source Alicia Sokolowski Green Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Vinegar is a natural, gentle cleanser that won’t hurt your porous composite sink.

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over any stains or tough spots and scrub them. Add a thin layer of baking soda to tough spots and let it sit for 30 seconds. It will fizz with the vinegar mixture and help breakdown thick limescale deposits or other nasties stuck to the sink. Once the bubbles subside, grab a soft cloth or sponge and scrub the spots again in gentle, circular motions. [8] X Research source Cleaning with baking soda is abrasive enough to be effective, but not so harsh that it will scratch your sink. Pay extra attention to buildup around the drain or garbage disposal. Try using an old toothbrush to scrub any hard to reach areas. [9] X Research source For extra tough stains or buildup, lots of people have had success with using Bar Keepers Friend Soft Cleanser . Apply the cleanser to any tough spots and scrub with a non-scratch sponge to restore any extra grimey areas."

      "content": "Rinse and dry the sink. Use cool or lukewarm water to dilute the vinegar mixture completely. If you don't have a sprayer, direct the water with your hands or a cup. Target soap suds, baking soda patches, and any remaining soap or vinegar buildup. Continue to rinse until all debris and cleaners has been flushed down the drain. Use a soft, fresh towel or cloth to dry the sink afterward. Move in a gentle circular motion with the grain and continue until the sink is completely dry. Sokolowski advises, “Wipe with a clean, dry microfiber cloth for extra shine.” [10] X Expert Source Alicia Sokolowski Green Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020."

      "content": "Oil your black sink about every 4–6 weeks to keep it shiny and glossy. First, make sure the sink is totally dry and dust-free. Then, spread a thin layer of mineral oil all over the sink with a clean rag or paper towel and let it dry for an hour. [11] X Research source If you don’t have mineral oil on hand, a high-quality cooking oil (like olive oil) will work too. [12] X Research source The oil also forms a protective coating on your sink that can prevent hard water mineral deposits from forming."

The best way to stay on top of your sink’s cleanliness is to give it a quick wipe, rinse, and dry at the end of the day (you could even just use the leftover soapy water from your last load of dishes). This way, you won’t have to do heavy-duty cleanings as often! [13] X Research source Here are some other tips to keep your sink cleaner for longer: Don’t leave standing water or dirty dishes in it for too long (this can lead to hard water deposits or limescale buildup). Clean with gentle, natural cleaners whenever possible and avoid harsh, acidic, or abrasive cleaners that can damage the finish (and potentially lead to scratches)."
