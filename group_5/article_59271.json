A cross-dissolve effect fades out the first clip while fading in the second clip. This blends the two clips together and obscures the breaking point. You can adjust the length of the cross-dissolve by clicking and dragging the edges of the cross-dissolve effect in the timeline. Making the cross-dissolve effect longer will probably do a better job of blending the two clips."

Finding a transition spot between two audio clips can be challenging. Try to find an area where the music is quiet, the narrator is speaking loudly, or there is excessive foreground noise.
