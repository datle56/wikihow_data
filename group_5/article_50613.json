      "content": "A Capricorn guy loves a good joke or a funny story. Just keep it shortâ€”he's not one for long text exchanges. But if you can make him laugh or even crack a smile, he'll be sure to think of you often. [1] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. As a lively Leo, you're probably well-known for your sense of humor, so you shouldn't have too much trouble figuring out how to crack up a Capricorn. Capricorns are pretty serious and tend to have a really dry sense of humor. Watch episodes of \"The Office\" (the British version) for inspiration. He's also going to enjoy a witty punâ€”not the \"dad joke\" kind of pun, the kind that would go over most people's heads. \"There's a new theory on inertia, but it doesn't seem to be gaining momentum.\""

      "content": "Capricorns are always willing to lend a helping hand. He likes to feel needed, so if you ask him to help you with something, he'll come to the rescue. He'll probably even follow up and ask you about it later. [2] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. You're a strong, independent woman, so you might find it a bit challenging to play the \"damsel in distress\"â€”but the payoff is worth it. Start with something small, like a sound your car is making or a computer glitch you can't figure out. You'll make him feel needed without sacrificing any of your own power. Resist the temptation to pretend you need help with something you already know how to doâ€”Capricorns value honesty, and he'll feel taken advantage of if he finds out about your ruse."

      "content": "This guy is goal-oriented and likes a woman who has a similar focus. Leo ladies are known for having big dreams and working hard to achieve them. If you tell him your plans for achieving greatness, he'll hang on your every word. [3] X Research source While Capricorn and Leo are both ambitious signs, you view your ambitions very differently. As a luxurious Lioness, you tend to see work as a means to an endâ€”hard work equals success and all its trappings. For your Goat guy, on the other hand, hard work is an end in and of itself."

      "content": "A Capricorn will be somewhat distant until you've met his expectations. And he usually has a pretty long list of expectations! As a Capricorn, he tends to be introverted but cares deeply for a small group of people. [4] X Expert Source Stina Garbis Psychic Astrologer Expert Interview. 10 December 2021. He's known for being pretty picky when it comes to those he lets get close to himâ€”but as a lovely Leo, you're definitely game. You'll go out of your way to impress someone you like, and your effort won't be wasted on him. Cozy up to the people who are close to him as well. He cares about them and trusts themâ€”if they like you, he'll be more likely to like you as well."

      "content": "The typical Capricorn will work hard to exceed your expectations. He's not shy about the fact that he pulled out all the stops to take you on the perfect dateâ€”and he needs to know that you appreciate it. A regal Lioness like you can be hard to impress, but that just makes your compliments more valuable. For example, if he takes you out to a restaurant, you might say, \"Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you got us a table hereâ€”I heard they were booked for months!\" Just make sure what you say is genuineâ€”empty flattery is a big turn-off for him and he can smell it a mile away."

      "title": "Honesty and integrity are traits you both value highly.",
      "content": "Honesty and integrity are traits you both value highly. This is perhaps the biggest thing you have in common, astrologically speaking. Take every opportunity you have to highlight what an honest and forthright person you are and he'll gain respect and appreciation for you. For example, you might tell him about the time you found a wallet on the ground and tracked down its owner so you could return it, cash and all. Anecdotes are great, but how you behave around him will really seal the deal. Show yourself as a woman of integrity who stands up for what you believe in and he'll want to keep you close."

      "title": "Capricorn guys tend to be introverted and need their alone time.",
      "content": "Capricorn guys tend to be introverted and need their alone time. As a Lioness, you have the reputation for being a devoted partner, but you also like a lot of attention. It might be difficult to leave him alone, but the key is to remind yourself that this is something he needs. You're showing your devotion to him by letting him have the time and space he needs to recharge. If you're talking and he says that he was thinking about staying at home, let him know that you'll see him tomorrowâ€”don't take it as an invitation to come over and hang out with him. While you love being the life of the party, he won't necessarily want to accompany you every time you go out. If you sense that he needs some time to himself, don't pressure him! Just go out with friends and have a great time on your own."

      "content": "A Capricorn tends to be pretty conservative with money. He's not necessarily a cheapskate, but he's also not really one to splurge on something he doesn't need. [5] X Research source This can be a sticking point for the typical Lioness who loves to treat herself to little luxuries. Just try to refrain when he's aroundâ€”he's not likely to question purchases he doesn't see you make. Be honest if he does ask you about the cost of somethingâ€”he'll be more upset if he finds out you lied. He does appreciate quality, so it can help to frame it as an investment purchase. If you get serious, maintaining separate finances is essential for this relationship to work. Money is already one of the main things couples argue about and your opposing spending habits can lead to conflict."

      "title": "Your Capricorn often needs a reminder he's your #1.",
      "content": "Your Capricorn often needs a reminder he's your #1. If you're a typical Lioness, you like to be surrounded by admirers and have a pretty big social circle. This can make your Goat uncomfortable because he keeps a small circle of close friends. Keep your focus on him and he'll never doubt his place in your heart. [6] X Research source If you're out with friends, you might check in on him periodically to show that he's still on your mind. Maybe send him a text that says, \"Can't stop thinking about you! Just thought I'd say hi ðŸ˜‰\" Capricorn guys tend to keep a tight lid on their emotions, which can be frustrating for an emotion-led Leo. But if he knows where he stands, he'll trust you enough to open up to you."

      "title": "Because both of you are dominant people, a relationship requires compromise.",
      "content": "Because both of you are dominant people, a relationship requires compromise. Once you start getting serious (if not before), you'll realize that you both want to take charge. This can lead you to butt heads often if you don't come up with a way to share control. Decide what's most important to each of you and go from there. For example, you might put him in charge of choosing the restaurants for dates if you're allowed to be in charge of other dating activities, such as which movie to see or what activity to do. After you've made your agreement, make sure you stick to it! Nothing will turn him cold faster than you going back on something you said."

      "content": "A Capricorn man expects his partner to be loyal. A Leo lady is naturally loyal, and he'll adore this about you. [7] X Research source Take every opportunity to express your support and stick by him when he's going through a rough patch. He'll feel honored that you chose him. For example, if you give him advice that he doesn't follow and he ends up being right, keep your \"I told you so\" to yourself. This shows that you respect him enough to make his own decisions and are too loyal to rub it in when you're right and he's wrong. Being faithful also means refraining from gossipâ€”especially about him. Even if a nasty rumor never gets back to him, you don't want to get the reputation as someone who talks bad about him behind his back."
