      "content": "Prepare the Keurig with a 1:1 ratio of water and descaling solution or vinegar. While Keurig officially recommends using their Keurig Descale Solution, vinegar can work in a pinch. Pour a bottle of descaling solution or vinegar into the machine’s empty water reservoir. Then, fill the same bottle with tap water and add it to the water reservoir. Place a large (14oz or larger) mug on the drip tray to catch the solution once it runs through the machine. [1] X Research source Ensure the funnel or cup holder inside the brewer is empty. Do not place a K-cup inside. You can also purchase commercial descaling alternatives if you’re looking for other affordable and accessible options. Solutions may come in liquid, powder, or tablet forms. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to fill your machine."

      "content": "Repeat the descaling process until the ADD WATER light illuminates. Look for the flashing “K” brew button atop the machine. Press the brew button to start the descaling process . The solution will run through the machine and into the large mug. Once the cycle is complete, dump the hot liquid into the sink. Repeat this process until the ADD WATER light illuminates. [3] X Research source The entire process can take 15-20 minutes."

Wait for a flashing brew light once the reservoir is in the machine. Press the brew button to start the rinsing process. Repeat this step until the DESCALE light turns off. [4] X Research source Keep an empty mug on the drip tray to capture the freshly brewed water. It can take 12 rinsing cycles. Now your machine is ready for a fresh cup of coffee!"

      "title": "Perform a descaling cycle every 3 to 6 months.",
      "content": "Perform a descaling cycle every 3 to 6 months. Many Keurigs have a built-in sensor and DESCALE light that will illuminate when it’s time. However, House Cleaning Professional James Sears recommends descaling every 3 to 6 months or upon visible notice of scale build-up. Look for white calcified spots in the machine or water reservoir."

      "title": "Use distilled or bottled water if you have “hard” water.",
      "content": "Use distilled or bottled water if you have “hard” water. Descaling removes mineral build-up from the machine and water reservoir. Sears explains, “The harder your water, the more often you should descale. A trick to avoid this would be to consider using distilled or bottled water with low mineral content.” It can lead to less scale build-up and less cleaning maintenance."

      "content": "The descale light doesn’t turn off. There could be two reasons why the descaling light isn’t going away. One reason is an insufficient descaling cycle caused by an improper descaling solution. Try another solution to see if that’s a problem. Otherwise, press the 8oz and 12oz buttons for 5 seconds, and the light will go away. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure the water reservoir has enough water to avoid overheating. Many Reddit users have experienced overheating or a complete breakdown after performing a descaling cycle. As you go through the cycle, ensure there’s sufficient water in the reservoir tank to keep the machine cool. Avoid running a cycle with minimal to no water or solution. One user recommended having at least 28 fl oz (56 US tbsp) of water or solution in the tank."
