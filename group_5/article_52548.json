      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C) and season the roast. Place a 3 to 4-pound (1.4 to 1.8 kg) boneless bottom round roast on your work surface and sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of salt and 1/4 teaspoon (0.5 g) of pepper evenly over the meat.

      "content": "Sear the roast for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Heat 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of vegetable oil in a large pot or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, set the seasoned roast in the pot. Leave the roast to cook for 2 to 3 minutes without moving it. Then use tongs to turn the roast to another side and sear it for another 2 to 3 minutes. [4] X Research source Searing the meat will make the roast more flavorful and give it a golden brown color. [5] X Research source Try coating the meat with your choice of chopped herbs or spices for additional flavor. If you try to move the meat before it's seared, it will stick to the pot."

Sprinkle the roast with freshly chopped parsley if you like. If you prefer, use the pan juices to make a quick gravy. Refrigerate the leftover roast in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Alternatively, you could freeze it partially before slicing it thinly. You can use it in something like a beef stroganoff because you do not overcook it. Those cuts of meat do not have a lot of intramuscular fat, and you can easily overcook them."
