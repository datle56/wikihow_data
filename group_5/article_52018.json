Remove the plastic lid and orange bottle tree from the sterilizer and submerge it in the water, then use a sponge or brush to scrub them clean.

Wipe down the base, the metal heating plate, and the control console on the front of the Sterilizer. [2] X Research source Try to clean your Baby Brezza Sterilizer at least once a week. Wipe the same areas with a damp clean cloth or paper towel to make sure all the soap is removed. Alternatively, dip the cloth in a solution of 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) warm water and 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) white distilled vinegar to help remove any mineral deposits."

Use a clean dry cloth to soak up any remaining water on or around the heating plate. [3] X Research source Try to descale your Baby Brezza sterilizer at least once a month. Descaling breaks down minerals left behind from the water, which can discolor the heating plate inside and affect its performance over time. [4] X Research source If you find rust-colored or white deposits on the heating plate, it’s most likely caused by mineral deposits. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Wipe the metal heating plate with a damp soft cloth. Wet a clean cloth with water and wipe down the heating plate in the center of the sterilizer and the plastic tray around it. [6] X Research source This helps remove any large mineral chunks that might not dissolve in the descaling process. Since the water is boiled to make steam, most of the mineral residue collects on the heating plate—however, you can descale the bottle tree and lid if you see hard water spots on them. Fill a sink with equal parts water and vinegar, let them soak for 10 minutes, and wash them with dish soap and warm clean water."

Baby Brezza recommends pouring ½ a bottle of their descaler on the heating plate, but you can also use 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white distilled vinegar. [7] X Research source Pour the solution directly onto the heating plate and on any mineral deposits around it. [8] X Research source If your sterilizer has a dryer, make sure to pour away from the fan opening, following the direction that the arrow points on the base. [9] X Research source Both descaler and vinegar contain citric acid that removes limescale and other mineral build-up. However, the descaler is odorless while the vinegar’s smell may take time to dissapate. [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source You can also wet a paper towel or cloth with water and use it to clean up any excess descaler or vinegar. Optionally, pour distilled water to the line in the base and turn on a sterilizing cycle to make sure all the vinegar or descaler is evaporated. Some brown or discolored spots might remain on the heating plate, but they’re harmless. [12] X Research source They’re most likely burnt spots that do not make the sterilizer unsafe to use."
