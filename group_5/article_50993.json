      "title": "3Dio Free Space Binaural Microphone.",
      "content": "3Dio Free Space Binaural Microphone. With not only one XLR port but two (for the left and right ears), the 3Dio FS Binaural Mic offers the best ASMR sound experience, hands-down. However, with that huge bonus feature comes an expensive price tag of around $400-1000. This is a highly specialized microphone that features two prosthetic ears so you can record things as you want them to sound. For example, if you crinkle a piece of paper above the left ear, the listener would hear the paper crinkle above their left ear instead of in both ears as they would with other microphones. Given that these are highly specialized, they aren't suited for traditional recordings."

    {
      "title": "Rode NT4.",
      "content": "Rode NT4. A little pricey (at $515), this single microphone allows you to be able to record with studio quality (on an X/Y pattern). It features 2 capture points so you don't need more than one microphone. For this reason, it's great for ASMR recordings."

      "title": "Form.",
      "content": "Form. Some ASMR artists show their microphones in their videos, and others hide them. If you have a microphone that's visually appealing, like you picked the best color for a Blue Yeti mic, why not show it off?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Recording type.",
      "content": "Recording type. Most, if not all, of the suggested microphones here are condenser or dynamic mics rather than ribbon or shotgun. Their sensitivity and ability to capture sound with lots of detail was a leading factor in these suggestions. Since binaural microphones record sound spatially, they are considered the very best for ASMR recordings. While expensive, they are the only type of microphone that can capture the 3D location of the sound for your listeners."
