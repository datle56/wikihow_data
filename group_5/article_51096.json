Doing anything tonight? 😉” or caption a photo with you on Instagram with, “Weekends with my bookie >>>” A girl may pair “bookie” with “pookie” to show even more affection.

      "content": "A “bookie” could be someone who bets or gambles. Back in the day, a “bookie” was short for “bookmaker” or someone who determines gambling odds and pays off bets. [1] X Research source Over time, the slang term started began describing a shady person who bets on sporting events. If someone uses the term when talking about someone placing bets, they’re probably not the most trustworthy with money. “Gosh, he’s a bookie. Wonder if she knows where all the money goes.” “See that one over there? Total bookie. He’s been placing bets for hours.” “No gambling for me tonight, friends! I’ve put the bookie days behind me.”"

      "content": "Sometimes, “bookie” refers to a bookworm or nerd. You may be called a “bookie” by someone if you love books or learning. In this context, “bookie” can have a negative or positive connotation. Say your bestie calls you “bookie” when you tell them you read 5 books this month—that’s a positive remark! They’re calling you a cute bookworm. On the other hand, let’s say a bully calls you “bookie” when you wear your glasses to school. If they call you other rude names or laugh, they may be making fun of your “nerdy” appearance."

      "content": "Give your girlfriend a pet name in return. If your girlfriend starts calling you “bookie” or “bookie pookie,” consider using a cute nickname for her too. Maybe her smile lights up your day like “sunshine,” or she’s as cute as a “ladybug.” As long as the pet name is endearing and makes her smile, you’re golden! [2] X Research source Try pet names like “Queen,” “Darling,” “Angel,” “Princess,” “Sweetie,” “Treasure,” or “Cupcake.” Ask your SO if it’s okay to call her by a cute nickname—it’s always best to know how she feels about it!"

Sometimes it’s better not to comment on snide remarks—it could fuel the name caller’s ego. So, if you have the means, remove yourself from the situation, ignore the bully, and find someone else to talk to. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tell them not to call you “bookie” if you don’t like it. If you’re feeling brave, speak up and express your distaste. Not everyone enjoys being called a “bookie,” and that’s okay! Take a look at these scenarios: If your girlfriend calls you bookie, try saying, “Babe, I love you, but can I have another nickname? ‘Bookie’ doesn’t sit well with me.” If you’re accused of gambling, say something like, “Guys, I know I have a track record, but we don’t have to start calling people out.” If you’re bullied for being a nerd, stand up for yourself with, “You can say whatever you want, but I like how I look. If wearing glasses and reading is a problem, it’s yours, not mine” and then walk away. [4] X Research source"
