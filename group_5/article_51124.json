      "content": "Charge your device. While an obvious choice, not all technology products come fully charged. For a rechargeable disposable vape plug it into the nearest outlet for 10 to 15 minutes before testing. Look for a still or flashing LED light to know when the device is charged."

      "content": "Examine e-liquid levels. Test your disposable vape by inhaling. Look for a burnt or harsh taste. If that’s the case, this is the result of chain vaping, lack of e-liquid or juice, or a faulty device. [2] X Research source Chain vaping, like chain smoking, refers to the action of taking puff after puff with no significant breaks in between. When this happens, the vape’s cotton wicking material inside its coil doesn’t get enough time to soak up fresh e-liquid. The cotton then becomes dry, making it vulnerable to being burned by the coil.

      "content": "Check airflow. A vape’s airflow controls the amount of fresh air that mixes into the vapor. This helps bring out its flavors and prevents you from getting burned. [4] X Research source Check your hand or finger positioning to avoid blocking the devices' air holes at its bottom end. Some vapes offer adjustable airflows that allow you to open and close air slots to produce more vapor."

To unclog your vape look for debris around the mouthpiece, or in the case of cannabis vapes, oil-build up. For removable and replaceable mouthpieces, take it off to see if there is any debris. For non-removable mouthpieces, take a toothpick or Q-tip to gently remove any blockage."

      "content": "Follow the 10 second rule. Many vapes are built with auto-stop, meaning when you pull for longer than 10 seconds the device will shut off. Read the manual to find out the exact cut-off time for your specific vape."

      "content": "Your faulty brand new vape is a dud. Nearly 11.9 million vapes are sold per month, so it’s no surprise to find yourself with a device that fails to work. [6] X Research source In many local smoke shops or dispensaries, sellers will ask you to open and test your new vape at the counter. If that’s not an option, keep the receipt or packaging to get in touch with the manufacturer for returns or refunds. It’s important to choose legal, licensed businesses when purchasing vape or cannabis products as they “comply with regulations that promote safety and product quality,” Dr. Jamie Corroon says. Also recommending to look for dispensaries that “display their license prominently [...] and on their website."

      "content": "There are five essential components to a vape’s autonomy. “Vaping is the process of applying heat to Cannabis flower, or oil, in order to convert CBD, and other compounds, into a gas state [to then] be inhaled through the lungs.” Dr. Jamie Corroon explains. While every device is different, there are five non-negotiable features that makes a vape, including: Mouthpiece. Also called “drip tips” this is the part you inhale through. Tank or cartridge. This is where the cannabis oil or nicotine is held. Atomizer. This piece heats the oil, forming tiny vapor droplets for inhalation. Power button and sensor. Some vapes feature a power button, though not all vapes have this. In some cases, vapes are draw-activated, meaning they turn on whenever you inhale. Battery. A vape’s battery works to supply a large amount of power so the atomizer can reach a high temperature quickly. Some batteries are rechargeable, where others are only built for one-time use.

      "content": "Disposable vapes are classified as electronic items. Vapes, even disposables, use lithium batteries and must be disposed of through county hazardous waste collections. [8] X Research source Whether you’ve drawn an unlucky card and ended up with a dud or your vape is out of e-liquid, recycle them responsibly. If your vape’s battery is easily removable, take it out before trashing the body of the vape. Check your city or town’s Department of Sanitation or Waste Management website for specific electronic waste instructions. Ask your local smoke shop or dispensary if they offer recycling services. Some vape brands partner with shops to offer safe and convenient recycling for their products. [9] X Research source"
