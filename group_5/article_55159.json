      "title": "Find an attractive girl at school/work.",
      "content": "Find an attractive girl at school/work. If you're straight (heterosexual), don't force yourself to like the same gender! You can try, but it won't work because you can't choose who you're attracted to. If you've already found a girl you like, skip this step. To find a bisexual girl, visit your local LGBT community centre."

      "title": "Flirt.",
      "content": "Flirt. Flirt a bit, but don't make her think you like her. Smile a bit, giggle calmly and cute and make her laugh, maybe if you befriend her enough you can go somewhere! Also: Make sure she is comfortable with any approaches you make. If she seems unsure, then stop."

    {
      "title": "Ask if she's into girls.",
      "content": "Ask if she's into girls. If you really got to know her, ask if she's bi or lesbian. Don't do this if you think she doesn't trust you enough, be patient, she would open up if she trust you, once you earned her trust ask her this question. How you gain her trust is tell her a secret, not your biggest one but one you feel comfortable telling her. Don't make it seem like a big deal, just nonchalantly ask her."

      "title": "Ask her on a date.",
      "content": "Ask her on a date. That's part of liking each other, dating! If you feel like she's your bestie now, ask her out casually like \"lets go to coffee shop\" or take her to a basketball game! Find out her interests first, then take her somewhere that fits her hobbies!"
