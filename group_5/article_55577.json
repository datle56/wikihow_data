      "content": "Donate clothes and household items if you live near an affected area. Search NVOAD online to find local food banks, shelters, and faith-based organizations that are providing relief efforts and to find out what items are accepted. Keep in mind, organizations may not accept certain items if they can’t use them right away. [7] X Research source Sometimes, even basic necessities, like water bottles, can’t be accepted due to logistics like storage space and delivery costs, so it’s best to call ahead or check online to find out what’s needed. The supplies that are needed often depend on the type of disaster. For instance, mops, buckets, and dehumidifiers might be needed if you want to help flood victims . While it may be natural to want to send toys to help comfort children who have been affected, toys are typically not encouraged because they are not considered an immediate need, and also due to other concerns such as storage and distribution.
