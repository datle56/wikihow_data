      "content": "Discord Nitro is broken up into three different tiers. Two of these tiers are currently available, Nitro Basic and regular Nitro. Nitro Basic is a tier that includes the ability to use emotes across servers, the ability to use custom stickers anywhere in addition to Nitro-exclusive stickers, up to 50MB upload quality, and the ability to set a custom animated background on your profile. This tier is US$2.99 per month or US$29.99 per year. Nitro Classic is a tier that includes all the features of Nitro Basic, as well as the ability to get 30% off server boosts, and higher streaming quality to 1080p60fps. This tier is US$4.99 per month or US$49.99 per year, but this tier cannot be obtained. Existing subscribers can continue to use Nitro Classic, and Nitro Classic gifts and credits will remain valid, but new purchases and gifts of Nitro Classic cannot be obtained. Nitro is the primary tier that includes all the features of Nitro Basic and Nitro Classic, as well as 2 free server boosts, 100MB upload size, 4k60fps streaming, double the message length, the ability to join double the number of servers, the ability to customize your profile background and animated avatar, video call backgrounds, and the ability to have server-specific profiles (beyond nicknames). This tier is US$9.99 per month or US$99.99 per year. All Nitro subscriptions will show a badge on your profile indicating you are currently subscribed to Nitro."

      "content": "Without Nitro, you do get to use Discord, but you may have certain features disabled: The maximum stream quality is 720p30fps, which is not ideal for screen-sharing video games or even sharing applications with text for work. Higher screen share resolutions, including source quality, can be unlocked through Nitro. The maximum upload size is 8MB. Any larger files require either a server boost (to increase the upload size for all members) or a Nitro subscription for a maximum of 100MB. The maximum character limit is 2000 characters. Nitro allows for double that at 4000 characters. External emotes and stickers will be disabled, and animated emotes will be unavailable. You will not be able to set a custom server profile aside from changing your nickname. You will also be unable to change your profile's accent colors or set an animated background."
