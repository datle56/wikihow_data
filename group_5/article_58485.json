      "content": "If you have a polarizing personality, some people hate you while others love you. When something’s polarizing, it’s a cause for a great debate and divided opinions. [1] X Research source Because of this, polarizing people are either adored or despised. They tend to have a cult-like following around them, with communities being very vocal about their support or distaste. For example, you may be familiar with some of these famous polarizing people: Kanye West, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, Meghan Markle, Wendy Williams, and Johnny Depp. As another example, you may know the phrase “political polarization,” which occurs when a population has variously different attitudes toward a political party or its members.

      "content": "You’re confident and ambitious. You’re the main character of your own story, so why should you worry about what other people think? If you want something, you’re not afraid to go for it (no matter what it takes). You have big dreams and a whole lot of chutzpah."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re opinionated.",
      "content": "You’re opinionated. With your confidence and eager attitude, you’ve certainly got a lot to say. You don’t hesitate to give people your 2 cents, which can sometimes give people an impression that you’re a know-it-all."

[5] X Research source For example, if someone gives you a disapproving look after you’ve tried someone’s food, chances are you’ve shown your distaste on your face. Make a note to smile or remain stoic the next time you take a bite."

      "content": "Avoid making jokes. Sometimes sarcasm and humor can be the most polarizing. If you want to reverse your polarizing personality and make more people like you, try staying away from jokes and sarcastic remarks. These can sometimes come across as rude or insensitive, which can cause people to dislike you. [6] X Research source Give a matter-of-fact statement rather than making a sarcastic comment so your opinion is super clear. For instance, instead of saying, “Yeah, it’d be nice to get some help. But that would require too much effort,” say, “Would you be able to help me with this? I feel like you’re being lazy.”"

      "title": "Acknowledge and apologize for your mistakes.",
      "content": "Acknowledge and apologize for your mistakes. One of the best ways to make amends for polarizing behaviors is to own up to your mistakes . If you’ve offended anyone unintentionally, say you’re sorry . Then, make it a point to never make the same mistake again. Remember, actions speak louder than words. Try saying something like, “Hey, I’m sorry about what I said the other night. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, and now I know I was out of line. I promise I won’t make comments like that again.”"

      "title": "Keep disagreements to a minimum.",
      "content": "Keep disagreements to a minimum. More often than not, people may have adverse opinions about you because your own opinion is polarizing. If you want to be more likable, do your best to avoid debate whenever possible. [7] X Research source For instance, if someone says, “The movie really made me think,” respond with, “I wish they showed their backstory more deeply,” rather than “Really? I thought it was awful.” This way, you add to the conversation without putting down their opinion."

    {
      "title": "Shift your personality.",
      "content": "Shift your personality. To become more agreeable and likable, try changing undesirable personality traits and adopt a flexible personality. Alter your demeanor depending on the circumstance. This way, you’re adapting to the public rather than being polarizing. [8] X Research source For example, how you behave with your boss differs from how you interact with close friends. Use a professional attitude with your boss, refraining from saying things outside the company’s guidelines, and reserve personal opinions and casualties for close friends. Keep in mind that this doesn’t mean you have to change all aspects of yourself. Simply show certain aspects of your personality to specific people who’d like or benefit from it."

      "content": "Being polarizing isn’t necessarily good or bad. Depending on who you ask, having a polarizing personality can be a blessing or a curse. On one hand, you can spark conversation with your naturally divisive nature. On the other, you may come across as arrogant or abrasive, causing conflict, tension, and stress in others. All in all, the morality of being polarizing depends on your attitude and actions. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
