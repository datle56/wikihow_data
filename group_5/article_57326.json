      "title": "Prepare a wooden board.",
      "content": "Prepare a wooden board. It should be 1x3 inches (2.54x7.62 cm) or 2x3 inches (5.08x7.62 cm). It should be 22 inches (55.88 cm) long. Going from left to right with the board laying horizontally, mark lines at the 2 inch (5.08 cm) mark, the 7.25 inch (18.42 cm) mark, the 12.5 inch (31.75 cm) mark, and the 17.75 inch (45.09 cm) mark. Use a marker or a pencil. Mark 2 dots on each line that are evenly spaced."

      "title": "Weave 2 wires on the board.",
      "content": "Weave 2 wires on the board. Use the remaining portion of the wire for this. The bent portion of the v-shaped wires should be intersected once each. The wires should not touch each other. Be sure that at least 1 of the wires that you weave is insulated. Vinyl insulation will work well. When finished, the wires should resemble 2 \"X\" shapes that connect the first and second and the third and fourth sets of v-shaped wires, respectively. Two horizontal lines should connect the \"X\" designs between the second and third sets of v-shaped wires."
