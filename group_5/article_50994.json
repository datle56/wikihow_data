      "title": "Microsoft Edge",
      "content": "Microsoft Edge offers a familiar Windows feel when browsing the internet. If you're a Windows user, you'll have Microsoft Edge already preinstalled to your device. You can easily use ChatGPT on this browser, but you won't have a huge selection of extensions. However, you do have exclusive access to Bing's AI chatbot. This functions similarly to ChatGPT and is only available to Edge users. If you want multiple AI chatbots to interact with and you enjoy the Windows interface, Microsoft Edge could be the browser for you."

While Opera's built-in version of ChatGPT doesn't have all the features ChatGPT has to offer, it's convenient for quick questions or prompts when you can't visit the OpenAI webpage."
