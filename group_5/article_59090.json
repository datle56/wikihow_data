      "title": "Dab any kind of ink with rubbing alcohol to remove it.",
      "content": "Dab any kind of ink with rubbing alcohol to remove it. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a paper towel, lay it on top of the stain, and place 1 to 2 other paper towels on top. Apply pressure to the stain, replacing the paper towels when the ink soaks through. [1] X Research source Repeat until the stain disappears. Wear rubber gloves and keep the room well-ventilated to avoid inhaling potentially harmful fumes. [2] X Research source Apply the alcohol to a sponge and test it on a corner of the carpet before applying it to the stain. Alternatively, use isopropyl alcohol. [3] X Research source Butyl alcohol might work better than rubbing alcohol if the ink is from a ballpoint pen or stamp pad. [4] X Research source Denatured alcohol (methylated spirits) can also work on ballpoint pen ink. [5] X Research source"

Wait 30 minutes or until the paste is hardened, then brush it off the area with your fingers and vacuum up the paste. [9] X Research source If the stain is still there after, repeat this method or try another in this list.

Hold the bottle 8 inches (20 cm) away and spray the area liberally. Blot with a damp cloth, then fill a bowl with warm water and 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of laundry detergent. Dab the area with a sponge dipped in the solution until the stain disappears. [12] X Research source Use ammonia on synthetic carpets only—natural fibers like cotton, wool, or linen might become damaged. [13] X Research source Test the ammonia on a small area first before applying it to the stained area. Alternatively, mix 1 part ammonia with 1 part hydrogen peroxide and apply it to the area with a paper towel or sponge. [14] X Research source"

Alternatively, fill a bowl with warm water and add 1 teaspoon of laundry detergent. Dab the stained area with a sponge soaked in the solution until the stain is gone. [19] X Research source This ratio of water to dish soap works best for synthetic carpets. For natural fiber carpets, mix 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of dish soap in 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water. [20] X Research source If the ink won’t come out all the way, scrub the soaped-up area with a clean toothbrush to work it out of the fibers."

[24] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source For best results, use a wet vacuum to lift the spill, then apply the spot remover and use the vacuum to suck up the cleaner and the stain. Repeat until the stain is gone. As a more natural alternative, apply a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 1 part water to the area. Wait a few minutes, then soak up the spot with a paper towel."
