      "content": "\"Pluh” is also used as a meme sound effect for TikTok videos. The goal is to spam users with an absurd word or sound as the speaker makes commentary on the subject of their video. For example, a TikTok gamer may describe their actions but interrupt themselves with the “Pluh” sound effect. The sound starts off gradually, appearing every few words or so before being played back to back at the end of a video so the speaker can’t get a word in. [4] X Research source The sound effect is also said to have been used to cover up sexually suggestive statements online. [5] X Research source"
