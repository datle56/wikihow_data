      "content": "Check your electrical panel for tripped breakers. If your digital Honeywell thermostat has a blank screen or isn't kicking on your furnace or air conditioner, check the breaker that powers the wall on which your thermostat is mounted. Also, check the breaker that powers your AC and/or furnace. If any breakers are tripped, reset it to the proper position. If you just installed your Honeywell thermostat and it's not working, make sure you've wired it exactly as your previous thermostat was wired."

      "content": "Override the current program. If your programmable thermostat is set to turn off or on between certain times, you may be unable to change the settings without unlocking or overriding the program. On most Honeywell thermostats, you can do this by selecting the desired temperature and pressing the Hold button. When you want to return to the program, just press Run . [1] X Research source On some other thermostat models, you can press the Fan and Up Arrow buttons at the same time to unlock the screen."

      "content": "Replace the batteries if the screen is blank. If your Honeywell thermostat has a blank screen, it may just need new batteries . Most thermostats that aren't Honeywell Home smart thermostats use batteries to power the display rather than C wires. [2] X Research source A blank display could indicate that the battery that powers the screen needs to be replaced. The steps vary by model, but you'll typically just need to remove the cover to access the battery."

If your Honeywell thermostat's screen works, but it will not heat or cool your home, locate the power switch on your furnace and/or air conditioner, and make sure it's set to the On position.

      "content": "Remove the faceplate and check your connections. If your Honeywell thermostat still isn't working, make sure the wires are connected to the proper terminals. Your thermostat's manual came with a wiring diagram that specifies which wires must connect to which terminals, so make sure your wires align with what you see in your manual. Before touching any wires or connections, be sure to turn off the breaker that powers your thermostat. All Honeywell thermostats use the \"G\" terminal to control the fan. If no wire is connected to the G terminal (or the wire is not secure), the fan will not activate. If the G wire is fine but the fan won't turn on, your HVAC system needs servicing.

If you want to restore your digital Honeywell thermostat to its original settings and delete any programmed temperature preferences, start by removing the batteries. Wait 10 seconds, and then reinsert them. If this doesn't work, some technicians recommend first reinserting the batteries incorrectly (backward), leaving them in for 10 seconds, and then replacing them correctly. This will clear any programming that may be interfering with your heating and cooling system."

If you've recently installed your thermostat and the screen is blank, it's typically because the C wire (or C-wire adapter) hasn't been connected. Before messing with wires in your thermostat, turn off the breaker to the wall on which your thermostat is mounted. Then, remove the faceplate and make sure the C wire is securely connected to the \"C\" terminal.

For other models, you will need to connect your computer, phone, or tablet to your Honeywell thermostat as a Wi-Fi access point (it'll be called New_Thermostat, followed by some numbers). This will take you to the setup page, where you can add your Honeywell thermostat to your Wi-Fi network.

Keep in mind that doing a factory reset will erase all of your settings, including your Wi-Fi connection. If your thermostat has a Menu option or button, such as the Smart WiFi T5, T6, T9, or T10, the option to reset it is in that menu. The menu names are a little different on all Honeywell models, but you'll usually find a Reset or Factory Reset option in a menu called Advanced Setup, Preferences , or Thermostat Information . On the VisionPRO TH8321WF, which has a Menu button, select Dealer Information on the menu, scroll down and write down the date code, then press Done . Then, select Installer Options , enter the date code, and select Reset . If you have a Honeywell FocusPro 6000, press and hold Arrow Up and Fan. Change the number on the left to 90, and the one on the right to 1. Select Done to reset. On the VisionPRO 8000, press System , press and hold the blank box in the center, change the number on the left to 0710, and the one on the right to 1. Select Done to reset.

      "content": "Check for electrical problems. Try switching your analog Honeywell thermostat to the Heat position and turning the heat up to 80. Wait a few moments to see if the heat kicks on. Then, if you also have air conditioning, turn the AC down to 60 to see if it kicks on. If this test doesn't activate the AC or heating system, there could be an electrical problem. Check the breaker that controls the wall your thermostat is attached to. Then, check the breaker that controls your furnace and/or AC. On the furnace or AC unit, make sure the on/off switch is in the On position and that no doors are open."
