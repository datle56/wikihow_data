      "title": "“New Relationship Energy” refers to the thrill of a new relationship.",
      "content": "“New Relationship Energy” refers to the thrill of a new relationship. NRE is also called the “honeymoon phase” and describes feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, novelty, and sexual chemistry you experience with a new partner. Anyone can experience NRE, but the term is common in polyamorous and ethically non-monogamous (ENM) communities where people manage multiple relationships at a time. [1] X Research source In nonmonogamous communities, NRE describes the excitement of meeting a new partner, in contrast with less intense feelings you may have towards a partner you’ve been with for a long time. Nonmonogamous folks may feel that NRE poses a risk to existing relationships, since it may cause someone to neglect other partners. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "NRE lasts from a few weeks to a few years. The exact duration varies between relationships. But inevitably, the novelty of a new relationship wears off as partners get to know each other. Excitement and euphoria give way to more a clear-eyed understanding of each other’s personalities—strengths, flaws, and all. [3] X Research source The end of NRE doesn’t automatically signal the end of passion, love, or sexual chemistry. As NRE ends, couples may still grow closer and more committed to each other ."

      "title": "You feel euphoric and “on top of the world.”",
      "content": "You feel euphoric and “on top of the world.” The “honeymoon phase” of a new relationship causes your brain to release dopamine, giving you an emotional “rush” or “high.” [4] X Research source Meanwhile, kissing, touching, and sex increase levels of oxytocin, a.k.a. the “love hormone,” which reinforces the romantic and sexual bonds between you and your new partner. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source NRE literally changes your brain chemistry, albeit temporarily. Eventually, your dopamine and oxytocin levels will return to normal and the euphoria of NRE will subside. These phenomena can happen to anyone during the early stages of a new relationship, including folks in monogamous relationships."

      "content": "You constantly think about your new partner. Maybe you think of them 24/7, or maybe you find yourself daydreaming about them while you’re at work. Maybe you smile every time it happens, or you quickly snap out of it and feel embarrassed. Whatever the case, like a love-struck teenager, you can’t get your crush off your mind. [6] X Research source If others have pointed out that you seem distracted, you can bet it’s due to NRE."

      "content": "You text or message them more often than anyone else. You’re constantly texting them just to say hi. Or to flirt . Or to send selfies. Or for no reason at all. But one thing’s for sure: you never leave them on read. [7] X Research source If you’re nonmonogamous, you may text them more often than your spouse or long-term partners."

      "title": "You have intense sexual chemistry with them.",
      "content": "You have intense sexual chemistry with them. When you’re together, you can’t keep your hands off each other. Getting through a whole movie on the couch is impossible. Not that you’re complaining, of course. [8] X Research source Nonmonogamous folks experiencing NRE may still have strong sexual chemistry with other partners. But with a new partner, the sex may feel more novel and intense. In some cases, nonmonogamous folks may share certain kinks and interests with a new partner, but not with a long-term partner. This can make the new connection particularly exciting."

      "content": "You start prioritizing them more than other people in your life. Maybe you keep canceling plans with friends. Or maybe you’ve left your social calendar open in case your new partner is free. Whatever the case, your new relationship is taking up a lot of your free time, while other relationships have taken a back seat. [9] X Research source If you have other partners, they might point out that you’ve been spending less time with them lately."

People who know you well have pointed out that you seem “somewhere else” lately, or that they don’t see you as often as they used to. Or they tease you for constantly talking about your new relationship. They may be jealous or irritated—or they could be sincerely happy for you. [10] X Research source For instance, poly and ENM folk may experience feelings of compersion: a sense of pleasure and joy from their partner happy in a new relationship. [11] X Research source"

[15] X Research source Poly and ENM folks should keep in mind that a new partner can’t fix problems in current relationships.
