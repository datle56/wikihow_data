      "content": "Modern beauty standards aren’t attainable for most people. With photo editing and filters, even celebrities don’t look like the photos of themselves most of the time! It can be tough to change your mindset, but remind yourself that most beauty standards aren’t realistic, and you shouldn’t hold yourself to them. [1] X Research source If you’re feeling intimidated by media beauty standards, criticize them in return. You might say something like, “What’s so special about being a size 0?” or “Who cares if I look like the celebrities in magazines?” Most celebrity pictures are edited to eliminate flaws and make the person look skinnier. Celebrities themselves recommend not comparing yourself to magazine covers and photoshoots!"

      "content": "Focus on what your body can do instead of what it can’t. Your body can run, dance, sing, dream, laugh, yell, and so much more! If you find yourself being critical of how you look, run through the list of things that your body does for you. It can help shift your perspective and make you thankful about your appearance instead of critical. It might help to sit down and write a list of all the things your body does for you. That way, if you catch yourself in a bad mood, you can whip out your list for a little boost."

      "content": "It can be really hard to look in the mirror without feeling critical. That’s okay! The next time you’re in front of the mirror, just observe yourself instead of being judgmental or critical. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t quite shake your negative thoughts—instead, just acknowledge that these thoughts are negative and try observing yourself again later."

      "content": "They can really boost your confidence when you feel down. It’s really easy to brush off compliments at first. Instead, grab a spare notebook and jot down exactly what that person said about you, whether it had to with your appearance, personality, or something else. After a week or so, flip through those compliments and really let them sink in. [2] X Research source When you write down a compliment, you’re forcing yourself to really think about it. A compliment could be something as simple as “I like your shirt” or “Your hair looks great today.”"

      "title": "You can’t please everyone, and that’s okay.",
      "content": "You can’t please everyone, and that’s okay. Remind yourself that you have control over your thoughts and feelings. If someone criticizes you or makes a judgmental comment, redirect your thoughts and energy to challenging their statement. Chances are, your feelings will match up with your attitude. [3] X Research source For example, if someone makes a negative comment about your outfit, think to yourself, “I look great in this outfit” or “They have no idea what they’re talking about.” At the end of the day, your thoughts and opinions about your appearance are the only ones that matter."

      "content": "Jot down the aspects of your appearance that you like. Each day, write down what parts of your appearance you’re thankful for, even if they’re insignificant. Writing down your strengths might help you feel a lot more positive and proud of your appearance. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For instance, write something like “I’m grateful for my long arms, which can stretch and reach almost anything.” Write down other things you’re grateful for, even if they aren’t related to your appearance."

Hold onto a few positive affirmations to help ground yourself, so you can feel positive and proud of your appearance. [5] X Research source You can say something like, “I am allowed to take up space” or “My body radiates beauty and strength.” You might also say something like, “My body will carry me where I want to go” or “I deserve to feel comfortable and confident.”"

      "content": "Stop and question negative thoughts instead of accepting them as true. Often, we think negatively about ourselves without even realizing it. If you catch yourself thinking something like, “I’m so ugly,” challenge it. Ask yourself, “Why do I think that?” “Do I have any proof?” The more often you challenge these thoughts, the easier it will be to get rid of them."

      "content": "Talk to yourself like you’d talk to a loved one. Oftentimes, we’re much more critical of ourselves than we are of others. If you catch yourself thinking badly about your appearance, ask yourself if you’d talk to a friend that way. Then, adjust your thinking until you’d be comfortable telling a friend the same things you tell yourself. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, you’d never tell a friend, “You look so ugly today.” Instead, change it into a kindness by thinking, “Even though I’m not wearing makeup, my skin still looks really good.”"

      "content": "Skip over the tight, uncomfortable clothes in your closet or wardrobe. If you’re wearing clothes that don’t fit quite right or make you uncomfortable, you probably aren’t going to feel great about your appearance for the day. Instead, pick an outfit that really suits your body type —this way, you can feel confident, comfortable, and proud throughout the day. For instance, you might wear a pair of jeggings instead of a tight pair of skinny jeans. You might switch out a comfortable T-shirt instead of a cramped polo shirt. It’s okay if you don’t feel confident at first! There’s nothing wrong with having a “fake it until you make it” attitude. [9] X Research source"

Instead of trying to lose weight or meet a certain beauty standard, just focus on eating healthy, balanced meals and exercising a few times per week. When you feel good, you look good, too! [10] X Research source Everyone’s diet is slightly different, and the same meal plan won’t work for everyone. In general, try to eat 3 balanced meals per day with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Aim for getting 30 minutes of exercise per day, 5 days a week. You could try jogging, swimming, jumping rope, weight training, or cycling as a fun way to stay healthy.

      "content": "Resist the urge to weigh yourself every day. Believe it or not, your actual weight can shift between 4 and 6 lb (1.8 and 2.7 kg) throughout the day, depending on when you weigh yourself. Besides, your weight is just a number—it doesn’t define your beauty, worth, or appearance. If needed, step on the scale once a week to get idea of where you’re at, instead of checking religiously each day. You might feel better if you throw out your scale altogether."
