      "title": "Conduct research into piercings.",
      "content": "Conduct research into piercings. The very first step in convincing your parents to let you get a piercing, is to know exactly what piercing you want. Some of the more popular piercings are ear, belly-button, lip, and/or tongue. Each of these piercings comes in different shapes, sizes, and colors. Lists can be found online, or at a nearby piercing facility. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source [3] X Research source For example, if you were to get a piercing in your ear, there are about 10-15 different places on your ear where the piercing could be located. This includes the lobe, tragus, inner conch, etc. Know exactly what type of piercing you want, and where you want it located. In terms of jewelry, you might want a barbell, a closed circle, an open circle, a plug, a flesh tunnel, etc. Don't: start with a large or unusual piercing your parents are unlikely to allow. Do: consider piercings you've seen on your parents or their friends."

      "content": "Find a high-quality piercing facility. Use phone books, or advertisement lists online to find a nearby facility. Look for ratings as given by customers, usually on a \"5 Star\" scale. Facilities that have lower than 4 stars should not even be considered. After you find one, go to the place in person to check it out. Note the cleanliness of the facility, and the attitude of the workers. Ask some customers in the store about their past experiences there, and write them down. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask your friends about their experiences with piercings.",
      "content": "Ask your friends about their experiences with piercings. Some of your friends have likely had experiences, either getting piercings, and/or having to convince their parents to get a piercing. They will be able to give you first hand knowledge about pain levels involved with the piercing, their preferences when it comes to jewelry, and where they have gone to get a piercing before. Make sure to write this information down on a sheet of paper. You will want to add tidbits of what they had to say to your argument later on. Don't: mention a friend your parents consider a \"bad influence.\" Do: relay the facts you've learned from these conversations."

    {
      "title": "Write down why getting the piercing is important to you.",
      "content": "Write down why getting the piercing is important to you. Using clear and concise language, create a list of main reasons you feel you need and want a piercing. They can range from the mundane, to the very serious. Acknowledge both aesthetic (jewelry is pretty) and emotional (makes me feel good inside) reasons. After you have created a list, cross off anything that might be off-putting to your parents, and those which are not that important. Form those thoughts into coherent sentences, with nouns, adjectives, and verbs. [5] X Research source For example: I want a black plug on my earlobe. This is because it is a beautiful addition and makes me feel more independent as a person."

      "content": "Practice reciting your argument. You can do this in front of a mirror, or in front of some of your friends. Try to memorize as much of the argument as you can so that it seems more convincing to your parents. Use a forceful, yet non-confrontational tone, when using specific words and/or points. Rather than just memorizing a script, add in additional phrases as you practice. Make the argument sound as convincing as possible. Practice at least 3-4 times."

Pamphlets and brochures concerning piercings. Medical statistics that cite the rate of infections among pierced individuals. The idea is to be more prepared than you have to be. If your parents have a question or inquiry, you want the information either in your head or at your fingertips. [6] X Research source Note, you do not want to present medical statistics that run contrary to your argument. If you find that all the medical statistics are negative for a particular piercing, you should perhaps get it somewhere else."

      "content": "Wait until you know the time is right. Your parents should be in a good mood when you sit them down. You will also want some time to yourself. Think about the research you have conducted. A rash or ill-advised decision is almost never a good one. Waiting an extra week, month, or year can give you time to prepare and think about what you are about to do. [7] X Research source If you notice that they are yelling a lot, do not confront them yet. If they are dealing with a traumatic problem themselves, do not overburden them."

Leaving notes is not as good as initially confronting your parents to let them know you want to talk. Set a time and day with them. You do not want to bombard them with information, but rather, set aside a particular time in which serious discussion can take place. [8] X Research source [9] X Research source Don't: mention the piercing yet. Give them time to wonder what it's about, and most parents will end up relieved. Do: say \"I want to talk to you about something serious. It's nothing bad, but it is important.\""

You also want to make sure your phones are off and put away. The T.V. should also not be on, which can be a major distraction as well. Make sure that you and your parents are seated close together so the talk isn't awkward. You might want pillows around, which can feel better when you sit down. You want yourself, and your parents to be as comfortable as possible."

This is a great way to break the ice, and show your parents what you have achieved. This will ease the conversation into something more controversial like getting a piercing. After you have your parents warmed up, and reminded of your good deeds, they may be more receptive to what you are about to ask of them. List all the A's and B's you have received recently in school. Tell them about the book reports you have written. Tell them that you are helping other kids with their schoolwork as well. Volunteer activities, such as at a blood drive, or cleaning a road, show your parents that you are a responsible young adult. Don't: go on for more than a few sentences, which can sound suspicious. Do: move on if your parents ask what this is about."

State your argument, give evidence, and then repeat your argument again. [10] X Research source Don't: talk over your parents or patronize them.

Crying, weeping, and/or frowning shows your parents that you are unable to handle your emotions and, therefore, not mature enough to get a piercing. You want to be calm, cool, and collected.

Every time they ask a question, have a clear response ready. If your parents sense weakness, or a lack of research, they will seriously doubt your readiness to get a piercing. If you do not know an answer, you should refer them to specific websites where they can find the answer they are looking for. Do not leave them wondering, with doubt in their minds.

You can even let your parents talk to some of the customers there to get their comments about the facility and it's level of professionalism. [14] X Research source"

However, don't let this get you down. Always remind them throughout the following days and weeks that a piercing is still important to you. Write them notes, perhaps better explaining your arguments. You can even schedule more serious talks in the future, and engage in further open dialogue with your parents. [16] X Research source Don't: bring up piercings when your parents are in a bad mood.

Make sure you have enough to cover the piercing and the piece of jewelry you want. Tell your parents that you are willing to pay for part of, or the whole procedure out of pocket.

Volunteer to take out the trash, or pick up your brother from his soccer game. Spend more time with the family at game night, and/or go out to dinner with them. Be a real part of the family and show them you are taking on responsibility. They might then reciprocate, and reward you for your newfound level of maturation and standing.
