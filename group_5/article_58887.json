      "title": "Look for bleeding that starts a few days before your expected period.",
      "content": "Look for bleeding that starts a few days before your expected period. Implantation bleeding typically happens around 6-12 days after you conceive. Usually, this means that any bleeding will happen within 1 week of the expected date of your next period . [1] X Research source Any bleeding that happens before or after that window of time is less likely to be implantation bleeding, but it’s not impossible. The time it takes for implantation to occur can vary."

      "content": "Check for a light pink or brown color. Menstrual bleeding may start out brown or light pink, but it typically progresses to a bright or dark red flow within a day or so. Implantation bleeding typically stays brown or pink, however. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that implantation bleeding doesn’t look the same for all women, though. In some cases, you may experience brighter blood that looks more like the early part of your menstrual flow. If you do experience bright red bleeding and you know or suspect that you are pregnant, see a doctor as soon as possible. They can help you identify or rule out any serious causes for your bleeding."

      "content": "Expect the bleeding to last no more than 3 days.
