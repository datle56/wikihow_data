      "title": "The crown of life is the heavenly reward we receive in the afterlife.",
      "content": "The crown of life is the heavenly reward we receive in the afterlife. The phrase “crown of life” appears twice in the Bible, in James 1:12 and Revelations 2:10. In both passages, the crown is said to be a reward for anyone who “perseveres under trial” and remains faithful to the Lord. [1] X Research source What that reward is isn’t specifically mentioned, but Rev 2:10 suggests it’s eternal life with God in heaven. Revelations 2:26-27 also suggests that these crowns come with some heavenly authority, and that we’ll join Christ on his throne in heaven. [2] X Research source Some scholars say that the reward may also come while we’re still alive on earth, and that our reward is the satisfaction of a complete, full life. [3] X Research source Others suggest that the crown is a reference to a laurel that victorious athletes would receive after a competition in Jesus’ time."

      "content": "The crown of life encourages us to remain steadfast in faith. Life isn’t always easy, and living a life of faith certainly isn’t a walk in the park. But God offers us the “crown of life” as a promise that if we persevere through the everyday trials, big and small, we’ll be rewarded at the finish line. The crown of life is a call to action, and a gold medal waiting for us at the end of the race."

      "title": "Crown of victory",
      "content": "Crown of victory 1 Corinthians 9: 25 says, “Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.” [4] X Research source Here, “the games” refers to a race, or life. Others may receive material rewards for running, but believers are to receive an eternal reward in heaven. This crown may be the very same “crown of life” mentioned in James 1:12 and Rev 2:10. Indeed, each of these crowns may very well be a different name for, or aspect of, our ultimate reward—life in heaven."

      "title": "Crown of rejoicing",
      "content": "Crown of rejoicing 1 Thessalonians 19-20 says, “For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you? Indeed, you are our glory and joy.” [5] X Research source Here, Paul tells the Thessalonians that, as siblings in Christ, we must support and celebrate each other until the coming of Christ, when we’ll receive our eternal reward. In the meantime, part of our earthly reward is simply the joy of one another’s company, and sharing this life with one another."

      "content": "Crown of righteousness 2 Timothy 4:8 says, “Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.” [6] X Research source This crown reminds us that we’re justified and righteous in our devotion, and our hope for eternal life is not in vain."

      "title": "Crown of glory",
      "content": "Crown of glory 1 Peter 5:4 says, “And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.” [7] X Research source This passage encourages us all to be shepherds awaiting the coming of the “Chief Shepherd,” or Jesus. While we wait, we’re encouraged to help our fellow believers in their journeys of faith, and to welcome any newcomers wanting to explore their own faith."

      "title": "Pray every day to strengthen your faith.",
      "content": "Pray every day to strengthen your faith. Daily prayer is like doing pushups to build your spiritual muscles—your faith! Philippians 4:6-7 says that if we bring our concerns to God through prayer, “the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” [8] X Research source Start by saying a decade of the rosary each day to deepen your relationship with God, then add another decade week by week, until you’re saying a full rosary! Founder of Bible Women Speak Olivia Woodford says, “prayer is the foundation for any religious practice, any relationship with the divine, our connection to our soul, and spirit? I think it all begins with prayer.”"

      "title": "Remember that eternal salvation awaits you in heaven.",
      "content": "Remember that eternal salvation awaits you in heaven. God never promised that faith would be easy. James tells us in 1:2-3 that faith requires perseverance. [9] X Research source We’ll be tested and tried in many ways, but so long as we remind ourselves that believing and loving God is its own reward, we’ll always pull through, with God himself by our side. Any time you feel tempted or even persecuted, think, “This is just one of my trials, and if I make it through this trial, I’ll find joy and fulfillment on the other side.”"

      "title": "Spend time with your religious community, and encourage others.",
      "content": "Spend time with your religious community, and encourage others. We’re not in this alone! Jesus established the church so that we might all find a place among his flock, and unite as a community of believers on a strong foundation of community. [10] X Research source Attend mass, but also attend other events at your church, like Bible groups or other clubs, to get to know your fellow believers. Living a life of faith is much easier when you have a group of allies with you to cheer you on."

      "title": "Reach out to your local community to spread rewards on earth.",
      "content": "Reach out to your local community to spread rewards on earth. 1 Peter 5:4 calls us all to be shepherds on earth until God himself comes to shepherd us into heaven. One great way to do just that is to volunteer in your community , and to serve others. When you lead by example, other people are more likely to find and foster their own faith, and earn their own crowns. For example, volunteer at your local soup kitchen or homeless shelter, or even just spend some time cleaning up litter at your local park."

      "title": "The Tribulation",
      "content": "The Tribulation This is a period of hardship that will come in the end of days, where all believers on earth will be put to the ultimate test of faith. But we must not fear, for Revelations 2:7 says, “To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” [11] X Research source We’re promised rewards in heaven that will far outweigh any suffering on earth."

      "title": "The Church of Smyrna",
      "content": "The Church of Smyrna In Revelations, John writes all that God revealed to him about the end of days. In particular, he writes to a handful of churches around the world, and predicts the hardships coming their way. The Church of Smyrna was a community in Asia Minor, and Paul wrote to them: “The devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.” [12] X Research source The other churches are the Church in Ephesus, in Pergamum, and in Thyatira. Each received a message of warning and encouragement."

      "content": "The Second Death Revelations 20:6 says, “Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.” The second death is the fate of unbelievers that comes after their earthly death. In other words, the second death refers to hell. [13] X Research source This, too, is a reminder to stay devout and chaste in order to avoid the second death and be rewarded with the crown of life."
