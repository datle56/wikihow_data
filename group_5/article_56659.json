While you don’t always have to be around them, you don’t have to leave as soon as they walk into the room.

Or, maybe they don't like it when you're on your phone at the dinner table. Once you've talked about it, your sibling could agree to wait until you're done in the kitchen before cooking dinner. Communicate with them and devise appropriate solutions. Try to open up the conversation as calmly as possible to see if things can be ironed out."
