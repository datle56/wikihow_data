Be sure to test your cleaning solution on discrete areas of your carpets and furniture. [5] X Research source Steam cleaning kills adult fleas and larvae, but some eggs will survive. It can take as long as 3 to 4 months for eggs to hatch, so continue to vacuum daily. Consider steaming your home every 1 to 2 months until you've brought the infestation to an end."

      "title": "Try using dehumidifiers to control moisture levels.",
      "content": "Try using dehumidifiers to control moisture levels. Flea eggs need humidity levels of at least 50% in order to develop and hatch. You could use a humidity monitor and dehumidifiers to make your home less hospitable for fleas. Keep in mind you'll still need to vacuum, wash bedding, and take other steps to control an infestation. The number of dehumidifiers you'll need depends on your home's size and layout. A medium-sized dehumidifier removes 40 US pints (19 L) of water from the air in 24 hours. This size is recommended for areas up to 1,500 square feet (140 m 2 )."

      "title": "Use flea traps to monitor your progress.",
      "content": "Use flea traps to monitor your progress. Flea traps are composed of strips of sticky paper or bowls of water that sit under a light bulb. Heat from the light attracts fleas, which get stuck on the paper or in the water. As you take steps to manage the infestation, you should start to catch gradually fewer fleas in your traps. [6] X Research source If 1 to 2 months pass and the number of fleas in your trap remains the same, it's time to call a professional. Flea traps are a good way to keep tabs on the infestation's severity, but they only catch adult fleas. They won't eliminate an infestation on their own."

      "content": "Try spraying your pet with a citrus solution. Slice a lemon thinly, and add it to pot filled with 1 US pint (470 mL) of water. Bring it just to a boil, then remove it from heat, cover it, and let it sit overnight. Strain the liquid into a spray bottle, then spritz your pet and massage the solution into its fur. You could also purchase a citrus pet spray online or at a pet store. Citrus can deter fleas for up to 24 hours, but daily applications could irritate your pet's skin. Try spraying every 3 or 4 days, and gradually spray more frequently if there are no signs of skin irritation. Avoid spraying near your pet's face. Discontinue use if you notice red or dry skin, or if your pet scratches itself persistently. It's always best to consult your pet's vet before treating it with a home remedy."
