Draw out a rectangle (it doesn’t have to match the proportions given, just a rectangle shape will do) and mark out a diagonal line to create 2 triangles. [1] X Research source You’ll be able to see the 2 triangles that make up the rectangle now."

      "content": "Assign 2 sides of the triangle as a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} . Pick one of the triangles that you’ve created in your rectangle to work with. Assign one side as a {\\displaystyle a} and the other side as b {\\displaystyle b} . [2] X Research source Make sure that you know either the length or width value as well as the diagonal value to solve your equation. If you were working with a square, you could assign both sides of the triangle as a {\\displaystyle a} since they are both the same. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem because you’re working with a right angle triangle."

In this instance, the height and width of the triangle are a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} , while c {\\displaystyle c} is the diagonal. [3] X Research source Let’s say the diagonal is 10 inches and the length is 8 inches. The equation would look like this: a 2 + 8 2 = 10 2 {\\displaystyle a^{2}+8^{2}=10^{2}} ."

Now that you’ve used the Pythagorean Theorem to find the second side length, you can solve for the area. [5] X Research source Don’t forget your units! [6] X Research source For example: A = 8 × 6 {\\displaystyle A=8\\times 6} . A = 48 i n 2 {\\displaystyle A=48\\ in^{2}} . Area is always in units squared."

Draw a simple rectangle with a ruler and create a diagonal line across it to make 2 triangles.
