      "content": "1ps stands for 1 picosecond. The abbreviation “ps” means picosecond, or 1/10 12 (1 trillionth) of a second. In the programming language Verilog, 1ps is a unit for the `timescale compiler directive, which sets the default unit of time for a simulation and the resolution to which outputs are rounded. [1] X Research source The units are seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), microseconds (us), nanoseconds (ns), picoseconds (ps), and femtoseconds (fs)."

When choosing your units, always put the larger one first. The general time scale must be divisible by the resolution. [2] X Research source The first unit is how time is measured, and the second is how precise your recordings are. [3] X Research source The ` symbol, or backtick, lets the program know that you’re using a compiler directive. It introduces the `timescale directive, as well as `include, `resetall, `define, and others. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source By adding an integer you can control how much time makes up a single unit or how many units go into the resolution. For example, if you write the directive `timescale 10ns / 1ns, then for every 10 nanoseconds the output value will be rounded to the nearest nanosecond. [6] X Research source A common timescale is 1ns / 1ps, which means at each nanosecond there is an output rounded to the nearest picosecond."

[8] X Research source For example, you could write #5 $display (“T=%0t At time #5”, $realtime); val<=1; If your `timescale is 1ns/1ns, then your output would be 1(ns) * 5 = 5 since it’s rounded to the nearest nanosecond. If your `timescale was 10ns/1ns, then your output would be 10(ns) * 5 = 50. If your `timescale was 1ns/1ps, then your output would be 1000ps (AKA 1ns) * 5 = 5000 to convert it to picoseconds."
