      "title": "Select a medium-textured mulch.",
      "content": "Select a medium-textured mulch. Fine textured mulch gets compacted and will starve your tree's roots of oxygen, while coarse mulch is too porous to maintain adequate water levels. A medium-textured mulch will hold water and won't starve the tree's roots of oxygen making it the perfect choice for use around your tree. [1] X Research source Organic mulches include wood chips, bark, pine needles, leaves, and compost mixes. If you're unsure how much mulch you'll need, type \"mulch calculator\" into a search engine to find online tools to help you calculate the amount."

      "content": "Spread mulch in a 4–5 ft (1.2–1.5 m) diameter around the tree. Apply a thin layer of mulch around the tree, not touching the tree itself. Leave 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of space between the base of the tree and the mulch. [2] X Research source Remove any existing mulch , if necessary, by shoveling or spading it away. Avoid creating a “mulch volcano” (pile of mulch around the tree’s base), as it will cut off your beautiful tree’s access to the oxygen it needs to thrive. Mulch stops serving a purpose after covering up to a 8 feet (2.4 m) diameter around the tree."

      "content": "Create a mulch-bed barrier with stones or extra mulch if desired. Pile about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of extra mulch around the edges of your mulch bed to create a barrier that will prevent your freshly laid mulch from washing away when it rains. Placing rocks around the mulch bed is another effective and stylish way to create a barrier as well. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull or kill weeds that grow out of the mulch.",
      "content": "Pull or kill weeds that grow out of the mulch. Mulch acts as a barrier for weeds and grass. Pull any weeds or grass that begin to grow out of the mulch bed throughout the year to prevent future growth and disruption of your tree’s root system. [5] X Research source Apply herbicide , (chemical weed killer) around your tree to prevent grass and weeds from growing in your beautiful new mulch. If you use an herbicide, ensure it's safe around trees."

      "content": "Rake the mulch to prevent it from getting packed down. Compacted mulch prevents oxygen from passing through, will starve your tree's roots, and often occurs due to excessive rainfall or people walking over it. Loosen compacted mulch by raking it. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Shovel away old mulch, dirt, and rocks. Shovel away all the old mulch, debris, and rocks so that the tree trunk is visible. A \"mulch volcano” occurs when mulch gets piled up year after year around the base of a tree. This is detrimental, as it starves the roots of necessary oxygen. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove girdling roots with a girdling chisel and mallet . If you notice any roots growing upward around the tree as you clear away old mulch, remove 1-2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the root where it contacts the tree trunk. Position your girdling chisel at the desired cut point and use your mallet to pound the shear into the root. [9] X Research source Removing girdling roots will ensure that these roots do not reconnect and cause problems later down the line. Girdling roots (roots visible around the tree's base) indicate that the tree is starved for oxygen and will wrap around the tree's base and kill it over time."

Once you shovel away the excess mulch, dirt, and rocks, you’ll see the primary root flare around the tree's base. [10] X Research source Mulch will act as a natural weed barrier. Avoid using roll-out weed barriers, also known as landscaping fabric, as these will starve the tree of oxygen and compact the soil underneath them. [11] X Research source"
