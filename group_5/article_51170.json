[3] X Research source You can obtain a Bowgart by breeding two monsters that make up the Plant, Water, and Cold elements. Examples of monster pairings that can successfully breed the Bowgart are Potbelly + Maw, Mammott + Oaktopus, and Toe Jammer + Furcorn. Alternately, you can purchase the Bowgart from the Market for 50 diamonds."

The breeding period for the Shugabush lasts 35 hours. After the breeding period has ended, the Shugabush egg will be relocated to the Nursery and ready to hatch. [5] X Research source Note: The Shugabush is a legendary monster which makes it hard to obtain. You will likely have to retry several times before you get a Shugabush through breeding. To increase your chances, you can purchase Wishing Torches from Structures and have your friends visit your island and light them. You can also light them yourself for 2 diamonds. Alternatively, you can purchase a Shugabush for 200 diamonds from the Market if you don't feel like breeding and waiting for a Shugabush."
