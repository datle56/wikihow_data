If you want to edit this name or add an additional name (such as a nickname or preferred name), do so in these fields. Name pronunciation: Phonetic pronunciation of your name. This can only be added with the LinkedIn mobile app. Pronouns: You can select he/him, she/her, or they/them from the dropdown. You can also select \"custom\" if your pronouns aren't listed.

Leima says to keep the \"About\" section short and sweet. \"Avoid the boilerplate phrasing of the automatically-produced LinkedIn summary that it churns out for you, as this often doesn’t make much sense,\" she says. \"For example, the fact that you have a 'demonstrated history of working in the automotive industry' will be abundantly obvious from the briefest glance at the rest of your profile, so you don’t need to waste space by including it in your summary.\" [3] X Expert Source Amber Leima Resumé Consultant Expert Interview. 18 March 2022. Canalichio says that your \"About\" summary should explain who you are, what you do, what your mission is, and what qualifications you have to back that up. \"If you put yourself in the shoes of the reader and think about what you would want to hear, what would that look like?\" he says. \"...I'm guessing it's something around the idea of 'Oh, I want to know all about this guy beyond just his name and his title.'\" [4] X Expert Source Pete Canalichio Brand Strategist & Licensing Expert Expert Interview. 2 February 2023."

      "content": "Fill out additional sections as needed. While \"Education\" and \"Experience\" are two of the most important sections to fill out, you should fill out as much information as possible in the following sections if it applies to you: Projects: If you worked on a project at your current/previous job, include it here. If you have a link to the project, you can add it to this section so other LinkedIn users can look at it as well. Skills: Fill out this section with as many skills as you can think of. These skills can help match you to job postings if you are looking for a job, and they give hiring employers a quick overview of what you can do. Leima agrees that the \"Skills\" section is incredibly important for LinkedIn profiles, especially if you're seeking a new job. \"Make sure your 'Skills' section is up to date with all the skills you have that relate to your current or desired field of employment. The more, the better, as long as they’re specific—and, of course, true,\" she says. [5] X Expert Source Amber Leima Resumé Consultant Expert Interview. 18 March 2022. Publications: If you've worked in a job where you were published (i.e., news articles as a journalist, research papers as a scientist, etc.), you should add them to this section of your LinkedIn profile, especially if you want to work in a career where you'll be publishing some writing in the future. Courses: Most employers aren't asking for college transcripts, but you might want to add to your profile that you've taken a certain class. This is a good spot to put classes you've taken for certifications if your career requires them. According to Leima, adding relevant coursework to LinkedIn is a great way to display this information without cluttering your paper resume. \"While adding coursework to your paper resume would usually add too much bulk, you can use LinkedIn to easily provide links to as much documentation as you see fit,\" she says. [6] X Expert Source Amber Leima Resumé Consultant Expert Interview. 18 March 2022. Languages: If you speak more than one language, that makes you even more attractive to potential employers. List all the languages you speak and the level at which you speak them. You can include your native language if you wish, but it's usually unnecessary."
