      "content": "Locate Calcelmo’s Stone. The stone can be found in Calcelmo’s Museum, which is inside the Undertone Keep in Markarth. Markarth is located in the southwest corner of Skyrim. Once inside Calcelmo’s Museum you will be able to access Calcelmo’s Tower, which is where the stone is located. Inside the tower you will find a study room containing the large stone with engravings on it. The stone is a large rectangular slab which has designs on the top of it with a face in the middle of these designs. Below this is some small writing which is what you will be copying to paper."
