      "content": "Gain weight by eating more calories than your body burns. Regardless of your metabolic rate, you're not going to gain weight unless you're consuming more calories than your body needs to function. This is one of the reasons why knowing your BMR is extremely important. Without that number, you have no way of knowing how many calories you should be eating on a daily basis if you want to gain weight. [2] X Research source Certified nutritionist John Burson notes that \"foods high in refined or processed sugar, saturated fat, and simple carbohydrates\" tend to slow down your metabolism. At the same time, these foods often aren't your healthiest options (think candy bars and sugary soft drinks), so you should still consume these foods sparingly. Instead, focus on foods that are rich in carbs, such as rice, bread, and pasta, along with foods high in fat and protein, such as red meat, salmon or oily fish, and higher-fat dairy products. Meats that are higher in fat, such as steak, pot roast, pork chops, and chicken or turkey thighs are also good choices if you're trying to gain weight.

      "content": "Use high-calorie drinks, sauces, and spreads to add calories. High-calorie drinks, spreads, and sauces are a great way to add a few calories to your meal. This is especially helpful if you're someone who doesn't have much of an appetite or feels full quickly because they're not going to weigh down your meal. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you might have a glass of whole milk with dinner instead of water. Milk is a much better choice than soft drinks or even juice because it's a rich source of protein. Studies show that a higher intake of protein promotes more efficient weight gain, compared to a standard or lower intake. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Make high-calorie smoothies. You can easily pack 500 calories or more in a smoothie by using ingredients such as bananas or other dense fruit, peanut butter, full-fat Greek yogurt, oatmeal, protein powder, or nuts and seeds. Drinking a smoothie can be much easier than eating a meal, and the body can absorb more calories from the foods blended in smoothie form. [6] X Research source A research study also found that consuming a pureed meal results in a significantly lower thermic effect of food (TEF) than consuming the same meal in solid form. [7] X Research source You might also add condiments that are high-calorie and rich in healthy fats, such as avocado, chopped nuts or seeds, olive oil, shredded cheese, or hummus. As a general rule, think about adding a total of 300 to 500 calories a day to what you normally eat. This will help you gain weight in a healthy way. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Be prepared to eat even when you're not hungry. If you struggle with appetite, the idea of sitting down for a huge meal might sound like torture. But having 5 or 6 meals a day (instead of the usual 3) gives you more opportunities to get those calories in. [9] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Even if you're not hungry, having a few bites of something will at least feed your body a few more calories, which you'll need if you're looking to gain weight. If a lot of small meals aren't feasible for you, try eating slightly larger servings of each thing on your plate during regular meals. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Nuts and seeds tend to have the most calories per ounce. High-calorie snacks between meals will certainly help you gain weight. But you don't want to just eat junk food! High-calorie foods that are also rich in protein, such as nuts and seeds, can help you gain weight healthily. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Nut butters are also a good choice! For example, you might have a peanut butter sandwich or peanut butter crackers for a snack. Eggs and Greek yogurt are also good snacks. For example, you could make deviled eggs or mix a handful of nuts and seeds into a cup of Greek yogurt."

When you drink water or other beverages within a half hour of eating, they can make you feel full. The result? You'll end up eating less food and won't get the calories you need.

[14] X Research source It's not uncommon to lose a lot of weight in the aftermath of an extremely stressful event, such as a divorce or job loss. Often, your weight will return to normal once the stress eases up—but that doesn't always happen.

      "content": "Exercise that's too intense burns too many calories. Many people who are trying to gain weight are afraid to exercise because they believe it will cause them to lose weight—and that can happen. The key is to avoid intense exercise sessions in favor of low- to moderate-intensity exercise that keeps you healthy and physically fit without impacting your metabolic rate too much. [17] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source For example, you might try yoga for strength training and go for a walk for 30 minutes each day.

[19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Stick to coffee in the mornings, if you must—avoid it in the afternoon or evening, especially close to bedtime.

      "content": "Burn fewer calories by living a more sedentary life. You've probably heard that a good way to lose weight is to squeeze activity into your daily life, such as by taking the stairs instead of an elevator. Being more active increases your metabolism a bit and causes your body to burn more calories for energy. But if you're looking to gain weight, go ahead and take that elevator! A little less activity can help lower your metabolism. [21] X Research source At the same time, you do want to stay healthy, and being active is a great way to do that. So while you don't necessarily want to lay on the couch all day, it's always good to take shortcuts where you can if you're trying to lower your metabolism and gain weight. For example, you might drive to a store that's less than a mile away instead of walking, then search for a parking place as close to the entrance as possible. Try to control fidgeting. Making these small, nervous movements burns an extra 40-60 calories per hour. [22] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have a job where you're on your feet a lot, this can also cause you to burn more calories and have a higher metabolic rate than someone who spends most of their workday sitting at a desk.

      "content": "Dress so that you aren't cold but also not overheated. When you're slightly cold, your body has to burn more calories to stay warm. But if you're too hot, on the other hand, your body temperature will rise, and that will also increase your metabolism because of Q10 effects. [24] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source What you need is a happy medium where you're neither too cold nor too hot, which will keep your metabolic rate as low as possible. [25] X Research source This is especially important while you're sleeping. Make sure you have several layers of light blankets on your bed so you can adjust as necessary. When you're out and about during the day, wearing several layers will help you control your body temperature inside and outside without expending too much energy."

      "content": "During sleep, your metabolism decreases by around 15%. Getting enough quality sleep is essential for your overall health, but it's even more important if you're trying to gain weight. If you don't get enough sleep, your appetite and metabolism might be disrupted. [26] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have a sleeping disorder that negatively affects your sleep, talk to your doctor. Medications and assistive devices might help you get more restful sleep. Practice good sleep hygiene by going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Do something relaxing for about an hour before you fall asleep. Reading a book or taking a warm bath or shower will also help your body slow down and prepare for sleep."

      "title": "Take advantage of lower sleeping metabolism through quick naps.",
      "content": "Take advantage of lower sleeping metabolism through quick naps. When you're sleeping, your metabolism is about as close to your BMR as it can get. This means if you have the opportunity to take a short nap (under 30 minutes) or two over the course of the day, you could lower your overall average metabolic rate for the day. [27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even if you're not a napper, simply relaxing and doing something passive, such as watching TV or reading a book, can lower your energy expenditure a bit (though maybe not as much as when you're sleeping). Keep in mind that there's not necessarily a rule that says you have to get all the sleep you need at one go either. If you have trouble sleeping at night for an extended period, a couple of naps throughout the day might help you ensure you're getting as much sleep as you need."

      "title": "Talk to your doctor if you think your metabolic rate is abnormally high.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor if you think your metabolic rate is abnormally high. Because metabolic disorders share symptoms with other disorders and conditions, specific medical testing is required. One of the most common hormonal disorders that raises your metabolism is hyperthyroidism, which can easily be checked for with a blood test to measure thyroid hormone levels. Your doctor will request tests to determine your basal or resting metabolic rate and order further tests if it's significantly high. [28] X Research source Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) reflects the amount of energy your body needs to perform its basic functions. This makes up anywhere from 50 to 80% of the energy your body uses on a daily basis and you can't really adjust this up or down very much. Genetic disorders can also cause abnormally high metabolic rates. These disorders are usually manageable under medical supervision."

These drugs can boost your appetite so that you'll be hungry more often and eat more food. They're typically prescribed if you're recovering from a recent health crisis, such as cancer, that causes a loss of appetite.

      "content": "Nicotine can raise your metabolism. If you're trying to decrease your metabolism, smoking or vaping won't do you any favors. When you quit feeding your body nicotine, your metabolism will typically lower quite a bit—this is one of the reasons many smokers gain weight after they quit. [31] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that it's not the act of quitting smoking that causes you to gain weight. It's because you continue to eat the same as you did before you quit, when you had a higher metabolism."
