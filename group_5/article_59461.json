    {
      "title": "Signal that you’re interested and use the name they give you.",
      "content": "Signal that you’re interested and use the name they give you. If they say, “Hello, this is Coach Williams,” use “Hello Coach Williams!” If they give you a first name, use that. Include the exclamation point to signal that you’re excited to speak with them. [1] X Research source You can use “Hey Coach,” if you’ve had conversations with them before. If you haven’t spoken with them though, not using their name may come off a little too familiar, though. The fact that they’re texting you likely means they’re interested in bringing you aboard, so relax! The fact that you’re in this situation is a good thing."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you come off as disinterested, they might get the wrong idea.",
      "content": "If you come off as disinterested, they might get the wrong idea. Throw in a comment about how happy you are to be connecting. Remember, it’s hard to communicate tone over text, so be positive, upbeat, and thankful. You might say: “I’m glad we’re getting the opportunity to talk!” “I’m happy you reached out!” “It’s really great to hear from you!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "They want to see if you’re a fit for their team, so show them you’re in.",
      "content": "They want to see if you’re a fit for their team, so show them you’re in. If they’re in the process of recruiting you, this is a little reminder that you’re on board and excited about the team—it shows that it isn’t all about you. Even if you’re playing an individual sport, it’s important that the coach knows you’ll have pride and investment in the athletic program and school as a whole. You might say something like: “I can’t wait to visit and get a chance to meet in person!” “I’ve been following the Wildcats closely this year, and I can see you’re building something special. I’ve really enjoyed watching the team play.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If they ask how you’re doing, tie it into your progress or accomplishments.",
      "content": "If they ask how you’re doing, tie it into your progress or accomplishments. It might seem like small talk when they ask, “How are you doing?” but they really do want to know what’s going on. This is your opportunity to brag a bit and play up the work you’re doing. This is also an opportunity to showcase your value as a player and student. [2] X Research source You could say: “It’s going well. I’ve been hitting the weights pretty hard, and I think we’ve got a real chance at the championship this year.” “I’m doing great! I made the honor roll last quarter, which was exciting, and we won our last two games which puts us in a good spot for the playoffs.” “I’m wonderful. This has really been a great year all around. School is going well, and I’m pitching better than I ever have. I even threw a no-hitter last month!”"

      "title": "The coach may have questions, so answer them kindly and maturely.",
      "content": "The coach may have questions, so answer them kindly and maturely. Coaches reach out to prospects for all kinds of reasons. If they’re texting you, it most likely means they’re interested in bringing you on board. They may be checking to make sure your grades are good enough to get in, checking your interest in the school, or probing to see if you’ve got the right personality for their team. Be honest, mature, and friendly as you answer. [3] X Research source If they ask about your grades you might say, “It’s going pretty well. I’ve got a 3.2 GPA and I take the SAT next month. I’ve scored pretty high on the practice exams, so I’m confident.” If they ask you whether you’re interested in playing for them, remember that a verbal commitment does not “lock you in” to going there. It’s a symbolic thing on your end, so feel free to say you’re interested if they ask! [4] X Research source You're going to need a really good relationship with the team coach if you wish to end up being recruited."

    {
      "title": "If they offer to answer your questions, go ahead and ask if they’re relevant.",
      "content": "If they offer to answer your questions, go ahead and ask if they’re relevant. This isn’t the time to ask about the university’s liberal arts curriculum, but if you have a specific question for the coach and they offer to answer questions, go ahead and ask. You could ask them about whether you can visit, or come out to see a practice and meet the coaches. It’s also totally fine to have no questions, as well. [5] X Research source You could say, “I am wondering when I’d be able to come out for a visit? I’d love to see the facilities in person.” Don’t outright ask about whether you’re going to be offered a scholarship."
    },
    {
      "title": "This is a professional relationship, so avoid overdoing it.",
      "content": "This is a professional relationship, so avoid overdoing it. Less is more here. Don’t feel compelled to write out massive explanations or answers. The coach probably isn’t looking for any huge walls of text. Avoid commenting on anything going on in your personal life, as well. Questions like, “Will my girlfriend/boyfriend be able to come out with me to see a game?” kind of signals that you don’t understand the focus of the conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "You may be used to texting shorthand, but the coach isn’t.",
      "content": "You may be used to texting shorthand, but the coach isn’t. On top of that, it will come off as unprofessional and immature if you use “lol” and “jk” every other sentence. Type in complete sentences, use punctuation, and maintain a mature tone the entire time you’re texting. [6] X Research source Skip the emojis entirely. There’s nothing wrong with using them, but they’ll be totally out of place in this conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "It looks better to tell an unpleasant truth than to sugarcoat things.",
      "content": "It looks better to tell an unpleasant truth than to sugarcoat things. If the coach asks you a question about your grades, an injury you had, or your stats, be straight up with them. You’ll look mature for telling the truth, and they’re going to find the truth out eventually so there’s no upside to being dishonest. [7] X Research source If they ask about your grades and you’ve got a 2.4 GPA, don’t say, “I think I’m at a 3.0 GPA.” Instead, say, “I’ve got a 2.4 GPA, but I’m getting tutoring for history, which is my weakest class. I’m working to get it up.” If they ask about an injury, you might say something like, “The doctor told me it should heal in a few months, but it’s keeping me from putting in as much work as I’d like to at the moment.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "As the conversation concludes, show some humility and appreciation.",
      "content": "As the conversation concludes, show some humility and appreciation. Leave on a positive note so that they feel good about the way the conversation went. Throw in a quick thanks alongside a note about how much you appreciate them texting you. You might say: “Thank you for taking the time to reach out, coach. I know you’re probably busy, but it really means a lot to me.” “I really appreciate you texting me, coach. I can’t wait to come out and see the program in person!” “Thanks for your time, coach. I can’t wait to hear back from you soon!”"

      "title": "Coaches often text multiple recruits at once, so don’t take forever.",
      "content": "Coaches often text multiple recruits at once, so don’t take forever. You can get lost in the shuffle if you’re not responsive, since the coach is probably texting multiple recruits right now. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t think through what you’re typing before hitting the send button. Just don’t wait hours between responding to each text. [8] X Research source If they text you in the middle of a school day, they probably aren’t expecting a response right away. If it’s 4 pm on a Saturday though, don’t put your phone down and plan on responding in a few hours."
    },
    {
      "title": "After your initial convo ends, let it go until they text first again.",
      "content": "After your initial convo ends, let it go until they text first again. Your coach may have texted you, but wait for them to text you again in the future. There are rules to what they’re allowed to text you, and you may be crossing a boundary by reaching out first. Just be patient, they’ll reach out to you again soon! [9] X Research source"
