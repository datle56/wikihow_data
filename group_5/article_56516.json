Then, lace the right end of the shoelace through the bottom right eyelet from the outside to the inside. [1] X Research source Match both ends of the shoelace and gently pull so you have an even length of lace on each side of the shoe. Make sure the laced section of the shoelace is not twisted."

Thread it through the second eyelet from the bottom on the right from the outside to the inside. Loop the shoelace over your finger before threading it through the eyelet to help you keep from pulling the lace too tight. [2] X Research source If you pull your lacings too tight, you won’t be able to slip your shoes on and off as easily. Take your time so you can make sure your lace stays flat. If your lace becomes twisted, take a moment to straighten it before moving on."

By lacing through the tongue loop, you prevent the tongue from falling into the shoe when you aren’t wearing it. Lacing the tongue loop is optional.

When you reach the top eyelet on each side, instead of looping over your finger and lacing from the outside, push the end of the lace through the inside of the eyelet. [3] X Research source Repeat on the other side. When you lace the final eyelet, you should only have an inch or two of shoelace on each side. If the excess lace is longer than a couple of inches, you can loosen the lacing of the shoe by carefully pulling the excess shoelace back into the lacing pattern of the shoe. This will make your shoes fit more loosely on your feet."

Then lace the left shoelace through the inside of the top right eyelet. Only pull 1 to 2 inches of shoelace through the to the outside of the shoe. Repeat with the right shoelace, pushing only a couple of inches through the inside of the top left eyelet. Try to keep each lace even with the other. Loop the excess shoelace over the tongue of the shoe. You should have two loops of extra shoelace between the top two eyelets.
