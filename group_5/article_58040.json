      "content": "Check out the machine you're going to operate. There are two obvious reasons for doing this: one is so you're familiar with the machine, and the other is to make sure it is suitable for the job. Backhoes are available as track or wheeled machines with either 2 or 4 wheel capable configurations. [1] X Research source Look at the location of the operator's controls, understanding that the machine is operated from a forward and backward facing position. Look at both the forward and rear facing operational controls to make sure you feel comfortable in your ability to reach all of them. Facing forward, you will see a steering wheel, shifter, front loader control lever, brake pedals (left and right independent brakes), gas pedal, and control switches for accessories like lights, emergency flashers, horn, emergency brake actuator, ignition switch, gauges, and other items. Facing the rear (the seat swivels 180 degrees), you should see the boom controls. There are two different boom control configurations, the three stick that includes foot controls to swing the bucket, and the joystick controls, that operate all the backhoe boom controls with two joysticks . Also, there will be two auxiliary controls, either mounted paired on one side of the seat, or in front of the boom control sticks, that raise and lower the stabilizers. Look at the safety equipment. Experienced backhoe operators check the safety equipment at the beginning of each shift to make sure it is in good condition. This requires some knowledge of how the safety equipment works, but even a novice should be able to observe things like the seat belt condition, the fire extinguisher charge, and be able to see obvious damage such as cracked members in the rollover protection system and missing guards. A backhoe will have two outrigger stabilizer arms that are planted firmly on the ground before digging with the rear boon. These must always be brought fully upright before moving the machine. Look at the general condition of the machine. Check the tires to make sure they are properly inflated and show no outward signs of damage, look for oil leaks, damaged hydraulic hoses, and other obvious signs of abuse or dangerous conditions. Look at the size of the machine. Backhoes range in size from small attachments for lawn tractors, to machines weighing over 12,000 pounds with turbo-charged diesel engines. You will have to decide how large a machine you will need to perform the project you have in mind. Look at other features of the machine you will operate, like air conditioning, four wheel drive, extend-a-hoes, and the various special attachments available on these machines."

There are substantial differences in backhoes, from the location of controls to the actual cranking procedure and the gauge cluster location. Obviously, this article is general in nature and doesn't cover every make and model of backhoes; each backhoe has its own features with which you should be familiar. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Climb up on the machine you have chosen. Using the safety steps and hand rails, carefully climb into the cab of the machine. Then, sit down in the seat, and buckle the seat belt before you take a long, slow look around to see what the clearances of the different different parts of the machine are, and where the various controls are located. Avoid dry runs on the controls, as many parts may move when levers or controls are moved, even if the engine is not running."

      "content": "Check all fluid levels before you start the machine. Before you start the backhoe, be sure to check all fluid levels including fuel, fuel additives, oil, radiator, power steering, brake, and hydraulic fluids. This should be done every day before you start the machine."

      "content": "Crank the engine, allowing it to warm up for a few minutes before attempting to engage the transmission or operating any controls. This warming-up time will ensure that the hydraulic fluid will begin to circulate and warm up."

      "content": "Check to make sure all attachments are clear of the ground, including the stabilizers, the front bucket, and the backhoe boom. If you need to raise them to allow the machine to be driven, use the controls delicately until you have a feel for them. This is especially true of the back boom, since raising or swinging it without the stabilizers down will shake the tractor violently."

      "title": "Release the parking brake, and shift the transmission into forward, then drive it slowly around while you get the hang of steering and braking the machine.",
      "content": "Release the parking brake, and shift the transmission into forward, then drive it slowly around while you get the hang of steering and braking the machine. Running in low or second gear while practice driving the machine is a good idea; even experienced operators only use third or high gear on very smooth, flat surfaces, since the balance of the machine makes it difficult to steer at high speeds. Backhoes are prone to bouncing, which can easily get out of control and be difficult to correct. Operate the machine slowly and carefully to avoid this complication."

On most machines, the control lever for this attachment is located on the operator's right while sitting facing forward. Pulling straight toward the rear raises the bucket, pushing straight forward lowers it, pulling it toward the center of the machine scoops , and pushing outward dumps it."

Keep the tires as low to the ground as possible to give you the best stability while digging. Then lower the front bucket to its limit, raising the front wheels also. You may find you have to lower one stabilizer further than the other to level the rear of the machine, depending on whether you're on a slope , or if the soil is less stable on one side than the other. [4] X Research source Try to get the machine just a bit off its wheels so that the weight during operation is on the stabilizers and front bucket."

Do this by pulling forward (toward you, and the front of the tractor) on the left control lever, then pushing if away from you when it pauses at the highest point, while holding the unlocking lever (usually on the right floor board) with your foot. Alternatively, there may be a manual unlock lever near the seat that you have to disengage by hand. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a comfortable operation configuration. Backhoes have a selector switch that allows you to reverse the controls for the right and left hands. Some people may be more comfortable with different configurations. Look in the operating manual to find the location of your machine's selector switch, and get a feel for what configuration is easier for you to use."

Push outward on the right lever to extend the lower boom (outer section, with the bucket attached) away from you (this will actually raise the second boom) so that the bucket is extending outward."

Push the left lever to lower the boom into the soil, while pulling the right lever to drag the bucket into the soil in a scooping motion, then begin rolling the bucket forward by moving the right control lever to the left. You will find with practice that you start to coordinate these movements, to achieve a fluid movement of the backhoe. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the front bucket down on the ground when you finish the operating period. Make sure the front bucket is placed firmly on the ground each time you get off the machine. This help prevent the backhoe from rolling away, even with the parking brake set. The back boom should be left in its locked position to prevent it from bleeding hydraulic fluid."
