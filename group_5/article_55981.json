      "content": "Eat more raw foods that contain vitamin B. B-group vitamins are found in many foods, and they help increase NAD levels. However, they are delicate and are easily destroyed by cooking or processing. While foods that need to be cooked can still provide vitamin B, you should still include raw options in your diet, such as peanuts, avocado, and sunflower seeds. [3] X Research source For foods that need to be cooked, such as poultry and fish, steaming and baking are better methods than boiling. Steaming and baking may leave more nutrients intact. Keep in mind that cooking methods affect each kind of vitamin differently. The cooking time, amount of heat, and type of food also impact the amount of nutrient loss. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Swap white flours, bread, and rice for their whole grain counterparts. Since processing can destroy B-group vitamins, whole grain foods are more nutritious. Choose whole grain or multigrain bread instead of white bread, and go for brown rice instead of white rice. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Go for fortified breakfast cereals. Unsweetened cereals are healthy breakfast options, and are among the richest sources of vitamin B3. Having milk with your cereal is even more beneficial. Among other nutrients, cow’s milk also contains vitamin B3, which your body converts into NAD.

      "content": "Drink 2 to 3 glasses of milk fortified with vitamin D per day. Vitamin D helps enhance your body’s ability to store and use NAD. B-group vitamins, which are also found in milk, help boost NAD levels. Increasing NAD levels and helping your body utilize the molecule can improve your metabolism and might slow the aging process.

[8] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source While red meat also contains vitamin B, eating a serving or more of red meat per day may increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, especially if it's processed red meat.

You can make lentil soups, make warm or cold lentil salads, mix them with brown rice, or serve them in dozens of other dishes. Lima beans (you might know them as butter beans) are also quick and easy and, like lentils, are great sources of the nutrients that increase NAD levels.

      "content": "Eat healthy unsaturated fats in moderation. A diet that's high in fat and sugar can decrease NAD levels and interfere with the metabolic processes that involve the NAD molecule. [11] X Research source Your body does need a moderate amount of healthy fats, so include a small amount of unsaturated fats derived from plants in your diet. Slices of avocado with a sandwich or salad or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter are good sources of healthy unsaturated fat. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplement.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplement. Your body converts vitamin B3 into NAD, so supplements intended to boost NAD levels usually contain B-group vitamins. However, too much vitamin B can damage your liver and cause other harmful effects. Furthermore, dietary supplements can negatively interact with some medications, so you need to discuss your diet and any medications you take with your doctor before starting one. Ask your doctor, \"Should I be concerned about getting enough nutrients from my diet? Would a dietary supplement negatively interact with any of my medications? Do you recommend I make any changes to my diet?\" A negative drug interaction can cause harmful side effects or make your medication ineffective."

NR is a type of vitamin B3 and is gaining credibility in the scientific community as an effective way to increase NAD levels. You can find over-the-counter NR supplements online, at pharmacies, and at health stores. Try taking 100 to 250 mg with a glass of water before your first meal of the day.

While you can get vitamin D from milk, fortified cereals, and direct sunlight, you could also ask your doctor about taking a daily supplement to reach your daily recommended amount of Vitamin D. While the daily recommended amount of Vitamin D for adults is 800 IU, you could need more or less depending on your age, diet, and daily exposure to sunlight.

Among a host of other benefits, regular exercise stimulates the production of NAD, boosts your metabolism, and can improve your body’s ability to repair damaged DNA. Most adults should get at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. Aerobic exercise is especially beneficial to your overall health, so try to go for a brisk walk or jog, swim, or cycle every day.

It’s recommended that men drink less than 2 to 3 alcoholic beverages a day, and for women to consume 1 to 2 drinks or less. If you drink more than your recommended amount, try to reduce your alcohol consumption."
