The owner's name appears after it, followed by the group name. r is read permissions, w is write permissions, and x is execute permissions. The first three characters in the permissions (in this example, r-- ), are the file owner's permissions. So, in this example, the owner of the file only has read permissions, which means they can't write to, execute, or delete the file. [3] X Research source The second three characters are group permissions. If you're a member of a group and that group has write permissions to the file, you'll be able to delete it even if you're not the owner. The third three characters are world permissions, which is everyone else."
