Know what type of data you are looking at. What do your numbers in your sample represent? this could be something like test scores, heart rate readings, height, weight etc. For example, a set of test scores is 10, 8, 10, 8, 8, and 4."

Samples with low variance have data that is clustered closely about the mean. Samples with high variance have data that is clustered far from the mean.
