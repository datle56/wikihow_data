      "content": "Many developers will happily reset your trial once. This is especially true with smaller software companies and independent developers. If you didn't get a chance to test out all the software's features in the short trial period, contact the developer to (nicely) ask for an extension. Just let the developers know you're interested in purchasing but want to make sure it really works for your needs. This will work for plenty of popular software titles, including Ableton Live . Some developers may secretly allow you to restart a trial one or more times just by uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Before you try another method, see if you can easily reset the trial with a quick uninstall and reinstall."

If you're trying to restart the trial period for software that verifies your account or computer online, it may have your MAC address (the hardware address of your network interface) on file. If you really want to be on the safe side, you can use a few quick Terminal commands to temporarily change your MAC address: Click the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar. Here, you'll see the name of your network interface (e.g., en1 ), and your current MAC address . Remember the interface name, as you'll need it soon. Because your MAC address will return to its default once you restart your Mac, you don't have to worry about writing it down. Open a Terminal window. Paste openssl rand -hex 6 into the prompt and press Return . You'll now see a randomly-generated MAC address with colons separating its values. Type sudo ifconfig <interface name> ether <MAC address> and press Return . Replace <interface name> with the interface name you noted earlier (e.g., en1 ), and <MAC address> with the randomly-generated MAC address. Disconnect from the internet, and then reconnect."

Also, because you'll be setting your Mac's system clock back, this method could cause problems with your other apps. Still, it's worth a try! Close the trial program first. Click the Apple menu and select System Settings . Click General and select Date & Time . [2] X Research source Turn off \"Set date and time automatically\" so you can set your clock back.

Because each virtual machine is seen by the software as a separate computer, this method will work for any trial software that doesn't require you to create an account or activate a license. You likely won't want to go through the trouble of creating a virtual machine to restart a software trial, but if you already have one, this is a great way to keep your trial going. One interesting way to do this would be to install Parallels, a virtual machine program that lets you run Windows in a window on your Mac. If the trial software you want to reset has a Windows version, Parallels is a great choice. [5] X Research source However, it's not free. If you want a free virtual machine option, try VirtualBox or QEMU . To use a virtual machine, you will need a disc image of an installer for the operating system you want to run. [6] X Research source For example, if you want the virtual computer to be running macOS Ventura, you'll need to download an image. If the software requires you to have an account or authenticate your trial over the internet, you still may need to create a new account before installing the software."
