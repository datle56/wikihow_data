      "title": "Choose great lighting.",
      "content": "Choose great lighting. To start, you want to make sure you get flattering lighting. Videos with sexual content often have dim bar-like lighting, which can be a nice touch. However, when setting your lights, make sure you do some practice takes to make sure your lighting choice is flattering for your body type. Some cameras work better with certain types of lights. For example, dim lighting may not show up well on a web cam , but it might on a higher-quality camera. Take a few practice shoots and experiment with different types of lighting. If you've never made a sexy video before, dark or dim lighting may make you feel more comfortable. If you're filming with another person, keep in mind that lighting can create shadows. If you end up casting shadows on one another's bodies, make sure it's not distracting before filming."

      "content": "Decide on your wardrobe. Just because you are shooting a sexy video does not mean that you have to be stark naked. In fact, wearing something can make it even sexier! What you choose to wear depends on what you'll be doing in the video. For example: If you're planning on doing a strip tease, select an outfit with layers. It can be fun and seductive to slowly peel off one layer of clothing at a time. [1] X Research source If you're doing a dance in the video, pick clothing that's fun and revealing but that also allows you to move. Skin-tight leggings and a low-cut tank-top may work, or you could try a loose pair of jeans and a tight t-shirt. [2] X Research source Keep in mind your comfort is most important. If you don't feel sexy or confident in an outfit, ditch it. If you're not feeling good about yourself, this can show up on camera."

      "title": "Consider music.",
      "content": "Consider music. Music can be a nice touch in a sexy video, especially if you'll be stripping or dancing . Try to take some time to consider if you'll have music playing during the video. If you're doing a dance or striptease video, try a fast-paced song that you can move to, such as \"S&M\" by Rihanna or \"Crazy\" by Aerosmith. [3] X Research source If you're doing a video with your partner, consider a slow, seductive song instead. If you're making a video for your own song, record a good, high-quality version of that song before making the video."

      "title": "Discuss limits with your partner if they will be in the video.",
      "content": "Discuss limits with your partner if they will be in the video. Many people make videos with themselves and romantic partners for personal use. If this is the case, you and your partner should have a frank talk ahead of time about what acts you'll be performing. You want to make sure both you and your partner are comfortable with what's being filmed. Talk ahead of time and mutually agree on what acts will be performed in the video. Never push your partner into performing an act he or she is not comfortable with. Discuss nudity. As with sex acts, if your partner is not comfortable with getting naked , you should not force him or her to do so. If you want to make a video, you should start with an idea. Then flesh out the idea and transition it from a concept to an actual storyboard or script. [4] X Research source After that, estimate the budget. The majority of work has to be done in the pre-production phase of planning and getting everything ready for recording. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Think about your audience. Many people make sexy videos for long distance partners, in which case your audience is your significant other. However, if you are making a video that you will upload online, make sure everything you do in the video is something you're comfortable with a larger audience seeing. Consider the future. If you're uploading something online, it will be available to an audience for years to come. Make sure this is something that you're comfortable with."

      "content": "Do a strip tease . A strip tease can be a fun and sexy way to start off a sexy video. There are a variety of moves you can use while engaging in a strip tease. For example: [6] X Research source Walk slowly when you begin your strip tease. Walk away from the camera, taking deliberate, slow steps. Then, turn and face the camera. Glide your fingers up and down your body until you reach a button that can be undone. If you have longer hair, consider whipping your hair around a little as you go. Move in a rhythmic manner as you remove your clothing . Take off one layer at a time. If you're playing music, try to dance to the beat of the music as you go. You do not have to get completely nude. If you're not comfortable with nudity, you can strip down to your underwear or a layer of lingerie."

      "title": "Try dirty talk.",
      "content": "Try dirty talk . If you're not playing loud music during your video, try dirty talk. This can be particularly helpful if you're making a video for a long distance lover. Dirty talk is a fun way to get your partner in the mood, even if you cannot physically be there. It can help to put yourself in the right mindset prior to engaging in dirty talk. Read racy fiction or spend time fantasizing about you and your partner. If you're nervous, do some deep breathing ahead of time to keep yourself calm. [7] X Research source Try to let the dirty talk come naturally. Think about what you want to do with your partner. Talk about what the two of you have done in bed in the past, and mention any fantasies you have. [8] X Research source Talk about your partner as well. Talk about how sexy you find your partner, specifying what about them turns you on. Use their name. If you're comfortable doing so on screen, consider masturbating while talking dirty. This can show your partner you're turned on by them."

      "content": "Dance in a sensual manner. Not all sexy videos are meant to be graphic. You may be making a sexy video to market yourself as a model or an actor or actress, or as an accompaniment to a music video. If this is the case, consider filming a sexy dance. Study popular, sexually charged music videos. Artists like Lady Gaga frequently dance provocatively in videos. Watch a variety of sexy music videos for inspiration. Pick dance moves that you're personally comfortable with. If you don't feel confident, you won't come off as sexy. Gyrating the hips, shaking your behind, and moving in a slow, teasing manner are all popular dance moves for a sexy video."

      "title": "Discuss what you'll be filming ahead of time.",
      "content": "Discuss what you'll be filming ahead of time. A sexy video with your partner does not necessarily have to include penetrative sex, and shouldn't if you or your partner is uncomfortable with this. You can film things like oral sex , mutual masturbation, or simply film the two of you engaging in dirty talk. Making a sexy video should be a fun, mutually enjoyable activity, so don't push your partner to engage in anything that makes him or her uncomfortable. [9] X Research source Consider camera angles. You do not want the focus to be solely on your partner. Make sure the two of you talk about what body parts are okay and are not okay to film ahead of time."

      "title": "Keep the video private if it includes sexual acts.",
      "content": "Keep the video private if it includes sexual acts. If your video includes sexual acts, it's a good idea to keep it private. Unless you work in the adult film industry, you could potentially get in trouble with your school or place of work if a sexual video of you surfaces. Store sexy videos offline and always password protect computers or other devices that contain adult videos. [10] X Research source Many people who share content online eventually regret it. Even a mildly sexy video can be a cause of embarrassment for you down the road. If an employer searches your name and finds you connected to sexual content, this could affect your employment depending on the ethics of your place of work. If you film a video with your partner, talk ahead of time about what to do with the video in the event you break up. Only film sexual videos with someone you trust completely. Sometimes, people upload sexual content of former partners online in an industry known as \"revenge porn.\" This can cause a great deal of emotional turmoil."

      "content": "Send videos to small audiences carefully. If you made a video for a long distance partner, be careful in how you send the video. There are a lot of simple tricks you can use to send sensitive information securely. Break sensitive information into chunks. If you uploaded a video on a password protected site, e-mail your partner something like, \"I'm texting you my password.\" Then, send the password out of context in a separate text. Dropbox is a service where you can share files and videos. While it's an online service, it's fairly secure as it encrypts all user information. Keep in mind sensitive data is best exchanged in person. If your partner can't play a DVD, consider uploading the video on a USB drive instead."

      "content": "Be aware of the legal consequences. Sexual content shared via the internet and a smart phone is never private. If you are underage, you can face felony charges in some states for distributing child pornography. You may even end up having to register as a sex offender. Think carefully before sharing sexually explicit content via online outlets, as it can have serious consequences for your future. [11] X Research source If you are underage, some states have strict laws regarding distributing images of a minor. If you text sexually explicit videos of yourself to a partner, you could end up in serious trouble. Review your state's specific laws regarding sexting and sexual content. Laws vary greatly by state, and you should know the potential legal consequences before sending someone a sexy video."
