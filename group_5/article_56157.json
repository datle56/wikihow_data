These conditions are difficult, if not impossible, to overcome because they relate to the person's traits and personality. They're harder to treat than conditions like anxiety or PTSD, which are connected to a state of being rather than a trait. Knowing more about the person's tendencies can help guide your interactions with them. There are 4 personality types in Cluster B: [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A person with antisocial personality disorder may have thoughts and actions that defy those in authority. They may also break rules, lack remorse, and even be violent or aggressive. A person with borderline personality disorder has low self-esteem that translates into using others for self-validation. They may act paranoid about what others think, make threats, and have a rocky relationship history. A person with histrionic personality disorder feels a strong need to be the center of attention. They may act sexually provocative, make threats, and form attachments too quickly. A person with narcissistic personality disorder acts with superficial charm and usually lacks emotional empathy. This person may be unable to accept criticism and have a need for admiration. They may exploit others."
