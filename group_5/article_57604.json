      "title": "Select a high-quality extra virgin olive oil as the base for your mask.",
      "content": "Select a high-quality extra virgin olive oil as the base for your mask. You'll need about a 1/2 cup of olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is a little more expensive than other types, but it has a much nicer fragrance and more antioxidants and vitamins that will give your hair strength and shine. To add pleasant fragrance and additional benefits, you can allow a sprig of dried rosemary or lavender to soak in the olive oil bottle several days prior to making your mask. These fragrances are excellent for relaxation."

      "title": "Pour 1/4 cup honey into a glass container.",
      "content": "Pour 1/4 cup honey into a glass container. Honey is a natural humectant (meaning it helps seal in moisture) and contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. These properties make honey ideal for restoring dry and damaged hair and split ends. Raw honey has more of these properties than processed honey. [1] X Research source Using a whisk, incorporate the olive oil. Mason jars with resealable lids are great for this (and for storing any extra), but you can use any clean glass container. If your mask becomes too sticky, dilute it by adding more olive oil and continuing to whisk."

      "title": "Pierce three capsules of Vitamin E and squeeze the contents into the mixture.",
      "content": "Pierce three capsules of Vitamin E and squeeze the contents into the mixture. You can find liquid-filled Vitamin E capsules at most grocery stores and pharmacies. The additional Vitamin E will not only help repair damaged hair, it has anti-inflammatory properties that will soothe your scalp. Whisk mixture until the consistency is smooth and manageable. The mixture shouldn't be overly sticky."

      "title": "Cover hair with a shower cap, plastic wrap or a plastic grocery bag.",
      "content": "Cover hair with a shower cap, plastic wrap or a plastic grocery bag. If you have long hair, you may want to twist your hair loosely on top of your head and secure with a clip before you wrap it. Wait for 90 minutes to allow the oil and honey mixture to fully permeate your hair. The heat that gets trapped inside the plastic will help the olive oil and honey absorb into the hair."

      "title": "Rinse with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse with warm water. Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm, not hot, water. Your hair may feel stiff or sticky; continue rinsing until your hair feels loose and supple. Use a gentle shampoo to wash your hair and follow with conditioner. Shampoos that say \"sulfate-free\" or \"surfactant free\" are more gentle on your hair than other shampoos. They don't form the same foamy lather, but they clean just as well."

      "title": "Select a good quality coconut oil for your base.",
      "content": "Select a good quality coconut oil for your base. \"Extra virgin\" coconut oil is best, but any oil without added fragrances, flavorings, or colorings will do. [2] X Research source Coconut oil is especially good for damaged hair because its fatty acid composition penetrates the hair shaft much more efficiently than most other oils. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It's also an excellent treatment for dandruff and dry, itchy scalp and is a natural anti-fungal agent. If you can afford it, raw organic coconut oil is the most effective oil to use on hair. Like raw honey, raw coconut oil may solidify in the jar; if so, microwave it for 10-20 seconds until liquified. [4] X Research source Because this mask is so lightweight, it's perfect for fine or thin hair."

      "content": "Mix 2 parts coconut oil with 1 part extra virgin olive oil. Stir these oils together in a resealable glass jar. If you have short hair, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of coconut oil and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil should be plenty, but adjust the quantities as necessary according to your hair's length and thickness."

      "content": "Add 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is fairly smooth. You may have some small lumps of banana remaining; that's all right. Just try to break down any large chunks. You can also puree the banana and olive oil in a food processor or blender, if you have one. This technique will create a more thoroughly emulsified mixture."

      "title": "Stir in 1 teaspoon of honey.",
      "content": "Stir in 1 teaspoon of honey. Raw organic honey is best for this, because it is highest in antioxidants, but any honey will work. Make sure the mixture is thoroughly combined."

      "content": "Select a ripe avocado. Press near the stem tip; if the avocado gives slightly, it's ripe. Avocados are rich in vitamins A and E and monounsaturated fat, which will provide moisture and shine. The oils in avocado are very close to the natural oils in human skin and hair, which makes this mask ideal for dry or frizzy hair. [6] X Research source Because of its very high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, avocado is particularly good for natural hair, which can require extra moisturizing. This mask is also great for very thick, coarse, or curly hair. However, it may be too bulky for people with very fine or thin hair."

      "content": "Scoop the avocado out of the skin with a spoon. Using a fork, mash the avocado into a paste in a medium bowl. A jar will not work as well for this mask because you have to have room to fully mash the avocado."
