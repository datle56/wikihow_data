  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Let your match know that they’re the person you’ve been searching for.",
      "content": "Let your match know that they’re the person you’ve been searching for. Everyone on Tinder knows how many times you have to swipe left before you want to swipe right. By making a joke about it, you two can bond over your swiping habits and the ridiculousness of online dating. [1] X Research source “You can stop swiping now—you found me!” “I’d swipe right twice for you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "This play on “Cinderella” is sure to make your match blush.",
      "content": "This play on “Cinderella” is sure to make your match blush. If you swipe right on a cutie and you want to call them a princess, use this play on words. This term is usually used for girls, but feel free to try it out on a guy, too! [2] X Research source “I need to call Disney World—I found their missing princess.” “Is your name Zelda? Because you sure look like a princess to me.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop the “L” word as a funny way to say hello.",
      "content": "Drop the “L” word as a funny way to say hello. This play on “love at first sight” is a great way to open a cheeky conversation. Or, if your match takes your question seriously, it might start a discussion about soulmates and love in general. [3] X Research source “I didn’t believe in love until I saw your profile.” “Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I match with you again?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Joke about marriage to make your match laugh.",
      "content": "Joke about marriage to make your match laugh. Obviously, Tinder isn’t quite the right place to propose to your future spouse (especially with the first message). By sending this as an opener, you can make your match smile and roll their eyes as they craft a funny response. [4] X Research source “So do we get married now, or later?” “Is this the time I start shopping for engagement rings?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Some people don’t like to admit they met on Tinder.",
      "content": "Some people don’t like to admit they met on Tinder. By asking your match to come up with a silly story, you can start a fun conversation and bond over that. Plus, it’s a great way to hint at the fact that you’re looking for something a little bit more serious than a hookup. [5] X Research source “When I introduce you to my parents, I’ll lie and say we met at a coffee shop.” “I’m thinking we should say we met through mutual friends. It’s just vague enough to be believable, right?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flatter your match by calling them an angel.",
      "content": "Flatter your match by calling them an angel. Your match will be so flattered, they’ll have to respond! Add even more spice to your message by inserting a few emojis, like 😇 or 👼. “Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven?” “I thought all the angels were in Heaven, but I guess there are a few on Tinder, too.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Accuse your match of being a bot to make them blush.",
      "content": "Accuse your match of being a bot to make them blush. We all know that there are tons of fake profiles on Tinder who use pictures of models for their profile. You can “accuse” your potential date of being a fake profile to flatter them while simultaneously making them laugh. [6] X Research source “Can I have the name of the model you used for these pics?” “There’s no way this is a real account. You’re just too perfect.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Call out your blue-eyed match to make them feel good.",
      "content": "Call out your blue-eyed match to make them feel good. Complimenting someone’s eye color is a great way to admire their physical appearance without making a comment about their body. Plus, it shows that you’re paying attention to what they look like in their pics. [7] X Research source “Your eyes are so blue, I feel like I could take a swim in them.” “You must get this all the time, but I love your eyes.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke fun at your own message to show off your sense of humor.",
      "content": "Poke fun at your own message to show off your sense of humor. Most people on Tinder have dealt with a few (or a lot) of cheesy pickup lines.

We’d be gouda together.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for your match’s number in a goofy way to make them laugh.",
      "content": "Ask for your match’s number in a goofy way to make them laugh. If you want to skip the small talk and move straight into exchanging digits, this is the pickup line for you. If you’re lucky, your match will like your sense of humor so much that they hand over their phone number right away. “I send the best good morning texts. But you’d know that already if you had my number.” “What emoji should I put next to your name in my phone? Actually, why don’t you start by giving me your number?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your match giggle while they send you their number.",
      "content": "Make your match giggle while they send you their number. If you don’t love chatting on Tinder and you’d rather just get their number, this line is for you! Plus, if your match isn’t comfortable giving out their number just yet, they can always politely decline. “I’m no mathematician, but I’ve been told I’m good with numbers. How about you give me yours so I can prove it?” “I was blinded by your beauty; I’m going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You can ask your match to cuddle with a few emojis.",
      "content": "You can ask your match to cuddle with a few emojis. Send this fork and knife emoji to mention a little spoon (or a big spoon, if you prefer).

Because you’re sweet, and I want to spoon you.” “I’d give up my morning cereal to spoon you instead.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Call out a weird national holiday to make your match laugh.",
      "content": "Call out a weird national holiday to make your match laugh. There are tons of random national holidays out there that nobody’s heard of—you can look up the holiday for that day, or you can just make one up. Hopefully, your match will be intrigued enough to ask you about it and start a fun conversation. “Happy Take Your Cat to Work Day!” “It’s National Drink a Glass of Milk Day! How will you be celebrating?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If your match is a cat person, this is sure to get a response.",
      "content": "If your match is a cat person, this is sure to get a response. Take a look at their profile to see if they have (or they like) cats first.

    {
      "title": "Flatter your match while also humble bragging about yourself.",
      "content": "Flatter your match while also humble bragging about yourself. It’s no secret that 2 cute people make a great couple!

I think it’d be perfect with your number in it.”"

    {
      "title": "This classic pickup line will make your match crack up.",
      "content": "This classic pickup line will make your match crack up. A G-rated, silly pickup line can never go wrong!

      "title": "Show off your nerdy side by calling out a popular search engine.",
      "content": "Show off your nerdy side by calling out a popular search engine. You can make your date laugh and groan with this punny play on words.

    },
    {
      "title": "If your match is a vegan, try this line out for size.",
      "content": "If your match is a vegan, try this line out for size. Anyone can be a cute-cumber, but your match might like it more if they’re on a plant-based diet. Plus, it shows that you looked into their profile a little bit to learn more about them. “If you were a dried fruit, you’d be my date.” “If you were a fruit, you’d be a fine-apple.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rank your date by number to give them a huge compliment.",
      "content": "Rank your date by number to give them a huge compliment. This pickup line is a good one if you’re messaging someone way out of your league. Not only does it tell them how hot they are, but it shows just how confident you are, too. “Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot?” “I hope there’s a firefighter around, because you’re smoking hot.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Nobody likes icebreakers, so make fun of them a little bit with this line.",
      "content": "Nobody likes icebreakers, so make fun of them a little bit with this line. The “getting to know you” portion of dating is usually the most awkward, and everyone knows it. Make a funny joke about icebreakers as your first message to, well… break the ice! “How much does a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice.” “Whenever I meet someone new, I start talking about climate change. It’s a real icebreaker.”"
