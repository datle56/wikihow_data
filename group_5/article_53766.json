      "content": "Blow the whistle code for forward movement - there will be either a cable, cables or whistle handles, above your head or in front of you on the boiler. Quickly pull down on the cable (or push the lever) twice in quick succession to make the steam whistle sound out two short blasts."

      "content": "Open the throttle to start the engine moving - the very long lever close to your face and hanging from the cab roof is the throttle. Grip it firmly and give it a yank towards you. As you feel the engine move slightly, shove it back in most of the way, so that it does not gather speed too fast."

      "title": "Move the Johnson bar slowly back toward vertical, but never too close to vertical.",
      "content": "Move the Johnson bar slowly back toward vertical, but never too close to vertical. This is like the gear shift of your car and admits less steam per cylinder stroke. In turn, this increases the efficiency of steam usage so you don't over work the fireman throwing coal into the fire (and to conserve fuel and water!)"

      "title": "If the locomotive's wheels slip, close throttle most of the way immediately.",
      "content": "If the locomotive's wheels slip, close throttle most of the way immediately. Allowing the wheels to slip will not render any tractive effort and will damage the locomotive's driving (powered) wheels if done continuously (also \"tears\" holes in a coal fired locomotive, or in an oil burning locomotive, can cause hollow booms much like an explosion). Wheelslip, as it's called, may cause excess damage if allowed for too long. This includes damage to the firebox itself, which may or may not result in the locomotive exploding."

      "title": "Blow the whistle at level crossings and before entering tunnels.",
      "content": "Blow the whistle at level crossings and before entering tunnels. If you see a whistle post sign, give the whistle a long blast and start ringing the bell. Then give another long blast. Wait a few seconds, and give a shorter blast. Once the train is nearly in the crossing, blow the whistle continuously until the locomotive has entered the crossing. This is the same whistling pattern required when entering tunnels or other locations where railroad employees may be working"

      "title": "Do not exceed the speed limit.",
      "content": "Do not exceed the speed limit. That is very dangerous, as derailments due to excess speed may occur, even on straight track. This too can cause boiler explosions. See the Wreck of the Old 97 for example."
