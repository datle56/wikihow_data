      "content": "Opt for a shorter haircut if you have long hair. Study different reference pictures of pixie cuts, bobs, lobs, or other kinds of short cuts. When you visit a hairstylist, ask for a recommendation on what type of style works best for your face shape and hair type.

Instead, play around with different textures and hair cutting styles, leaving the thinning hair around your bald crown at a longer length.

      "content": "Change your hair part to make your hair look fuller. If you traditionally part your hair down the center, try parting your hair to the left or right.

      "content": "Apply a spray-on dye to cover your bald crown. Consult a stylist or other beauty professional to discuss a cosmetic spray or dye that can be applied over your balding area. Ask about how much the procedure would cost, and how long the dye lasts. If you’re looking for sleek, short-term coverage of your crown, then this might be a good option for you!

      "title": "Dye your roots",
      "content": "Dye your roots a darker color to make your hair look thicker. Take note of your current hair color, including the shade of your roots. If your hair is especially light, your crown might be more visible to the naked eye. To combat this, invest in a dye color for your roots that’s a shade or so darker than your current hair color. Follow the packaging instructions carefully to ensure that your roots are evenly coated and covered. [7] X Research source For instance, if you have medium-brown hair, look for a dark brown dye for your roots. If you aren’t sure of the best dye to use, ask a hairstylist or beauty professional for advice."

To add the powder, spray or shake a bottle of powder over a small, 1 in (2.5 cm) section of hair. Repeat this process throughout your locks, applying the powder wherever you’d like to add more texture. [9] X Research source For easier use, use a spray container to apply your volumizing powder. As you use it, hold the bottle about 10 cm (3.9 in) away from your hair. Generally, around 6 sprays will provide even, texturized coverage for your hair."
