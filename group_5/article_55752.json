      "title": "Average time: 1–2 days",
      "content": "Average time: 1–2 days Most dry cleaners try to get your clothes finished within a couple of days after you drop them off. Some cleaners may even offer same-day services so you can pick them up later in the evening. Just ask the employees and they can give you a more accurate estimate. When in doubt, check the claim tag that the dry cleaners gave you when you dropped your garments off so you know when to pick them up."

    {
      "title": "Dress clothes: 1–2 days",
      "content": "Dress clothes: 1–2 days Since dress clothes are really common pieces, dry cleaners can usually get them done quickly and they may even be ready the same day that you drop them off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Suits: 2–7 days",
      "content": "Suits: 2–7 days Since full suits have multiple pieces to clean and usually contain liners and buttons, give the cleaners a little extra time to fully clean them. Standard suit jackets and pants are typically ready after 2–3 days, but formal tuxedos may take up to a week since they’re more delicate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Formal dresses: 4–7 days",
      "content": "Formal dresses: 4–7 days Prom dresses and formal gowns typically have pleating, beads, or other embellishments that require slow and special care. If you’re dropping off a bridal gown or wedding dress with intricate lacework, it may take an additional week so the cleaners don’t rush and damage the material."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leather, suede, & fur: 1–2 weeks",
      "content": "Leather, suede, & fur: 1–2 weeks Since leather, suede, and fur are natural fabrics, they require a slightly different solvent than the rest of your dry cleaning. It might take a little longer to ensure your garments aren’t destroyed in the process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drapery & linens: 3–7 days",
      "content": "Drapery & linens: 3–7 days Since linens and drapes are larger, it takes a little while for cleaners to get rid of stains and wash them thoroughly. Linens take around 3–4 days, but drapes with liners or made from delicate fabrics could take the full week."
    },
    {
      "title": "Anything labeled “dry clean only”",
      "content": "Anything labeled “dry clean only” Read the laundry tag on your clothes to see how the manufacturer recommends cleaning them. If the tag explicitly says that it should be dry-cleaned, then avoid trying to wash the garment at home so you don’t risk any damage, stretching, or pilling on the fabric. [1] X Research source Try dry cleaning at home if you need to quickly get rid of stains or odors, but use the cleaners to be on the safe side."

    {
      "title": "Colored silks and delicate fabrics",
      "content": "Colored silks and delicate fabrics Since fabrics like silk, rayon, and chiffon are fragile and can get damaged in your washer and dryer at home, it’s always safest to take them to a professional cleaner instead. If you have vibrant or patterned fabrics, cleaning them at home could also make the colors bleed or fade. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Embellished clothing",
      "content": "Embellished clothing If your clothes have sequins, beads, or embroidery, you risk damaging them if you wash them at home. Dry cleaners will be more gentle with these garments so they look good as new when you pick them up. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dry cleaners hold clothes anywhere from 90 days to 6 months.",
      "content": "Dry cleaners hold clothes anywhere from 90 days to 6 months. Some states and areas may discard or donate clothes 90 days after you drop them off. [4] X Research source Other locations may hold onto clothes for 6 months so you have some extra leeway before you pick them up. The laws vary between locations, so always ask the employees how long they’ll hold your clothes when you drop them off. [5] X Research source Don’t worry if you can’t pick up your clothes right when they’re finished. Just try to get them as soon as you’re able to."

    {
      "title": "Dry cleaners use chemical solvents without water to clean garments.",
      "content": "Dry cleaners use chemical solvents without water to clean garments. When you drop off your garments, the cleaners will spot-treat any stains they find. Then, they'll load your clothes into a machine similar to a regular washer. However, instead of using soap and water, they'll add the chemical solvent perchloroethylene. The machine will run through a gentle wash cycle, and after that, the cleaners dry and hang your clothes. [6] X Research source"
