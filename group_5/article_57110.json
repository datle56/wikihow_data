      "title": "Give yourself permission and set your intentions beforehand.",
      "content": "Give yourself permission and set your intentions beforehand. First, remind yourself that you deserve to have time for yourself. Let go of any guilt you may feel over prioritizing your needs and focus instead on genuinely enjoying the time you set aside for yourself. From there, reflect on what, exactly, you want to do and write down your specific intentions on paper to help you commit to them. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, you might set an intention to make 1 hour of time for yourself every day. Alternatively, you might resolve to set aside 1 full day of \"me time\" each weekend. By setting intentions , you’re basically affirming your commitment to making time for yourself."

      "content": "Remind yourself that imperfections are okay. Many people get bogged down by the need to get every task just right—to the point that they might stay after work, answer work emails on the weekend, or put off sleeping until all their chores are done. However, that doesn’t leave you much free time! Instead, accept that you can’t always get everything done (and that you deserve “me time” regardless). [2] X Research source Once you're officially off the clock each day, even if you have more work to do, try putting everything down and focus on doing something you want. Remember: most tasks can wait, and you’ll have another opportunity to do them. Also, taking time away from important tasks can actually improve your performance."

      "content": "Schedule free time for yourself daily. Some people are great at scheduling tasks for everyone else—but don’t do anything for themselves. So, be kind to yourself! Create a timeslot reserved for “me time” every day, if possible, or at least a few times per week, and treat those times like you would any work or family commitment. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, you could block off an hour in the evening that you can't break unless it’s an emergency. If you’re wondering how much “me time” people need, the answer is that it varies based on your individual needs. You might be happy with just 30 minutes or crave a full 24 hours! This doesn't need to be time alone, just time spent doing things you enjoy. This can be watching a movie with a friend or even going out to dinner. Making time for yourself can come in many forms!"

Finding specific things to do can not only give you a clearer picture of what you want to do but a concrete goal to make yourself start pursuing with alone time. For instance, you could focus on activities you enjoy but don’t usually do, like reading, watching a TV show, or exercising. Make sure they’re activities you really enjoy! [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you're feeling stuck, try thinking of things you enjoyed when you were younger, like a hobby you used to really love.

      "content": "Change your routine to make time for yourself. It may not always be possible to squeeze in time during the day for yourself, but you can usually make time before or after work. Instead of getting up at 6:30 to rush off for work, get up a half hour earlier. Spend this time doing something you like before your day starts. This is a great way to jumpstart the workday! [6] X Research source If you can't make a significant amount of time for yourself at first, start small and take mini-breaks throughout the day! A mini-break could be just a few minutes (perhaps 5 to 10) that you spend doing something for yourself (like deep breathing, meditating, stretching, or having a quick snack). This can be a great exercise to do consistently; the more you find mini-breaks for yourself, the more they'll add up over time."

      "content": "Set personal and professional boundaries for yourself. In short, learn to say “no.” Don't keep taking on endless tasks. Rather, understand that you have a limit—and it’s okay to say no to things without feeling guilty or like you’re slacking off. Draw boundaries to ensure you have time to yourself, even when work or your social life complicates things. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, you might draw a boundary by refusing to answer a work call after hours or during your break. You might also set a boundary by reserving a certain chunk of time for yourself and keeping it clear, even if someone tries to make plans with you during that time. Ultimately, even if you’re not used to saying “no,” most people will understand as long as you lay out your boundaries respectfully."

It can seem like everything is critical, especially when it comes to work and chores around the house—but there’s usually more flexibility than you think. Delegate some responsibility or cut out what isn’t necessary to clear your schedule. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Ask your family to give you a hand. You might ask your child to do chores or your spouse to run to the grocery store, for example—which can give you 20 free minutes to yourself. Find jobs to outsource. This may hurt your budget a little, but consider finding a service to mow your lawn or a cleaning service to help around the house. If you're bogged down at work, find help. This can be someone under you at work, a co-worker, or even asking a boss to help lessen your load."

For an hour each day, try putting down your phone or computer (or at least limiting the amount of work and social media scrolling you do on them). [9] X Research source Make the most of your time by being present in your own skin rather than mindlessly wrapped up in an app. Set specific limits on work-related things like checking your email. Decide on a time you’re allowed to check your email and stay away from it until then!"

After all, exercise is important for both your mental and physical health! When you exercise regularly, it’ll become part of a routine (something you consistently make time for). So, find some kind of exercise you want to try and reserve it for “me time.” [10] X Research source This could mean anything from jogging, cycling, or weight-lifting to dancing, swimming, or taking a group class. If you hate going to the gym, get outside to be active. This can help you disconnect from the stresses of home and work to immerse yourself in nature. After exercising, decompress in a hot tub or sauna, if possible. It’s the perfect way to end an exercise regimen!

As you take each breath, focus on different parts of your body; this is thought to help center you and reconnect your body and spirit.

[12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even if you can’t solve every problem that arises as you take deep breaths, it can help to remind yourself that everything is okay and you don’t have to have all the answers.

Taking time for yourself to do things like reading, meditating, and journaling can alleviate stress and help you clear your mind, allowing you to focus better in the future. Time for reflection.

Journaling and mindful thinking both invite reflection, which can remind you of all the good things in life, making it easier to cultivate gratitude. Strengthening your relationships. “Me time” gives you the space to identify how you feel about relationships (and whether there are any problems you want to fix).
