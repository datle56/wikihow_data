      "content": "Red exclamation mark ❗ The red ❗emoji represents excitement or urgency and emphasizes whatever point you’re making in the sentence before it (whether it’s positive or negative). [1] X Research source It’s basically an exaggerated version of a regular exclamation point, and its big, bright red design captures the reader’s attention right away. “I can’t believe my baby girl won the spelling bee ❗🥹”"

      "content": "White exclamation mark ❕ The white version ❕ of the exclamation mark emoji also expresses excitement, surprise, and urgency, but may come off as less intense or important. While the ❗ emoji uses bright red to grab your attention or indicate “danger” or “alert,” the ❕ emoji looks softer and a little bit more tranquil in comparison. On some platforms, it has a black outline to help it stand out better against light backgrounds. [2] X Research source “White water rafting? Heck yes ❕”"

      "title": "Double exclamation mark ‼️",
      "content": "Double exclamation mark ‼️ This emoji looks like two side-by-side red exclamation marks and indicates even more excitement, emphasis, or urgency than the ❗ or ❕ emojis. It expresses shock or utter surprise and can help bring attention to super important points in a long text or social media post (positive or negative). [3] X Research source “Attention everyone‼️ After 4 long years…my braces are off! 😬”"

      "content": "Exclamation question mark ⁉️ The ⁉️ emoji combines the ❗ and ❓ (red question mark) emojis to indicate confusion, shock, or disbelief about something combined with a sense of urgency. [4] X Research source Basically, it’s like a big, red, exaggerated version of typing out “!?” at the end of an exclamatory question. “The history test is tomorrow⁉️ I’m doomed…” Did you know? The ⁉️ emoji is similar to an out-of-style punctuation mark called the interrobang (‽), which combines an exclamation point and a question mark. The name is a combo of “interrogation point” (the technical name for a question mark) and “bang” (printers’ slang for an exclamation point). [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Heart exclamation point ❣️ This little known emoji combines the ❗ and ❤️ (red heart) emojis for a romantic twist on a regular exclamation point. It still expresses excitement or urgency, but also affection, love, support, or enthusiasm. [6] X Research source Think of it as a sweet way to add positive, loving vibes to your text or post (especially if you’re sending it to a friend or loved one). “We’re ENGAGED❣️💍”"

Any one of these emojis will heighten the importance or energy of your message. Simply put these emojis at the end of a sentence, just like you would with any punctuation. The ‼️ emoji gives off the most energy, while the ❕ is the most mellow (but still exciting!). “I JUST WON THE LOTTERY ‼️ 🤯” “I will NOT be answering his texts anymore. Enough is enough❗”"

[7] X Research source You can put the emojis at the end of the sentence, or you can even put them at the beginning to signal “Hey, this is important!” (kind of like a dramatic bullet point). “‼️ Tornado spotted just outside of town.

Put it at the end of dramatic rhetorical questions, statements or news you can hardly believe, or anything that makes you scratch your head. You can use it for serious scenarios (“The dog ran away⁉️”) or pair it with more lighthearted statements for a comical or intentionally exaggerated effect (“You forgot to buy milk⁉️”). “So we’re just gonna let people straight up lie on the news now⁉️” “My nephew is already 3⁉️ Time sure does fly!”"

Save this emoji for close friends, family, and/or your romantic interests (it might be misleading to send it to someone outside of your close circle). “Happy anniversary to the best husband a gal could ask for ❣️” “I can’t wait to see you later❣️ I’ve been looking forward to going out all week!”"

The bright red color draws attention and gives the question or thought a small sense of urgency (but not as much as a ❗ emoji, though). [8] X Research source Use it at the end of a sentence to emphasize your question or respond to a confusing message with ❓ to show you have no idea what’s going on. “Did you know❓ Newborn zebras can stand up after only 6 minutes!” “Can we go out for ice cream PLEASE❓” Them: “Duis congue sem tuum Latine possum effingo?” You: “...❓”"

Can you answer your portion of the homework ❔s so we can turn in the assignment?” “❔ Did you send out invites for the surprise party❔We gotta do that soon!”"
