      "title": "Sun in Scorpio",
      "content": "Sun in Scorpio In astrology, your sun sign represents your core identity and personality. [3] X Research source Drake’s sun is in the mysterious, brooding water sign, Scorpio . Scorpios are known for their emotional depth and intensity, as well as their secretive nature. [4] X Research source Drake has a Scorpio stellium, which means that 3 or more of his planets are in this sign. This means that Drake has seriously strong Scorpio energy. [5] X Research source He even named his fifth studio album Scorpion. It's likely not a coincidence that The Scorpion is the official symbol of Scorpio! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Moon in Cancer",
      "content": "Moon in Cancer According to expert astrologer Stina Garbis, your moon sign “determines emotional states and moods.” Drake’s moon is in sensitive water sign, Cancer. Cancer moons feel their emotions very deeply, and they’re also very creative. [7] X Research source This makes perfect sense for someone like Drake, who seems to channel his intense emotions into the artistic outlet of his music. Cancer moons are also romantic, sentimental, and nostalgic. This energy is clear on several of Drake’s more vulnerable tracks, like “Hold On We’re Going Home,” and “Take Care.”"

      "content": "Ascendant in Leo Your ascendant, also called your rising sign , represents your outward personality and the way you present yourself to the world. [8] X Research source Drake’s rising sign is in bold fire sign, Leo. Leo risings are known for being confident, outgoing, and showy. They’ve got huge personalities and aren’t afraid to be the center of attention! [9] X Research source The combination of an ascendant in bold Leo and a moon in sensitive Cancer also makes sense for Drake, whose signature style as a rapper is a mix of bravado coupled with emotional vulnerability.

      "title": "Mercury in Scorpio",
      "content": "Mercury in Scorpio Your mercury sign governs the way you think and communicate. [11] X Research source Drake’s Mercury sign is also in Scorpio. Those who have a Scorpio Mercury are known for getting down to the nitty gritty. They hate superficiality and prefer to focus on deep, profound truths. They’re also very direct communicators who will tell it like it is, without worrying about other peoples’ feelings. [12] X Research source This depth and honesty is present in much of Drake’s music. Along with his fun, dance-y tunes, Drake has tons of intense, bluntly truthful songs on deep topics like heartbreak, public feuds, and his opinion of himself."

      "title": "Venus in Scorpio",
      "content": "Venus in Scorpio Your Venus sign reveals how you receive and express love. [13] X Research source Drake’s Venus is (yet again!) in moody, magnetic Scorpio. For those with Venus in Scorpio, romantic relationships are serious business. They love intensely, and when they fall for someone, they’re in it for the long haul. They look for a soulmate, rather than a casual fling. [14] X Research source Considering the plethora of songs he has about love and heartbreak, such as “Find Your Love,” “Too Good,” and “Marvin’s Room,” Drake's Scorpio Venus makes perfect sense!"

      "title": "Mars in Aquarius",
      "content": "Mars in Aquarius According to Stina Garbis, your Mars sign represents “how you get angry.” Drake’s Mars is in the inventive, individualistic air sign, Aquarius. When an Aquarius Mars gets fired up, they tend to use their logic and their words to fight back. [15] X Research source They often need to explore their anger as a concept through discussion or creative outlets to move on. [16] X Research source This makes perfect sense for someone like Drake, who has used his lyrics to respond to other rappers and celebrities he’s publicly feuded with. He has written and released several \"diss tracks,\" which seems to be a way for him to explore and express his frustrations. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "The element of water is dominant in Drake’s birth chart. In fact, 6 of his astrological placements (sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Pluto) are water signs! In astrology, water signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are known for their deep sensitivity. They’re also very intuitive and creative. [18] X Research source Because they’re so imaginative and in touch with their emotions, water-dominant people often end up being artists. With this in mind, it’s no surprise that a talented musician like Drake has so many water placements!"

      "content": "Drake’s chart has a predominance of the fixed modality. In astrology, fixed signs Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius are known for their steady and hardworking natures. When they have a goal, they push toward it determinedly until they achieve it! [19] X Research source This perseverance and determination is clear in Drake’s incredibly long and successful music career—he’s had 13 #1 hits and won 5 Grammys over the past 13 years!

      "content": "The 3rd and 4th houses are dominant in Drake’s birth chart. In fact, he has a stellium (3 or more planets) in each of these houses. The Third House is the house of communication, so those with a Third House stellium have excellent communication skills. [21] X Research source The Fourth House is the house of home and family, so those with a Fourth House stellium tend to value security and stability in their home lives. [22] X Research source These placements mean that Drake likely values romantic partnership and family very deeply, and that he is great at communicating effectively with the people in his life."
