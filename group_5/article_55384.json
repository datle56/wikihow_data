      "title": "Deep-rooting grass has a higher chance of survival.",
      "content": "Deep-rooting grass has a higher chance of survival. When you’re buying grass seed, stay away from anything with short, shallow roots, like fine fescue, since it will likely get torn up by your dog. Instead, go for hearty grasses like: [1] X Research source Tall fescue Kentucky bluegrass Bermuda grass"

      "title": "Use a rake to stir up the soil and make grass more likely to stick.",
      "content": "Use a rake to stir up the soil and make grass more likely to stick. Grab a hard rake and gently go over the bare areas that don’t have grass growing. Till the top 1 in (2.5 cm) of the soil so the seeds can put down roots. [2] X Research source If you have any dead or dying grass in your yard, use the rake to rake up the dead grass and remove it. Then, you can rake the soil underneath to get it ready for reseeding."

    {
      "title": "Potting soil",
      "content": "Potting soil helps the grass seed stick to the ground better. To prepare your grass seed, mix a handful of seed with a handful of potting soil. If you’re covering a large area, mix a 1:1 ratio of potting soil and grass seed before spreading it. [3] X Research source Potting soil also adds valuable nutrients to the ground to help grass seed grow."

      "title": "Pat the seed into the soil so it sticks.",
      "content": "Pat the seed into the soil so it sticks. Sprinkle the ground with your grass seed mixture, then gently tamp the seed down into the soil. Use your hands or your feet to pat it down until the area is mostly flat. [4] X Research source Grass seed is very hearty, so it will have no problem growing roots and establishing itself as long as it makes contact with bare soil."

    {
      "title": "Water the grass seed every day to help it grow.",
      "content": "Water the grass seed every day to help it grow. Grass takes a lot of water, especially during warmer months. As the grass grows, water it every day, and make sure the dirt around it never dries out. [5] X Research source Consider using an automatic sprinkler system so you don’t have to worry about remembering to water. Plus, motion-activated sprinklers may help keep dogs off your lawn."

    {
      "title": "Cover the grass seed so it has time to put down roots.",
      "content": "Cover the grass seed so it has time to put down roots. After you’ve planted the seeds, cover them with a thin layer of straw or hay to lock in moisture and keep the seed from being washed away. Straw and hay provide some protection, but they probably won’t hold up against multiple dogs walking through the area every day. [6] X Research source Straw and hay also helps avoid wet soil and mud during the rainy season. If you do have multiple dogs walking through the area every day, use other methods mentioned below to keep them away from the area."

      "title": "Take your dogs to 1 specific area away from new grass.",
      "content": "Take your dogs to 1 specific area away from new grass. When your dogs have to go potty outside, lead them to a section of your yard where you aren’t growing new grass. [7] X Research source If you have the space to do so, you could even build a dog run to keep them in 1 fenced off location. If your dogs are used to roaming free in the yard, take them out on a leash the first few times and lead them to their new potty area."

      "title": "Put up a fence to keep dogs off of new grass.",
      "content": "Put up a fence to keep dogs off of new grass. Putting a barrier around your grass ensures that dogs (and humans) won’t disturb it. A temporary fence made of chicken wire will protect your lawn until the grass seed is established. [8] X Research source For a more permanent option, build a fence by digging post holes, installing the posts, and filling them in with concrete. Then, add either wood or chain link to connect the posts."

      "title": "Remove waste from your lawn to avoid more damage.",
      "content": "Remove waste from your lawn to avoid more damage. Your dogs are going to do their business on your lawn, but you can still maintain green, luscious grass! When they go number 2, pick up the poop right away and throw it out. When they pee, flood the area with water as soon as possible to wash away urine and stop the grass from turning yellow. [9] X Research source If urine spots are a big concern, consider using a pet spot repair treatment on your lawn. Repair treatments help neutralize the acidity of urine and provide nutrients so the grass can grow."
