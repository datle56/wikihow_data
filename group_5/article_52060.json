      "title": "Pull out the screen.",
      "content": "Pull out the screen. Locate the lint screen on your dryer. It may be at the top, on the side, or at the bottom of the dryer door. Check the screen and clean it of lint every time before you place a load inside. Grab the handle of the screen and pull it out until it is fully extended. In most models, you will be able to remove it entirely for cleaning. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Only apply gentle pressure when pulling out the screen. You should meet with little to no resistance. If you bend the screen too much, it may not fit back properly into the lint trap area."

    {
      "title": "Wipe off the lint with your hands.",
      "content": "Wipe off the lint with your hands. Run your hands over the screen until you gather a small ball of lint. Then, rub this lint ball across the screen, as it will attract the leftover lint. Keep going until you can see through the screen without any blockages. Toss the gathered lint in the trash. [2] X Research source Instead of your hand, rubbing a cleaning brush across the surface of the screen will gather the lint just as well. However, just make sure to discard the lint pulled from the screen, as it could present a fire hazard. [3] X Research source Placing a vacuum brush attachment against the screen is another way to remove the lint."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the screen off with water.",
      "content": "Rinse the screen off with water. After you’ve pulled the screen out all the way, remove the extra lint and then run it under some water in the sink. If the screen is especially dusty, apply a bit of soap to the surface as well. Keep rinsing until the screen is clean and clear. [4] X Research source It is not necessary to complete the step after each load, but it is a good idea to do a rinse every few weeks. This is especially the case if you use dryer sheets, as they can leave a residue on the screen’s surface."

      "title": "Vacuum out the screen vent.",
      "content": "Vacuum out the screen vent. While the screen is out, peer into the lint trap. If you see any extra lint or debris, get out the extended vacuum attachment. Stick this attachment into the trap area, turn it on, and remove any materials present. Taking this extra step may prevent a clog from forming in the trap area. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Repeat after each use.",
      "content": "Repeat after each use. Before you place a fresh load into the dryer, make sure to fully clean the screen and trap. This will help to keep lint and debris from making its way further into the machine. It might be easy to ignore the practice for smaller loads, but continue with it regardless of load size.

      "content": "Unplug your dryer. Reach around to the back of your dryer and detach the power cord. It is necessary to cut off the electricity to your dryer at this point, as you will be moving the machine around and possibly opening up some of the interior panels. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the exhaust hose.",
      "content": "Remove the exhaust hose. Shimmy the dryer away from the wall and look at the back of the machine. Locate the exhaust hose and loosen it from dryer by loosening the outward “o-ring” clamp. You may be able to simply squeeze the clamp to remove it, but other styles require that you use a screwdriver to loosen a bolt at the center of the clamp. Pull the hose away from the dryer and from the wall port. [8] X Research source Make sure to loosen the clamps on both sides of the hose prior to trying to remove it. Otherwise, you could damage the connection to the port and make it more difficult to replace afterwards. [9] X Research source Most clamps require a flathead screwdriver for the bolt. You may want to call in an appliance professional if your dryer connection is older and connected to gas. Moving around the machine could cause gas leaks. [10] X Research source"

Take a cleaning brush and gently wipe off the interior. Or, stick your vacuum attachment inside and suck out the lint. Set the newly cleaned vent aside. [11] X Research source"

This kit will contain a brush attached to an extended arm that is then connected to a drill or used alone. Following the package’s directions, slowly feed the brush into the vent. Continue to gently push, rotating as needed, until you’ve cleaned the entire inside of the vent. [12] X Research source Rotate and spin the brush multiple times in order to get the most lint out. Also, pull the brush out of the vent entirely multiple times and clean off any accumulated lint before reinserting it."

Remove the screen and set it aside. Reach inside the vent with your hand and gather any lint sitting nearby. Then, use a small vacuum or brush to clean out the lint a bit deeper inside. Make sure to carefully re-secure the vent in order to keep any pests at bay. [14] X Research source"
