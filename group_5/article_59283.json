      "content": "Measure your old nose pads. Nose pads are typically measured in millimeters and this size refers to the length of the nose pads. Measure across the longest part of 1 pad with a ruler or tape measure marked with millimeters. For D-shaped nose pads, for example, you would measure from the top of the D to the bottom of the D rather than across the D. Nose pad sizes range from 6 to 24 millimetres (0.24 to 0.94 in)."

      "title": "Purchase replacements that are the same size and shape as your old nose pads.",
      "content": "Purchase replacements that are the same size and shape as your old nose pads. In addition to size differences, nose pads come in a variety of shapes like teardrop, rectangle, circle, or D-shaped. Look for the same size and shape online, at your local drugstore, an optical shop, or your ophthalmologist's office. Nose pads are also offered in a variety of materials including: glass, plastic, rubber, ceramic, and silicone. Consider trying silicone for comfort even if your old nose pads are made from another material. You can purchase replacement nose pads in a kit that also includes a little screwdriver, magnifying glass, cloth, and screws. If you don’t purchase a kit, you will need a jeweler’s flat head screwdriver."

Place the screwdriver gently into the groove and rotate the screwdriver to the left until the screw is loose enough to pull out. Remove the nose pad from the mount. [1] X Research source You can reuse the screw if you’d like but check to make sure the threads aren’t stripped and the head is intact."

If you find this difficult, try using a pair of tweezers instead of your fingers to hold on to the nose pad.

The most common nose pads are D-shaped or oval but there are also circular, square, and teardrop shaped nose pads.

Snap-on nose pads can also be referred to as push-in or click-in style nose pads."

If your nose pads are D-shaped, make sure the flat edge faces away from the face. [7] X Research source"
