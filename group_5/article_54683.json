      "content": "Frfr means “for real for real.” “For real for real” conveys a sense of sincerity in your words; it adds extra emphasis to what you’re saying. On the other hand, it can also express disbelief or curiosity. It’s an acronym often used in direct messages, texts, and social media posts—either in uppercase (FRFR) or lowercase (frfr), although lowercase is more common. [1] X Research source “FR” is also a common acronym that simply means “For real.” “FRFR” has the same overall uses and meaning as “FR”—it’s basically a more intense version of “FR.” Keep in mind that FRFR and FR aren’t appropriate in professional messages or in the workplace. They work best in casual, personal texts and messages!"

      "content": "Emphasize your point in a message. When you’re texting someone and want to highlight whatever you’re saying, you can use FRFR. Using “Frfr” is a lot like using “seriously” or “genuinely” to stress the importance of your words. For example: [2] X Research source “I need to play this game, it looks amazing frfr!” “I wanna hang out but I frfr need to study tonight.”"

      "content": "Indicate when you’re being serious or totally honest. If someone seems skeptical about what you’re saying or thinks you’re joking around, use “frfr” to tell them you’re being completely sincere. It’s a handy acronym to use when it’s important for someone to believe you! [3] X Research source Them : “You’re not seriously staying home tonight right?” You : “No, I am frfr. I have a lot of chores to get done.”"

      "title": "Tell someone that you agree with them.",
      "content": "Tell someone that you agree with them. You can use “frfr” to express agreement or confirm a statement when chatting with someone. It’s basically like telling someone you’re on the same page as them, saying, “I totally agree” or “I agree 100%!” For example: Them : “ Wicked is my favorite musical of all time!” You : “Yeah, frfr! It’s so good!”"

Use “frfr” to indicate when you’re skeptical about something, or simply curious and want more information. For example: [5] X Research source Them : “Ben and Sam just broke up!” You : “Frfr? Wait, what happened??”"

      "content": "React honestly to whatever they’re emphasizing. If you’re texting someone who uses “frfr” to emphasize a point, respond with sincerity (since “frfr” indicates sincerity itself). You might agree, disagree, or have some other genuine reaction to whatever they’re saying. Them : “I need to play this game, it looks amazing frfr!” You : “It is! I’m loving the combat and graphics especially.”"

If the other person uses FRFR to agree with you, that’s a great excuse to talk more about a common interest and have a more in-depth discussion! You might even learn you have other things in common, too. For example: You : “I like Star Wars more than Star Trek .” Them : “Me too frfr!” You : “Oh cool! What’s your fav SW movie or show? I have a soft spot for The Empire Strikes Back .”"

When you see “frfr” next to a request for seriousness or no more joking around, it might be a sign that the other person is getting slightly exasperated. So, it’s usually best to listen to them and offer a genuine or direct response to whatever they’re talking about. Them : “Can we frfr get serious and talk about this project for class?” You : “Yeah, for sure, sorry. I’ll send you a couple of ideas I came up with!”"

      "content": "Full range, flat response Full range flat response speakers (or FRFR speakers) are speakers often used with electric guitars, resembling PA speakers more than traditional guitar cabinets. They’re self-contained systems that can handle any tone or frequency fed into it from an amp and emulate signals as cleanly as possible. You’ll likely know if someone uses FRFR to refer to a speaker when they mention music, guitars, or speakers or write FRFR as a noun. For example: “Time to get a new speaker. I’m looking at an FRFR model!” “I prefer FRFR speakers to other varieties, not gonna lie.”"

      "content": "France “FR” is actually a shorthand for France (or, sometimes, the French language). If a website prompts you to select a language, you might be able to click on “FR” to read the entire site in French—or, if the website’s content varies by region, selecting the “FR” option can bring you to a French version of the site. Many French websites also end in “.fr” (instead of “.com”). [6] X Research source When prompted to choose a language or select a French variant of a website, you’ll usually also see the French flag (or its colors) to indicate that “FR” is French. France no longer uses francs as currency (it now uses Euros), but before 2002, “FR” was also shorthand for “francs.”"

Finally, around 2010, FRFR (“for real for real”) got its own entry on Urban Dictionary and started to grow in popularity. [7] X Research source The original phrase, “For real,” was used in tons of movies and songs throughout the 90s and 2000s before its acronym or “frfr” became popular."
