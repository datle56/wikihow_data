      "content": "While you can generally prune nandinas any time of the year, winter is the best time to prune. Not only is the plant dormant, but you can use the pruned stems in floral arrangements. The combination of bright green leaves and red berries is quite festive. If you cannot prune the nandina during winter, you can prune it during early spring before the white flowers develop. If you cut those off, you won't get the berries! [2] X Research source Use bypass pruning shears on shoots that are thinner than 3 ‚ÅÑ 4 inch (1.9 cm). You will then need to switch to lopping shears for thicker branches. Both tools must be sharp in order to reduce wounding. You can purchase these in a hardware store or in a garden supply shop. Warning: Keep children and pet away from the nandina while pruning, as the leaves and berries are toxic to consume. Their bright colors can make them look appealing to children and pets who are curious or don't know any better. If you decide to bring the cuttings indoors to use in arrangements, be sure to keep them out of reach of children and pets."

The most visually-appealing formation for nandinas is the \"stair-step\" formation, where you cut the outer stems shorter than the central ones. It will also help with the formation of new shoots.

      "content": "Prune the oldest, longest stems to a third of their length. Cut the next couple of stems down to half their length. Trim the rest of the stems to a quarter of their original length. Intermix cuts to give the bushes a fuller look. If you are working on an older plant, prune one-third of the old growth."

      "content": "Fertilizing after pruning is recommended because it provides a needed dose of nutrients to the plant and helps it get ready for the upcoming growing season. Once you clear away the pruned stems and leaves, try to fertilize that same day, or within a couple of days."
