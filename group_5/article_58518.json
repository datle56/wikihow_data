You should pick a spot that is not visited by other dogs and is easy to clean up. Your puppy will remember the smell of urine and start to associate the area as its \"bathroom.\" Pick an area that is easy to get to quickly. You will be visiting this area frequently during the training process. Until your puppy has had its third set of vaccines, you should avoid areas where other dogs go or have recently gone, such as parks. Itâ€™s a good idea to discuss this with your veterinarian. When taking your dog outside, it's a good idea to keep it on a leash so you can teach it to go in a specific location. You can also more easily keep an eye on the dog, so you'll know when it is done."

For example, If your puppy is a tiny little chihuahua, their bladder will be very small and they will need to urinate more frequently; accidents will happen even if they are well trained. Although most dogs are highly intelligent, they don't think like humans do. It is often a problem when we expect them to understand simple command words or tell you that they need to pee or poop. For this reason, you must be willing to understand how they communicate with you and study the clues they give and get from you."

To encourage your dog to patiently hold and wait until you allow them to go they must first enjoy it.

If you catch your puppy in the act of urinating or defecating indoors, make a sudden noise such as a clap, and say the word \"no.\" Then, quickly lead the dog outside. [6] X Research source You want to startle but not to scare the dog. The intent here is to get their immediate attention and know that you disapprove marking or pooping indoors. You also want to be consistent, using the same word and/or noise each time. You may not get the same result if the dog is defecating, because most puppies will not be able to stop this. But, you should still do the same thing as part of the teaching process. Never punish your puppy for accidents. The dog does not know it is doing anything wrong. Do not force your puppy to smell or keep reminding them of their actions. They will not remember and could possibly become scared of you. When you use punishment to stop them from going indoors it can confuse your dog and even make it worse. Your dog could only understand that you get mad when you see them potty and will hide from you when they need to go, most likely in places that are hard to reach for you."

Use an enzymatic cleaner, not one that contains ammonia. This will help to get rid of the odor and the dog's attraction to the area.

You can also use white vinegar to counteract the smell of ammonia."

Be sure to pick an area that has fast, easy access to the outdoors. A room with a door leading straight outside is best. Picking an area that is easy to clean is also a good idea.
