      "content": "Check your current clock speed. To determine if you need to enable XMP, check your current clock speed against what your RAM is supposed to run at. You'll need to know what your RAM's maximum clock speed is, which is provided by your RAM's manufacturer. Right click the taskbar and select Task Manager . Click on More details to expand your Task Manager view, then click on Performance > Memory . In the bottom right of the window, check what speed your RAM is running at. For example, if your RAM's maximum clock speed is 3200MHz and your RAM runs at anything lower than that, you will likely want to enable XMP to get the most out of your hardware."
