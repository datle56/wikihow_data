      "content": "Add gunpowder to any potion to turn it into a splash potion. You must first brew the desired potion , then combine it with gunpowder to turn it into a splash potion. [1] X Research source If you use gunpowder on a bottle of water you'll get a splash water bottle. If you're playing on Minecraft Education or with the \"Education\" option enabled in Bedrock Edition, you cannot turn Antidotes, Elixirs, Eye Drops, or Tonics into splash potions. [2] X Research source If you use a glass bottle on a cauldron that has a splash potion in it, you'll get a bottle of that splash potion."

      "content": "There are two alternative ways to get certain splash potions. You can get one splash potion of weakness from a brewing stand in an igloo basement, and Piglins have a 1.74% chance of bartering a splash potion of Fire Resistance when you give them a gold ingot."

      "title": "Splash potions are used by throwing them.",
      "content": "Splash potions are used by throwing them. Splash potions will heal, damage, or give a status effect to all creatures within 8 blocks of the impact. The creature that is hit by the splash potion will take the full duration and potency of the status effect. Creatures that are farther away will still be affected, but the effect will have reduced duration or potency depending on the type of splash potion used. In Bedrock Edition, splash potions last for 75% of the duration of the drinkable potion. In Java Edition, status effects have the same duration for drinkable and throwable potions. Splash water bottles will do a half heart of damage to endermen, striders, snow golems, and blazes. Endermen have a chance of teleporting away if hit by a splash water bottle. Undead mobs (including drowned, husks, skeletons, withers , wither skeletons, zombies, and more) will take damage from splash potions of Healing, will be healed by splash potions of Harming, and are immune to splash potions of Poison and Regeneration. [3] X Research source Splash potions cannot be drunk, and the bottle holding them is destroyed when they're thrown."

      "content": "Splash water bottles can be used for more than damaging enemies. Splash water bottles can also be used to extinguish fires and create mud. When thrown on a fire, splash water bottles will extinguish the block it hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it. Splash water bottles will also extinguish a burning creature. Splash water bottles can be used on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt to create mud."

      "content": "Splash potions can fill cauldrons in Bedrock Edition. If you use a splash potion on a cauldron, it will add one level of that potion to the cauldron. If the cauldron is filled with water, dyed water, or a potion that doesn't match the splash potion, it will empty the cauldron. This will also result in an explosion sound, but no actual explosion will happen."
