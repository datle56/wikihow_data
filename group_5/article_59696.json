      "content": "Tatakau (戦う) means “to fight” as in a battle or physical struggle. The word tatakau (戦う) features the Japanese kanji symbol “ikusa” (戦), which means “war,” “battle,” or “fight.” [1] X Research source It can also be spelled as “tatakae” (闘え), which uses “tataka” (闘), a kanji symbol that also means “fight.” [2] X Research source You might recognize the word “tatakae” (闘え) from the anime Attack on Titan , when the protagonist Eren yells the word to himself in a mirror."

      "content": "Kenka suru (喧嘩する) means “to fight” as in an argument or heated discussion. This verb stems from the word “kenka” (喧嘩), which directly translates to “quarrel,” “fight,” “squabble,” or “argument.” When paired with “suru” (する), the Japanese verb “to do,” the word becomes “喧嘩する,” or “to argue” or “to fight.” [3] X Research source Example: “Buraian-san to Kurisu-san wa kinou kenkashimashita” (ブライアンさんと クリスンさは 喧嘩しました) means “Bryan and Chris had an argument yesterday.” The verb “arasou” (争う) can also mean “to quarrel,” “to argue,” or “to fight.” This word can also mean “to compete” or “to contend.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Tatakai (戦い) and sentou (戦闘): “fight” or “battle.” “Tatakai” (戦い) sounds familiar, right? That’s because it’s the noun form of “tatakau” (戦う), the verb for “to fight.” “Tatakai” also has the war kanji “ikusa” (戦) in it, which gives it the same meaning. [5] X Research source The word “sentou” (戦闘) also means “fight” or “battle”—it also has the war kanji, along with the “tataka” (闘) kanji that means “war.” [6] X Research source Example: “Tatakai wa kyo hajimarimasu” (戦いは今日始まります) translates to “The fight begins today.”"

      "content": "Faito (ファイト): a motivational cheer used to encourage someone. Although “faito” (ファイト) comes from the English word “fight,” it doesn’t refer to a physical brawl. Instead, it carries the same sentiment as “good luck” or “go for it.” [7] X Research source Example: “Kyou no shiai faito!” (今日の試合ファイト!) translates to “Good luck with today’s game!” Since “faito” is borrowed from the English word “fight,” it’s spelled using katakana, a Japanese alphabet dedicated to loan (non-Japanese) words."

In many contexts, the word “fight” or “fighting” tends to mean “do your best,” “good luck,” “go for it,” and “don’t give up.” Some popular examples of motivational “fighting” phrases include: [8] X Research source Gambatte kudasai (頑張ってください) - do your best Murihashinaide ne (無理はしないでね) - don’t overwork yourself Genki wo dashite (元気を出して) - cheer up Akiramenaide (諦めないで) - don’t give up Kimi nara dekiru yo (君なら出来るよ) - you can do it Sono ikida (その意気だ) - keep up the good work"

The word “gambatte” (頑張って) comes from the verb “gambaru” (頑張る), which means “to persevere” or “to do one’s best.” When paired with “kudasai” (ください), which means “please,” the phrase becomes a polite way of saying “Do your best!” [9] X Research source “Ganbare” (頑張れ) is another form of this phrase—it’s usually spoken by someone of a high social position to someone of a lower social position (like a boss to an employee). “Ganba” (がんば) is a really casual form of “gambatte kudasai” (頑張ってください) that you’d use to support a close friend or loved one.

[12] X Research source Example 1: “Ai-san nara dekiru yo!” (愛さんなら出来るよ!) translates to “You can do it, Ai!” Example 2: “Sensei nara dekimasu yo!” (先生なら出来ますよ) translates “You can do it, teacher!”"
