      "content": "Find the valves by following the 2 large hoses running out of the water softener. Locate the water softener, then look for 2 large hoses running out of it, normally either out of the side or the back. These are the inlet and outlet hoses for water moving through the softener. Follow them to lead you to the bypass valve. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that the bypass valve may be on the other side of a wall or in a cupboard, but if you keep following the hoses they will eventually lead you to it. If you don’t know where the water softener is located, check near the water supply inlet for the building. This might be in the basement or garage and is usually near the water heater."

      "content": "Close the inlet and outlet valves connected to the 2 hoses. The inlet and outlet valves are the 2 plastic knobs located where the 2 hoses connect to the rest of the piping. Turn them 90 degrees so they are perpendicular to the hoses in order to close them. [2] X Research source The knobs have something like wings on the sides that will show you which way they are turned. When the wings are running across the piping they are closed and when they are running in line with the piping they are open."

      "content": "Open the bypass valve by turning it so the handle is in line with the pipe. The bypass valve is the third valve located between the inlet and outlet valves on the main pipe. Turn it 90 degrees so the wings run parallel to the main pipe to open it and start bypassing the water softener. [3] X Research source The water system is now just running the normal water service without sending anything to the water softener."

      "title": "Locate the bypass valve near the tubes running off the water softener.",
      "content": "Locate the bypass valve near the tubes running off the water softener. Look for a lever-like valve near the inlet and outlet tubes of the water softener. There will usually be 2 labels that say “bypass” and “service,” or something similar, as well as an arrow showing which setting it is on. [5] X Research source If you don’t see a printed arrow that indicates which setting the lever handle is on, then look for a small metal point on the side that lines up with either “bypass” or “service.” Water softeners are usually located near the water supply inlet. This could be in the basement or garage of the building and is typically near where the water heater is located."

      "content": "Turn the valve to the “bypass” position to shut off soft water service. Rotate the lever handle 90 degrees until the arrow indicates that it is set to bypass. Make sure it is turned all the way to bypass so you know that the softener service is completely turned off. [6] X Research source The inlet and outlet valves for the water softener will now be shut and water will not be directed through the water softener."

      "content": "Return the valve to the “service” position to start softening water again. Turn the lever handle back 90 degrees in the direction you originally turned it from until the arrow indicates that soft water service is on again. Double-check that it is turned as far as it can go in that direction to ensure service is fully on. [7] X Research source This will open the inlet and outlet valves again and redirect water through the water softener."

Locate a push knob labeled with “bypass” or “on/off.” [8] X Research source There are 2 main types of push valves. The first type is called a “push-push” valve and functions by pushing it in from 1 side and then pushing it back out from the other side. The second type is a “push-pull” valve and functions by pushing it in from 1 side and pulling it back out from the same side. If you aren’t sure where the water softener is located, check near the water heater. Water softeners are usually installed near the water supply inlet for the building, which is often in a basement or garage."
