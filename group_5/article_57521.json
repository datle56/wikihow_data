When you talk to him, only give him a little bit of information about yourself at a time and leave some details to the imagination. He'll end up thinking about you when you're gone and will likely blow up your phone with follow-up questions. If he asks you what you're up to, only give him a little bit of information. Say something like, \"I'm catching a movie with some friends ðŸ˜Š.\" He'll be left wanting to know more, like what movie you saw. On a date, give only a few details about your past instead of revealing your whole life story. You might say something like, \"I grew up here, but I've lived all over.\" When he's home from your date, he'll think of you and wonder about all the places you've lived."
