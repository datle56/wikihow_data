      "content": "Adjust the bar to fit you. Make sure there are no weighs on the bar and lift it up. Then, move the bar back or forward to unhook it from the hook, then place it on a hook that is just below your shoulders. Along with adjusting the bar, every Smith Machine has safety hooks. You can adjust these hooks so if there is ever a time you are unable to return to a stand-up position the safety hooks will catch the bar preventing injury."
