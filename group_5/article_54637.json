Don’t be afraid to feel your emotional pain, like hurt, sadness, and even anger. Identifying your feelings helps you regulate them, and prevents you from pushing them down in an unhealthy way.” [3] X Expert Source Rachel Eddins, M.Ed., LPC-S Licensed Professional Counselor Expert Interview. 23 March 2022."

If the person who traumatized you hasn’t shown any remorse or even said they’re sorry, they might not react well to you telling them you forgive them.

Talking to someone like that can put more stress on you than it’s worth.

For instance, if you used to see them in person often, stick to phone calls and text messages for now. In cases of severe trauma, you may need to cut contact with them for good . Forgiveness is something you can do on your own without talking to the other person at all. You could also remind the person that you forgave them once, but you might not be able to forgive them again."
