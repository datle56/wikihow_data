As you start gaining strength and building muscle, keep track of how much weight you gain, how much weight you can lift, and what exercises you do from week to week. This will help you figure out what works for your body and what doesn't, and keep you from getting into a workout rut. [1] X Research source If you find that a certain muscle group doesn't seem to be making significant gains, switch up your exercises to see if something else works better. Alter your diet as necessary to help you lose fat and gain muscle. Experiment with different ratios of protein, fats and carbohydrates to find a balance that helps you achieve your weight and fitness goals."

Don't push yourself too hard, or you may find yourself sitting on the couch with a pulled muscle instead of at the gym training to failure. [2] X Research source Sleeping well is another essential aspect of gaining mass and strength in a healthy way. Try to get seven to nine hours per day."

[5] X Research source Do six to eight reps and three to four sets. Rest for about 45 seconds in between sets. To increase the difficulty of this exercise, bend at the waist, grasp the weights, rise to a standing position, then pull the weights up to your chest and press them over your head.

Rather than training your entire body during each session, it's a good idea to split up your muscle groups so that some parts of your body have time to rest while others are getting a workout.

      "title": "Train to failure.",
      "content": "Train to failure. Bodybuilders have found that training in short, intense sessions leads to greater mass and strength than easier, longer sessions. \"Training to failure\" means doing an exercise until you can't physically repeat it one more time. You'll need to find the appropriate train to failure weight for each of your muscle groups to do this effectively. To find your train to failure weight, choose a weight you can use for six to eight reps before your muscles give out. If you can do 10 reps without breaking a sweat or feeling too fatigued, you need to add weight. If you can't even do one or two reps correctly, reduce the weight. Attempting to lift too much weight before you've gotten strong enough to lift it can damage your muscles, and it's also counterproductive. Start with your appropriate train to failure weight and give your muscles time to build strength. Soon you'll find that the weight you've been using has become easy; when that happens, increase the weight by 5 or 10 pounds until you're back to the six to eight rep sweet spot."

If you don't, you'll risk injuring your muscles, and you also won't be training as effectively as you could be. Consider working with a personal trainer to learn good technique and keep these pointers in mind during your training sessions: [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should be able to complete each exercise using the right technique. If you can't press your dumbbells over your head with your arms fully extended, for example, then you should probably be using less weight. Another option for difficult exercises is to begin with a reduced range of motion. Gradually increase your range of motion until you are able to complete the exercise's full range of motion. Do not increase the amount of weight you use until you are able to do this. Don't use momentum to swing your weights into place. Lift with controlled, steady movements. Lower weights back to their starting position slowly rather than letting them drop. Slowing down the eccentric (downward) portion of an exercise can help build muscle."
