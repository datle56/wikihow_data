A 1x4 piece of oak actually measures 3 1/2\" in width, which is fine. Buy an 8 foot (2.4 m) length (for beginners, in case there are mistakes)."

      "content": "To cut the wood, and seeing that the flag is triangular in shape, cut the angles on a 45 degree . You can do this with a circular saw or a chop saw (miter saw). [1] X Research source Chop saws give a much better cut. [2] X Research source The bottom measurement of the flag is 24\", so the inside measurement of the 45 degree cuts must be at least 24\". I recommend cutting the length of 1/4. (little play room for glass and flag). You should have approx. 6 feet (1.8 m) of board left. As you know, wood has a grain pattern. What follows now will give your case more of a professional look."

      "content": "Measure off the longest portion of the angled 6' board (that's your long point of that particular angle, the other is the short point of that particular angle). Your angled measurements are 16 3/4\", short point to short point. However, you will be cutting it 3\" longer than that (for mistakes), so lets just cut our side pieces 20\" long. short to short. Measure off the 6' board from long point 20\". Using a speed square or framing square, make a mark and cut your piece. (set this piece aside) The longer remaining piece should have a short point."

      "content": "Your objective now is to turn that piece around 180 degrees, and cut the short point again in order to make it a long point. Once you do this, your two 45 degree angles at the top of the display case will fit and the grain will match. it will look continuous. (Match up all the angled pieces until you find that grain match). When you place the bottom piece up to the angled side pieces to form the triangle, you will notice that the side pieces are too long. Just pencil mark the bottom where it hangs over the bottom piece. That now is going to be cut at a 45 degree. Make sure you cut the 45 degree angle the correct way, your end product should be a short to short angled piece. If it helps; when you are marking the piece to be cut, also mark the side of the board so you know for sure, which way the wood should be cut."

      "content": "Measure the size of glass you will need. [3] X Research source We can measure the glass in two ways: The exact size, minus 1/8th inch. (if there is going to be a wooden corner cover over the glass and attach it to the frame.) or We can measure the glass 1/4\" larger if we are going to insert it into the frame. Buy an 8' piece of wooden corner board (for outside corners of walls) it is 3/4\" long on each side of the 45 degree angle. Cut this to fit the outside of the triangular frame you just made. You can insert the glass from the back side after the glass is inserted, then you can cut and place 3 pieces of 1/4\" x 1/4\" moulding on the inside to hold the glass in place. Inset glass involves using a table saw. If you have one or can use one, this is what you do. [4] X Research source You set your guide that's on the table saw to 1/4\" from the inside of the saw blade to the guide itself. Set the depth of the blade to 1/8th inch. If you know at the beginning that you will be insetting the glass, then cut the entire 8' length of board at one time. It's very difficult to cut small pieces like this and have it turn out correctly. If you have never used a table saw, ask someone that has to preform this next step."
