It involves interpreting the shapes, colors, and odors of incense smoke to gain spiritual and divine insight into a question or situation. It can also be used for meditation and the invocation of spirits. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Smoke patterns There are several different smoke patterns and shapes you might see during a libanomancy reading, and they often tell you things about yourself or your journey. Interpreting smoke patterns can tell you if you’re on the road to success or if you’re likely to face challenges along the way. [8] X Research source Here are some of the most common patterns and their interpretations: Smoke spirals: Smoke spirals reflect spiritual growth. If the smoke spirals up, you’re on the right path. If it spirals down, you may be spiraling out of control. Circles: If the smoke forms a circle, your intentions are set in motion. Expect results soon. Two smoke trails: This indicates a crossroads. You may be feeling stuck and need to choose your path. Clotting: If the smoke clots together, it signifies success. However, if the clot separates from the rest of the smoke, you can expect difficulties."

[9] X Research source Here are some examples: Rises straight up: This is a positive sign or a “yes.” Breaks apart: If the smoke breaks apart or struggles to rise, it represents challenges or a “no.” Travels down: If the smoke travels down or stays near the base of the incense, it’s a warning to change your path. Blows to the left or right: If the smoke blows to the right, you will prevail, and if it blows to the left, you will fail or face challenges. Blows toward you: This is a sign your manifestation is coming your way or that someone is thinking about you. Blows away from you: This indicates you need to work harder for your manifestation to work or that someone is trying to ignore you."

[10] X Research source However, there are some common interpretations you can use to guide yourself: Numbers: Numbers often represent the number of days until a situation arises or your manifestation occurs. They could also signify a specific date. Infinity symbol: Seeing the infinity symbol often means a drastic change is about to occur. Typically, this event will be something good. Sharp objects: If you see something sharp like a fork, a knife, or a trident, this often signifies danger. Take precautions by using a protection spell or carrying obsidian to absorb negative energy."
