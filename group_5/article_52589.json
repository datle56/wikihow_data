      "content": "Add the flour and corn starch a bit at a time, stirring minimally. Traditional batter (in Japan) is made by stirring briefly with a couple of chopsticks. It is okay to leave lumps in the batter and is best not to over-stir the batter as doing so tends to toughen the coating. Make the tempura batter just before use. It is best made fresh and not stored for later use."
