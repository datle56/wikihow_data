      "content": "Skip the cleaning agent and scrape away as much gunk as you can. Opt for a plastic scraper or credit card if the glue is already soft. If the glue isn’t soft, use a razor blade. Guide the edge of the scraper, card, or razor over the glue at a roughly 45- to 75-degree angle. Be careful not to scratch the plastic as you gently wedge the scraper underneath the glue to remove it. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Ahmed Mezil Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. Repeat this process until you get all of the glue residue up. You may not need to use any cleaning agents if you get all of the glue up. However, you may need to apply a cleaner first before scraping the glue away. Do not use a razor blade on any thin materials, matted surfaces, or unprotected plastic."

      "content": "Water and soap is the least abrasive option available. Before you break out any cleaning chemicals or fancy baking soda mixtures, just grab a cloth and dip it in some soapy water. Gently rub the glue with the cloth repeatedly. If it wasn’t a hardcore glue brand, it should come up quite easily. Any mild dish soap will work. Wipe the water and soap off with a clean cloth or paper towel when you’re done."

      "content": "Soak larger glue streaks in vinegar to dissolve the glue. Mezil explains, “Vinegar is always the go-to organic solution for glue. So, I would just soak the area with vinegar .” [3] X Expert Source Ahmed Mezil Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. If you don’t want to endlessly scrub a bigger sticky area, douse a cloth or paper towel in vinegar and lay it over the glue. Leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes, then wipe off the now-loosened residue. Use a plastic scraper, if necessary. [4] X Expert Source Ahmed Mezil Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. Vinegar is a deodorizer but if you really hate the vinegar smell, wash the plastic with soap and warm water. An alternative is to place the plastic in a bowl filled with vinegar to let it soak instead of using a cloth."

      "content": "Any non-acetone-based nail polish remover will work. Acetone-based removers are no good at removing glue and may actually discolor the surface. Take a cotton ball, dip it in your nail polish remover , and then gently blot and wipe the glue. Reload the cotton ball as needed whenever it dries out and rinse the plastic off with water whenever you’re done. [5] X Research source"

Wet a paper towel with the alcohol of choice and just gently rub the residue.” [6] X Expert Source Ahmed Mezil Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021. Vodka, rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol will all work. Continue rubbing it until all of the glue is removed, re-applying the alcohol as needed. [7] X Research source To remove super glue with alcohol, let the liquid sit on the glue for 15 to 30 minutes to dissolve it before trying to scrub it off. Mezil goes on, “Add any stronger alcohol as needed to lift it up.” If typical vodka isn’t doing the trick for example, Everclear should do the trick.

      "content": "If the plastic isn’t porous, these oily products will soften glue. The fat in these foods will erode glue. These foods do contain a lot of oil though, which can seep into porous plastic and stain them. For sturdier plastics, coat the glue spot with a thick layer of mayonnaise or peanut butter and let it sit for 30 minutes before wiping the surface with a clean cloth. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a rubber eraser for thin layers of glue residue. For example, if you’ve already removed a label and there’s just a tiny bit of residue remaining on the plastic, rub an eraser over it. Gently rub repeatedly in the same direction until the glue wears away. [10] X Research source You can use either the small eraser on the end of a pencil or a larger rubber eraser."

Goo-gone is probably the most popular option here, but WD-40 , Lysol , and most standard household cleaners should do the trick.

      "content": "For seriously stubborn glue, baking soda and oil will work. Mix together equal parts oil and baking soda in a small bowl until they form a paste. Use your hands to apply the baking soda and oil, making sure to saturate all of the glue by rubbing in small circles. Wait 30 minutes, then scrub the area with a dampened scouring pad to remove the glue. If any glue remains, use a plastic scraper to wear down the remaining residue. [12] X Research source The baking soda is an exfoliant to scrub off the glue and the oil softens the glue to make it easier to remove. Wash the item with soap and water when you’re done."
