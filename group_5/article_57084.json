      "title": "Allow to dry.",
      "content": "Allow to dry. Once you are happy with your rose, leave to dry in a cool, dry area, to prevent the fondant from becoming sticky, for one day. They can be left for less time, but this is for best results. Avoid storing the fondant roses in the fridge, as that will create condensation on the fondant when you move them to a room-temperature location."
