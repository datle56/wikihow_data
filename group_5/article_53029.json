      "content": "Verify that the intruder is in your home. Be quick about checking and listen carefully. Do you hear noises that are out of the ordinary, like creaking stairs, opening drawers, or whispering? Is there a strange vehicle parked in your driveway? Once you confirm that someone is inside, stay calm so you can decide on the next steps. Do not open your door or confront the intruder because they could react violently. [1] X Research source Text your roommates or family members to see if they might be making the noises. If possible, check your home security cameras on your phone to see if anyone’s inside."

      "title": "See if you can get out of your home safely.",
      "content": "See if you can get out of your home safely. If the intruder is still outside or far away from you, try to escape through a back door, window, or the fire escape ladder. That way, you’ll put greater distance between you and the intruder, reducing the chances of an altercation or serious danger. Once you’re out of your home, hide in your car and call the police. If you’re living with other people, text them that there’s an intruder. Tell them to either lock their door, sneak outside, or get to a designated safe room in your home."

      "title": "Hide in your safe room and lock the door.",
      "content": "Hide in your safe room and lock the door. If you’re not able to escape, the best thing to do is to get to a safe place inside your home. Designate a safe room that you can hide in during an emergency, and make sure the room has a solid door that locks from the inside. If you like, barricade the door with heavy objects or furniture so the intruder cannot enter. Install a deadbolt lock on your bedroom door or safe room for extra protection. If you can’t make it to your designated safe room, stay put, lock the door, and remain silent. Stock your safe room in advance with food, water, first aid supplies, and a weapon (a bat, hammer, etc.). Make sure you have a charged cell phone that you can use to call the police."

      "title": "Turn out the lights and stay silent.",
      "content": "Turn out the lights and stay silent. To avoid alerting the intruder of your presence, put your phone on silent mode, and ensure all the lights in your room are turned off. Avoid fidgeting, moving around the room, or opening interior doors."

      "title": "Call emergency services and follow their instructions.",
      "content": "Call emergency services and follow their instructions. Once you’re in a safe place with the lights turned off, call 911 or emergency services for help. Provide the dispatcher with as much information as possible, and keep the line open so they can listen in, provide you with updates on the progress of the police, and help you stay calm. [2] X Research source Prepare to answer questions about the nature of your emergency, your address, your name and phone number, who else is in the home with you, where you and other people are located in the home, and the description of the intruder. For example, you might say, “My name is Sally Smith, and I live at 123 River Road. I hear an intruder in my home. I'm hiding in the upstairs bathroom, but I think they’re still downstairs in the living room.”"

      "title": "Avoid talking to the intruder, unless they try to break into your room.",
      "content": "Avoid talking to the intruder, unless they try to break into your room. Threatening the intruder or telling them that you’ve called the police can give away your hiding spot, so remain as quiet as possible until police arrive. If the intruder tries to break into the room, however, go ahead and yell, “We've called the police, and they're on their way!” [3] X Research source Use the plural “we” when you call out, even if you're alone. If the intruder thinks that there are more than one of you, they may panic and leave."

      "content": "Choose your position in your safe room strategically. If the intruder tries to break into the room where you are hiding, stand in a corner that is on the opposite side of the door, and have your family members stand behind you. That way, you’ll be able to see the intruder before they see you, and see if you need to fight them (or shoot, if you’re armed with a gun)."

      "title": "Remain in your safe room until the police arrive.",
      "content": "Remain in your safe room until the police arrive. Even if you’re sure that the intruder is gone, stay put until the police arrive to secure your home. Continue to stay on the line with the emergency services dispatcher until they inform you that the police have arrived and the police officially announce themselves outside your door. Make sure that the police check your entire house, especially if the intruder is still on the loose. Ask them to thoroughly check your property and any areas that seem vulnerable."

      "content": "Consider staying with a friend or neighbor for the rest of the evening. Even if the police assure you that your house is safe, it’s completely normal to feel stressed, paranoid, or traumatized after a burglary. Call a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to see if you can stay with them until the morning. It's also a good idea to try to determine how the intruder got into your home: Was a lock picked or a window broken? You may need to have repairs completed and/or locks changed before you'll feel safe sleeping in your home again."

      "content": "Trigger your security system or panic alarm button. Activating your home security system may scare off the intruder and prompt them to leave the premises. Some home security companies will automatically call you if an intruder breaks in, so be prepared to answer the phone. If the intruder forces you to disarm your security system, use your duress code instead of your usual code. This will silently notify the police that you’re in danger. If the intruder is inside your room and wants you to accept a call from your home security provider (they might know that if you don’t pick up, the police will arrive), answer with your prearranged distress code. For instance, you might say, “Mom, I’ll you in the morning” to indicate that you’re in trouble. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a security system that notifies the police, call 911 as soon as possible. That way, if you’re confronted by the intruder, you can say that the police are on their way and possibly scare them away."

Put your hands up at shoulder level so you look submissive, and try to position yourself so there’s furniture between you and the intruder. If you need to reach into your pocket to grab something, tell the intruder beforehand. [6] X Research source You may eventually be forced to defend yourself, but you'll have a greater chance of surviving if you do what you're asked. In the meantime, look for ways to escape, and do your best to remain calm and cooperative— avoid confrontation , and do not react violently!"

Aim for the intruder’s groin, neck, face (eyes, nose, mouth), or knees, and pay attention to their position. If they’re not standing beside you, for example, kicking them in the knees is more effective than moving in closer to strike them in the neck. [8] X Research source Inflict damage with your hands. Hold your dominant hand open and flat, with your fingers straight and close together, and your thumb out. Then, forcefully jab your hand into the intruder's neck. Alternatively, jab your elbow into the intruder’s neck, face, groin, or stomach, and throw all your body weight into it."

In most states, you can shoot someone and claim self-defense if: you’re not the aggressor, use the minimum amount of force to combat the threat, have a reasonable belief that such force is necessary and that there is an immediate threat, and are unable to retreat. However, some states have enacted laws that make a few exceptions: [9] X Research source “Stand Your Ground:” Under this law, you don’t have to retreat (or attempt to retreat). You’re legally permitted to respond with force, but you may still need a reasonable belief that shooting is necessary. Castle Doctrine: Removes the duty to retreat because there’s a presumption that using deadly force was necessary. You can shoot anyone who unlawfully enters your home, without having to determine whether and how much of a threat they pose to you. Currently, there’s no duty to retreat in at least 28 states and Puerto Rico, but check your local self-defense laws for more information."

In order to avoid tragic accidents, it's important that you try to keep a cool head when you think there’s an intruder in your home. Identify the person before shooting blindly, and account for your spouse, partner, and/or other family members. Take a quick moment before shooting if someone breaks into your room. It could be an intruder, in which case it's important that you protect yourself, but you don't want to accidentally shoot a police officer."
