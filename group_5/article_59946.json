      "content": "Place two pieces of fabric together with right sides facing in. Lay a fabric sheet on a flat surface with the right side facing you. The \"right side\" is the front or patterned side of the fabric, while the \"wrong side\" is the back or blank side. Place another sheet of fabric with the wrong side facing up, and ensure all edges are aligned. [1] X Research source A standard circle throw pillow is 16 inches (41 cm) in diameter. However, you can make your pillow as big or small as you want. Choose woven fabric without any stretch, like linen or cotton broadcloth, so your pillow holds its shape over time. You can also use fabric from clothes you no longer wear, which is a great way to repurpose and recycle your items."

      "content": "Use an erasable pen or chalk to trace a circle onto the fabric. Grab a large bowl or similar item to trace a circle onto your fabric. Add 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to your circle's size for seam allowance and cutting. If you're making a cover for an existing pillow, trace 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) around the pillow. [2] X Research source You can also make a circle pattern by folding the fabric into quarters. Measure from the center and mark the length of half the diameter plus seam allowance. Repeat this and mark an arc, marking at regular intervals. Then, cut along the marked line. Use white tailor's chalk for dark fabrics or a fabric pen on light fabrics."

Use sharp fabric scissors and cut through both pieces using the template line as a guide. [3] X Research source Don't remove the pins; they'll hold the fabric together as you sew. Alternatively, place a hardcover book or a similar heavy item to hold the fabric. Use a circular knife to cut the fabric out and then pin. [4] X Research source You could also trace the circle on pattern paper and cut it out to make identical pillows in the future. If you're adding a zipper, cut one circle in half. Then, place the zipper face-down on one half-circle with the fabric right-side up. Line up the straight edge with the zipper and pin it. With a zipper foot on the machine, sew a straight stitch. Repeat with the other half-circle. [5] X Research source"

Select the \"straight stitch\" setting and begin with a backstitch to secure the stitches. Then, continue to sew along the edges of your pillow with a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance. Leave a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) gap to turn the pillow inside out. [6] X Research source Remove the pins as you sew so you don't ruin your sewing machine. Alternatively, sew a straight stitch by hand . Bring the needle up from the bottom of the fabric and back through, making a straight stitch 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long. Repeat this process."

The pillow’s side (the ring you’ll make) is the height. For instance, you may want your pillow to be an inch in height. Once you’ve decided, measure the circumference of the fabric circle you just cut out. Then, add 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) for the rectangle's length. Cut a strip out of fabric based on these measurements for the pillow's sides. [12] X Research source A standard width for a pillow 3 inches (7.6 cm). However, it can be as wide as you want.

Calculate the circumference of a circle with an online calculator. Then, use scissors to cut two rectangles out from the fabric. These will be used to form a pillow at the end. [20] X Research source Use the radius for the rectangle's height and the circumference for the length. Round the circumference up or down to the nearest whole number to make measuring easier.
