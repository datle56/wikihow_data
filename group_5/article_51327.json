      "title": "Measure the space you have.",
      "content": "Measure the space you have. Use a tape measure to get the length and the width of the space where you will keep your stackable washer and dryer, to make sure you buy one that fits. Most models are from 24 to 27 inches (61 to 68.6 cm) wide, and from 70 to 75 inches (177.8 to 190.5 cm) high."

      "title": "Look for units labeled as stackable.",
      "content": "Look for units labeled as stackable. Any compact washer and dryer can be purchased separately and stacked on top of one another, but that may not be safe. Make sure you select a model that is labeled as stackable. Washers are typically on the bottom of the unit, with dryers on the top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider your own height.",
      "content": "Consider your own height. When buying a stackable washer and dryer, make sure you can reach the dryer. Practice opening and reaching into the dryer to make sure loading and unloading laundry will be easy. If you cannot find a stackable unit that you can reach, consider getting a small stool to help you reach into the dryer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Save water and electricity with a front loading washer.",
      "content": "Save water and electricity with a front loading washer. Stackable models come with washers that load in the front of the machine, or on top of the machine. Front loading washing machines spin faster, which takes more water out of the clothing and linens, cutting down on drying time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a unit that includes a moisture sensor in the dryer.",
      "content": "Look for a unit that includes a moisture sensor in the dryer. The sensor detects the amount of moisture in the load, and will shut off automatically when the load is dry. The price will be higher than models with a thermostat sensor, which will measure air temperature in the drum of the dryer. However, the moisture sensor will save energy and help protect your laundry from extra wear and tear."

    {
      "title": "Consider the additional features that are important to you.",
      "content": "Consider the additional features that are important to you. If conservation and green energy is important to you, choose a model that has an Energy Star rating. If you like to do a lot of small loads of laundry, make sure you select a model that has low settings as well as high or heavy-load settings. Other considerations that depend on your preference include the placement of the lint screen in the dryer, the buzzer or bell that alerts you that the drying is complete, the simplicity of adding detergent and bleach to the washer, and how noisy the machine is when it is running."

      "title": "Shop around for the best prices and selections.",
      "content": "Shop around for the best prices and selections. Stackable washers and dryers can be purchased in home appliance stores, major department stores, and at home improvement centers and warehouse chains. You can also find deals online, at major retailing sites. If you are on a budget, consider checking Craigslist in your area for a used model."

      "title": "Inquire about warranties.",
      "content": "Inquire about warranties. Most stackable washer and dryer units come with a standard 1 year warranty. Extended warranties are often available, but they can be expensive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Research consumer reviews online.",
      "content": "Research consumer reviews online. Before you buy a stackable washer and dryer, look for reviews provided by customers who currently own one. Best selling brands in stores and online include Kenmore, General Electric, and Whirlpool."
