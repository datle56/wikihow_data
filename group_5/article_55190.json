      "content": "Flattery goes a long way with Leo women. Since Leos are the lions of the Zodiac signs, they appreciate being treated like the rulers of the animal kingdom. When you’re around your Leo woman, compliment her often, and make sure you’re being genuine. Leos can spot a fake compliment from miles away, so it’s not even worth trying. [2] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. Try complimenting her on her intellect, her strong personality, or her relationships with others.

      "content": "Leos tend to love being the center of attention. Try not to interrupt her, and let her tell you all about the cool new thing she’s discovered that day. The more you can make her feel safe and listened to, the more she’ll think about you when you’re not around (and probably chase after you when you leave). [3] X Research source Practice active listening by nodding along and asking follow up questions like, “Is that so?” or, “Can you tell me more?”"

      "title": "Buy her flowers or write her a love note.",
      "content": "Buy her flowers or write her a love note. Although it might not seem like it, fiery Leos love to be wooed with romantic gestures. If you’re into poetry or literature at all, send her a text with a sweet love note that she can read throughout the day. Or, send her a box of chocolates when she’s feeling down. These gestures might seem small, but to a Leo woman, they can mean the world. [4] X Research source Sending her a text or a note is a great idea—that way, she can look back on your words throughout the day and remember how much you like her."

      "title": "Every time she looks at her gift, she’ll think of you.",
      "content": "Every time she looks at her gift, she’ll think of you. It doesn’t have to be anything huge—maybe you grab her a cute keychain on your vacation, or maybe you buy her a nice snack at the grocery store. When you show up with something for her, she’ll realize that you thought about her during the day. For a Leo woman, this is a huge compliment, and it could make her chase after you even more. [5] X Research source Jewelry is also a good gift idea, but save that for special occasions, like birthdays or anniversaries."

      "title": "Leo women tend to appreciate the finer things in life.",
      "content": "Leo women tend to appreciate the finer things in life. As you woo your Leo woman, take her out to fancy restaurants and lavish her with delicious foods and drinks. You don’t have to break the bank every time, but try to save up for a nice date every once in a while. She’ll appreciate all the effort you went to, which will make her like you a lot. [6] X Research source Plus, this gives her the perfect excuse to dress up."

      "title": "Like most people, Leos tend to get bored with routines.",
      "content": "Like most people, Leos tend to get bored with routines. If you’ve fallen into a rut and you can see your Leo woman pulling away from you, try doing something spontaneous that you’ve never done together before. Take her ice skating, check out a national park, or surprise her with a weekend getaway. The more you show her that you care, the more she’ll want to be with you. [7] X Research source You could also try visiting a new restaurant, hitting the beach, going on a hike, or doing a scavenger hunt around your city."

      "title": "Leo women get jealous pretty easily.",
      "content": "Leo women get jealous pretty easily. If you don’t want to make a Leo woman mad, keep your hands (and your eyes) away from anybody else. As long as you maintain a strong, solid relationship with a Leo woman, she’ll never want to let you go, and she’ll want you even more than she did before. [8] X Research source Similarly, playing “hard to get” with a Leo woman is a dangerous game. If you’re too unavailable, she might just assume you’ve found someone else, and she’ll move on."

      "title": "Leos tend to have big dreams, so you should, too.",
      "content": "Leos tend to have big dreams, so you should, too. Stay goal-oriented, and work on furthering yourself in every aspect of your life. Move up in your career, dive into your hobbies, and keep your life on track. More than anything, a Leo woman wants someone who can help her achieve her dreams, so if you can do that, she’ll keep coming back for more. [9] X Research source As you pursue your own passions, make sure you encourage her to follow her dreams, too. She’ll appreciate the support, and she’ll probably want to keep you around."

      "title": "Leos tend to be very private people, and they don’t open up easily.",
      "content": "Leos tend to be very private people, and they don’t open up easily. If you notice that the Leo woman you’re with has been acting a little different lately, ask her if she’s okay or if there’s anything she’d like to talk about. It might take a little prying, but you’ll be able to get her to open up if she trusts you. The more she feels like she can talk to you, the more she’ll want to be with you. [10] X Research source You might have to anticipate her needs a little bit. For instance, does she get hungry around the same time each day? Plan to make her a meal so she doesn't get hangry. Can you tell that work is stressing her out? Run her a bath so she can get some much needed self-care in."

      "title": "There’s nothing that Leos appreciate more than being in the right.",
      "content": "There’s nothing that Leos appreciate more than being in the right. For Leos, honesty and morality is very important, and it’s something they feel strongly about. If you two are arguing and you realize that you’re wrong, go ahead and tell her that. She’ll appreciate your honesty, and it will probably make her like you even more. [11] X Expert Source Tara Divina Vedic Astrologer Expert Interview. 20 November 2019. Even something as simple as, “You were right and I was wrong,” will probably make her feel a lot better."

      "title": "Leo women are very independent, and they don’t appreciate being smothered.",
      "content": "Leo women are very independent, and they don’t appreciate being smothered. Although it can be tempting to call and text her all the time, give her some time to herself so she has a chance to miss you. After a couple of days, she’ll probably realize that she wants to be around you, and she’ll be the one chasing after you. [12] X Research source Similarly, you shouldn’t be offended if a Leo decides to hang out with her friends instead of you. Most Leos need a lot of social interaction, and they love going to lots of parties and events."
