      "content": "Recommended: Affresh washing machine cleaner tablets Whirlpool explicitly recommends using Affresh cleaning tablets to clean their machines. Just put one tablet in the machine’s empty drum and run a “clean washer” cycle. [1] X Research source If your model doesn’t have a “clean washer” cycle, run a normal cycle. After the cycle is over, leave the door open for an hour or so to let the machine air out. Whirlpool recommends doing this once every 30 loads or so. A lot of consumers just do this whenever they notice there’s a funky odor in their drum, though."

      "content": "Alternative: Chlorine bleach If you don’t have Affresh tablets or prefer household cleaners, Whirlpool recommends chlorine bleach. With an empty machine, open the lid and add 1 cup (236 mL) of liquid chlorine bleach to the drum. Select the “clean washer” cycle and run it. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a “clean washer” cycle, just run a normal wash cycle. Let the drum air dry for an hour or so after the cycle is done."

      "title": "Clean the washing machine dispensers.",
      "content": "Clean the washing machine dispensers. If your machine has a dispenser drawer, clean it periodically to get rid of any soap scum and buildup. Pull the drawer out (unless you sense resistance, in which case leave the drawer where it is). Soak a clean cloth in warm water and wipe the dispenser down. If it’s still dirty, use a disinfectant cleaning wipe to scrub the dispenser clean. Towel dry the dispenser when you’re done. If you can remove the dispenser drawer and you don’t feel like scrubbing, just soak the dispenser in hot water and mild soap."

      "content": "Remove the agitator if you can to clean it separately. If you have a top-loading machine, look in the middle of the drum for a column. If you have one, this is the agitator. Try taking the cap off. If it does come off, clean the inside of the agitator with a cloth or long scrub brush and some warm water. If the cap doesn’t come off easily because there’s resistance, don’t push it. Only some Whirlpool models have removable agitator caps."

      "title": "Clean the outside of the washing machine.",
      "content": "Clean the outside of the washing machine. If the outside of your machine is dirty, grab a sponge or cloth and wipe away anything that seems dirty or dusty. You can dampen the sponge or cloth with a little warm water if the job calls for it. You can use mild soap or disinfectant if you’d like, but don’t use any abrasive cleaners, bleach, or commercial cleaners."

      "content": "Run an empty cycle with the opposite settings you normally use. Run an empty cycle once you’re done cleaning. If you normally use hot water to wash your clothes, use cold water to run an empty cycle. If you normally use cold water, use hot water. This will clean out any buildup in your washing machine’s water lines and ensure it continues to run efficiently. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "No, you cannot use dish soap in a Whirlpool washing machine. Dish soap creates suds. In fact, it creates a lot more suds than normal laundry detergent. If you use dish soap in the drum of the machine, you may end up overflowing the machine with soap suds. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Dish soap can also clog the drain lines and coat them in soap scum, which may prevent your machine from running efficiently in the future."

      "content": "Yes, it’s generally safe to pour some baking soda into the drum. Check your manual to be sure, but this is usually fine with Whirlpool models. If you want to deodorize your washing machine , feel free to sprinkle a spoonful or two of baking soda in the drum. Wait a little bit for the baking soda to absorb any odors, and then run an empty cycle to wash it out. [5] X Research source You can also use white vinegar in a Whirlpool machine. Just don’t use white vinegar and baking soda together—it’s too caustic for the machine."
