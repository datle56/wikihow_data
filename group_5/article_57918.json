      "content": "A reversed Nine of Pentacles shows cracks in your stable life. Although you strive for security, luxury, and satisfaction, something may be disrupting your plans for success. [1] X Research source The root cause of this stalling may or may not be clear to you yet—perhaps the consequences of a past mistake are catching up to you, or careless planning has caused your projects and plans to lose their potential. If a lack of wealth or material possessions is plaguing you, the cause may be social deprivation or a lack of confidence. For example, you may be missing out on career opportunities due to weak networking skills. The reversed Nine of Pentacles is also associated with low self-worth or material envy.

Do your struggles stem from factors outside your control, or is there something you can do to turn things around?

You feel like something is missing, but out of fear of losing your current lifestyle, you may choose to ignore that nagging feeling.

[4] X Research source On the other hand, this draw might also signify that you’ve worked too hard and haven’t left yourself time to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

      "content": "For your finances You may be wealthy now, but overspending might threaten your lifestyle. It’s possible you struggle with a tendency to immediately spend your hard-earned cash on things you want, but don’t necessarily need. This poses a risk to your financial well-being, especially if you’re going through a rough patch at work. [5] X Research source What to do: Slow down your spending and pay only for what you need (rather than giving in to impulse spending) until you feel secure in your finances and have plenty of money saved away.

Aside from physical ailments, the card might also hint that you have underlying mental or emotional stress that is impacting your well-being. What to do: Make an effort to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. You don’t have to become a fitness and nutrition guru, but taking care of your body will help you become more prosperous down the road. Think about the times in your life when you felt the best. What was different back then? Try to copy those behaviors or mindsets now to get back on track. [6] X Research source Remember that a tarot reading is not a substitute for professional medical advice. If you’re experiencing a physical or mental health problem, visit your doctor or a therapist for treatment."

      "content": "For your spirituality The reversed Nine of Pentacles might mean you’re clinging to old beliefs or ideas that don’t work for you anymore—maybe you’re just “going through the motions” of the religion you were raised in, or you’ve put your faith in people or leaders who don’t have your best interest at heart. You might also feel timid or unsure about creating your own spiritual path and investigating what you truly believe in. What to do: Explore new ideas and belief systems. Try meditating or journaling to clarify to yourself what your core values are, then read up on different religions, philosophies, or lifestyles that align with your beliefs. In many cases, you get what you give when it comes to spiritual practices. Be patient and give different beliefs and points of view a thoughtful chance—you never know what may end up resonating with you."
