      "content": "Find out if your printer supports double-sided printing. From the \"Print\" window, you can figure out whether your printer supports duplex printing. The easiest way to check is to look for an option that specifies \"double-sided,\" \"2-sided,\" or \"duplex\" printing. Be sure to check the preferences or settings in the Print menu if you can't see anything immediately. Although duplex printing relies on the printer, larger printers are more likely to support this type of printing because it reduces waste and can be done quickly. Smaller, at-home inkjet printers are less likely to have the option. You can also check the manual that came with your printer for more information on duplex printing."

Go to source Manually re-inserting pages to be printed on both sides requires you to know how your paper feeder functions. Many printers require the pages to be faced up to print 2-sided, and others need them to be faced down. They may also need to be re-ordered. Do several sample pages to understand how your printer feed operates before you reinsert the odd-numbered pages."
