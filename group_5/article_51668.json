      "content": "Plan a surprise party to celebrate with all of her friends and family. Send out invitations a month in advance of the party, and remind attendees not to say anything to the birthday queen. Then, lead your wife there on the day of the part under the guise of going somewhere else, and have her family and friends jump out and surprise her when you arrive! [1] X Research source Be sure to stress the importance of keeping it a secret on the invitation. If you know someone is a bad secret keeper, talk to them in person or on the phone about ways they can avoid your spouse before the party. Some people don’t like surprises. If you’re thinking of planning a surprise party, ask your wife how she feels about them well in advance. If she says no, respect her wishes. The first thing to do when starting to plan a birthday party is to get a good sense of what your budget is for the event. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting your spending out of control. If money's tight right now, host the party at a time where you don't need to serve a full meal. This way, you can have light bites that are nice for guests, but you don't need to serve a heavy lunch that will fill everybody up."

      "content": "Invite her family and friends for a low-key birthday dinner. If your wife isn’t enthusiastic about her birthday, a small birthday dinner might be the best way to celebrate. Invite her family and 3-4 of her closest friends to go to a nice restaurant. [2] X Research source If you’re on a tighter budget, have dinner at your house for everyone. Make your wife’s favorite party foods so she can celebrate with her friends while saving money. If you want to mix it up, you can even invite them to brunch on her birthday. That gives you the rest of the day to celebrate and do more birthday activities."

      "content": "Take her to dinner and have a night out for two to celebrate alone. This is a great gift idea if your wife asks to just spend time with you for her birthday.

      "content": "Pamper her with a spa day if she never takes time for herself.

Present the gift to her by giving her a brochure for the spa with a heartfelt note.

      "content": "Take her on a vacation for a major milestone birthday. Many women dream of taking some time off for their birthday, and if you can make it happen, you definitely should. Milestone birthdays like 30, 40, 50, and 60 are all great opportunities to take a trip together to somewhere you’ve never been. [5] X Research source You can either tell her in advance or surprise her, but just remember that planning a surprise trip is much more difficult. Be sure to call her work and let them know that you’re planning a surprise trip for the week of her birthday so she doesn’t get in trouble for calling off."
