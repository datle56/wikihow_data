      "content": "Find a raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar. When shopping for the apple cider vinegar to apply to your hair, choose an unfiltered apple cider vinegar that is cloudy rather than clear. Clear apple cider vinegars are pasteurized to remove the sediment that makes raw apple cider vinegar cloudy. The sediment contains the nutrients that are beneficial for your hair, so it is best to use a raw, unfiltered vinegar product. [2] X Research source Most organic apple cider vinegars are unpasteurized, so it is a good idea to check organic food stores."

      "content": "Measure out equal parts apple cider vinegar and water. To make an apple cider vinegar solution for your hair, use 1 part water to every 1 part apple cider vinegar. For example, if you are making a large batch of the rinse, try mixing 8 ounces (230 g) of apple cider vinegar for every 8 ounces (230 g) of water. If your skin is sensitive, try a more diluted mixture, such as 1 part apple cider vinegar to every 2 or 3 parts water. [3] X Research source v161775_b01. Tuesday, June 1, 2021.

      "content": "Mix the ingredients in a cup or spray bottle. Once you have measured the ingredients to your preferred ratio, pour the apple cider vinegar and water into a cup or spray bottle. Shake or stir with a spatula or spoon to mix well. Using a spray bottle can be helpful because it may help you apply the solution more evenly over your hair. If you use a spray bottle, make sure that it is new and clean, as any residue from other products may be harmful to your hair. If you don’t need to use it all immediately, you can store the leftover hair solution in the refrigerator for up to two weeks."

For extra nutrients or to mask the vinegar smell, add a few drops (1 to 3) of your favorite essential oil to the apple cider vinegar and water solution. Lavender, rosemary, lemongrass, and tea tree are all essential oils commonly found in hair products, and contain nutrients that may help make your hair healthier. Lavender, tea tree, and rosemary are particularly popular for stimulating healthy hair growth, while lemongrass may help with itchy scalp caused by dandruff. [4] X Research source Be careful with hot oils, such as peppermint, though, as these may irritate your skin. If you want to add a hot oil like peppermint to your solution, stick to 1 to 2 drops until you know how the oil impacts your skin."

[8] X Research source If your solution is strong (i.e. if you used a 1:1 ratio), do not leave the solution on for more than 10 minutes, as it can seriously irritate your skin.
