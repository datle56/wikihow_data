      "content": "Open the door and stick a door stop under the bottom edge of the door. Open up the door about halfway, so you can easily access both sides of the door handle. Push a door stop under the bottom edge of the door to keep it from moving and closing while you replace the handle. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a door stop, you could use a wedge-shaped piece of wood or any other wedge-like object you can find around your home that will fit under the door."

      "title": "Push the handle’s pressure release in with a screwdriver and pull it off.",
      "content": "Push the handle’s pressure release in with a screwdriver and pull it off. Look for a small slot in the side of the door knob or door handle where it connects to the cover plate or look on the side of the cover plate where it sits flush against the door. Insert the tip of a flat-head screwdriver into the slot and apply pressure with the tip of the screwdriver, then pull the handle or door knob off. [2] X Research source The cover plates are the round or rectangular plates that sit against the door between the handle or door knob and the door itself. These parts are there to hide the inner workings of the door handle and give it an attractive appearance. Try unscrewing the knobs or handles if you don’t see this type of pressure slot. Different handles come off in different ways. Some types of handles might not come off separately. If yours don’t seem like you can pull or screw them off, skip this step. For instance, if your handle has a rectangular plate, the handle might be attached to the plate and will just come off when you remove the whole plate."

      "title": "Unscrew and pull off the door handle’s cover plates.",
      "content": "Unscrew and pull off the door handle’s cover plates. Remove any screws that are holding the cover plates in place on either side of the door using a flat-head screwdriver. Insert the edge of your screwdriver under the plates and pry them up gently until they pop off, then remove them and set them aside. [3] X Research source Not all cover plates have screws holding them in place. Some might just snap into place, so you can just pry them right off using your screwdriver. Look for a slot on the side or bottom of the cover plate that you can slide your screwdriver into to pry it off. Some round types of cover plates might screw on, so try turning the cover plate itself counterclockwise if you can’t remove it by unscrewing it or prying it off."

      "content": "Take out the screws holding the latch and inner plates in place. Unscrew and remove the screws holding the latch in place on the inside edge of the door. Take out the screws that hold the inner plates in place on either side of the door. [4] X Research source The inner plates are what sit directly under the cover plates you just removed. These hold the door handle’s latching mechanism in place inside the hole in the door. The latch is the angled metal piece that moves in and out of the hole on the inside edge of the door. When you close the door, this latch hooks into a hole in the door frame to keep the door closed. Turning the door handle moves this latch in, so you can open the door."

      "title": "Pull out the latch plate and door latch mechanism.",
      "content": "Pull out the latch plate and door latch mechanism. Carefully pull the latch plate and mechanism out from the hole on the inside edge of the door and set it aside. Remove the plates from either side of the door and set them aside as well. [5] X Research source You should now just have holes in your door, into which you can install a new door handle."

      "title": "Choose a new door handle that fits on your door.",
      "content": "Choose a new door handle that fits on your door. Use a tape measure to measure from the inside edge of the door to the center of the hole in the door to get the backset measurement, then choose a handle that fits this backset. Pick a new handle or knob with cover plates that are the same shape and size as the old ones to cover up any marks in the surface of your door that the old plates made, such as screw holes and scratches. [6] X Research source Most door handles have a standard backset of 60 mm or 70 mm, so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a new door handle that fits in the existing holes in your door. For example, if your old door handle had rectangular cover plates, it’s probably best to stick to a new handle with similar rectangular cover plates, rather than switching to one with round plates."

      "title": "Insert your new handle’s latch into the hole on the door’s inside edge.",
      "content": "Insert your new handle’s latch into the hole on the door’s inside edge. Position the latch in the hole on the inside edge of the door so that the smooth angled part faces in the same direction as the door closes in. Slide the latch mechanism into the hole until the latch plate rests flush against the inside edge of the door in the old latch recess. [7] X Research source Door handle latches come in a standard size, so the new latch should fit into the old recess without any problems. If it doesn’t seem to fit for some reason, you can use a chisel to make adjustments to the depth and shape of the recess in the door."

      "title": "Screw the new handle’s inner plates to the door.",
      "content": "Screw the new handle’s inner plates to the door. Line up the cylinders on the insides of the inner plates with the corresponding holes in the latch mechanism and slide them into place. Fasten the plates flush against the door using the provided screws and your screwdriver. [8] X Research source If the inner plates are different from each other, make sure to look at the instructions on your new handle to see which one goes on the inside and which one goes on the outside of the door."

      "content": "Put the cover plates in place on top of the inner plates. Slide the new cover plates on and press them against the inner plates until they snap into place. Attach any provided screws that hold the plates in place using your screwdriver. [9] X Research source These plates should be the same for both sides, since they are just the cosmetic plates that cover up the inner plates."

      "title": "Press the new knobs or handles into place.",
      "content": "Press the new knobs or handles into place. Slide the outer knob or handle onto the handle mechanism’s cylinder on the outside of the door and press it until it snaps into place. Do the same for the inner knob or handle. [10] X Research source Remember that some knobs and handles screw on. If you see threads on the door handle mechanism cylinders, screw the knobs or handles on instead of pressing them into place. If your new door handles are already attached to the cover plates, you don’t have to put them on separately. They will already be in place after you attach the new cover plates to the door."

      "content": "Replace any other locks and deadbolts on the door if you want them to match. Choose new locks and deadbolts that match your door handle to update the appearance of all the hardware on the door. Unscrew and remove the old locks and deadbolts, then slide the new ones into place on the door and attach them with the provided screws to finish upgrading the door’s hardware. [11] X Research source This is totally optional and would only matter if the new handle looks way different from the other hardware on the door. For example, if you have a silver deadbolt lock on your front door and you just replaced the old handle with a new silver handle, the difference might not be that noticeable. However, if your new handle is gold, you might want to update the locks."
