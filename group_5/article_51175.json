      "content": "Prepare a mixture of three parts salt and one part sugar. The salt may be kosher or sea salt. The sugar can be any white crystal sugar, but not 10X or confectioner's sugar. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Dissolve the sugar/salt mixture in water.",
      "content": "Dissolve the sugar/salt mixture in water. Brining is all about ratio, and the salt to water ratio should be 1:16â€”for every gallon of water you should have a cup of salt (50-60 grams of salt per litre water). [2] X Research source Make enough of the mixture to comfortably cover the meat you wish to brine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add any flavorings you wish.",
      "content": "Add any flavorings you wish. Sharp liquids (vinegars and citrus juices), whole seeds, and dried herbs and spices work especially well. Thicker liquids such as honey, oil and some sauces will impart fewer flavors unless boiled (see step 4, substep 1). This is also the case with fresh herbs. [3] X Research source Fruits, both acidic or sweet, can add a special layer of flavor to the brine. Try adding pineapple or apple for a nice taste."

      "title": "Submerge the meat in brine.",
      "content": "Submerge the meat in brine. [4] X Research source Heating the brine solution and then letting it cool before pouring it over the meat helps to get more flavor from the spices."

    {
      "title": "Store it in a refrigerator or other cooler space.",
      "content": "Store it in a refrigerator or other cooler space. Cuts of pork, wild game, and larger poultry, such as turkey, can be brined anywhere from 4-12 hours; smaller cuts and birds should be brined for 30 minutes to 2 hours. [5] X Research source If your brine is extensively flavored, or if you do not plan to brine the meat for long, consider bringing the mixture to a fast boil and cooling before starting the brine. This is especially effective for chicken and smaller poultry because brining them for too long will cause the meat to break down."
