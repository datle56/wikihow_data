To automatically map your folder when your system starts, put the SUBST command in a batch file, and put the batch file in your Autostart folder in the start menu.

      "content": "Execute the SUBST command using the account that issued it. These mappings are only created for the user who originally issued the SUBST command. When you login as \"John\", and you open a command prompt as \"Administrator\" and execute the SUBST command, \"John\" will not be able to see any mapped drive letters because the mapping was created for \"Administrator\". This is why you need to open the command prompt as a default user in Windows Vista and Windows 7. When using the task scheduler, again make sure that the command is executed under the default user account."
