      "title": "Consider how you view their appearance.",
      "content": "Consider how you view their appearance. There is a difference between aesthetic attraction and romantic/sexual attraction. If you think your friend is good-looking, and you like to look at their face/body but that's all it is, then you probably don't like them. Aesthetic attraction —Wow, he has nice hair. It's appealing to look at. Romantic/sexual attraction —Wow, he has nice hair. I want to run my hands through it and kiss him and go out to dinner with him."

      "content": "Ask your friends or family about their first crushes, or how they feel about the love of their life. How did they know? What did it feel like to them? (You don't need to mention the name of the person you're thinking about if you don't want to.)"

      "title": "Notice how others respond to the two of you.",
      "content": "Notice how others respond to the two of you. If you have a pretty obvious crush on them, then other people may notice—assuming you're a couple, acting cold and disapproving, or trying to set the two of you up. If your friends detect a crush, they will probably gently tease you and try to set you up with your best friend."

    {
      "title": "Consider how much you think about them.",
      "content": "Consider how much you think about them. Are they often on your mind? Are you constantly thinking of ways to spend time with them? If you think about your friend much more than you think about other people, this means you likely have a crush on them."

      "title": "Think if you've had any romantic or sexual thoughts about them.",
      "content": "Think if you've had any romantic or sexual thoughts about them. Straight/aromantic-asexual people might have a few passing thoughts or weird dreams about same-gender relationships, but they're fleeting and minor in the long run. If you keep thinking about dating, kissing, or going beyond kissing with your friend, then there's a good chance you like them."

    {
      "title": "Think about how you feel around them.",
      "content": "Think about how you feel around them. Do your cheeks feel warm and does your face feel like it's glowing? Does spending time with them boost your mood and make your day seem brighter?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider how positively you feel towards them.",
      "content": "Consider how positively you feel towards them. Since you're friends, you'll naturally like each other, but love and crushes go beyond this. Do you see their inner beauty? Do you recognize their faults and strengths, and love every piece of who they are? Do you want to be with them all the time? This is a sign of blossoming love. Think whether your friend shares your values. [1] X Research source Consider whether the person has the qualities you respect, such as being kind, thoughtful, supportive, and honest.
