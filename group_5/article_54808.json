You will need to select a number between zero to ninety-nine, and if you manage to get the lucky number, you will get all of your diamonds back. This makes it a nice option to get your diamonds back without wasting money! Do note, however, that this step can only be done if you use and buy diamonds from the game itself. If you don't use any, you'll only get a single diamond."
