      "content": "Eat a diet that's high in lean protein and veggies and low in carbs. Think of the food you put into your body as fuel for your activity. The cleaner the fuel, the more efficiently your body will run. Avoid foods that are high in sugars and that lack nutrients. Opt for lean proteins like grilled chicken or seafood, and try to fill about half of your plate with colorful veggies, like leafy greens, sweet potatoes, or broccoli. Don’t eat for 30 minutes before you exercise to avoid cramps."

To start getting in great physical shape before you lift, you should try to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each week. Running, jogging, and swimming are some of the most popular aerobic exercises, but feel free to get creative — a flag football game with friends or taking the stairs at work can count towards your goal.

      "content": "Study the major muscle groups. As you start getting ready to lift weights, study anatomy charts and workout guides online to learn more about the body's major muscle groups. Pay attention to how each set of muscles moves to control your body, then mimic those movements during weight training. Understanding how the muscles work will help you have a better understanding of what you're working towards. [2] X Research source If you know that the muscles biceps, rhomboids, latissimus dorsi, and posterior deltoids all contract and shorten to move the shoulder and arm, you will understand the exact benefit you get from doing a lateral pull-down."

      "content": "Practice bodyweight exercises to prepare your muscles for lifting weights. Bodyweight exercises don't require any equipment to give you a good workout — just the weight of your own body and gravity is enough to help you build muscles. Bodyweight exercises like squats, push-ups , and sit ups are a great way to get your body in shape for weight lifting."

      "content": "Start with lifting smaller weights, then work your way up. You might have images of pressing some heavy iron to build huge muscles, but you can actually get benefits by lifting lighter weights for more reps, plus you decrease your risk of injury. Start out by selecting a weight that you can easily lift 8-12 times, then gradually work your way up to heavier weights. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your form is correct before you lift more weight. You might not notice that your form is off when you're lifting lighter weights, but if your knees aren't aligned properly, or your back isn't straight, it can make a big difference when you add more weight to your lift. If you go to a gym, ask a trainer to evaluate your form before you increase your lifts. [4] X Research source If you don't go to a gym, watch video tutorials and work out in front of a mirror or film yourself lifting weights to check your form. Pay special attention to any aches or pains you feel while lifting."

      "content": "Do a warm-up before you start lifting. A proper warm-up will increase the oxygen in your bloodstream and your muscles, helping reduce the risk of injury and helping prevent or relieve muscle soreness. Before you lift, try 5-10 minutes of light cardio activity, like push-ups, sit-ups, jogging on a treadmill, or riding a stationary bike. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Exercise with about 10% less than the maximum you can lift. Don’t strain your body by lifting the absolute most you can every time. This will increase your risk of injury and can lead your body to plateau. Dial it back to about 90% of the most you can lift, then increase a little every 2-4 weeks. [9] X Research source"

If you normally rest 30-45 seconds between sets, try resting for 60-90 seconds instead. You may need to rest longer if you are performing compound exercises and lifting 90 percent of your maximum weight."

Think about training your pushing and pulling muscles (like your hamstrings vs your quads) equally, as well as balancing your arms, legs, chest, and back. Set up a schedule so you know what muscle group you’ll focus on each day. [10] X Research source"
