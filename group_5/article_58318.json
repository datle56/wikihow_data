      "content": "Start with the tutorial. Officially, the game has 5 levels. However, in the first level you are robbing a barn, and it helps you along every step. Control Bob with the arrow keys or WSAD, and scan through crates and items with up arrow or W. Your down arrow key or S key doesn't do anything, though. Just follow the letters, grab the money, and get out safely."

      "title": "Go to level 2.",
      "content": "Go to level 2. You'll have to dodge security cameras, and policeman to sneak past. Just stay in the shadows to hide from the cameras, and whack the cops with your baton (space bar). Tackle each step logically. Many of the levels are a puzzle, and it's good to think, \"Where is the game leading me?\""

      "title": "Don't worry about money.",
      "content": "Don't worry about money. You can always replay levels; the main point is to beat level 5, not get all the money/best score each level. If you beat a level, you can go back and try to get as much money as you can."

      "title": "Don't worry much about being caught.",
      "content": "Don't worry much about being caught. There is no penalty; you will just have to restart the current level. In some ways, being caught will allow you to refresh your mind, and a quick run-through of a level will tell you the layout and the traps that lie ahead."
