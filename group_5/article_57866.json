      "title": "Multiclassing allows a character to gain levels in multiple classes.",
      "content": "Multiclassing allows a character to gain levels in multiple classes. Multiclassing is an optional rule that allows players to mix the abilities of different classes to create more unique characters. If you play with this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class each time you advance in level (instead of just gaining a level in your character’s current class). [1] X Research source How you evolve your character when multiclassing is completely up to you. You can keep your original class as your “main” and add a few levels in another class to make a character more versatile. Or you could add a new class and focus on leveling that up going forward, leaving your previous class behind. You can even add a third or fourth class and progress in those, too. To determine your character level when multiclassing, add together the levels in all of your classes. For example, if you have four levels in druid and two in ranger, you're a 6th-level character."

      "title": "You can optimize your character in new and exciting ways.",
      "content": "You can optimize your character in new and exciting ways. Single-class characters allow you to really fine-tune your abilities within that class, but you’re locked into those abilities for the duration of the game. With multiclassing, you’re able to explore other classes, add a variety of new abilities, and create powerful combinations that can make gameplay really unique. Think of classes as pizza toppings: you can’t go wrong with classic pepperoni (single-class), but adding toppings like mushrooms and olives can make the flavor more complex and interesting."

      "title": "Unique character builds create opportunities for compelling storylines.",
      "content": "Unique character builds create opportunities for compelling storylines. A good DM creates storylines that incorporate each character’s unique set of skills, abilities, and weaknesses. A multiclass character provides the DM with a much wider range of characteristics to play around with. They can craft extremely creative storylines that wouldn’t necessarily make sense (or be fun) for a single-class character. As you’re creating your character , try to avoid basing everything on stats–this can result in an awkward character build. Remember that your character is part of a story and that story needs to actually make sense."

      "title": "Multiclass characters are often less effective than single-class.",
      "content": "Multiclass characters are often less effective than single-class. When multiclassing, you’re gaining versatility but sacrificing the focus of a single-class character. A single-class character will advance and gain power more quickly since they’re continually adding more levels to that one class. Playing multiclass essentially delays the acquisition of a character’s most powerful abilities. [2] X Research source For example, your 6th-level character is more powerful if you have 6 levels as a ranger (as opposed to a multiclass character with 4 levels in ranger and 2 levels in bard)."

      "title": "Your character will progress more slowly than the rest of your party.",
      "content": "Your character will progress more slowly than the rest of your party. Multiclassing can put a character multiple levels behind when it comes to features like Ability Score, Extra Attack, and high-level spells. This power gap between characters can slow the group down and make them less effective. It can also slow the story down in general (much to the chagrin of your DM). [3] X Research source Playing two classes may not slow you down too much, but when you start adding third and fourth classes to the mix, you probably won’t be able to keep up with your party."

      "title": "Meet ability score prerequisites for your current class and new class.",
      "content": "Meet ability score prerequisites for your current class and new class. Since your character doesn’t have the full training that a beginning character receives, you must have a natural aptitude for the class you want to add, which is reflected in your ability scores. For example, a druid who wants to add the rogue class must have both a Dexterity and Wisdom score of 13 or higher. [4] X Research source The minimum Ability Score prerequisites for each class are: Barbarian: Strength 13 Bard: Charisma 13 Cleric: Wisdom 13 Druid: Wisdom 13 Fighter: Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 Monk: Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Paladin: Strength 13 and Charisma 13 Ranger: Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 Rogue: Dexterity 13 Sorcerer: Charisma 13 Warlock: Charisma 13 Wizard: Intelligence 13"

      "title": "Experience points (XP) are based on your character level.",
      "content": "Experience points (XP) are based on your character level. Experience points (XP) are based on your total character level and not your level in any particular class. This is always the case, no matter how many classes your character takes on. For example, if you have 6 levels in cleric and 1 level in fighter, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your 7th level as a cleric. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that your DM calls the shots when it comes to XP. Players don’t manage their own XP (and some DMs don't use XP at all)."

      "title": "Hit Points are additive.",
      "content": "Hit Points are additive. When you gain levels and roll for hit points (or take the rounded average, which is recommended), just add them to your hit point maximum the same way you would if you gained a level in your original class. Use the “Hit Points at Higher Levels” entry for your class (in the handbook) and not the “Hit Points at 1st Level” entry. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Hit Dice are additive.",
      "content": "Hit Dice are additive. When you gain a level in a class, add the correct hit die to your pool of hit dice. This means you will probably end up having multiple hit die sizes. If you spend a hit die, you can choose which die to use. [7] X Research source If your classes both provide the same hit die type, pool them together. For example, if you’re a fighter level 5/paladin level 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice (because both the fighter and the paladin have a d10). If your classes provide different hit die types, be sure to keep track of them separately. For example, if you’re a paladin level 5/cleric level 5, that means you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice."

      "content": "Proficiency Bonus is based on your character’s overall level. Proficiency bonus is not dependent on your level in a particular class–it’s determined by the total level of your character from both classes combined. This rule is important because if it didn’t exist, your proficiency bonus would be way too low. This way, a multiclass character’s proficiency bonus is the same as the single-class characters in your party. [8] X Research source"
