To repair your reputation, you need to be in the driver's seat. Even if people don't believe you or want to support you, at least they've heard your side of the story.

For example, if you have a reputation for being promiscuous, you might say that you're sex-positive and in charge of your sexuality. As another example, if you have a reputation at work for taking more time than other employees with each transaction, you might say that you take your time with each customer to make sure their needs are being met. For life coach Karuna Jain, this is also about learning to be tolerant of your own weaknesses: \"And [once] we have learned to be more tolerant of our weaknesses, then we will learn how to be tolerant of other people's weaknesses.

For example, even though you have a reputation for processing transactions slowly at work, your employer might appreciate that you have a significantly lower return rate as well as fewer follow-up support calls after the sale. You likely won't be able to sway everyone's opinion but you might at least encourage them to look at things from another point of view."

Act consistently to show that you're building different habits that will truly change your ways. [9] X Research source For example, if you have a reputation among your housemates for being selfish, you might start cleaning the kitchen for 15 minutes every day and making breakfast for everyone on weekends. If your reputation was tarnished because of false gossip or rumors, you might not have any behavior to correct. What you might do instead is reconsider the people who you're letting get close to you.
