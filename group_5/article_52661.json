      "content": "Dab cream concealer over and around your mole. Start by dipping your fingers into the cream concealer and lightly tapping the concealer on and around your mole. The technique should remind you of finger painting. Then, let the concealer dry for a minute or so. You might need a second application of concealer if your mole still shows after one application, so repeat if necessary. If you’re using two shades of concealer, dab both of them over your mole and blend. You also have the option to apply and blend the concealer with a foundation brush or a beauty blender.

      "content": "Dust face powder over the spot as a final coat. Face powder isn't just for the face. It works like fixative, so the concealer and foundation won't run. Dip the face powder applicator, a powder brush for example, in the powder and tap it on the edge of the container to remove any excess. Apply the powder lightly and evenly over the spot. Your mole should be completely covered at this point. Remember, you can use beauty products like creme concealer, foundation and face powder on any part of your body your mole appears."

As with the tattoo eraser, let the tattoo concealer dry and apply a second coat if you can still see your mole.

Covering your moles can also protect them from being exposed to UV radiation, which can cause them to mutate into melanoma. For example, you might consider wearing a cashmere scarf to hide a mole during the winter and a lightweight cotton or silk scarf in the summer."
