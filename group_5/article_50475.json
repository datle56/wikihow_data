      "content": "Power wash the surface for a sure clean. The best way to ensure your surface is clean is to power wash it at a pressure of 2,000 to 2,500 psi. It's always a good idea to test the pressure on your surface, because it can cause damage. You may need to use a lower pressure or another cleaning method if washing at these pressure levels causes damage. Don't add cleaner or bleach to the water when power washing. [1] X Research source"

If you do need to use a cleaner on the surface, pick one that's meant to clean the surface before painting, such as trisodium phosphate which removes oxidation. Apply the cleaner to the surface according to the bottle's directions. Thoroughly rinse the product off so you don't leave any on the surface."

      "content": "Test for cleanliness after the surface dries. The area needs to air dry before you make sure it's clean or try to paint. Leave it to dry out for at least an hour or so, and then perform a tape test to check if it's clean. Put a strip of masking tape on the surface you plan to paint. Pull off the tape and examine the sticky side. If you see dirt or contaminants, your wall needs further cleaning."

      "content": "Seal cracks larger than 1 ⁄ 16 inch (0.16 cm) with caulk. While elastomeric paint does fill in smaller cracks, you should fill in most cracks with acrylic or siliconized caulk. Use a caulk gun to fill the crack, and then smooth it out with a putty knife. [3] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 1 March 2021. If you're filling in a large crack, use layers to fill it in, letting it dry in between. [4] X Research source Let the caulk dry overnight. If the caulk isn't flat after drying, sand it down until it is. Avoid using pure silicone caulks."

Divide it into simple shapes as needed, such as rectangles and triangles, and then measure each piece. You can round up to the next whole foot or meter to make it easier. For instance, say you're covering 2 walls that are 20 by 12 feet (6.1 by 3.7 m), 2 walls that are 15 by 12 feet (4.6 by 3.7 m), and a triangle that has a base of 15 feet (4.6 m) and a height of 8 feet (2.4 m)."

For a triangle that has 2 equal sides, multiply the length by the height and divide by 2. To find the square footage or meterage (area) of the first 2 walls, multiply the length by the height: 20 feet (6.1 m) x 12 feet (3.7 m) = 240 square feet or 22.6 square meters. Multiply that by 2 to get the area for the first 2 walls: 480 square feet or 45.2 square meters. Find the area of the second 2 walls: 15 feet (4.6 m) x 12 feet (3.7 m) = 180 square feet or 17 square meters. Multiply by 2 for the 2 walls to get 360 square feet or 34 square meters. For the triangle, multiply the length times the height, and then divide by 2 to find the area: 15 feet (4.6 m) x 8 feet (2.4 m) = 120 square feet or 11 square meters / 2 = 60 square feet or 5.5 square meters."

At the recommended thickness, you'll need 1 55-pound (25-kilogram) pail to cover 250 to 375 ft 2 (23 to 35 m 2 ) for 1 coat on a porous surface, which you'll need to double for the second coat. On a smooth, filled-in surface, you'll need 1 55-pound (25-kilogram) pail to cover 700 to 800 ft 2 (65 to 75 m 2 ) for 1 coat. Again, you'll need to double the amount. Double your square footage/meterage for 2 coats, then divide by the average square footage/meterage 1 pail covers: 900 ft 2 (84.7 m 2 ) x 2 = 1,800 ft 2 (169.4 m 2 ) / 312.5 ft 2 (29 m 2 ) = 5.8. Round up to get 6 pails. Do the same for a smooth surface: 900 ft 2 (84.7 m 2 ) x 2= 1,800 ft 2 (169.4 m 2 ); 1,800 ft 2 (169.4 m 2 ) / 750 ft 2 (70 m 2 ) = 2.4. Round up to 2.5 or 3 pails.

If you put polyurethane mesh (which is sold in rolls of 6 inches up to rolls of 4 feet) over the first coat it will prevent the elastomeric from cracking. Apply the paint at the thickness directed by the manufacturer. The coats for this paint are relatively thick, which is what fills in some cracks and provides weatherproofing. However, you must pay attention to the thickness of the paint to get these benefits. The best way to achieve the correct thickness is to follow the manufacturer's instructions for applying the paint.

They have a tendency to take on a chalky appearance, particularly when in direct sun. Because of this tendency, you won't find many dark colors in this type of paint. If you want a darker color, apply 2 coats of a conventional paint, such as 100% acrylic latex flat or satin-finish exterior paint, over the elastomeric paint. [10] X Research source"
