[1] X Research source Gather what you need for the bath itself, including the tub, a cup for pouring water, gentle baby soap, two washcloths, and cotton balls for cleaning the baby's eyes and ears. Optionally, collect a few bath toys for the baby to play with. Lay out what you'll need after the bath, including a towel, a brush or comb, lotion or oil, a diaper, diaper ointment and a clean set of clothes nearby. Until the umbilical cord has fallen off, sponge bathes are probably the easiest way to wash the baby because dry cord care is currently recommended--just leaving the stump alone to let it fall by itself. Despite what you have heard, there is no need to use rubbing alcohol to clean baby's umbilical cord area if it is still attached."

      "content": "Set up the tub. Most baby tubs available are shaped so as to support the infant's neck and head. They usually have a mat or sling that prevents the baby from being completely submerged in water. Place the baby bath in a clean sink, bathtub, or on the floor, depending on the manufacturer's instructions. If you don't have a baby bath, you may use a clean kitchen sink instead. Just make sure the tap does not touch the baby's head. Tap covers are available for baby-proofing your sink. Do not use a full-size adult bathtub to bathe a newborn baby. [3] X Expert Source Kylee Money Parenting Consultant Expert Interview. 21 May 2021. They are too deep, and it's difficult to make sure the baby doesn't slip during the bath. If your baby bath doesn't have a tread on the bottom to keep the baby from slipping, line it with a washcloth or separate bath mat."

      "content": "Fill the tub with a few inches of warm water. Run the water and test the temperature. You may use your elbow, wrist or a special bath thermometer to make sure the water isn't too hot or cold for the baby. The water should be comfortably warm to the touch, but not as hot as you'd prefer for your own bath or shower. [4] X Research source If the baby still has their umbilical cord attached, simply fill a bowl with water so you can administer a sponge bath instead. Always test the water before placing the baby in the bath. When in doubt, err on the cooler side; your hands are rougher than a baby's sensitive skin, so they will feel heat more acutely than you. Do not fill the tub more than a couple of inches. Babies should never be submerged in water. As your baby gets a little bigger, you can add a bit more water, but never enough to come close to submerging the baby."

[6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Use cotton balls to wipe the baby's eyes and ears. If you wish, you can use a safe baby soap that is very neutral, but it isn't necessary; a gentle scrub and wash down are adequate to keep babies clean. Don't forget to get between all the little creases and behind the ears and under the neck, where spit-up and moisture tend to collect. Use a little baby soap on a washcloth to wash the baby's hands and feet. Clean the baby's genitals last, using a dab of baby soap if you wish. If you have a baby who is circumcised, gently wipe them with the wet washcloth. Wash female babies from front to back to prevent infection."

You can use baby shampoo if desired, but there is really no need. Babies are born with all the natural oils needed to keep the scalp healthy, and shampoos can easily spoil this balance. [7] X Research source If you use baby shampoo, use your hand to protect the baby's eyes from being irritated. Before rinsing, check again to make sure that the temperature of the running water is not too hot."
