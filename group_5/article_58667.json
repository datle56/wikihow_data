      "content": "Cut off a stem that’s 6 inches (15 cm) long and has 2 to 3 nodes. Find a healthy growing green stem that has lots of leaves and 2 to 3 nodes; these are the bumps or knots that new leaves grow out of along the stem. Then, take a pair of sharp, sterilized scissors or cutting shears and snip off a 6-inch (15 cm) cutting about ½ inch (1 cm) below the node. [1] X Research source Disinfect your scissors or shears by carefully wiping the blades with rubbing alcohol. [2] X Research source Dirty pruning tools can spread harmful bacteria and pathogens between your plants."

Just make sure that your cutting has 2 to 3 leaves at the top. [3] X Research source Then, dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone. Dipping your cutting in rooting hormone is optional, but this helps your tree grow roots faster and stronger."

      "content": "Place the bottom ⅓ of the cutting in water and set it in indirect light. Set your money tree cutting in a cup, vase, or mason jar. Then, fill it with room temperature water so the bottom ⅓ of the cutting is submerged. Money trees love bright, indirect light, so place your cutting in a spot that gets lots of filtered light, like in front of a sunny window. [4] X Research source Chinese money trees are tropical plants, so make sure the spot you choose stays around 65-80° F (18-26° C). [5] X Research source If you don’t get lots of bright, indirect light, place a grow light over your cutting."

      "content": "Change the water every 3-5 days and watch for roots in 1-2 months. The best part about propagating your money tree in water is watching it grow roots. Just change out its water every 3 to 5 days to keep it clean. After several weeks to 2 months, you’ll see little white roots growing from the bottom node in the water. [6] X Research source Money trees are slow growers, so be patient when watching for root development. Some cuttings might grow roots in a few weeks, while others might take over 2 months."

Then, water the soil so it’s moist. Poke a hole in the center of the soil with your finger and settle the rooted cutting inside. Water the soil again thoroughly and then place your new money tree back in its spot that gets bright, indirect light.

      "content": "Watch for new growth forming in about 6 to 8 weeks. When you propagate your money tree in soil, it’s hard to tell when it starts to grow roots. The best way to see if it’s growing is to look out for new growth sprouting at the top of your plant. This can take anywhere from several weeks to several months, so know that your tree is slowly working its magic. [16] X Research source If you don’t see new leaves sprouting after 1 to 2 months, very gently pull on your cutting. If you feel a bit of resistance, this is a sign it’s developing roots. Once your cutting is rooted, keep your new money tree in its warm, bright spot."

These are your tree’s seed pods! Just crack the pod open with a knife and collect all of the nut-like seeds that are brown, dry, and circular; shriveled or white seeds won’t grow into a new money tree. [17] X Research source The seed pods often fall onto the ground and crack open on their own. If your tree isn’t producing seeds, look for them at your local plant nursery. The Chinese money tree’s seeds are actually edible and taste similar to peanuts. They’re tasty raw, roasted, or fried. [18] X Research source Money trees rarely flower and grow seeds indoors because there are no bees or butterflies to pollinate them."

      "content": "Water your tree when the top 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of soil are dry. Care for your money tree so it grows nice and strong by making sure its soil stays moist. Check the soil to feel if it’s dry, then water it thoroughly. Then, regularly mist its leaves with water to ensure the humidity stays around 50%. [23] X Research source If your money tree’s leaves are brown, curly, and crisp, it might not be humid enough. Set your plant on top of a tray full of water and pebbles, or place a humidifier near it. [24] X Research source Cut back on your watering if your money tree’s leaves are yellowing or drooping. Money trees are susceptible to root rot, which is when their roots get damaged from sitting in water. This stems from overwatering, so only water your tree when its soil is dry. [25] X Research source Droopy leaves, soft bark at the base, and a bad smell coming from your tree are all signs of root rot. Take your tree out of its pot and look for black, mushy roots. Then, cut them off and repot your tree. You typically water your tree less during the winter when it’s not growing."

Just use clean, sharp scissors or shears to snip off unruly stems just under a node. Then, tidy up the base of your plant by removing any stems growing at the bottom. [27] X Research source Regularly snip off any dead or dying leaves to keep your plant looking neat, too. Rotate your tree every few months to encourage straight growth. Chinese money trees sometimes lean towards the sun when only 1 side gets consistent light, or they’re not getting enough light. [28] X Research source"

Just fill a new pot that's 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) bigger with well-draining soil . Then, tip your plant over and tap the end of the pot with your hand to slide your tree out. Make a hole in the new soil and nestle your tree inside, filling the hole with dirt. [29] X Research source You typically repot money trees every 2 to 3 years. Don’t worry if a few leaves fall off your plant after you repot it. Money trees don’t like being disturbed, but they bounce back quickly."

Sometimes spider mites, aphids, or mealybugs feast on their leaves, but they’re easy to treat. Either wet a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe down leaves where you see bugs, or spray the leaves with neem oil . [30] X Research source The best way to prevent pests is to inspect the leaves, stem, and soil of any new plants you bring into your home. If you see any bugs, quarantine and treat the plant. [31] X Research source Regularly check your money tree to help catch pests before they become a problem, too."
