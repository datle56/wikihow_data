      "content": "Research shows it can help you learn more effectively . Make sure you bring a pen (or pencil) and plenty of paper whenever you’re heading to class or studying. Jot down important information and try reframing the information in your own words, which can help improve your recall. Write in phrases instead of complete sentences so you can still pay attention and won’t waste time on every little word. [1] X Research source Sure, you can probably type faster than you can write, but taking the time to write out everything by hand can actually retain the information more effectively."

      "content": "Stick to a stable routine to help your mind retain more information. Make a rigorous practice or study schedule instead of trying to learn something in your spare time. Follow the schedule you make and focus only on studying or learning during that time period. [2] X Research source A consistent study routine can help you learn more quickly and effectively."

      "title": "You’ll retain more information if you study in 30-60 minutes sessions.",
      "content": "You’ll retain more information if you study in 30-60 minutes sessions. Distributed practice, also known as “time-chunking” or simply “chunking,” essentially just means you spread out your practice or study sessions over multiple, short periods of time. Stick to shorter sessions focused on specific material. [3] X Research source Cramming or super long study sessions (something like 2-4 hours) may help you remember information in the short-term, but you won’t actually retain as much of it. One way to use distributed practice is to review your notes immediately after a class while it’s still fresh in your mind. You can then study for 30 minutes to an hour each day after to improve your recall."

      "title": "The right mindset can help you learn more effectively.",
      "content": "The right mindset can help you learn more effectively. Try to remind yourself that you’re learning something to improve your knowledge and skills. Think about all of the benefits that come with it, whether they’re professional, financial, or creative. Avoid worst-case-scenario thinking and focus on the potential positive outcomes. It can make a huge difference. [4] X Research source For instance, instead of thinking about all of the things you’re missing out on while you study, try thinking about all of the things learning a new skill or getting a good grade in a class can allow you to do."

    {
      "title": "It can help information stick in your mind.",
      "content": "It can help information stick in your mind. As you review or study information, use your own speech to add an active element to a word or phrase. Say something you really want to remember out loud. It can help it become more distinct in your long-term memory. [5] X Research source For instance, if you’re studying the rules of grammar and you want to remember what a gerund is, you can say something like, “Gerund. Gerund. Ends in ‘I-N-G.’” Try repeating the word or phrase multiple times to really drive it home."

      "title": "Make visual associations with information you’re studying.",
      "content": "Make visual associations with information you’re studying. Try thinking of words, phrases, and information that you’re learning as specific images in your mind. Turn large amounts of data into charts and graphs you can use to study. There are a ton of different ways you can visualize information, so try coming up with your own, too! [6] X Research source For instance, if you’re learning about the different parts of a cell, you could picture the nucleus as an office. The membrane could be like a castle wall and the mitochondria could be little factories in your mind. Find creative ways to help the information stick! Graphs and pie charts can be a super effective way to study large amounts of data."

      "title": "They can help you memorize a large amount of information.",
      "content": "They can help you memorize a large amount of information. A mnemonic device uses a pattern of letters, sounds, or some other association to help you remember something, and if you know the “ABCs” song, then you know exactly how effective they can be! Create mnemonic devices with the information you’re trying to learn and it can help improve your recall. [7] X Research source Mnemonics help you simply and summarize things, so it’s really useful for a large amount of information. For instance, if you’re trying to remember the first 5 US presidents, you could come up with a mnemonic like “White Apples Just Mean Mice” or something like that to represent the first letters of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe."

      "title": "It’s a great way to figure out what you need to learn.",
      "content": "It’s a great way to figure out what you need to learn. Go through the information you’re trying to learn and ask yourself questions about the material. If you answer correctly, great! If not, find the right answer and try to remember it. If you have access to practice tests or quizzes, use them to challenge your recall. If you’re giving a talk or presentation, rehearse it and test yourself by listing all of the information you’ll cover as well as any stats or data you’ll use in it. [8] X Research source The more you test yourself, the more confident you’ll be that you know the information."

      "title": "Changing up the way you practice can help you improve.",
      "content": "Changing up the way you practice can help you improve. If you’re trying to learn a task or skill, practice is super important and one of the most effective ways to get better. But don’t just practice the same way over and over. Instead, try mixing it up and practicing a different way each time, which can help your mind consolidate your memories and recall, making you learn more quickly. [9] X Research source For instance, if you’re giving a presentation on a specific topic, try rehearsing it normally, then try rehearsing it faster than you normally would. After that, you could try rehearsing it more slowly than usual. You can also try breaking it up into smaller chunks and going through each bit multiple times. Find different ways you can practice!"

As you’re studying or testing yourself, ask yourself questions about how well you know something. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For instance, if you’re learning about the geography of Africa, you could ask yourself questions like, “Do I know where Libya is?” or “Could I show someone where Ethiopia is on the map?” Metacognition can also help you avoid wasting time on things you already know."

Cultivate a calm and relaxed mind by practicing meditation or other techniques such as deep breathing exercises.

Try to get at least 30 minutes each day. Use exercise as a healthy way to take a break from your studies that will also actually help with your recall. [12] X Research source Try out a group fitness class, go for a run or bike ride, or lift some weights. Do whatever you feel comfortable doing—just get active! Fun fact: exercise actually increases a chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which helps improve the health of your brain cells. Neat!"

Research shows that eating brain-healthy foods like leafy vegetables, fatty fish, berries, and nuts can boost your brainpower, which may help improve your ability to learn new things.

Your brain consolidates the information you learn while you sleep, and studies indicate that people who get a full night’s sleep have better long-term retention of information.
