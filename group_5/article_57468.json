      "title": "Select your fabric and lining material.",
      "content": "Select your fabric and lining material. While these can be made with light weight materials, decorator weight is ideal. [2] X Research source \"Decorator weight\" is a bit heavier -- think the weight of a tablecloth."

    {
      "title": "Cut the fabric.",
      "content": "Cut the fabric. Add an inch (2.54 cm) in both height and width to the size of the window opening. The extra material is for seam allowances. Outer fabric can be cut a little wider so that it \"wraps\" around each side as a margin on the back side of the shade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pin both layers together.",
      "content": "Pin both layers together. Make sure printed or \"right\" sides are facing. You may want to sew fabric tape to the lining fabric to make channels for inserting the battens rather than gluing (as noted in following steps)."

    {
      "title": "Sew around the perimeter.",
      "content": "Sew around the perimeter. Leave several inches open for turning the fabric \"right\" side out when done. Miter (cut off) the seam allowances at the corners so that it will turn cleanly and it won't bunch up in the corner. If outer fabric is wider to create a margin on the back, sew the sides together. Hem the bottom by hand and use iron-on hem tape at the top; it will not be seen."

      "content": "Measure and mark the horizontal lines. Make marks where you want the horizontal pleats/folds to fall. Glue \"battens\" or thin strips of stiffening material horizontally across your fabric at the pleat marks. Some shade makers will unpick the seams at the sides of the shade fabric and slide the battens between the layers to hide them. Some batten materials could include: old mini-blinds slats, 1/8 metal rods, furring strips, paneling trip strips, etc. While you can do without these battens, you may be sadly disappointed in the sag of your shade pleats without them."

If your loops are different sizes or your pins are uneven, redo them before you get any further. Pin the bottom of the shade. Any hanging material should be the last loop."
