      "content": "Gather yourself. If a coworker, acquaintance or loved one accuses you of something you have not done, it is best to confront them calmly and directly. If you are being accused face to face, you may have to take a deep breath before you begin. If the accusations come to you as a written or recorded message, you will have the opportunity to wait and respond when you are calm and collected.

[2] X Expert Source Hyungbum Kang, MA, MSW, LCSW, MAC Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 22 July 2021. If your accuser is ready to hear you, this can save a lot of back and forth. If your accuser is not yet ready to hear you, check your frustration. Even if the conversation ends without your accuser taking you at your word, know that they may come to believe you when they have had time to process what you said."

      "title": "Get the story.",
      "content": "Get the story. Find out where the accusations come from, and why your accuser might be disposed to believe them. If your accuser is unwilling or unable to reveal the source, ask them if there is someone they would recommend you speak to. If they refuse to help you, ask them to imagine that you are innocent, and ask what they would advise you to do in that case. Ask \"what can you tell me?\" You may have to resign yourself to never getting the full story. Let the rumors die rather than reviving them with investigations."

[3] X Expert Source Hyungbum Kang, MA, MSW, LCSW, MAC Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 22 July 2021. If you have a good network, you may never have to defend yourself again. If you know the accusation began with a careless conjecture or a misunderstanding, rather than malice, ask your accuser to speak up and help you stop the false rumor."

      "title": "Forgive as you go.",
      "content": "Forgive as you go. Remind yourself that what looks like malice is often a mistake or a misunderstanding. Avoid getting angry or retaliating. You may be judged more by the way you behave under pressure than by the rumor.

Have honest, non-judgmental talks with family and friends, and seek counseling if a serious rift has occurred. Take the initiative and invite someone out for coffee who you haven't seen in a while.

Ask how you will know when the investigation is done, who will tell you, and when it is likely to be resolved. If there is information withheld, ask \"what can you tell me about X?\" Make sure to obtain your investigator's name and contact information.

Unless you have a contract that states the minimum length of your employment, you are likely an \"at will\" employee, and can be fired for any reason.

[10] X Research source Not all false accusations count as defamation. If you are not fully identified, if your character has already come under public scrutiny, if you have made statements that support the false claims, if you are a public figure, or if the person defaming you is a former employer or other protected party, your case may not qualify as defamation in every state.
