      "title": "Turn your bra inside out so the new stitches won’t be visible.",
      "content": "Turn your bra inside out so the new stitches won’t be visible. Turn the bra inside out and then smooth out any lumps or bumps that you see with your hands. Lay the bra out on a flat surface, like a table or a countertop. [1] X Research source You can sew a clean or a dirty sports bra, but it’s probably best to use a clean, dry one so the fabric isn’t crumpled up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Situate the pads so they lie flat inside of the bra.",
      "content": "Situate the pads so they lie flat inside of the bra. Adjust the pads within the sports bra so they sit in the cup of the sports bra. Make sure they are smooth and flat without any bumps or folds in them. [2] X Research source If the pads are removable, you can reach in the bra and adjust them. Otherwise, just push and pull the pads through the fabric of your bra."

      "title": "Thread a sewing needle with a 12 in (30 cm) length of thread.",
      "content": "Thread a sewing needle with a 12 in (30 cm) length of thread. Cut a 12 in (30 cm) length of thread and put it through the eye of a sewing needle. Double up the thread, then tie the loose ends together in a small knot to keep your thread in place. [3] X Research source You can pick thread that’s close to the color of your bra, or you can go with whatever thread you have on hand since the stitches will be on the inside of your bra."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make 3 to 4 stitches at the top point of the pad.",
      "content": "Make 3 to 4 stitches at the top point of the pad. Find the very top of the pad at its highest point. Bring your needle into the outer layer of the bra and through the pad, but not the front part of the bra. Pull it back out through the outer layer to make a stitch about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) long, then repeat the stitch 3 to 4 times. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut the thread, tie off the ends, and cut off the excess.",
      "content": "Cut the thread, tie off the ends, and cut off the excess. Once you are done stitching one section of your pad, use sharp scissors to cut the thread so the needle is loose. Then, tie the loose ends of the thread into a tight knot inside of your bra. Use the scissors to cut the rest of the thread off so it’s not hanging on the inside of your bra. [5] X Research source If the small knots of thread stick out and bother you while you’re wearing your bra, tape some moleskin to them to hold them down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the stitch on the side points of the pad.",
      "content": "Repeat the stitch on the side points of the pad. Find the left and right rounded points of your pad and add 3 to 4 stitches on each side with your needle. This will hold down the edges of your pad so they don’t roll in. Cut your thread and tie it in a knot once you’re done with each section. [6] X Research source Make sure your needle never goes through the front part of your bra so you don’t see the stitches from the outside."

      "title": "Put your bra in a delicates bag to protect it during a wash.",
      "content": "Put your bra in a delicates bag to protect it during a wash. Grab a mesh or rubber bag that’s made specifically for putting delicates in and put your sports bra in there when it’s time to wash it. The bag adds a layer of protection between your sports bra and the rough washing machine, so there’s less of a chance that the pads will move around. [7] X Research source You can find these bags at most home goods stores or online for around $10."

    {
      "title": "Set your washer to the “delicates” setting.",
      "content": "Set your washer to the “delicates” setting. Most washing machines have different settings that change how fast they spin. When you wash your sports bra in a washing machine, always put it on the setting for delicates so that your bra doesn’t get spun around too much. [8] X Research source You can also wash other delicates, like regular bras and underwear, on this setting. Most delicate settings automatically use cold water. If yours gives you a temperature option, set it to cold."

    {
      "title": "Wash your sports bra by hand for a gentler wash.",
      "content": "Wash your sports bra by hand for a gentler wash. Fill up a bucket or a sink with warm water and mild laundry detergent. Swish your bra in the water until it suds up, then let it soak for about 15 minutes. Rinse out your bra with cool water until the water runs clear to get rid of all the detergent. [9] X Research source Use caution as you swish your bra around so you don’t disrupt the pads too much. Try to be aware of them as much as you can so you can keep them in place."

    {
      "title": "Hang your bra to dry instead of putting it in the dryer.",
      "content": "Hang your bra to dry instead of putting it in the dryer. Set your sports bra in a cool, dry place and let it dry for 2 to 8 hours before putting it on again. Keep it out of the direct sunlight to avoid fading, and don’t let your bra get too hot, or it could cause shrinkage. [10] X Research source You can use a hanger or a clothes rack to hang up your sports bra."
