      "content": "Prepare your clothing. Before you even open the door, get your skirt or dress ready for your exit. If you're wearing a miniskirt , pull the cloth down to cover as much of your thighs as possible. If you're wearing a longer skirt, dress, or train, pull it down to cover your knees and push any excess fabric toward the center of the car so that it doesn't get caught around your feet when you exit."

      "content": "Open the door as far as you can stretch your arm. Don't lean out of the vehicle to open the door, but make sure it's open far enough that you can exit gracefully. If your date or chauffeur opens the door for you, all the better."

Keep your hands low to give yourself better leverage and to appear more graceful. Try to rise smoothly. Alternatively, you can use one hand to boost you up, and the other hand to hold down your skirt flat against your body as you stand."

      "content": "Make sure your feet are firmly on the ground before stepping away from the car. If the pavement is uneven, or if there's a curb right next to you, the first step can be disastrous, especially if you're in high heels . Be aware of where you put your feet, and watch your step."
