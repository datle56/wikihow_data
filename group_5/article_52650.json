Fill the machine with water and follow the machine's instructions on how to brew a pot of coffee. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a coffee machine, you can make coffee by boiling water and then adding the coffee to the water. 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 ml) are used to make 1 cup (240 ml) of coffee. Use your favorite brand of dark coffee to dye your hair. [2] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021."

      "content": "Let the coffee sit for 15 minutes in a large bowl or basin. Allow the coffee to cool down so that you don’t burn yourself when dipping your hair in the coffee. Once it has cooled, pour the coffee into a bowl, basin, or pot large enough for you to fit your head in so the coffee will reach your roots. [3] X Research source Set a timer for 15 minutes to let the coffee cool down before you start using it."

      "content": "Dip your hair into the coffee and leave it there for several minutes. Lean over in front of the bowl and dip the sections of your grey hair that you’d like to color into the coffee. Once you've dipped your hair, stay in that position for at least 3 minutes to let the coffee color absorb. Know that dipping brown or black hair in coffee to fix grey roots may make the rest of your hair slightly darker, while dipping blonde hair into coffee to fix grey roots will have a more drastic result. [4] X Research source Wrap a towel around your neck and wear an old T-shirt in case you get coffee on yourself. If you’re only dyeing certain sections of your hair, clip back the other sections using hair clips or hair ties so they don’t get in the coffee."

Scoop small amounts of the mixture out using your fingers or a dye application brush and rub it onto the strands of grey hair. Cover each section of grey hair with the mixture to be sure it dyes your hair. [20] X Research source For example, you might apply it to your roots only, to certain strands of grey hairs, or to your entire head.
