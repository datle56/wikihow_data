      "content": "Buy wheat starts from Leif. Leif sells wheat starts for 280 Bells. [1] X Research source You should get at least five wheat starts, as you'll need a decent amount of wheat to make flour. There are two ways you can get wheat starts from Leif: Buy them from Leif's pop-up store in front of Resident Services. Once every two weeks, Leif will visit your island . From his shop, you can buy wheat starts (as well as gardening tools, flowers, and other plant starts). [2] X Research source Buy them from Leif's store in the open-air market on Harv's Island. If you don't have Leif's store unlocked, you'll need to pay 100,000 to Lloid to fund it, and the store will open the next day. If Leif doesn't have wheat starts available, his store stock changes every Monday. Leif will also still show up in front of Resident Services, and on these days, his shop on Harv's Island will be closed. [3] X Research source"

You can also buy the \"Basic Cooking Recipes\" item from Nook's Cranny for 4,980 Bells for even more recipes that use whole-wheat flour instead of basic flour. Get some kitchenware. To make food, you need one kitchenware item. \"Be a Chef! DIY Recipes+\" will give you the recipe for the stonework kitchen, which requires 30 stone, 15 clay, and 10 iron nuggets. However, you can buy other kitchens from Nook's Cranny or the Paradise Planning office. [5] X Research source"
