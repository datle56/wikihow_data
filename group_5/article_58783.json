      "content": "Start with general questions to figure out if you’d work as roommates. There are certain things (such as budget and non-negotiables) that you need to be on the same page about. When you sit down with a possible roommate to get to know them, it’s a good idea to start with these questions, so you’ll know if there’s potential right off the bat.

      "content": "When you're living with someone, it's helpful to have similar routines. For example, it may be difficult if one person works the night shift, and the other likes to wake up at 6:00 a.m. for a morning workout. You’ll likely end up disturbing each other’s sleep cycles, which will leave you both frustrated. Here are some questions about schedules to help make sure you’re on the same page: [2] X Research source What time do you usually go to bed at night? What time do you wake up in the morning?

      "title": "Preferences about diet and pets can be real deal breakers.",
      "content": "Preferences about diet and pets can be real deal breakers. For example, if one person is a dedicated cat mom and the other is severely allergic to cats, they might not work out as roommates. [5] X Research source Similarly, if one roommate is a vegan who hates the smell of meat, and the other loves to cook steak for dinner, they may not be the best match. To avoid these awkward situations, ask these questions: Do you have any pets, or do you plan to get a pet? Are you comfortable with pets living in the apartment? Are you allergic to cats or dogs? Do you have any severe food allergies? And if so, are they so severe that the particular food should not be in the kitchen? Do you have any major dietary restrictions, such as being vegetarian or vegan? And if so, are you comfortable with a roommate cooking meat in the kitchen? How often do you cook? Do you prefer sharing utensils, dishware, and cooking supplies, or do you prefer that we each have our own? Do you prefer sharing certain ingredients like spices and cooking oils, or do you prefer that we each buy them separately? Do you have any appliances (blenders, air fryers, coffee makers, etc) that you will be bringing?"

      "content": "Ask some questions about their likes, dislikes, and hobbies. Getting to know a bit more about their personality will help you determine whether or not you’ll be compatible living together.
