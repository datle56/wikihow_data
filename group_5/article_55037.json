      "title": "Purchase deodorizing products.",
      "content": "Purchase deodorizing products. Some products will advertise things such as odor control or odor removal. However, it's important you use products that have a cleaning agent included. Products that simply mask odors will not get rid of the smell of smoke. Look for products that have: Baking soda. Baking soda naturally neutralizes odors and does it by bringing acidic and basic odor molecules into a more neutral pH or state. [1] X Research source Activated charcoal. Charcoal is used often to filter dirt and particles from water but it also acts as a great deodorizing agent that absorbs odors and smells. [2] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide deodorizes by giving oxygen to a contaminated or smelly area. However, this chemical can act like bleach and should be used carefully and only on certain surfaces. Do a test run on a small area before using it extensively. Also, wear gloves and old clothing when using hydrogen peroxide in case it bleaches the fabric. Be sure to seal the peroxide tightly for storage. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Gather all your clothing, duvets, pillows, and curtains.",
      "content": "Gather all your clothing, duvets, pillows, and curtains. Anything that is cloth or linen and can be washable should be gathered into bags to be washed. You may think a certain item doesn't smell, but you may have gone noseblind to it. This means you have gotten used to the smell of smoke and can't distinguish it from the environment anymore. It's safe to say that if something in a home smells of smoke, most or all items will probably smell like smoke. Wash or dry clean all items. It's important to clean your clothes as well as cloths, linens, and pillows before you plan to clean the rest of the home. Cloths and linens are able to soak up odors more effectively than other types of materials. By getting them out of the way, it makes cleaning other surfaces easier. Consider washing and storing your clean cloths and linens outside of the home. Bringing them back into the home after cleaning runs the risk of your items soaking up smoke odors left in the home."

Remember to take these down as well and clean them with mild soap, water, and a wash cloth. Simply wipe them down and store them outside of the home until you finish the deodorizing process."

      "content": "Use vinegar or diluted bleach to clean non-fabric surfaces. Bleach, and especially vinegar, do well to break up the tars and resins in cigarette smoke. The smell of bleach and vinegar may be off putting at first, but unlike smoke, these odors will dissipate in time. Mix equal parts of white distilled vinegar and warm water to create a cleaning solution. Mix 1/2 cup (115 mL) of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (4 L) of water to clean surfaces like sinks, showers, bathtubs, countertops, glazed tile, vinyl, and floors. Always rinse surfaces with water thoroughly after cleaning, before use. Do not use bleach on the same surface that you applied the vinegar mixture to."

Make sure to take into consideration the size of the room or home, and purchase equipment that is the right size and strength for the area. Note that most air purifiers won't remove gaseous pollutants created by smoke. While those equipped with HEPA filters may reduce certain airborne particles created in relation to the smoke, this won't be 100 percent effective. If you do decide to try this option anyway, do some additional research into the options presently available to find out which, if any, are proven to be effective at removing the odor of smoke."
