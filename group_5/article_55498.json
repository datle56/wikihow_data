      "content": "Harpsichord strings are plucked, while piano strings are struck. When you press a harpsichord key, a small piece of material called a “plectrum” plucks a string, producing a sound that’s always the same volume. [1] X Research source When you press a piano key, however, a small hammer strikes a string according to how hard you pressed the key. This gives you control over the piano’s loudness. [2] X Research source Since their strings are plucked, harpsichords are classified as stringed instruments. Since their strings are struck, pianos are classified as percussion instruments."

      "content": "A piano’s loudness depends on how hard you press the keys. When you press a piano key, a hidden mechanism causes a hammer to strike a string with the same intensity that the key was pressed. [3] X Research source When a harpsichord key is pressed, however, a piece of material called a “plectrum” plucks a string, producing a note that’s same volume regardless of how hard or softly the key was pressed. [4] X Research source Most pianos have hammers wrapped in wool or felt. The wrapping produces a tone that’s powerful but not harsh. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Having more keys gives pianos a greater range than harpsichords.",
      "content": "Having more keys gives pianos a greater range than harpsichords. Pianos have a range of 7¼ octaves (from A0 - C8), while a harpsichord’s range is at most 5 octaves (from F1 - F6). This means that pianos can play higher and lower notes than harpsichords can. [6] X Research source Some harpsichords have as few as 56 keys, giving them an even smaller range. [7] X Research source White piano keys are usually made of ivory or light wood, while the black keys are usually made of a darker wood like ebony. Harpsichord keys are always made of wood.

      "content": "Before pianos, harpsichords were prominent in western classical music. They were heard in operas, symphonies, and concertos by some of Europe’s most famous composers—including Mozart, Bach, and Pachelbel, to name just a few. [9] X Research source By the 1800s, however, pianos came to dominate thanks to their versatility and range. [10] X Research source Since the 19th century, the piano has been featured in music from all over the world. Famous piano players include Mozart, Frédéric Chopin, Billy Joel, Chick Corea, Hiromi Uehara, and Alicia Keys, to name just a few."

      "title": "Both instruments also use keyboards and strings.",
      "content": "Both instruments also use keyboards and strings. The strings are connected to the curved body and are pulled taut to produce a specific musical note when a corresponding key is pressed. [11] X Research source The body sits on top of a wooden soundboard, which vibrates and amplifies the sound. [12] X Research source Though they have a similar shape, harpsichords are usually longer and narrower than pianos since they have fewer keys. Some harpsichords have two keyboards—that is, two sets of keys, one on top of the other. The second set of keys could be moved left or right to quickly change the key of the music being played.

      "title": "Both instruments require the same skillset and techniques.",
      "content": "Both instruments require the same skillset and techniques. Chords, arpeggios, and harmonies are made with similar movements and hand positions. [14] X Research source Music written for the harpsichord can be played on a piano due to the latter’s larger range, and some modern musicians actually believe some harpsichord pieces sound better on the piano. [15] X Research source Some musicians find harpsichord’s slightly easier to play due to the lack of volume control, since they don’t have to worry about how hard they press the keys."
