      "content": "Have a basic Pokémon on your active or bench, as well as the evolution in your hand. The Pokémon a card evolves from is listed on the top left, under the name. A basic Pokémon will evolve into a Stage 1 Pokémon, which will evolve into a Stage 2. You can find its evolution by searching it from your deck or drawing into it. You can also use something Supporter cards, which are special Trainer cards that usually help you draw cards. Use them to draw cards from your deck to increase the chance of getting an evolution card. You can only play one Supporter per turn."

      "content": "Evolve the Pokémon by placing the evolution on top of it. You can only evolve during your turn, as long as it is not your first turn, or if the Pokémon you’re evolving wasn’t just put in play (this includes evolving a Pokémon). You can bypass these restrictions by using an ability like Delta Evolution. Pokémon can also be evolved by using Item cards or effects, like Rare Candy or Wally. The evolved Pokémon will have its special conditions cured, but will keep its damage and energy, and cannot use the moves of its pre-evolution. It's also usually more powerful, with higher HP and stronger attacks."
