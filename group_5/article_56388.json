      "title": "Enchant your weapons and armor.",
      "content": "Enchant your weapons and armor. In addition to crafting weapons and armor out of diamond, you can use an enchantment table to enchant it. Smite V is a good sword enchantment to use against the Wither as it is an undead mob and will take extra damage from it. Enchant a bow with Power V and Infinity to do extra damage. Flame and Punch are ineffective against the Wither. If you are using a crossbow, enchant it with Quick Charge III . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Craft Potions . You will also want to have some potions on hand when you fight the Wither. In a brewing stand, brew some instant health, speed, strength, resistance and regeneration potions. Use gunpowder to turn your instant health potions into splash potions, because these can also be used to deal damage to the Wither. In addition to potions, you can also craft a golden apple using a crafting table and 8 bars of gold and an apple. This food source gives you absorption and regeneration. An Enchanted Golden Apple cannot be crafted, but can be found in loot chests in dungeons, woodland mansions, mineshafts, desert pyramids, and ancient cities. This gives you Absorption, Regeneration, Fire Resistance, and Resistance. A bucket of milk can cure the wither effect. Use an empty bucket to get milk from cows."

Be careful when fighting them, as it can do a lot of damage as well as inflicting the Wither effect. It will take a while to obtain the three skulls, since the drop chance is only 2.5%. Use a sword enchanted with Looting to increase the chances. If a Wither skeleton is blown up by a charged creeper, it will have a 100% chance to drop a skull. However, getting these to the Nether is very tricky."

However, the Wither is invulnerable to damage during this period, and will rapidly start regenerating its health, so any attacks will be useless. The Wither will explode after reaching full health, so make sure you back away a good distance away."

This effect will drain your health much like Poison, but is capable of killing you. Stay away from the Wither and shoot it with your bow while dodging the projectiles. Hide in your base or a long tunnel when needed. Then run out and shoot a few arrows at the Wither. The wither will attack all mobs except undead ones (zombies and skeletons), so you can spawn mobs like snow golems to distract it. Be sure to have all your potions and healing items in your toolbar and ready to use."

In this stage, it will charge at you. Attack it with a diamond sword repeatedly to kill it. You can also throw splash potions of healing at it, as since the Wither is an undead mob, it will take extra damage from them."
