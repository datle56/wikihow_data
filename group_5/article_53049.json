      "content": "Professional estheticians are trained to wax with minimal pain. If you try to wax yourself, you're more likely to make mistakes that could result in a more painful experience. Nervousness and hesitation also cause the whole process to be way more painful than it needs to be. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose an esthetician who uses hard wax.",
      "content": "Choose an esthetician who uses hard wax. When you book your appointment, ask the esthetician what kind of wax they use. Hard wax is less painful and more efficient than soft wax, which needs to be removed with paper strips. [2] X Research source Soft wax is the kind you'll usually get for at-home kits, which is another reason waxing will be less painful if you go to a pro."

      "content": "Get waxed later in the afternoon. Your pain threshold is at its highest between 3 and 5 p.m. and at its lowest first thing in the morning. That means the same procedure will hurt less if you get it done in the afternoon. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Schedule your appointment in the middle of your menstrual cycle.",
      "content": "Schedule your appointment in the middle of your menstrual cycle. Your pain threshold is lower during your period and often for a day or two before and after. This is especially true if you're getting waxed along the \"bikini line.\" To keep your waxing as pain-free as possible, avoid that time of the month.

      "title": "If your hair is too short (or too long) the wax won't grip it properly.",
      "content": "If your hair is too short (or too long) the wax won't grip it properly. Don't try to wax until your hair is at least 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) to give the wax enough hair to grip onto and pull out cleanly. But don't wait too long! If your hair is more than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) long, it'll sting more and you won't get a smooth finish. [5] X Research source Most pros recommend you get waxed every 4-6 weeks. Hair does grow at different rates, but once you've had a couple of appointments you'll have a good feel for how often you need to schedule them."

      "title": "Use a moisturizing body scrub at least once a week and 2 days before waxing.",
      "content": "Use a moisturizing body scrub at least once a week and 2 days before waxing. Body scrubs remove dead skin cells that have built upon the surface of your skin. This helps the wax grip the hair more cleanly for a less painful experience. [6] X Research source If your skin is dry on the day of your appointment, massage in a moisturizer in the morning before your appointment in the afternoon. Let it air dry for a few minutes to give it a chance to really soak into your skin. Exfoliating and moisturizing also helps prevent ingrown hairs after waxing, which can be painful in and of themselves. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Hydrated skin is plumper so the hair is easier to remove. Staying well-hydrated is essential for healthy skin in general, but it's even more important on the day of your waxing appointment if you want to minimize pain. Drink lots of water the day of your appointment and steer clear of other beverages that have a dehydrating effect. [8] X Research source Caffeine and other stimulants also make your skin more sensitive, which can increase the pain from waxing—so skip your coffee the day of your waxing appointment.

      "content": "Apply an anesthetic cream about 30 minutes before your appointment. Anesthetic creams are also available OTC at your local pharmacy. Rub the cream onto your skin like you would any lotion and allow your skin to absorb it. [13] X Research source These creams don't work for everybody, so you might still feel some pain. But if you have a really hard time dealing with the pain from waxing, it's worth a shot."

      "title": "Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth.",
      "content": "Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth. Deep breaths before and during your waxing will relax you, which helps decrease pain. Pay attention to your breath, inhaling slowly, then pausing and exhaling at the same rate. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Listen to music or watch a video while getting waxed.",
      "content": "Listen to music or watch a video while getting waxed. Estheticians often have music or television available to help you take your mind off the waxing. If they don't, ask if you can put something on your smartphone to distract you. [15] X Research source If you watch the esthetician waxing you, you'll likely anticipate the pain, which will make it hurt more."

      "title": "Wait 6 to 8 hours after waxing before working out.",
      "content": "Wait 6 to 8 hours after waxing before working out. The sweat and heat from a workout can inflame your skin, which can lead to a rash or chafing right after a wax. Your skin will also be more sensitive, so you don't want to subject it to friction or heat. [16] X Research source Steam or a hot shower or bath are also likely to inflame your skin post-wax, so wait a day or 2 on those."
