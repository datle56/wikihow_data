      "content": "Be able to acquire security clearance. You cannot actually obtain a security clearance until you are employed in a government job, or have been sponsored by a company or agency who wishes to hire you. However, you should try to determine if you are eligible for clearance before you begin. If you have previously had a security clearance in the past, this is a good indicator that you will be able to obtain one again. The following are some of the factors that generally prevent a person from obtaining a security clearance: Past criminal convictions that lead to jail time of 1 year or more. Current use of illegal or controlled substances. A determination of mental incompetence by a DoD-approved mental health professional. A dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces. Unwillingness to surrender a foreign passport. Severe, repeated financial problems. Intentional false statements made in the application process. Repeated alcohol abuse. A pattern of criminal or conduct or rule violation."
