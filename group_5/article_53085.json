      "content": "This is a fun way to mix up your Switch at any time. Just buy a skin or a decal (adhesive stickers that fit over the back and border of your Switch), then stick it onto your Nintendo Switch for a fun color or pattern. [1] X Research source You can even buy matching decals to fit over your controllers, too! Look for skins and decals online or at most home goods stores. You can find different colors, patterns, and themes to fit your style. Make sure the skins and decals say “residue-free” or “safe-removal” to ensure they don’t hurt your Switch when you take them off."

      "content": "Snap-on plastic covers can protect your Switch while giving it new life. Find one with a pattern or a color that you like, then snap it onto the back of your Switch for a fun, personal detail. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that snap-on covers can make your Switch look and feel a little thicker, so it might not be a great option for traveling. Most snap-on covers are around $20."

      "title": "These covers add a new color or design to the outside of your Switch.",
      "content": "These covers add a new color or design to the outside of your Switch. Plus, they’re soft and squishy! Take the Joy Cons off your Switch, then slide your new cover over the Switch itself. [3] X Research source Silicone covers also give your Switch a little bit of extra protection in case it falls off your lap or the table. Look for a cover with your favorite Nintendo game characters on it to match your style."

      "content": "Make your Joy Cons look cute with some custom grips. Order new grips online, then simply pop them over the top of your existing thumb grips, or the part of your Joy Con that you wiggle with your thumbs. [4] X Research source Thumb grips are super easy to take on and off, so you can always mix and match them. You can find a pair of thumb grips for around $10."

      "content": "Match your Switch color to your Joy Cons without buying new ones. Just slide the silicone or plastic covers over your Joy Cons, and make sure all of the buttons line up with the holes. [5] X Research source You can usually buy Joy Con covers in a set with a Switch cover. You’ll still be able to use all the buttons on your Joy Cons even with a shell on."

      "content": "A super easy way to give your Switch some personality is small stickers! Add a few to the back or on top of your Joy Cons for a fun decoration that’s easy to peel off. [6] X Research source Don’t put stickers on the screen, though—they could leave a sticky residue. If you find any adhesive left over when you take the stickers off, use a commercial degreaser. Try using stickers of your favorite Nintendo game characters."

      "title": "These fun designs can give your Switch a new pattern.",
      "content": "These fun designs can give your Switch a new pattern. Apply your Washi tape, or craft tape, carefully around the outside of your screen for a fun border, or add it to the back of the Switch for an all over pattern. [7] X Research source Washi tape is easy to peel off, so it won’t leave a residue on your Switch. You can find tons of colors and patterns at craft stores."

      "content": "Dangle a fun charm or a puff ball from your Switch for a 3D decoration. Buy a few charms that come with a headphone jack hoop for your Nintendo Switch. Tie your charms to the metal hoop, then plug the hoop into the headphone jack for a fun way to show your personality. [8] X Research source If you want to use your headphones, just pull the hoop out of the headphone jack. Try a puff ball, a jewelry charm, or even a ribbon!"

      "title": "For a truly customized Switch, you can grab your paintbrush.",
      "content": "For a truly customized Switch, you can grab your paintbrush. Put Washi tape down on the area that you want to paint so you don’t paint directly onto your Switch. Then, use acrylic paint for a fun border, pattern, or color! [9] X Research source Go for a white border to really make your screen stand out, or try a pastel color, like pink, yellow, or blue. If you decide you don’t like the paint color anymore, just peel the tape off to take the paint with it. Try not to get paint on the actual Switch itself. It could leave residue on the screen or on the back. You can also customize a clear case with acrylic paint. That way, you aren’t painting directly onto the Switch."

      "title": "Instead of buying new Joy Cons, you can replace the shells instead.",
      "content": "Instead of buying new Joy Cons, you can replace the shells instead. Use a small screwdriver to remove your existing shells, then replace them with your new ones (being careful to keep all the hardware in place as you found it). [10] X Research source You should only try this option if you feel confident in your ability to put your Joy Cons back together. Usually, changing a Joy Con shell voids the warranty with Nintendo, so you won’t be able to get a fix or replacement if something goes wrong down the line."
