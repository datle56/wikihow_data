Provide your license plate number and your car’s make, model, and color, then ask why your car was towed and who towed it. The parking authority should have answers, although their database may take a few hours to update. Call your city’s non-emergency police number (like 311) for more information if the parking authority can’t answer all of your questions. [1] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source Ask business or apartment complex owners who they called to tow your vehicle if you were parked on their property. When in doubt, ask people in the area or passersby if they saw which towing company moved your car. Don’t call 911 to ask about a towed car. It’s considered a waste of emergency resources and may be illegal (look for your jurisdiction's Non-emergency police number instead)."
