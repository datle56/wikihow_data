      "content": "Once the date ends, feel free to shoot them a text if you’re into them! If things went well, don’t worry about violating any kind of social norm here. Let them know you had fun and that you hope to see them again. If they like you too, they’ll be happy to see your text pop up on the screen. [1] X Research source You might say, “Hey thanks for the great night! I really had a lot of fun :)” or, “That was a blast. We should do it again some time!” People get self-conscious about this, and a lot of 21+ folks grew up hearing adages about waiting a certain amount of time before texting. That’s kind of outdated advice these days."

      "content": "If you want to know if they’re super into you, give it a little. You don’t want to wait more than 24 hours to text them if you really like them, but it’s totally okay to wait a little to see if they hit you up first. If they do text you first, it’s a major sign that the date went just as well as you imagined! [2] X Research source You can try playing hard to get by waiting a little bit after getting their text to reply , but it’s also totally fine to reply right away!

      "content": "If you just had one date and the sparks didn’t fly, it’s okay to wait. This is particularly salient advice if you’re on the older side and you and your date both have a lot going on professionally or personally.

      "title": "Feel things out with the other person to see how you two click.",
      "content": "Feel things out with the other person to see how you two click. A single text a day gives the other person something to respond to without making you seem too desperate or uncaring. If they hit you back really quick and the two of you text up a storm, let it happen! If your conversations are more sporadic, that’s okay, too. This gives the two of you time to establish a rapport and set a vibe. [4] X Research source A simple, “Hey! How are you doing?” is a perfectly safe and laid-back way to go. You could ask something open-ended, like, “How was your day?” or, “What was the highlight of your day?” to give them something to respond to."

      "content": "If the two of you hit it off right away, don’t overthink it. It’s easy to get up in your head about whether you’re texting too often, or not enough, or whatever. If the date went well, you’re into them, and you get the vibe that they’re into you, text as much as you’d like. So long as your conversations aren’t really lopsided where one of you is sending multiple messages before the other responds, it’s totally okay. [5] X Research source The etiquette surrounding texting after a first date used to be very conservative and concrete. These days, people treat texting like an extension of a regular conversation, so don’t be super self-conscious here."

      "content": "If you don’t want to seem too eager, read, wait, then reply. If you respond to the other person’s texts as soon as you get them, it can leave the impression that you’re hanging on their every word. If you want to come off a little more laid back, wait a few minutes after you get each text before you reply. This won’t damage the conversation, and you may come off as a little more mysterious!

It’s totally normal to not know right away whether a relationship has legs or not, so send them a text periodically. If they latch on and pick the convo up, awesome!

Don’t penalize them or read into it too much if they hit you with a “Oh, sorry, I got caught up and forgot to reply” once or twice. However, if you’ve texted them a few times and they haven’t replied at all, don’t text them again. They may simply be too weak to acknowledge that they don’t want to go on a second date, and if that’s the case, you’re better off without them anyway. [10] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. If they felt a little cold or detached on the first date as well, they probably aren’t into it.
