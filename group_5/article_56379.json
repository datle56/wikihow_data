      "content": "Kill Nilsine Shatter-Shield. Inside the Halls of the Dead you’ll find a single woman with golden-brown hair in a grey-and-white dress. This is Nilsine Shatter-Shield. Once you see her, you can immediately attack her with any weapon or magic spell your character is using to kill her. Nilsine Shatter-Shield has a very low life point and can be killed with only one strike of your sword. You don’t need to talk to her to meet the requirement of the “Mourning Never Comes” quest. You can simply finish her off as soon as you spot her."
