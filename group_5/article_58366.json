      "title": "Find a laser tag arena in your area and enlist some friends to play.",
      "content": "Find a laser tag arena in your area and enlist some friends to play. Laser tag arenas are parks designed specifically to play laser tag. They can be rented out or you can simply show up and get in line with your friends, although you should check ahead of time to see if the arena has open play before you go. Pick an area that looks cool to you and visit with 6-30 friends. The cost for playing laser tag is usually between $10-50 per person. You can certainly purchase your own laser tag equipment, but people usually play at areas since they’re designed with unique layouts that make playing fun. You also usually play laser tag in the dark, and an arena allows you to play under dim lighting which makes the game more fun."

      "title": "Wear dark clothes to blend into the background.",
      "content": "Wear dark clothes to blend into the background. Wear a black or navy blue shirt and a set of black or navy athletic pants or jeans. This way you’ll blend into the background and be harder to spot in the dim lighting of the arena. Wear comfortable tennis or gym shoes so that you can comfortably run."

      "title": "Split your friends up into 2-4 teams.",
      "content": "Split your friends up into 2-4 teams. Before the game, split your friends up into 2, evenly-matched teams. Some arenas allow for up to 4 teams to compete at once, so split up into smaller squads for a more competitive game. Either separate into multiple groups on your own, or select team captains to draft players for their team. [1] X Research source Discuss strategy ahead of time! Meet with your team and figure out how you’re going to advance on the map and who will take the lead. Unless you’re playing competitively in a tournament, laser tag is all about having fun. Split the teams up so that they’re evenly-matched and everyone can have a good time."

      "title": "Put on your tactical vest and tighten the straps.",
      "content": "Put on your tactical vest and tighten the straps. Put your vest on and tighten the clips in the front. Tighten the straps on the side by pulling them until the vest is snug on your body. In laser tag, you are “hit” when an infrared laser strikes one of the sensors on your vest. If your vest is too loose, your sensors could accidentally go off, so make sure that your vest fits and is tight on your body. [2] X Research source There are usually sensors in the middle of the chest, tops of the shoulders, and back. There may be a sensor in your gun as well."

    {
      "title": "Pick up a laser gun and determine whether it has cartridges or not.",
      "content": "Pick up a laser gun and determine whether it has cartridges or not. Pick a laser gun up. Arenas usually give every player the same model, so it really shouldn’t matter which one you pick. Inspect the gun to see if it has instructions for turning it on if it lists the ammo on the side of the gun. Cartridge laser guns have a limited amount of ammunition and must be reloaded or recharged. This is important because your strategy will change drastically depending on whether you have unlimited ammo or not. [3] X Research source Some laser guns have nicknames printed on them. This is how you’ll figure out what your score is at the end of the game."

    {
      "title": "Review the game rules and the map.",
      "content": "Review the game rules and the map. Most games are either elimination-style where a player is out of the game once they’re hit, or point-based, where you score points by hitting other players and only remove them from the game temporarily. Either way, there will be a pre-game presentation provided by the arena explaining what is allowed and what is not. [4] X Research source Depending on where you’re playing and how old you are, you may not actually be allowed to run during the game. If you aren’t, move by staying low and shuffling quickly to stay out of firing range. Other common game modes include battle royale, where every player is on their own and the last player standing wins, and capture the flag, where a team wins by capturing a position or item."

      "title": "Start playing once the buzzer goes off.",
      "content": "Start playing once the buzzer goes off. Enter the arena and set up with your team. Either start in the assigned area, or find a safe end of the arena. Wait until the buzzer goes off to start the game. Some arenas use other cues to indicate when the game has started, like dimming lights or an announcement of some sort. If you’re allowed to pick where to start, it helps to begin in an area far away from your opponents so that you can track their movements from a safe distance. If you’re starting from a predetermined area, identify a safe set of cover nearby where your team can set up. When the buzzer goes off, sprint or move quickly to that location."

    {
      "title": "Shoot at your opponents to knock them out or stun them.",
      "content": "Shoot at your opponents to knock them out or stun them. When you pull the trigger while aiming at your opponent’s vest, you’ll hit them. Depending on the style of game that you’re playing, this will either knock them out of the game, or “stun” them. When a player is stunned, their gun stops working and you’re awarded points. [5] X Research source Players that are stunned will be knocked out of play for 5-30 seconds depending on the arena’s rules. In some arenas, you can still hit your opponent when they’re stunned but they can’t shoot back. Rack up as many points as you can while their gun isn’t working by firing repeatedly."

    {
      "title": "Avoid taking fire by ducking for cover and moving quickly.",
      "content": "Avoid taking fire by ducking for cover and moving quickly. To avoid getting knocked out or stunned yourself, look for obstacles on the map that you can duck behind. Move from cover to cover when traveling across the map to avoid getting hit, and never stay out in the open for too long. [6] X Research source Zig-zag while you run to make it harder to aim at you. This is only a good strategy in open areas though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play until the end of the round or until you’re knocked out.",
      "content": "Play until the end of the round or until you’re knocked out. When time in the round is up or a team has won, your vests will either go off, or a buzzer will signal the end of the game. In some arenas, the lights will turn back up. When the round is over, either reset for the next round, or leave the play area to view the scoreboard. [7] X Research source There are usually multiple rounds played in a single session. A session can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours."

      "title": "Work in pairs to make you harder to pick off.",
      "content": "Work in pairs to make you harder to pick off. It will be easier to take down individual opponents if you’re rushing them with a partner. Similarly, it will be harder to sneak up on you if you’ve got a teammate watching your back. Before the game starts, split your team up into smaller pairs. When occupying a position, have one player cover one direction and another player cover the opposite side to stay safe while playing. You can split up into teams of 3-4 if you prefer. It will be harder to move around without making a lot of noise or getting noticed at that point though."

    {
      "title": "Cover for your teammates by laying down covering fire.",
      "content": "Cover for your teammates by laying down covering fire. When a teammate is moving across the map, they’re going to be an open target for the enemy team. Help keep them safe by firing repeatedly at the enemy—even if you think you’re going to miss. This will make the opponent less likely to take risks, and they’re going to be less accurate while they’re aiming at your friend. Ask your teammates to lay down covering fire for you when you’re moving!"

    {
      "title": "Blitz a position as a team to take occupied ground.",
      "content": "Blitz a position as a team to take occupied ground. If the enemy is held up in a safe location on the map, it may be hard to just sneak your way in there and take them down. Instead, carry out a coordinated attack by spreading your team out and attacking quickly from multiple sides. Be willing to give up a few players to shake the enemy loose from their spot and take the position for yourself. Be careful when using this strategy. If it goes poorly, you’ll end up giving up a lot of points."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep a nearby exit open in case you get rushed.",
      "content": "Keep a nearby exit open in case you get rushed. When your team is holding a position down, identify a nearby escape route that you can take in case you get rushed. Try to avoid taking up positions that are corners or tight areas where you won’t be able to escape if you get sieged or rushed. In general, positions with multiple exits are better spots to hold down anyway, since your team will be able to cover multiple paths and take down the individual players that walk by."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot while you’re moving to keep the enemy off of you.",
      "content": "Shoot while you’re moving to keep the enemy off of you. When you’re moving, if your team isn’t providing covering fire, provide it yourself. Before you start moving, raise your gun up and look down the sights. Then, as you’re moving, keep your head on a swivel by looking back and forth down the sights. If you see any opponents, fire repeatedly to keep them from hopping up and getting a free shot. In general, unless you absolutely know there’s no one around, you shouldn’t lower your gun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take the high ground if there’s a second floor.",
      "content": "Take the high ground if there’s a second floor. If the arena has multiple levels, taking the high ground can make it easier to track your enemy. From the second floor, you’ll have an easier time spotting the enemy as they move across the map. You’ll also be safer from the second floor since your opponent would have to look upwards to notice you. The one instance where this may not be true could be the beginning of the game. If there’s a second level, a bunch of players are likely going to be rushing upstairs as soon as the buzzer goes off. Expect a massive shootout in the first minute or two."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change your rate of fire based on your ammunition.",
      "content": "Change your rate of fire based on your ammunition. If the guns have limited ammunition, you’ll need to conserve your ammunition and maneuver around the map to get into position for higher-percentage shots. If the guns have unlimited ammunition, you’ll be rewarded for firing as often as possible and playing a little more defensively by finding a safe spot and shooting from cover."
