      "content": "Before you challenge the Pokémon Champion, Cynthia, make sure your Pokémon team is healed up and you have everything prepared. The only thing that changes in Platinum is her Pokémon. She now has a Togekiss, rather than a Gastrodon. She still has her other Pokémon from Diamond/Pearl. All of her Pokémon (except Roserade) are hard to beat. Her Spiritomb has no weakness, so you're going to have to hit it with your strongest attack. Her Garchomp, Togekiss and Roserade are commonly weak against Ice-type moves. Her Milotic is weak against Electric-type and Grass-type moves. Her Lucario is weak against Fire-type, Fighting-type and Ground-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 60 before taking her on."
