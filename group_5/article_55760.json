      "content": "A basic pedicure lasts 1-2 weeks, while a gel pedicure lasts 3-4 weeks. Gel polish is longer lasting than regular nail polish, but the lifespan of your pedicure depends on your lifestyle, shoe choice, and how quickly your nails grow. If you’re super active, your polish is more likely to chip because your toes keep rubbing against your shoes, and your feet are unlikely to remain soft and smooth. [1] X Research source Similarly, if your toenails grow fast, your pedicure won’t stay “salon fresh” for long. You might have to schedule a weekly appointment to fill in any nail polish gaps at the base of your nails (near the cuticle). A gel pedicure is more durable than a basic pedicure, but it costs about $10 more—a standard polish service is $45, while gel polish is $55. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Schedule an appointment for a full pedicure package once a month. A pedicure is a great way to pamper yourself, but most people don’t need to schedule an appointment every week to maintain their nails. If you plan to get a full pedicure package (with massage, scrub, cuticle removal, and polish), schedule an appointment once a month—doing it too often can over-exfoliate your skin. [3] X Research source For a basic cleaning, shaping, or painting session, you can safely schedule an appointment every 1-2 weeks. While many people book a pedicure when they simply want a new shade of polish, you may want to head to the salon if you notice: major chipping, cracked heels, corns and calluses, ingrown nails, unevenly shaped nails, and untidy cuticles"

      "title": "Avoid getting your toes wet for at least 12 hours after your pedicure.",
      "content": "Avoid getting your toes wet for at least 12 hours after your pedicure. Even though your toes may feel dry to the touch 1-2 hours after leaving your appointment, it actually takes between 12-24 hours for nail polish to fully dry. To prevent your polish from warping or lifting, avoid exposing your toes to any water or steam for the first 12 hours. [4] X Research source Wait a full week before swimming in a chlorine pool—the harsh chemicals can ruin your freshly-painted toes and dry out your cuticles."

      "title": "Re-apply a clear topcoat every 7-10 days.",
      "content": "Re-apply a clear topcoat every 7-10 days. To maintain the look of your pedicure, ask your nail technician about which brand of topcoat they used for your toes. Reapply the topcoat every few days to help your pedicure look as shiny as possible and keep the edges from lifting prematurely. [5] X Research source Make sure to apply your topcoat in thin layers to prevent your polish from chipping off in large chunks."

      "title": "Apply cuticle oil every 2-3 days.",
      "content": "Apply cuticle oil every 2-3 days. Keeping your toenail cuticles hydrated helps keep them in shape and extend the life of your pedicure. Squeeze a drop of cuticle oil onto each toe, then massage the oil into your cuticles ; make sure to work the oil into the sides of your nail, as well as the skin surrounding the nail. [6] X Research source Although some cuticle care kits include clippers, never use them to remove your cuticles at home; it can increase your risk of a bacterial infection. You can also keep your cuticles moisturized with products like Aquaphor and Vaniply . [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Touch up any small chips with your base color. Ask your nail technician about which brand and color they used on your toes, so you can patch up any minor damage at home—without having to schedule an appointment. Before painting a fresh coat of polish, roll the bottle between your hands to prevent any air bubbles (instead of shaking it). Then, swab your nails with white vinegar to remove any buildup and help your polish apply more evenly. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Protect your pedicure by wearing socks or slippers.",
      "content": "Protect your pedicure by wearing socks or slippers. When you get a pedicure, your nail technician sloughs dead skin and calluses away from your feet, leaving your skin extra smooth. To extend the life of your pedicure, cover your feet with socks or slippers—even when you’re just lounging around the house. [9] X Research source If possible, try to wear closed toed shoes when you go outside. Covering your toes prevents your pedicure from getting beat up as you walk around, and it protects your polish from the sun, preserving its shine. To remove dry skin between nail appointments, massage your feet with an exfoliating foot scrub , and use a pumice stone to get rid of calluses : soak your in warm water, then scrub away the dead skin cells with the stone."

      "content": "Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Staying hydrated helps keep your skin (and cuticles) soft and moisturized, extending the length of your pedicure. Dry, brittle nails are prone to breakage and cracking, so be sure to drink enough water throughout the day—especially during the hotter months. [10] X Research source"
