      "content": "Log out of social networks. Nothing can ruin a digital detox or any peaceful time like an electronic device that’s beeping, binging, and chirping every two minutes. Staying logged in will make it easy for you to quickly turn on your device, especially if you have widgets, and check your social networking updates. Logging out and turning off all notifications for social media can help you stick with your detox. You don’t need to disable your account, but you can log out of the app on your device. You can log back in once your digital detox is over. Make sure you know your login information before you log out of the app. Turn off your alerts and notifications if you can’t or don’t want to log out of your apps."

      "content": "Choose when to detox. Although you may want to start your digital detox right now, you should think about the timing of your detox first. Deciding to log off during a peak work time or around exam time during school may not be the best decision. Choose a time when you have fewer responsibilities and when there will be less consequences for missing a message or two. [2] X Research source Think about having your detox over a weekend, school break, or holiday. You are less likely to receive important messages during those times. Look at your calendar and pick a time when you don’t have any upcoming deadlines or important events. This way you won’t miss updates about them."

      "title": "Decide how long to detox.",
      "content": "Decide how long to detox. In general a digital detox will last for about one to two days. [3] X Research source This gives you time to connect with your friends and family and do some of the things you’ve been meaning to do.

      "content": "Think through the logistics. You may not realize all the ways in which you depend on your smartphone and other devices in your day-to-day life. For instance, if you use your phone as an alarm, do you have an alarm clock you can use while you detox? If you want to listen to music during the detox, do you have a radio? If you use your phone or computer for driving directions, do you have maps so you won't get lost? Before your detox, try to note all the different ways in which you rely on your devices and think of other ways to meet your needs. You may also need to think about how you will do this if your family is not participating in the detox. What will you do if everyone is watching TV? Do you have a digital-free area where you can retreat to read or work on a craft project? How will you fill your time and avoid the temptation when other people are using their devices?"

      "title": "Give advance notice.",
      "content": "Give advance notice. If you are including work or school in your digital detox, you may need to let others know what you are doing. [9] X Research source This way they can let you know what’s going on and you won’t miss messages about major deadlines or other important information. Do you have a landline so that someone can call and reach you in case of an emergency? You might also want to let family members know that it's okay to show up unannounced if there is an emergency. Ask someone to contact you with important messages if your digital detox is going to last more than 12 hours. For instance, say something like, “Could you call me on my landline if we have a schedule update at work?” If you primarily communicate with people via text, email, or messaging, you may want to let them know what’s going on."

It doesn’t have to be a big thing like repainting their house, but you can take an hour or two to do something that benefits someone else. Volunteer for a cause or organization that you support or attend a charitable event in your neighborhood. Offer to go grocery shopping for your dad, walk your neighbor’s dog, or help your friend wash her car."

Consider the hour before bed as a non-digital time. Put your electronic devices on vibrate and turn any non-essential alerts off. Have a regular weekend detox for a few hours. For example, you might want to spend every Sunday morning free of your electronics."
