      "content": "Rule Summary To play True American, players take turns climbing across furniture to avoid touching the floor, like the game “Floor is Lava.” At the center of the game is a “castle” made up of various beers and a large bottle of alcohol. The players grab and drink the beers from the castle as they move to different pieces of furniture. Once all the beers have been removed, the first player to grab the bottle of alcohol and take a drink is the winner. [1] X Research source On the TV show New Girl , True American was created to be an intentionally vague and complicated drinking game, so it may be a bit confusing at first."

      "title": "The Castle",
      "content": "The Castle The castle is a table or piece of furniture set up in the center of the playing area. It is made up of a bottle of liquor (or the “king of the castle”) and 20 beers (or “pawns”). The beers are arranged in 4 lines of 5 beers, extending from each side of the bottle of liquor in an “X” shape. The castle is the focal point of True American, and players take and drink beers from it as they play the game. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Zones (Layout)",
      "content": "Zones (Layout) The layout of the game consists of 4 zones the players must move through. The zones are centered around the castle and separated by the lines of beer. Each zone contains 5 pieces of furniture or household objects on which the players stand. Players must step or leap to each of these objects without touching the floor. Players can only take a beer from the castle when standing on the object in the center of the zone. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Winning or Losing To win True American, players must first remove all pawns (beers) from the castle. Then, the first person to land on a center space, finish all remaining beers in their hand, and take a drink from the king (bottle of liquor) wins the game. [4] X Research source Anyone who “falls in lava” (or steps on the floor) loses True American. You’ll also be disqualified if you have less than 1 or more than 3 beers in hand. Getting caught with an empty container can disqualify you, as well. Luckily, you can rejoin the game by drinking and finishing another beer that isn’t a pawn. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Gather at least 4 players and pick teams if desired. While it isn’t required to divide players into teams, having teams of at least 2 people each will create a more competitive atmosphere and encourage players to get more involved. To create teams, have each player hold up a number between 1 and 5 on their foreheads. The players who hold up the same number will be on a team together. Repeat the process until the teams are balanced and have the same number of players. [6] X Research source For example, let’s say you have 6 players total. Two players held up a 1, so they’re on the same team. If the other 4 members all picked different numbers, they’ll keep picking different numbers until they’re paired off in teams of two. If more than 2 players pick the same number, they can all be on the same team or keep choosing numbers until they’re paired off. The remaining player can then join another team or play by themselves—the rules are up to you."

Place a bottle of liquor in the middle of the table. The liquor bottle will serve as the “king of the castle,” and the first player to drink from this bottle will win the game. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a table, lay some mats on a section of the floor and designate this area as the castle. Make sure you have a large space to play the game, like a living room or recreation room. You need enough space around the table to create the required obstacle course zones. Choose a hard liquor like whiskey or a liquor that is a favorite amongst you and your friends. For a non-alcoholic option, try juice, milk, soda, or another beverage."

      "content": "Set up 4 lines of 5 beers each that extend from the liquor bottle in an X-shape. Both beer bottles and cans are fine. Line the beers up so they form 4 straight lines that extend from each side of the bottle. These 4 lines represent the barriers between the 4 playing zones, and the set of 20 beers serve as “pawns” that belong to the “Soldiers of the Secret Order.” [8] X Research source Creating the perfect ratio between beers and players makes for an interesting game. Having 5 pawns per branch easily supports a game of 4 people, and feel free to add more pawns to each branch if you have a larger number of players."

      "content": "Set up 4 triangle-shaped zones with 5 objects to stand on in each zone. Create 4 V-shaped zones in your playing area, each confined within the space designated by two lines of beer at the castle. In each zone, set up 5 pieces of furniture or household items for players to stand on, like pillows, blankets, chairs, and tables. Arrange the objects in a V, placing the center object closest to the castle and the first and last objects farthest away. [9] X Research source The center space in each zone is the only place where players can retrieve a pawn, which is why it needs to be closest to the castle. Make sure the objects are large enough for 1 or 2 people to stand on, and leave some distance between each one to make moving to the next space more challenging. Remember, the floor is lava in True American, so the players must be able to step or jump to the next object without touching the floor. When you’re done setting up each zone, the setup should roughly resemble a flower that has 4 petals."

Traditional shotgunning involves poking a hole in the bottom of a beer can and popping the top to quickly drink it from the hole. If you don’t want to make a mess, an alternate option would be to chug the beers normally. The order in which you and your friends finish your beers determines the order in which you will play the game. [10] X Research source Another option is to use a game of chance to determine who will have the first turn, like playing Rock, Paper, Scissors or by flipping a coin. Whoever wins gets to go first. The person who wins the tip-off, regardless of which method you use, is the first “president,” or player in control."

In response, all of the other players will yell “FDR.” Then, everyone will take a pawn (beer) from the castle and rush to stand on any of the 5 objects within the 4 zones. Once every player is on an object, the floor becomes lava, and players cannot touch it or they’ll be out of the game. [11] X Research source"

Each time it’s your turn or you earn the chance to move forward, move to the next space within your zone without touching the floor. Once you land on or pass the center space of that zone, proceed to the next zone and continue the clockwise rotation. Each time you move, take a drink from your pawn. [12] X Research source Remember, the floor is lava in True American, so if you touch it, you’re out of the game. Step or jump from object to object as you move throughout the game. The only time you can touch the floor is if you’re on a bathroom break, in which you can “fly” over the lava by flapping your arms like a bird on the way to and from the bathroom."

After you move forward a space during your turn, you’ll be in charge of giving the other players a chance to move, as well. As the player in control, allow the players to compete for movement using 1 of 3 methods. Once you do this, your turn will be over, and the process will start over for the next player. Here are the three ways players can move forward when it isn’t their turn: [14] X Research source Counting method: Count upwards by yelling out, “One, two, three.” Each player will then hold up a number between 1 and 5 on their foreheads. The player holding up a number that no one else has wins, and moves forward 1 space. If there are multiple players who held up a number that no one else picked, each of the winners gets to move forward 1 space. [15] X Research source Quote method: Say a quote and ask players to complete it. This can be a famous quote from history, pop culture, or literature. Choose one that you think will equally stump each of your friends, or make your friends act quickly to finish an easy quote. All players who correctly recite the quote in tandem with you before you complete the quote get to move forward 2 spaces. Commonality method: Think of either 2 people, places, or things that have a key feature or element in common (for example, George Washington and a nutcracker soldier both have wooden teeth). The first player to correctly identify what those 2 things have in common will get to move forward 3 spaces. For each space a player earns, they will have to take an equivalent amount of drinks from their pawn as well. This will be the part of each turn in which players will need to really pace their drinking in order to maintain the needed 1 to 3 pawns."

      "content": "Have 1 to 3 pawns in hand at all times to stay in the game. Having no pawns or more than 3 in your hand can cause you to lose the game. Getting caught with an empty pawn will also disqualify you. Carefully strategize the size of drinks you take depending on where you land throughout the game. [16] X Research source For example, if you haven’t had any luck landing on a center space, take small sips of your beer until you pick up a second one. If you frequently land on center spaces, take bigger gulps to make sure you do not collect more than 3 pawns at a time."

      "content": "Add optional rules to make the game more fun. Because True American is based on a vague drinking game in New Girl , there aren’t many “official” rules. However, within the show, the game evolved and new rules were mentioned throughout different episodes. Here are some of the show’s rules that you can add to your game to make it more chaotic: [19] X Research source Everything is a lie when you play True American. When a player finishes their beer, they yell, “All trash belongs…” and the other players respond with “In the junkyard!” At that point, all empty cans or bottles are thrown in a designated trash can or receptacle. This keeps the playable area from becoming littered. A player can yell “JFK” at any point, and everyone else must respond by yelling “FDR” and finishing a beer. This can quickly eliminate players and make a slow game move faster. Playing with “Clinton Rules” effectively turns the game into a stripping game. Players must remove an article of clothing if they fail certain tasks. Any time someone yells “Donald Trump,” the other players must shout “Build the wall” and drink. Remember, these rules are optional and aren’t necessary for playing the “real life” version of True American. Feel free to make up your own rules as well!"
