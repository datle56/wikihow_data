      "content": "Discuss the property interests at stake. There are different ways that people can own real property, either as a group or on their own. The biggest difference between the different types of joint ownership is what happens when someone dies. You also want to look at percentages of ownership if there are multiple names still listed on the deed. [1] X Research source For example, if your mother wants to take her name off of the deed to the family home and leave it to her 3 children, she would need to consider how she wants the 3 of you to inherit."

This deed will have all of the information on the property as well as all of the names of the people who currently have ownership interests in the property. [2] X Research source While deeds are public records, the search process varies. While you might be able to search or even order a copy of the deed online, you'll typically have to go to the recorder's office in person to pick it up. The recorder's office may charge a small fee for a copy of the deed, typically less than $10. [3] X Research source Pay attention to how you took title on the current deed. Some forms of ownership, such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, don't require you to file a new deed to take full ownership of the property when the other owner dies.

On the form, copy the property description, parcel number, and other property information exactly as it appears on the current deed. Type or write legibly in blue or black ink. [5] X Research source Any differences in the information on the two deeds could cause problems later if you decide you want to mortgage or sell the property. Proofread carefully and make sure everything is exactly the same. Filling out a deed properly can get complicated. If you're not 100% confident, consider hiring an attorney to help you. You can also find forms at your local library, office supply store, or title company—just make sure the form you use is accepted in the county where the property is located. [6] X Research source Most states have preprinted forms that you can use, but some don't! If your state doesn't have forms, it's probably best to get an attorney to help. [7] X Research source"

Signing it in front of a notary verifies everyone's identity and the voluntary nature of the transaction so there aren't any challenges or questions later. [8] X Research source If the person whose name you're removing from the deed has died, you'll still need to visit a notary to have your court affidavit notarized. This affidavit certifies that you're the correct person to dispose of the property or get the deceased person's name removed from the deed. [9] X Research source Even if your county doesn't require deeds to be notarized, it's still a good idea to get it done. It will make it a lot more difficult for the person whose name was removed to question the transfer later on or claim it was done fraudulently."

Generally, if the person whose name you want to remove is still alive, they have to sign the deed if you want to take their name off of it. Technically, when you remove their name, you are transferring an ownership interest in the property to the remaining owners.

You must be able to prove to a judge that you have a greater right to the property than the person whose name is on the deed. Foreclosure and partition are the most common ways your name could potentially be removed from a deed without your consent. [14] X Research source For example, if you have a mortgage on the property and you are seriously behind on your mortgage payments, the bank that holds the mortgage can file a foreclosure action. If successful, the bank gains title to the property and your name is removed from the deed. Partition involves the court-ordered division of property. These actions typically happen when an owner has died and the remaining owners disagree on the use of the property."

If that owner dies, the property would typically be inherited by an heir or group of heirs. [15] X Research source Sole ownership is also the easiest to determine because there will only be one name on the deed."

Generally, joint tenants have the same interest in the property and acquired that interest at the same time.

[16] X Research source Joint tenants are usually a married couple, but they don't have to be! You can be joint tenants with friends or family members as long as your ownership interest in the property starts at the same time."

All this means is that when one owner dies, the surviving owners automatically get the dead owner's share. There's no need to go to probate court or even file a new deed if you don't want to (although most people do, just so they don't have to worry about it later). [17] X Research source When you have a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, all owners have an equal right to use the land and property, regardless of their share of ownership. So someone with a 10% share would still be able to use the property in the same way that someone with a 50% share could. In some states, such as California, rights of survivorship are assumed if the owners are listed as joint tenants. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Tenants in common When multiple people have an ownership interest in real property but aren't joint tenants, they're tenants in common. Tenants in common each have their own separate ownership interest in the property that is transferred to their heirs when they die. [19] X Research source When a tenant in common dies, the other owners do not automatically get their share. For example, if you own a ranch with your two siblings and one of them dies, their share of the ranch would pass on to their children or whoever they had designated in their will."

It doesn't guarantee that the person has any ownership interest at all in the property. For this reason, it's typically used for transactions between family members or people who know and trust each other very well.

      "content": "Choose a warranty deed if there are strangers involved. With a warranty deed (also called a grant deed), you are not only transferring your ownership interest in the property but also guaranteeing that you have the property interest you've stated you do. This typically requires a title company to do research to verify your ownership interest, which costs time and money. [23] X Research source The time and money required to complete a title search is the main reason quitclaim deeds are so popular among people who know and trust each other. There are a lot of other different types of deeds that are called by different names, but they're just specialty forms of a basic warranty deed."

Probate is a court proceeding that distributes a deceased person's assets after their debts are paid. If the person left a will, call the probate court in the county where they were a resident. The probate court clerk should be able to tell you if the person's will has been entered into probate yet. You may also be able to find out who was named their personal representative, or executor of their estate.

Explain your relationship to the deceased person and why you are entitled to the property. Typically, the form also requires the legal description of the property found on the deed, as well as the specific wording on the deed that defines their interest in the property. Go to the recorder's office of the county where the property is located to get a copy of the current deed if you don't have one in your records.
