It is highly recommended that you download directly from the developer to avoid any potential viruses or fake files. Downloading the Nmap installer includes Zenmap, the graphical interface for Nmap which makes it easy for newcomers to perform scans without having to learn command lines. The Zenmap program is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can find the installation files for all operating systems on the Nmap website."

      "title": "Enter the target for your scan.",
      "content": "Enter the target for your scan. The Zenmap program makes scanning a fairly simple process. The first step to running a scan is choosing your target. You can enter a domain (example.com), an IP address (127.0.0.1), a network (192.168.1.0/24), or a combination of those. Depending on the intensity and target of your scan, running a Nmap scan may be against the terms of your internet service provider and may land you in hot water. Always check your local laws and your ISP contract before performing Nmap scans on targets other than your network."

The profiles allow you to quickly select different types of scans without having to type in the modifiers on the command line. Choose the profile that best fits your needs: [1] X Research source Intense scan - A comprehensive scan. Contains Operating System (OS) detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute, and has aggressive scan timing. This is considered an intrusive scan. Ping scan - This scan simply detects if the targets are online, it does not scan any ports. Quick scan - This is quicker than a regular scan due to aggressive timing and only scanning select ports. Regular scan - This is the standard Nmap scan without any modifiers. It will return ping and return open ports on the target."

You can now check your results, depending on the type of scan you performed. All of the results will be listed in the main Nmap Output tab, but you can use the other tabs to get a better look at specific data. [2] X Research source Ports/Hosts - This tab will show the results of your port scan, including the services for those ports. Topology - This shows the traceroute for the scan you performed. You can see how many hops your data goes through to reach the target. Host Details - This shows a summary of your target learned through scans, such as the number of ports, IP addresses, hostnames, operating systems, and more. Scans - This tab stores the commands of your previously-run scans. This allows you to quickly re-scan with a specific set of parameters."

Nmap is small and available for free from the developer. Follow the instructions below for your operating system: Linux - Download and install Nmap from your repository. Nmap is available through most of the major Linux repositories. Enter the command below based on your distribution: Red Hat, Fedora, SUSE rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.40-1.i386.rpm (32-bit) OR rpm -vhU https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.40-1.x86_64.rpm (64-bit) Debian, Ubuntu sudo apt-get install nmap Windows - Download the Nmap installer. This can be found for free on the developer’s website. It is highly recommended that you download directly from the developer to avoid any potential viruses or fake files. Using the installer allows you to quickly install the command line Nmap tools without having to worry about extracting them to the right folder. If you don’t want the Zenmap graphical user interface, you can uncheck it during the installation process. Mac OS X – Download the Nmap disk image. This can be found for free on the developer’s website. It is highly recommended that you download directly from the developer to avoid any potential viruses or fake files. Use the included installer to install Nmap on your system. Nmap requires OS X 10.6 or later."

You can run the scan from any directory on the command line. Linux - Open the terminal if you are using a GUI for your Linux distribution. The location of the terminal varies by distribution Windows - This can be accessed by pressing the Windows key + R and then typing “cmd” into the Run field. Windows 8 users can press the Windows key + X and select Command Prompt from the menu. You can run a Nmap scan from any directory. Mac OS X - Open the Terminal application located in the Utility subfolder of your Applications folder."

Changing the scan variables will change the intrusiveness of the scan. You can add multiple variables by placing a space between each one. Variables come before the target: nmap <variable> <variable> <target> [3] X Research source -sS - This is a SYN stealth scan. It is less detectable than a standard scan but may take longer. Many modern firewalls can detect an –sS scan. -sn - This is a ping scan. This will disable port scanning, and will only check to see if the host is online. -O - This is an operating system scan. The scan will attempt to determine the operating system of the target. -A - This variable enables several of the most commonly used scans: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. -F - This enables fast mode, and will reduce the number of ports scanned. -v - This will show more information in your results, making them easier to read."

To do this, you will need to use the -oX variable, as well as set a filename for the new XML file. A completed command would look similar to nmap –oX Scan Results.xml <target> . The XML file will be saved to whatever your current working location is."
