If you aren’t sure what to do when you two hang out, try the fun activities you used to do together as a couple (as long as they aren’t romantic). Maybe you can nerd out together about a movie or TV show, or maybe you can go hiking in a group because you both really love nature. Think back to what drew you two together in the first place.
