      "content": "Try an overall color meditation. [10] X Research source Sit or lie down in a comfortable position in a quiet room. Take a few deep cleansing breaths. Start breathing slowly and evenly. Visualize a golden light over your head and draw the light down through your body, all the way to your toes. Allow the light to illuminate every aspect of your being. When you feel completely relaxed, begin meditating on each chakra and its color. Start at your root chakra, which is red, and focus on the aspects of that chakra while you visualize the color red. Continue focusing on each color and chakra until you reach the crown chakra. Finish your meditation by taking a few more deep cleansing breaths. Once again, visualize your being with golden light before you come out of your meditative state."
