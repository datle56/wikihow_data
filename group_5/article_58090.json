Some research links bulimia to parenting styles that are rejecting, ambivalent, or over-involved. If your parents exhibit these styles, talk to them about what you feel you aren't getting, or are getting too much of in terms of attention. If your dad hovers around you all the time when you are eating, tell him that you appreciate the concern, but the over-involvement is actually making you feel more negatively about yourself and your behaviors. Research also suggests that in many families where eating disorders arise, communication can be discounted or ignored. If you feel like you aren't being heard, bring this up in an assertive but nonjudgmental way. Tell your mom or dad that you need to tell them something important and you are worried that it won't be heard. This will bring them into your concerns and help them understand where you are coming from."
