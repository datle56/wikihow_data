      "content": "Remove the blades and squirt 1 drop of oil into each blade chamber. Pull out each rotary blade and squeeze 1 drop of oil into each of the blade chambers. Put the blades back in and push the head back in place. Then, turn on the shaver for a few seconds so the oil distributes across the blades. [1] X Research source Not sure how to get the blades out? It's easy! Just op open the head and pull it out of the shaver. Pull off the plastic rotary blade guard—you may have to turn it counterclockwise to unlock it. Then, pull out each blade. If you're using a spray, give 1 quick spritz to each chamber before you put the blades back in."

      "title": "Squirt 1 drop of oil onto each of the outer foils.",
      "content": "Squirt 1 drop of oil onto each of the outer foils. If you're using a spray, give the foils 1 quick spritz. Turn on the shaver and let it run for about 5 seconds so the oil works across the length of the foils. If you see oil on the exterior of your foil shaver, wipe it clean with a cloth."

      "title": "Squeeze 1 drop of oil on the cutting bar underneath the foils.",
      "content": "Squeeze 1 drop of oil on the cutting bar underneath the foils. Remove the foil headpiece from the shaver and tilt the shaver at a 45-degree angle. Turn it on and gently squirt 1 drop of clipper oil onto the cutting blades. Keep the shaver on for 5 seconds so the oil spreads and lubricates all of the cutting bar blades. Then, turn it off. [2] X Research source Avoid holding the shaver up so the blades are at a 90-degree angle. If oil drips straight down into the electrical components, it could damage the shaver. To remove the metallic foil cover from the top of the shaver, press the release button that's on the side. Then, pull the shaver head away from the cutting blades below."

      "title": "Most manufacturers recommend mineral oil.",
      "content": "Most manufacturers recommend mineral oil. You can also use baby oil which is mineral oil with a slight fragrance. These are light oils that will lubricate the working parts of your shaver without clogging the delicate mechanics. They're also gentle on your skin so you won't get irritated. [3] X Research source Your electric shaver might have come with a small tube of clipper oil. Trim off the tip from the end and you'll be able to squeeze the oil onto the cutting blades."

      "title": "You can use a lubricating spray designed for shavers.",
      "content": "You can use a lubricating spray designed for shavers. Check your local beauty supply store for a specialist cleaning and lubricating spray. This cleans and disinfects the shaver while adding a light layer of lubrication. [4] X Research source This specialist spray is sometimes called 5-in-1 clipper spray. If you don't see it at the beauty supply store, check online."

      "title": "No—these are too thick for your shaver.",
      "content": "No—these are too thick for your shaver. Cooking oils like olive or vegetable oil can clog the delicate parts of your electric shaver, so don't use them. Motor oil or water-displacing products like WD40 can also damage the shaver and irritate your skin so skip these as well. [5] X Research source Coconut oil is another one you shouldn't use—although it wouldn't bother your skin, it's also too thick for the shaver."

      "title": "Preferably, you should oil it after every use.",
      "content": "Preferably, you should oil it after every use. This keeps the blades in top condition. If you don't use your shaver every day, it's totally fine to oil the shaver just a few times a week. [6] X Research source Do you use shaving cream or gel? These can dry out the blades so oiling your shaver is really important."

      "title": "Yes—it's important to remove hair and dead skin cells first.",
      "content": "Yes—it's important to remove hair and dead skin cells first. Otherwise, they'll clump up in the oil and this can clog the shaver. To clean your electric shaver, remove the foil headpiece from the top or pop open the head on your rotary shaver. Rinse out the hairs and let the shaver air dry completely before you oil it. You may need to remove individual blades if you've got a rotary shaver. [7] X Research source If you see tiny hairs still stuck around the blades, take a small bristle brush and gently brush them away. Most electric rotary shavers are designed with rinsing the hairs in mind, so you can get the shavers wet. If you're not sure if you can get yours wet, check your owner's manual. If you are transitioning to an electric shaver from wet shaving, use a beard trimmer for a week or two. It will help to accustom your facial skin to the abrasion of a metal trimmer.
