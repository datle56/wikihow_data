      "title": "Pick out a mature mushroom that you want to make a print of.",
      "content": "Pick out a mature mushroom that you want to make a print of. The mushroom must be mature to ensure that it has enough spores to print. A freshly picked mushroom is more likely to have live spores than a store-bought one. [1] X Research source If parts of the mushroom cover the spores, the printing effect won't work as well. Avoid using mushrooms that are shriveled, bruised or appear old. [2] X Research source Flat mushrooms create the best prints."

      "content": "Remove the stem so only the cap remains. If the cap is very large you can cut it and make a print of just a part of the mushroom."

      "content": "Place the cap on a piece of paper, spore side down. Cover the mushroom with glass or bowl. Although it doesn't need to be clear, a clear glass covering allows you to help determine when the print is done. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The print could be done as fast as a few hours, but you can leave it longer to ensure a better, more deeply textured print.",
      "content": "The print could be done as fast as a few hours, but you can leave it longer to ensure a better, more deeply textured print. When you think it's ready, remove the bowl and view your print. The print is actually made by the many microscopic spores falling from the mushroom, leaving a near-photographic impression. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Done.",
      "content": "Done. Use the print for hanging artwork, gift wrapping, adding to another craft project or to create more art from. To protect the dusty print, spray with spray fixative, such as hairspray. Several coats should be adequate. Be careful though, as the pressure from the spray can easily disturb the spore print and change its shape."
