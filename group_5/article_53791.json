      "content": "Treat any stains. If your mattress is wet from bodily fluids, like urine or blood, you’ll need to use an enzyme cleaner. Other stains can be treated with a mixture of 2 parts hydrogen peroxide to 1 part liquid dishwashing soap. Brush the stain remover into the mattress with a toothbrush, then wipe it up after 5 minutes with a cool, damp cloth. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry small spots with a hairdryer. If only a small amount of liquid got on the mattress, like if you spilled a glass of water, you can quickly dry it with a hairdryer. Aim the hairdryer at the wet spot and use a warm, not hot, setting. Keep the hairdryer moving for best results. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a wet/dry vacuum to soak up excess liquid.",
      "content": "Use a wet/dry vacuum to soak up excess liquid. If rain blew in from the window, for example, a portion of your mattress may be soaked. Turn on a wet/dry vacuum and run the nozzle over the wet parts of the mattress in long, even strokes to suck up the liquid. [4] X Research source Disinfect the vacuum nozzle first, as you don’t want to touch your mattress with a nozzle that’s been stuck into cobweb-filled corners of the garage. Simply wipe it with an antibacterial wipe, inside and out, and let it dry."

      "title": "Press clean kitty litter into the mattress to absorb liquid.",
      "content": "Press clean kitty litter into the mattress to absorb liquid. If your mattress was moved during a rainstorm, for instance, it’s bound to be pretty wet. Spread a layer of clean kitty litter over the wet areas of the mattress. Then, cover the kitty litter with a towel and firmly press the kitty litter into the mattress. Vacuum up the kitty litter with a wet/dry vacuum. [5] X Research source If the mattress is still wet, spread a fresh layer of kitty litter on the mattress and allow it to sit for 1 to 2 hours. Then, vacuum it up."

      "content": "Dry a soaked mattress in direct sunlight, if possible. After you’ve soaked up as much of the liquid as possible, take the mattress outdoors and set it in the sunlight. Choose the hottest, sunniest spot on your property. Be sure to spread plastic sheeting or an old blanket beneath the mattress so it doesn’t get dirty. [6] X Research source Sunlight has the added benefit of killing bacteria in your mattress, as well."

      "title": "Provide plenty of air circulation if drying indoors.",
      "content": "Provide plenty of air circulation if drying indoors. Open as many windows as possible to get the air moving around the mattress. If both sides are wet, stand it on one end or lean it against a solid surface so air can flow freely around it. Set up a fan and/or a dehumidifier, depending on what you have handy. Direct the fan at the mattress to increase the air circulation. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Expect to wait a few hours. Unfortunately, time is essential for drying a mattress. If the mattress is soaked, like from a ceiling leak, it’s best to make alternative sleeping arrangements for the night, as it may take up to 24 hours to fully dry. Covering the mattress with sheets and bedding when it’s wet will lead to mold and mildew growth, which is hazardous to your health. [8] X Research source"

If you have more time, you can let the baking soda sit on the mattress for up to 24 hours.
