      "content": "Look for yellow leaves. One of the first signs of root rot is when the leaves begin to turn yellow or brown. That means they're not getting enough water and nutrients, which in turn is due to dying or damaged root systems. [1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source The leaves may look dull first. When they turn yellow, they may also begin to wilt. [2] X Research source Yellow leaves can also be a sign of underwatering, though typically they'll curl and droop if it needs water. Plus, the soil will be dry."

      "content": "Watch for twigs and branches dying off in trees. If the root rot is severe, branches may begin to die off. In that case, they'll lose their leaves, and you'll see dry, brittle wood instead of supple branches and twigs.

      "title": "Check for the absence of white feeder rootlets in plants.",
      "content": "Check for the absence of white feeder rootlets in plants. In healthy plants, you should see small white rootlets near the top of the soil at the base of the plant, which are starting to burrow down into the soil. If you can't see these, you likely have root rot. [4] X Research source You may want to gently dig up a plant you think is affected. The roots will be brown and mushy if they have root rot."

      "content": "Notice brown discoloring on the stems of plants. This discoloring can start out as streaks, then progress to spots or even turn the whole stem brown. Generally, it will start out near the base of the plant and work its way up. [5] X Research source In trees, you may see this under the bark near the base of the plant. Sometimes, the fungus will form inverted \"Vs.\" Other times, it may move to the exterior of the bark, discoloring it or causing it to weep liquid.

      "title": "Lift the plant up to look at the roots.",
      "content": "Lift the plant up to look at the roots. Grab the plant at the base and pull it gently out of the pot. Gently brush away the dirt so you can look at the roots. They should be white and firm if they are healthy. If you see brown, mushy roots, you need to treat them for root rot. [7] X Research source You'll also be able to see other signs of root rot, such as brown stems and leaves.

      "content": "Snip off an equal part of the leaves and branches. When you cut back the roots, the roots that are left won't be able to support as much plant matter. Therefore, you need to trim the plant back. Start with any leaves that are yellow or brown, as well as any that look wilted. If you still need to trim more, prune the plant into a shape you like. [10] X Research source Make sure to leave some healthy leaves behind so your plant can still get the sunlight it needs."

      "content": "Apply nitrogen to help encourage plant and root growth. When plants succumb to root rot, they won't get enough nitrogen from the soil to thrive. Add between 20 and 50 pounds (9.1 and 22.7 kg) per 1 acre (4,000 m 2 ). It's best to apply it between the rows, then cultivate between the rows to throw it up on the roots. [14] X Research source Opt for potassium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium nitrate over urea."

      "title": "Cultivate between rows to help new root growth.",
      "content": "Cultivate between rows to help new root growth. If the roots underneath are rotting, sometimes new roots will grow near the surface. Cultivating or \"scuffling\" involves pulling cultivation teeth in the dirt between rows as a way of killing off weeds; in this case, it also tosses soil onto new root growth to help it thrive. [15] X Research source Make sure not to get too close to the plants, as that will slice off the ends of roots, which is the opposite of what you want to do. Go down the middle of the row to avoid the roots. Sometimes, it helps to do this twice in a row with about 5-10 days in between."

      "content": "Avoid using fungicides on roots. While it seems logical to try to treat a fungus-based problem with fungicide, they're usually not effective for this issue. For one, it's hard to get the fungicide to the root of the plant. Also, once a plant has root rot, they won't bring the plant back to life. [19] X Research source It's best to just avoid the chemicals and start over next year if you need to."

      "content": "Remove the affected plants so it doesn't spread. If the root rot is particularly bad, you may just need to take out the plants. If the leaves and stems are completely withered and dead, those plants are not coming back, and you need to think of the other plants around them. Pull these plants up, and then place compost where the hole is to help combat the fungus. [20] X Research source Make sure to toss these plants in the trash so they can't infect other ones."

      "content": "Sow plants resistant to root rot in the beds in the future. The fungi that cause root rot can stick around in the soil, so if you want to sow the bed again, opt for plants that are less likely to catch it. While that won't guarantee a root rot-free bed, it can help prevent another outbreak. [21] X Research source For instance, try plants like lilies, mints, ornamental grasses, daffodils, anemone, or black-eyed Susans, just to name a few."

      "title": "Avoid over-watering plants in gardens and pots.",
      "content": "Avoid over-watering plants in gardens and pots. Over-watering is one of the main triggers of root rot since it leads to moist soil that can't drain well. While you can't prevent heavy rains, you can research your plants to figure out what amount of water they need and only give them enough to fulfill their needs. [22] X Research source This is especially an issue if you have a heavy soil type, such as clay."

      "title": "Put in raised beds for better drainage with outdoor plants.",
      "content": "Put in raised beds for better drainage with outdoor plants. Plants susceptible to root rot, such as parsley, do well in raised beds. Moisture is less likely to sit around the roots because you can put in well-draining soil. Plus, the beds will lose more moisture to the air if they are surrounded by a porous material like wood. [23] X Research source You can find kits to make raised beds online, but you can also make your own out of planks of wood, bricks, or any number of other materials. You can even use things like old wine crates for a garden bed."

If you don't want to use raised beds, you can encourage better drainage by tilling material into your soil. [24] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Use compost, manure, shredded leaves, or grass clippings, for instance, which will make your soil lighter. Put a layer of 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) on top of your soil and then work it in to about a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm). [25] X Research source You'll need to work this material in throughout the year, as microorganisms will continue to compost it. [26] X Research source"

      "content": "Try core aeration to encourage better drainage in outdoor plants. Dig up holes that are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) wide in the ground, going to a depth of about 1.5 feet (0.46 m). Aim for a hole every 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m). Fill the holes with a mixture of peat moss and pumice/baked clay in equal parts. [27] X Research source Core aeration is where you pull out small plugs of soil and replace them with an inorganic material. The process helps create lighter soil. You may need an aeration tool for this process. To use one, just press the hollow points of the tool into the ground, and it will pull out small plugs of soil for you."

      "content": "Rotate out vegetables that are susceptible to root rot. If you know certain plants in your garden are more likely to get root rot, change up where you plant them each year. For instance, parsley and some beans are susceptible, so don't put them in the same place when you plant in the spring. [28] X Research source For resistant plants, try geraniums, marigolds, sweet potato vine, ferns, aster, mint, or ornamental grasses. Try to rotate the plants out every year."
