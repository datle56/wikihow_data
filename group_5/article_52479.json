Voxelizer for Fab is slicer software similar to Cura or PrusaSlicer, but Voxelizer for Fab is the only slicer that works the best for converting G-code to STL, which you can then convert to 3MF.

Voxelize smooths out your geometry, which means any intricate details will be removed. Select Voxelize Precise if your model is intricate with holes, sharp points or contours, or small details. Voxelize Precise retains these details compared to Voxelize."

But if you need to do any tweaks or if there are still extra printing supports present, you can refine your model with various filters. Click the Filters menu in the sidebar. Use the filters under Basic Filters to increase or decrease wall thickness, smooth contours, or mirror the model. Use the filters under Object Refinement to close holes or remove small objects such as brims or rafts."

It's a convenient option that works entirely in your browser, but you may notice that the results aren't as clean as if you use an actual slicer such as Voxelizer for Fab. Gcode2l's website warns that there is no way to go from G-code to another file type without a loss in quality, so you should expect the resulting STL to be less detailed than the G-code file."

There is no one-size-fits-all settings profile that will work for every model , so you will have to use some trial and error to figure out what will look best. Each of the parameters is explained below: Resolution: The STL's resolution can be adjusted from \"detailed\" to \"rough.\" In general, smaller models do better with a more detailed resolution, and larger models should have a rougher resolution to avoid lengthy reconstruction times. Simplify: This slider will remove excess edges to decrease model complexity and file size. If you plan to use the reconstructed STL for printing, you should simplify the model. Otherwise, you can leave the slider at \"off.\" Optimize: The optimize toggle tells Gcode2l to remove interior extrusions, which can save computer resources and speed up the reconstruction time. It can, however, increase the chance of unwanted artifacts left on the model. Skip: Skip will tell the reconstruction not to include a certain number of initial layers, which is a good way to get rid of a brim or raft. If you don't have a brim or a raft, you can leave this at 0."
