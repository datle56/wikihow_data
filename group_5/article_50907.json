      "content": "Go door to door to ask about apprenticeships. Most body piercing studios don’t advertise their apprenticeships online, so the most common way to find an apprenticeship is to visit different studios and ask if they are willing to take on apprentices. You can bring along a resumé if you have one. Don’t feel like you have to speak or dress formally—a lot of piercing studios have a casual, independent environment, so while you should come across as driven and articulate, you don’t have to be overly formal. [5] X Research source You could say something like, “I was wondering if you take on apprentices here at Dragon Piercing. I think that you do really great work, and it would be great to be able to learn from such a professional studio.” Studios will be looking for apprentices with confidence and strong people skills. Remember to stand up straight, smile and speak clearly and with confidence."
