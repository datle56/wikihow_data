      "content": "Follow celebrities you like on their social media accounts. Most celebrities have accounts on all kinds of different social media platforms. If you don’t have any social media accounts yourself, you may want to sign up just to follow the celebrities you want to be friends with. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are good places to start, but other platforms like Snapchat are becoming popular among celebrities, as well. If the celebrity you like has a personal website, they might list their social media accounts on their website. Check there for their usernames or links to their different accounts, or do a quick Google search to find them."

      "title": "Avoid adding personal accounts.",
      "content": "Avoid adding personal accounts. Until you are on conversational or friendly terms with the celebrity, don’t try to add their personal or private accounts. They will likely ignore or deny your request because they don’t know you, and you might mess up your chances of getting to know them. Stick to following their public accounts. If you want to be friends with someone famous, you don’t want to come off as pushy by trying to be a part of their personal lives before you’ve been invited in."
    },
    {
      "title": "Comment on their posts.",
      "content": "Comment on their posts. If you want the celebrity to notice you, you’ll need to leave them comments on their posts! If they post a photo on Instagram, leave a comment and let them know what you think. If they post something on Facebook, comment or like their post. Just make sure you don’t comment too much, or say anything that will make you come off looking desperate or obsessive. Instead of commenting with something like “Wow I love you so much!” you might comment with something casual. For instance, “Looks awesome! You should check out…” and bring up something related to the post. This way, you’re connecting with them and showing them you have common interests, and not just looking like a fan."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send a private or direct message.",
      "content": "Send a private or direct message. Sending a message directly to their inbox is a good way to make contact, but that is not always possible. You could send a note to their post office box or email them if you have an email address instead. For example, if you know the celebrity will be in your town, or if you’ll be visiting theirs, send them a message to tell them something fun they should check out in your city, or ask something fun you could try in theirs. This will let them know you’ll be nearby, and that you’re interested in something fun to do. Keep in mind that if you are trying to make contact with an “A List” celebrity, or someone who is extremely popular, you might have trouble making contact at all. These kinds of celebrities rarely check their own direct messages on public accounts, and even more rarely answer those messages."

    {
      "title": "Post things you know they are interested in.",
      "content": "Post things you know they are interested in. Make posts on your own accounts that are related to the celebrity’s interests. For example, if you want to make friends with someone who is famous online and known for her makeup skills or fashion sense, you might make a post related to these things and include hashtags that the celebrity also uses on her posts. The celeb might follow these tags, and notice your posts. Don’t go overboard and tag the celebrity’s name. You want to come off as someone who has similar interests and could possibly be their friend, not a crazy fan."

    {
      "title": "Join or start a fan club.",
      "content": "Join or start a fan club. Do a search to find out if the celebrity has an official fan club that already exists, and join it. Attend meetups and events planned and put on by the club, as these official events might involve meeting the celebrity. If there isn’t an official fan club, see if you can get in touch with the celebrity’s management and start the process of starting one. Don’t start an “official” fan club without the involvement of the celeb and/or their management. You don’t want to unintentionally infringe on copyright or end up in legal trouble."

      "title": "Go to places the celebrity frequents.",
      "content": "Go to places the celebrity frequents. If you live near the celebrity, find out where that celeb goes on a regular basis. Maybe it’s a certain fitness club, coffee shop, or grocery store. If you go to the same places as the celeb, you’re more likely to casually run into them and be able to strike up a conversation and eventually a friendship. Even if you only see each other in passing for a while, the celeb will see you as a familiar face, and as someone who doesn’t get crazy or excited like a fan when you see them. Then, once you finally do talk to them, they might be more willing to treat you like a potential friend."

    {
      "title": "Make friends with friends of the celebrity.",
      "content": "Make friends with friends of the celebrity. One of the best ways to meet famous people is to become friends with people who already know them. That way, that friend can introduce you as a mutual friend, and you’ll be able to hang out in groups. The celeb will be less likely to see you as a fan and more likely to see you as a friend if you meet them through someone they already have a relationship with. Don’t bring up the celebrity right away when making friends with their friends. Their friends will probably know you’re just trying to meet the famous person, and they might not be so willing to hang out with you, or to introduce you. Give it some time before you bring it up, or let it happen naturally."

      "title": "Find out about their other ventures.",
      "content": "Find out about their other ventures. Some celebrities have multiple venues they work in. For example, some actors might also be restaurant owners, or have their own fashion lines. Find out what other side ventures the famous person is into, and get involved in those. That might be a better way to meet and connect with them. If you meet the famous person through their side venture or business, you might have easier access to them, as this other venture might not have as big of a following as their main one."

      "title": "Go to filming locations.",
      "content": "Go to filming locations. If you’re interested in making friends with actors, go to where they work. For example, many films and television shows are filmed in Los Angeles, but you could do a little searching online and find out more specifically where things are being or will be filmed and go to those places. Stick with public places, rather than staking out sound stages and back slots at movie production properties. For example, if you know a certain show films in a small town, or will have a few filming days in a public location—like a certain city block in NYC, or a certain landmark—spend some time in that spot."

      "title": "Get a job in their industry.",
      "content": "Get a job in their industry. One way to meet famous people and develop a relationship is by working in the same fields as they do. For example, if you want to meet actors, you might get a job or internship working for a production company, or television network. If you want to meet famous models, you might consider working for a modeling agency or fashion designer. If you happen to have any experience with the technical side of filmmaking or television production, you could try to get a job on the set of a movie or TV show. This will help you meet famous people naturally, and you’ll be able to spend a lot of time with them to build a relationship."

      "content": "Make sure you aren’t stalking the celebrity. Don’t repeatedly send them unwanted gifts, follow them, stand outside their home, or generally do anything to make them feel uncomfortable. If you want to be friends with the celeb, you won’t want to make them feel unsafe. Keep a safe distance and don’t overdo it with the attention. [1] X Research source Cyber stalking is also an issue. Don’t post anything negative the defame their character, spread rumors, or generally harass them online."

      "title": "Avoid using famous people for their connections.",
      "content": "Avoid using famous people for their connections. If you want to make friends with famous people just to use them, keep in mind that they will probably see right through you. Famous people deal with strangers who just want to use them for their money or connections all the time, and they will be able to tell if that’s the case with you. Make sure you are trying to establish a friendship for the right reasons. For example, if you do make friends with someone famous, pay your own way. If they offer to pay for things, that’s fine, but never expect or ask them to. Treat them like you would any other normal person."

      "title": "Remember that it might be impossible to become their friend.",
      "content": "Remember that it might be impossible to become their friend. Famous people deal with obsessive fans all the time. They probably keep most people at a bit of a distance for a while until they’re sure that person genuinely wants to be their friend and isn’t just a crazy fan. Many famous people don’t communicate directly with fans online, or answer private messages. It might be very difficult to become friends with famous people at all. Give it time if you have started communicating with someone famous. Don’t expect a relationship to happen overnight. They will probably need some time to trust you and decide they want to meet you or hang out with you."

      "title": "Be a good friend if you do establish a relationship.",
      "content": "Be a good friend if you do establish a relationship. Once you have made friends with someone famous, be a good person and a good friend to them. Be receptive and friendly. If you use them or act like someone you’re not just to keep their attention, they will more than likely notice and be turned off by it. Treat them like any other friend, and they will probably appreciate it. Famous people don’t usually want to be treated like they’re more important than anyone else, especially by people they consider friends. They would probably appreciate you treating them like a normal person, and like someone they can be themselves around. Don't see them as just a celebrity friend. Instead, think of them as a friend really passionate about their career and successful at it."
