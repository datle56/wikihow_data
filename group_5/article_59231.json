Click Options and select Preferences from the bottom of the menu. Click the video tab. Click the drop-down menu next to \"GPU acceleration of video processing\" and select your graphics card. If your video card is not supported, it will not appear in the menu. Click Apply and then OK to close the window."

      "content": "Select a template. At the top of the Video tab, you will see a Template drop-down menu. There will be a large list of templates to choose from, but if you are rendering in HD there are only a couple you need to pay attention to. If you are filming in NTSC (North America), select \"HDV 720-30p\" for 720p or \"HD 1080-60i\" for 1080p. If you are filming in PAL (Europe), select \"HDV 720-25p\" for 720p or \"HD 1080-50i\" for 1080p. The main difference between NTSC and PAL is the framerate (29.970 vs. 25). If you are shooting at a higher framerate than NTSC or PAL standards, such as 60 fps, choose the appropriate template for the resolution you want."

Any other method could result in unwanted scanlines in the final video. If you are rendering in 1080p, select \"Blend Fields\" as most 1080p footage still uses interlaced frames."

Sony AVC is the best option for older versions of Vegas."

Choose the one that matches your video the best. For MainConcept, if you are making a 720p video, choose \"Internet HD 720p\". If you are making a 1080p video, choose \"Internet HD 1080p\". For Windows Media Video, if you are making a 720p video, choose \"6 Mbps HD 720-30p\" (NTSC) or \"5 Mbps HD 720-25p\" (PAL). If you are making a 1080p video, choose \"8 Mbps HD 1080-30p\" (NTSC) or \"6.7 Mbps HD 1080-25p\" (PAL)."

Note: This is different than your Project Properties template, and the following settings apply to MainConcept only. Uncheck the \"Allow source to adjust frame rate\" box. This may help prevent some stuttering in the final project. Ensure that the \"Frame rate\" drop-down menu matches what you set in the Project Properties window. Adjust the bitrate for smaller file sizes. If you want the final project to be smaller, lower the average bit rate at the bottom of the window. This will result in a lower-quality video. 720p can go as low as 5,000,000 for the average and 10,000,000 as the maximum. Change the \"Encode mode\" drop-down menu to \"Render using GPU if available\". This will force the program to use the GPU to help rendering, which can significantly speed up the process. If you are using the Windows Media Video format, and are making a 1080p video, check the \"Image size\" drop-down menu in the Custom Settings window. By default, WMV selects 1440 x 1080, which will result in a skewed image. Set it to \"(Keep Original Size)\" and then set the \"Pixel aspect ratio\" menu to \"1.000 (Square)\"."

Click the Render button at the bottom of the \"Render As\" window to begin the process. A progress bar will appear, and you will see the frame counter beneath the preview window advance as the rendering occurs. Rendering in HD can take a significant amount of time. Video length, rendering options, and computer specifications all have an impact on the total rendering time. [1] X Research source"
