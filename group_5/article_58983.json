      "content": "Look for a GP practice that best suits your needs. If you are a UK citizen or resident, you can register with any GP practice in the country. Generally, it is recommended that you find a GP close to where you live. If you are ill or injured and cannot travel to the practice, the GP will make a house call if you are within that GP's practice boundary. [2] X Research source You can register with a GP further away from you. You might want to do this if, for example, you're going to school far away from your primary residence, or if you need specialized services that aren't available nearby. If you register with a GP and you live outside that GP's practice boundary, you won't have access to house calls. That GP also has the right to refuse registration, although this is rare if the practice is open to patients outside its practice boundary. You can browse GPs near you by visiting https://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4"

You can also use the form to register as an organ donor or blood donor. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can download a copy of the standard form at https://www.nhs.uk/Servicedirectories/Documents/GMS1.pdf if you want to fill it out in advance. However, keep in mind that some practices may have their own versions of the form that they use instead. Some GP practices ask for ID so they can compare the details with the information on the NHS central registry and confirm they match. However, it is not legally required for you to show ID to register with a GP practice, and no GP can refuse to register you because you don't have ID on you."

Paper records may take up to 6 weeks to transfer, but electronic records can be transferred instantaneously when the request is received. If you need to see your GP for urgent care before your registration is confirmed, you are free to do so.
