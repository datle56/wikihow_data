      "title": "“I want you” is typically a statement of desire or sexual attraction.",
      "content": "“I want you” is typically a statement of desire or sexual attraction. More often than not, if your significant other or a romantic interest says this phrase to you, it means they want to be physically close or intimate with you. They likely think you’re smoking hot and are possibly aroused by your appearance, attitude, or personality. Saying “I want you” could be their way of gauging whether or not you also find them attractive. How “I want you” is said can greatly impact its meaning. For instance, if your partner says the phrase with you in the bedroom or during foreplay, they may be showing sexual dominance. If someone says it to you at a party or social gathering, they’re likely expressing a physical attraction to you."

      "title": "“I want you” could be an expression of vulnerability.",
      "content": "“I want you” could be an expression of vulnerability. Sometimes, “I want you” relays emotional needs, especially in sad or intimate moments. A friend might say this phrase if they don’t want to be left alone after a bad day, or a partner may use it if they’re upset and want to be comforted by you. Pay close attention to the context of the situation. If someone says “I want you” with a seductive or sensual tone, chances are they’re seeking physical pleasure. If they say it with an uneasy voice, they’re likely feeling vulnerable."

      "content": "Say you want them back. If you feel physically or sexually attracted to this person, don’t be afraid to express it! By saying “I want you,” they’re relaying a desire for you and the easiest way to reciprocate that feeling is to respond with, “I want you, too.”"

      "content": "Be there for them. If someone uses “I want you” to say they feel vulnerable, don’t leave their side. With this expression, they’re saying, “I want you with me.” They may be seeking an emotional connection rather than a physical one, so keep them company. Do whatever you can to support them in the moment. You might respond with something like, “Okay. How can I help?” or “Alright. Do you want a hug or to watch a movie? I’m all yours.” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "“I want you” doesn’t mean “I love you.”",
      "content": "“I want you” doesn’t mean “I love you.” “I want you” is a statement of desire and attraction rather than a confession of love or compassion. While someone who says “I want you” may care deeply about you (especially if you’re in a steady or long-term relationship), the phrase doesn’t express the same sentiment as “I love you.” Think of it like this: “I want you” roughly translates to “You’re attractive, and I’m turned on by the idea of being intimate with you,” while “I love you” can mean “I want to spend the rest of my days with you. I’m committed to you.” [4] X Research source"
