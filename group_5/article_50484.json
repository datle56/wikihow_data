      "content": "Start with a flawless base. If you have oily skin, use a primer to help your makeup last throughout the day. Whether it's foundation, powder or just some concealer, use something that gives the overall look of a good complexion. A beauty blender is a good tool to use if you want to have flawless base as it will make sure your foundation does not have a caked-on appearance. Use less and build up your coverage if needed. Do not apply lots, as it may look caked-on. A powder foundation or mineral makeup will give a much lighter coverage while still appearing flawless."

      "title": "Powder your face if you have used liquid foundation or concealer.",
      "content": "Powder your face if you have used liquid foundation or concealer. Even if you have dry skin, this is a crucial step, as you do not want your makeup to move throughout the day. If you are dry skinned, then use powder lightly or in some places. If you're oily skinned, then it is recommended to use all over your face. Do not powder too much as it may turn cake-like. Do not buff or rub as this may disturb and move the makeup. Lightly bounce on the skin and once applied all over, then buff into the skin."
