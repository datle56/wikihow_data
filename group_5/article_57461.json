Tap the search bar and enter \"Trending\" —if the song is trending, you'll see a small arrow pointing upward next to the song's title. You'll also get a mix of trending and other sounds under the \"For You\" header. If you're also on TikTok, check TikTok's trending songs for a hint at what's trending (or will soon trend) on Reels. Tap Controls to change your camera's audio, the music track, and the sound effects. You can also use these tools with a Reel consisting of multiple photos. Simply tap the music note icon after you've selected your music from the first screen, or tap Skip . Tap Done or the back button to continue."
