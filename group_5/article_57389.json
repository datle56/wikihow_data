      "content": "Crush the spices. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods and cloves until they have reached a fine powder. Use your hand to cover the spices so they don't ricochet out of the mortar and onto the floor. [2] X Research source When the spices are fairly crushed, stir the pestle around the spices to crush them into an even finer powder. If you prefer not to use your hand, you can also cover the mortar with a wet paper towel to prevent spillage."

      "content": "Add the remaining ingredients. Combine the crushed spices, vanilla bean pieces, orange peel zest and alcohol in a glass mason jar. Cap the jar and shake the jar before storing the jar in a cool, dark place. Shake the jar once or twice a day to resettle the ingredients. Allow the jar to sit for between 2 – 6 weeks."

      "title": "Strain the perfume.",
      "content": "Strain the perfume. After 2-6 weeks, strain the mixture either in a colander or by using a teapot strainer. Pour the perfume mixture into a glass bottle with a top, and apply the mixture to the inside of your wrists and behind your ears. In addition to smelling good, this perfume should help alleviate stress, mental fatigue and tension. For a stronger smelling perfume, add additional spices. When incorporating a cinnamon scent, always conduct a patch test. Apply a small amount of the diluted mixture to your skin and wait 24–48 hours to check for any adverse reactions like redness, itching, or burning. This helps ensure that the product is safe for your skin type."

For this recipe, you will need the following items: a 5 ml roll on bottle, your carrier oil of choice, sweet orange essential oil, mandarin essential oil, neroli essential oil and cedarwood atlas essential oil.

Essential oils can be purchased online or in some grocery stores."

      "content": "Enjoy your perfume, but be aware of safety concerns. Citrus oils have the potential to make your skin hyper-sensitive to the sun. Make sure you are wearing sunscreen before you go outside. To be safe, apply a small amount of perfume only to your wrists and behind your ears. If you are using an essential oil for the first time, check for allergies. Combine a few drops of the essential oil to a teaspoon of carrier oil and dab a little of the mixture on your skin. If you are allergic, you may experience redness or bumps. Pregnant people and children should not wear this perfume."

      "content": "Make a fruit tincture. A tincture is an herbal preparation in which the oils of a plant are extracted into a solvent. To create your own tincture, take fresh, frozen or dried elderberries and remove the stems. [3] X Research source Take a quart jar with a tight fitting lid and fill it 2/3 of the way full of the elderberries. Fill the rest of the jar with Everclear grain alcohol and store the mixture in a cool, dry place. Shake the mixture several times a week and wait 6 weeks for the mixture to extract. After 6 weeks, drain the mixture and store it in a glass bottle. Keep the bottle in a cool, dark place and your tincture will last for years to come."
