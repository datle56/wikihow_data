When first installing a new water filter, you should soak it in fresh water for at least 5 minutes to remove any particles and help the filter absorb more water like a sponge. [4] X Research source However, even with an existing water filter, you can soak it in equal parts water and vinegar for 45 minutes to remove any build-up that settles on the filter. If this doesn't help, try rinsing the water filter under cool running water afterward. You can also do a full descale of your Keurig to get things moving again, but the filter itself is usually to blame."
