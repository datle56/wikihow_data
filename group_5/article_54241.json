      "content": "First player bets $100. The next player only has $20 to call. Two more players call the $100 bet. The easiest way to figure out how much the Short player can win is to say they can win $20 times 4 players. So, $80 goes into the main pot. That means that $240 ($80 X 3 players, what they are short)will go into the Side Pot. At this time the dealer should announce \"John is all-in for $20. He can win the Main Pot.\" The dealer is telling John, himself, and everyone at the table what John can win. **Be sure to add in any blinds that are $20 or less into the Main Pot. The 'Main Pot' is not necessarily the largest pot. It is just the first pot. It is also the pot under which the burn cards will be."

Always start the Main Pot first with the shortest chips. Say out loud \"John has $45 four ways, plus the blinds. That will be $180 plus the $10 Blind. Mary has $5 more, 3 ways, that makes $15 in the first side pot. All the rest is in Side Pot #2.\" You now have 3 pots. Any more betting goes into pot #3. You must say your calculations out loud. If anyone disagrees this is their time to speak up. Take corrections graciously. Say thanks for helping."

Now take $152 from each of them and put it into the Main Pot. Be sure to add in any blinds of $152 or less. Player #2 is actually $31 short of the big bet by the first player. If you can do this in your head then you know that there is $62 on the side pot. This is really about chips by the color. Often it is easiest to just make equal stacks, rather than do the math."
