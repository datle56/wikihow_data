      "title": "Worn tires",
      "content": "Worn tires If your front tires are balding, worn unevenly, or damaged, it can cause your vehicle to vibrate when you brake. This comes from your tires struggling to produce an identical, uniform amount of friction with the road. Luckily, it’s very easy and straightforward to swap your tires out. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Other Symptoms : Your car feels harder to control in rain or snow, your tires make screeching noises, the tread on your tires is uneven, your tires are bulging or misshapen, and your steering wheel shakes when you drive. The Repair: You just need new tires. Either replace the tires yourself or see a tire pro (or mechanic) to have them install a new set. The Cost: Expect to pay around $50-100 per tire."

      "title": "Warped rotors",
      "content": "Warped rotors The rotors are the metal discs behind your rims. They’re the components that the brake pads press against to create friction and slow your vehicle down. If the rotors are warped, your brakes won’t apply evenly or consistently and you may end up feeling like your car’s front-end is wobbling when you brake. [2] X Research source Other Symptoms: The shaking doesn’t occur when you slow down by coasting, your brake pedal and steering wheel vibrate when you brake, and you hear a wooshing noise when you brake. The Repair: You need new rotors. This isn’t a DIY repair, so see a mechanic to have the rotors inspected and replaced. The Cost: You’ll likely pay around $200-300 a rotor. Unfortunately, you have to replace all of the rotors at the same time, so you’ll pay around $400-1,200 depending on how many rotors you have."

      "title": "Old brake pads",
      "content": "Old brake pads Brake pads need to be replaced every 10,000–20,000 miles (16,000–32,000 km), so if your brake pads are just old this may be a normal maintenance issue. When the pads are ground down far enough, they lose a lot of their stopping power. This can often lead to intermittent shaking when you brake. [3] X Research source Other Symptoms: Your brake pad light is on, you hear squealing/whistling noises when you brake, it takes longer than normal for your car to brake, you pull to one side when you brake, or your brakes feel “soft” and spongy. The Repair: This is pretty routine stuff for a mechanic. See a pro to have them swap your brake pads out. The Cost: This will likely cost around $100-250 per axle (brake pads are always swapped out on both wheels per axle)."

      "title": "Sticky calipers",
      "content": "Sticky calipers The calipers are the component that holds the brake pad in place. When you press the brake pedal, the calipers push the brake pads against the rotors. If your calipers are “sticky,” it means they’re having troubled engaging and disengaging when they’re supposed to. This will often cause the front of your car to wobble when you brake. [4] X Research source Other Symptoms: Your brakes squeal, your braking power is reduced, it feels like your car pulls to one side when you brake, your brake lights pop on, or your car brakes even as you’re releasing the pedal. The Repair: You need new calipers. See a professional to have the calipers replaced . The Cost: The cost really depends on how exotic your car is. You’ll likely pay $300 or so per caliper for an old Honda or Ford F-150, while higher-end cars can cost up to $1,000 a caliper."

      "title": "Alignment issues",
      "content": "Alignment issues Your car’s alignment refers to the angle of your tires. If something is off, one (or more) of your tires will be pointing in a slightly different direction. This can cause your car to shake when you accelerate or brake. [5] X Research source Other Symptoms: The shaking also appears when you’re accelerating, your steering wheel shifts or turns on its own when you don’t hold it, and your steering wheel vibrates. The Repair: You need an alignment! See an alignment shop or mechanic to have the angle of your tires fixed. The Cost: This is a cheaper repair; you’ll likely spend around $50-150."

      "title": "Suspension wear and tear",
      "content": "Suspension wear and tear Your suspension system is responsible for keeping your ride smooth and holding your tires firmly against the road. If the CV joints, shock absorbers, springs, sway bar, or ball joints that make up your suspension have failed or worn down, it can lead to all kinds of issues—including front-end shaking. [6] X Research source Other Symptoms: It depends on what specific component is worn down or damaged, but you’ll likely notice shaking when you accelerate or turn, too. You’re also likely to hear odd noises or notice your car drives rougher than it used to. The Repair: Suspension issues can’t easily be diagnosed at home, so see a mechanic to have the entire system assessed and repaired. The Cost: It depends on what kind of work needs to be done, but you’ll likely pay around $500 on the low end, or up to $5,000 for a new suspension system."

      "title": "Loose lug nuts",
      "content": "Loose lug nuts This is a very rare source of front-end shaking, but it can happen. If one of your tires has unsecured lug nuts, the tire can wobble. You may not notice this when you’re accelerating or coasting, although the shaking could be noticeable when the brake pad tries to fight the rotational power of the uneven tire. [7] X Research source Other Symptoms: There may not be any other symptoms now. Over time though, you’ll notice wheel warping, hubcap damage, broken studs, or stretched threading on your lug nuts. The Repair: Just tighten the lug nuts with your tire iron. The Cost: None."

      "content": "No, not if you’re losing control of the vehicle. If you can maintain complete control of the car, you can drive slowly to the mechanic or finish whatever short drive you’re on. If you feel like you’re losing control of the vehicle when you brake though, do not risk driving. Instead, have your vehicle towed to the mechanic. If you start to have trouble braking while you’re on the road, slow down, put your hazards on, and slowly work your way to the shoulder, a parking lot, or a parking space."
