      "title": "Start exfoliating and moisturizing your skin 3-5 days beforehand.",
      "content": "Start exfoliating and moisturizing your skin 3-5 days beforehand. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells from the surface of your skin, so that you have a smooth and even surface for your spray tan. This helps you achieve a more even result without streaks or patches. You can exfoliate using a dry brush before you shower, or you can use an exfoliating body scrub or exfoliating mitt in the shower—whatever you prefer! [1] X Research source When you exfoliate, gently buff your skin in small circles. Pay extra attention to drier areas, like your elbows, knees, and ankles. After each exfoliation session, apply a gentle body lotion to keep your skin hydrated and moisturized. Do your exfoliating routine each day leading up to your spray tan, but stop about 8 hours before your appointment. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Shave or wax at least 24 hours before your appointment.",
      "content": "Shave or wax at least 24 hours before your appointment. It’s a good idea to do some hair removal before a spray tan, since body hair can make it harder to get an even tan. [3] X Research source However, it’s important to shave or wax at least 24 hours before your appointment. If you shave or wax right before, the spray tan can seep into your open pores and cause dark spots, and it may cause irritation if you have sensitive skin. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop using retinoids and hydroxy acids 24 hours before your spray tan.",
      "content": "Stop using retinoids and hydroxy acids 24 hours before your spray tan. If you use any skincare products that contain retinoids or hydroxy acids (AHAs or BHAs), stop using them about 24 hours before your appointment. These products work by increasing cell turnover, which can cause your spray tan to fade more quickly. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Paint your nails.",
      "content": "Paint your nails. If you head to your spray tan with bare nails, they'll likely get discolored, which is a dead giveaway that your bronzed glow isn’t entirely natural. To prevent this, paint your nails the day before your appointment. The polish will prevent the tanning solution from staining your nails. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a shower before your appointment.",
      "content": "Take a shower before your appointment. For the best results, you’ll want your skin to be completely clean when you get your spray tan. Sweat and oil can prevent the tan from absorbing evenly into your skin, so it’s important to wash these things off before you head to your appointment. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't apply any lotions or oils on the day of your appointment.",
      "content": "Don't apply any lotions or oils on the day of your appointment. To get an even result, it’s important that there are no barriers between your skin and the tanning solution. This means you’ll need to avoid applying any moisturizers, body oils, or sunscreen on the day of your appointment. [8] X Research source Your spray tan specialist will likely provide some barrier cream at your tanning session for your dry areas (hands, toes, behind the knees, etc). This cream will be specially formulated to make sure you get an even finish. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't wear any makeup, deodorant, or perfume.",
      "content": "Don't wear any makeup, deodorant, or perfume. For an even spray tan, your skin should be completely free of any products. This includes things like makeup, deodorant, perfume, and body spray. In fact, wearing deodorant to a spray tan can result in green underarms, which is definitely something you’ll want to avoid! [10] X Research source If you’re really worried about underarm sweat or odor on the day of your appointment, try applying some baby powder to the area. It’ll absorb moisture, and you can easily wipe it off right before your spray tan session. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wear dark, loose-fitting clothes to your appointment.",
      "content": "Wear dark, loose-fitting clothes to your appointment. \"Dark colored clothing helps to minimize the visibility of any residual tanning solution that may transfer to the fabric,\" explains Ritzman. “Loose-fitting clothes also prevent friction and rubbing against the skin, which can cause the tan to streak or rub off,” she says. Ritzman also cautions against wearing tight bras, socks, or shoes, as they can cause marks and unevenness in your spray tan when you put them back on after your appointment."

    {
      "title": "Avoid sweating and exposing your skin to water after your spray tan.",
      "content": "Avoid sweating and exposing your skin to water after your spray tan. “Avoid any activities that may cause excessive sweating or exposure to water during the waiting period, as this can potentially affect the development of the tan,” says Ritzman. This means steering clear of things like working out, showering, getting in the pool, or doing the dishes for several hours. Your tanning specialist will tell you exactly how long to wait to do these things."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until the next day to take a shower.",
      "content": "Wait until the next day to take a shower. “Typically, you should wait around 8-12 hours before showering after getting a spray tan,” says Ritzman. “This allows the tanning solution to fully develop and adhere to your skin, resulting in a longer-lasting and more even tan.” However, the amount of time you should wait can vary depending on the facility you go to and the type of tan you get, so be sure to follow the specific instructions your tanning specialist gives you. When you shower for the first time after your spray tan, wash your body gently with a non-abrasive body wash, not a bar soap or exfoliating product. Use your hands to wash, rather than a loofah.

    {
      "title": "Avoid swimming and taking very long baths or showers.",
      "content": "Avoid swimming and taking very long baths or showers. A long soak in water can cause your spray tan to fade more quickly. When you take a bath or a shower, keep things quick and efficient, and don’t linger too long in the steamy water. Chlorine also speeds up the fading process, so it’s best to avoid swimming in chlorinated pools altogether. [13] X Research source If you got your spray tan to look bronzed and sun-kissed on a tropical vacation, it makes sense that you'd want to go for a quick dip in the ocean. This should be okay, as long as you don’t soak in the water for a long amount of time. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use gentle bath and shower products, and avoid exfoliating.",
      "content": "Use gentle bath and shower products, and avoid exfoliating. Harsh soaps can strip your spray tan off in patches, so it’s important to opt for gentle liquid body washes or gels when you shower, preferably without oils or sulfates in them. [15] X Research source Avoid using abrasive bar soaps or exfoliating products that slough off the top layer of your skin—these products can slough away your brand new tan, too!

      "title": "Avoid using adhesive bandages, fashion tape, or pore strips.",
      "content": "Avoid using adhesive bandages, fashion tape, or pore strips. Products that stick to your skin can accidentally strip some of your spray tan off when you remove them. [17] X Research source Because of this, it’s best to avoid using things like adhesive bandages, fashion tape, stick-on bras, and pore strips if you want your tan to stay even and last as long as possible."

      "title": "Keep your skin moisturized.",
      "content": "Keep your skin moisturized. When your skin is adequately hydrated, your spray tan is more likely to last longer. Apply body lotion frequently in the days following your appointment. Just make sure to use a product that is oil-free, since oils can break down the DHA (the main ingredient in sunless tanning products). [18] X Research source"

When your tan eventually starts to fade, you may find it helpful to use a self-tanning lotion that contains DHA, the same ingredient that was in the solution used during your spray tan. [19] X Research source These products can add a little boost to a fading spray tan and help you stay glowy and bronzed for a bit longer. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "A spray tan can last up to 10 days.",
      "content": "A spray tan can last up to 10 days. This varies depending on how well you take care of your tan, but if you’re avoiding things like swimming, taking very long showers, exfoliating, and using harsh bath products, your tan should last for around 8-10 days. [21] X Research source When your tan starts to fade, you can try “topping it off” with a self-tanning product to stretch it for a few more days."
