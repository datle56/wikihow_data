      "content": "Choose the right product. While it's not necessary to buy the most expensive cosmetics, read reviews about the product you're considering buying to find out whether it's worth it. Gel eyeliner typically comes in a pot, and you'll need an angled brush to apply it. [1] X Research source Devorah Kuperland. Makeup Artist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020. A thick brush will create thick, dark lines. A thin, angled brush will give you more control and allow you to make finer lines. [2] X Research source Look for a brush that has a bit of stiffness to it."

      "content": "Wash, dry, and moisturize your face. Use a gentle cleanser and your favorite moisturizer. You want to ensure your skin is free of dirt and oil so that you have a fresh canvas to work with. [3] X Research source Don't use an overly oily moisturizer, or the eyeliner will have trouble adhering to your skin."

      "title": "Apply concealer or primer as a base layer.",
      "content": "Apply concealer or primer as a base layer. A good base layer will give the gel eyeliner something more to stick to, will help it last longer, and will make it more apparent. Avoid using a setting powder underneath your liner, though, as this could cause clumping. [4] X Research source Opt for a matte primer that's either transparent or that has very little tint so it won't affect the color of your eye makeup. [5] X Research source Devorah Kuperland. Makeup Artist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020. If you don't have eye primer, you can use a thin layer of concealer, instead."

      "content": "Dip the brush into the eyeliner. Only dip the brush bristles in, and wipe them on the sides to remove excess eyeliner. Start with less rather than more, as you can always add more eyeliner if necessary, but taking it away will be much more difficult. Using too much eyeliner at once can lead to globs and smearing."

      "content": "Hold the brush at an angle. Don't point the brush perpendicular to your eye so you can't see what you're doing. Instead, hold the brush at an angle so you can see the tip touching your eye and can follow as you work."

      "content": "Gently pull the skin around your eye taut. Using your other hand, place a finger on your face between your temple and the eye you're going to apply eyeliner to. Very gently pull the skin taut toward your temple. This will help you apply the eyeliner in a straight line. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a basic line. Close the eye you are going to apply eyeliner to, but not so tightly that you're squinting. You can even squint so that your eye is mostly closed, but you can still see what you're doing. On your top lid, start about 1/4 of the way out from your inside corner. Use the tip of the brush to gently and smoothly follow the lash line and trace the natural curve of your eye with the eyeliner. [7] X Research source Try to do this in one stroke, keeping the eyeliner as close to the lash line as possible. If you find it difficult to trace the lash line smoothly, mark points along the way first with the eyeliner, and then connect the dots with a single stroke of the brush. [8] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Create the wing by using the brush tip to draw a triangle that naturally extends the corner of your eye. The triangle should taper and come to a point that points toward the tip of your eyebrow, and should get thicker as it approaches your eye. Angle the triangle slightly upward toward your temple. The wing should follow the line that connects the bottom of your brow with your nose. [11] X Research source Make the triangle no longer than the halfway point between the corner of your eye and your eyebrow. Fill in the triangle shape with eyeliner, and smoothly connect the triangle with the original line you drew to trace your lash line."

      "content": "Clean smears and mistakes immediately. Use either a cotton swab or makeup sponge wipe up any mistakes right away, before the eyeliner dries. If necessary, dip the cotton swab in baby oil or makeup remover first. Remember that if you use makeup remover, it will also wipe away your primer, foundation, and any other makeup in the area, so you may need to do some touchups."
