For instance, you might be able to grab some veggie burgers, wheat-based \"chicken\" cutlets, rice-paper \"bacon,\" or soy \"hot dogs.\" If you're going vegan, you might be able to find alternatives for things like eggs and cheese, as well.

Tofu, tempeh, and seitan can be used as a substitute for meat in a lot of conventional recipes. Avoid basing your whole diet on these meat alternatives—they're usually highly processed, and you usually won't get the same nutritional benefits as you would from adding in more veggies to your meal."

Not only will it be easier for you to adapt your meals if you switch gradually, but it can also give your body more time to adjust to the different diet. You might even plan to have one \"last meal\" with each ingredient you're giving up before you resolve not to eat it again. [4] X Expert Source Tara Coleman Clinical Nutritionist Expert Interview. 22 October 2020. For instance, you might start by cutting all red meat from your diet, like beef, lamb, or venison.

Vegetarians range from vegan—meaning they don't consume or use any type of animal products at all—to partial vegetarians, who just try to stick to a plant-based diet the majority of the time. This is a really personal choice, and it's okay if you need to experiment for a while to find out what works for you. In the end, it comes down to what makes you feel the best, both physically and mentally. Some of your choices include: [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Vegan: No animal products, including meat, dairy, eggs, gelatin, or honey.
