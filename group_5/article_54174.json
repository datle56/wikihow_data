    {
      "title": "Get a fresh mushroom from the store or ground.",
      "content": "Get a fresh mushroom from the store or ground. You can extract spores from any mushroom as long as it’s fresh and healthy. For best results, use a mushroom with a large cap. [1] X Research source You can also get more than 1 mushroom to extract more spores or make different designs. If you plan on growing the mushrooms to eat, make sure you get a type you know is safe and edible. It’s best to buy mushrooms from the store if you want to eat them because eating wild mushrooms can be dangerous."

    {
      "title": "Check for mold, brown spots, and mushy areas.",
      "content": "Check for mold, brown spots, and mushy areas. Unhealthy mushrooms may not produce spores. Feel the cap to make sure it’s firm and not wet and mushy. Flip the mushroom over and check that the gills are moist; if they’re old and dry, they’re less likely to release spores. [2] X Research source If your mushroom has pores instead of gills, you can still extract the spores following this method. If you want to reduce the risk of contamination, wear gloves sterilized with 70% rubbing alcohol."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the stem from the mushroom so the gills can touch the paper.",
      "content": "Remove the stem from the mushroom so the gills can touch the paper. Use scissors or a knife and cut the stem at its base, as close to the gills as you can. [3] X Research source You can also just pull the stem out since it usually separates easily. Sterilize the scissors by holding them over a flame until they turn red hot, then dipping them into distilled water. [4] X Research source Wear heatproof gloves and work on a metal surface. On some mushrooms, the top of the cap grows down and over the gills a little bit. If that’s the case, use a heat-sterilized knife to carefully carve out the skirt of the cap, avoiding the gills. You can still make a spore print if you accidentally damage the gills; the pattern will just be affected. You can still extract the spores even if you want to keep the stem attached to the mushroom. Cut a hole in an index card and place it over a bowl, then insert the stem into the hole so the cap rests on the paper."

    {
      "title": "Sterilize a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Sterilize a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil. Either wipe a piece of wax paper down with 70% rubbing alcohol or hold a piece of aluminum foil over a flame. This helps prevent other bacterium from getting into your print. [5] X Research source Wear heatproof gloves if you are sterilizing aluminum foil. If you’re making the print for an art piece, you can just use paper. If you’re doing this project to make a decoration, try putting a few mushrooms on paper of all different colors. White and black are good choices, since these are the most common colors for mushroom spores. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put the mushroom gill-side down onto the paper.",
      "content": "Put the mushroom gill-side down onto the paper. Flip the mushroom so the gills are facing down. Then gently lay it onto the wax paper. [7] X Research source If you want to be as sterile as possible, use heat-sterilized tweezers to touch the cap. If your mushroom has pores, put the cap pore-side down. The pores will often face down (in the same direction as the gills). Don’t press the mushroom down or you might crush it. You can put more than one mushroom on the same piece of paper or follow the same steps for a different piece."

      "title": "Add a drop of water to the top of the mushroom so the spores release.",
      "content": "Add a drop of water to the top of the mushroom so the spores release. The water helps keep the mushroom moist and encourages it to release spores. [8] X Research source Don’t soak the mushroom or you might ruin the spores. Dry the cap off if you accidentally add too much water. If you’re trying to keep your culture pure, use sterilized water. Either boil the water, let it cool, and boil it again, or pressure cook it in a beaker at 15 psi for 15 minutes. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Cover the mushroom with a cup or bowl to lock in moisture.",
      "content": "Cover the mushroom with a cup or bowl to lock in moisture. Anything will work as long as it covers the mushroom entirely. This helps lock in the moisture and also prevents the spores from blowing away when the cap releases them. If you’re worried about cross-contamination, consider making your print in sterilized box. [10] X Research source Make sure the bowl or cup doesn’t press on the top of the mushroom. This might damage it. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Leave the mushroom alone for 2-24 hours while it releases spores.",
      "content": "Leave the mushroom alone for 2-24 hours while it releases spores. Mushrooms start releasing spores within a few hours, so just leave it alone and let nature do its work. [12] X Research source In general, the longer you leave the mushroom out, the more spores it will release. If you’re trying to do an art project, try leaving multiple mushrooms out for different lengths of time. That way, you can create a cool mosaic of different designs."

      "content": "Lift the mushroom up to see your spore print. After a few hours, go back to see the result. Pick up the mushroom and check out the spore print on the paper. [13] X Research source Spores usually just look like dirt or dust on the paper. The main difference is that there are a range of colors. They could be brown, black, white, red, yellow, and a few other shades. If you want to collect more spores, you can always leave the mushroom out a little longer."

      "content": "Sterilize your water, syringes, and tools in a pressure cooker. Pour 10 mL of distilled water per syringe you have into a glass or shot glass, then cover the top with aluminum foil. Wrap your syringes and a tool for scraping (like tweezers) in aluminum, too, and put everything in a pressure cooker. Pressure cook them on a dry setting for 15 minutes at 15 psi. [17] X Research source Let everything cool before you start work on your syringe. Some water will likely evaporate in the pressure cooker, so put a little more than you need to fill all your syringes."

Cut two holes large enough to fit your arms through into the bin, then tape the kitchen gloves so they go into the holes. Wipe the entire inside down with rubbing alcohol, then Lysol. [18] X Research source Alternatively, wipe down a counter with rubbing alcohol and Lysol. If you use the sterile box, place your sterile instruments and spore print inside and close the lid. Make the syringe using the kitchen gloves taped into the box, and don’t open the lid until your syringe is capped off or ready to use."

[21] X Research source Research your spores to find what kind of grow bag to buy or make. If you’re not sure what mushroom you have, try growing it in straw.

The perfect temperature for your mushroom grow bag depends on the species of mushroom, but between 60 to 75 °F (16 to 24 °C) is generally good.

Mix it together, water it, and put the pot in a dark area, ideally between 65 to 75 °F (18 to 24 °C). [24] X Research source Mushrooms don't need a lot of care, but keep the soil moist. Spritz it with some water if it's dry. The mushrooms should start sprouting in 3-4 weeks. If you don't see any by then, the spores may have gone bad. You can use compost mixed with straw for your medium. If you have a wood-eating mushroom, mix the compost with sawdust."

If you live in an area with high humidity, store your spores in the fridge but don’t freeze spore prints or syringes. [25] X Research source Try not to scrape the paper on the opening of the bag when you're putting it in or you might rub off some of the spores. If you're saving spores on multiple pieces of paper, use a different bag for each piece. Kept in favorable conditions, the spores can last about a year. You can't really tell if they're still fresh with a visual check, though the color might start fading as they dry out."
