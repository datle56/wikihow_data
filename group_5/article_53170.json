      "content": "Consider why you're deleting your Minecraft account. For most people interested in deleting their accounts, they're wanting to rid themselves of Minecraft due to its addictive properties. Many people have found countless hours swept away by the game, and would prefer to do something else. Because the deletion process is irreversible, you should take some time to consider whether you really want to quit. If you think you can't have it as part of a healthy life, then proceed with deleting it. If you're addicted, try limiting, rather than deleting your Minecraft experience. You might try putting a strict limit on the amount you can play each day; that way, you'll have lots of other time to do other things. While it may seem hard at first, the self-restraint you'll learn from this will actually help you in many other ways. Because there is a monetary value associated with a Minecraft account, it may be preferable to give the account away to someone who might get enjoyment out of it, rather than deleting it completely.

      "content": "Uninstall the game from your computer. Uninstalling the Minecraft software is a good first step towards quitting. Delete any trace of it on your computer. If you have a console, toss out or trade in the disk. If you play it via a mobile device, remove the app. Uninstalling the software but leaving the account intact is another option, as it'll give you the opportunity to return to it if you ever have a change of heart."

      "content": "Make sure your Minecraft account is attached to Mojang. This shouldn't be a problem if you have a relatively newer account, but older accounts will require migrating your Minecraft info to Mojang. You won't be able to follow through with deleting your account otherwise. This can be done via the Mojang account migration form. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Log into your Mojang account and request deletion. Go to https://account.mojang.com . From there, log in and access your 'Settings' tab. At the bottom, there should be a 'Request Deletion' button. Click the button, and you'll be asked to verify some of your information. In the majority of cases, your account should now be eliminated."

      "title": "Contact Mojang's customer support.",
      "content": "Contact Mojang's customer support. If you cannot delete an account on your own for whatever reason, you might try contacting Mojang directly. They'll either be able to guide you through the process, or delete the account for you themselves. If you only recently purchased the account (within the past 30 days) and want to delete it, you should send Mojang an email requesting a refund."
