      "title": "Bring water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring water to a boil. Fill a large pot with a good amount of water. Be careful not to overfill it though, as the water could end up boiling over. Make sure the water is boiling before moving on to the next step. Don't forget to add a dash of salt."

      "title": "Add lasagna noodles to the water.",
      "content": "Add lasagna noodles to the water. Firstly, check your recipe to see how much lasagna noodles are needed. You might find yourself with leftovers. Have your wooden spoon ready as you need to start the next step instantly. Take care when dropping your noodles into the pot. Otherwise, you could get splashed by boiling water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir continuously for the first two minutes.",
      "content": "Stir continuously for the first two minutes. Lasagna noodles are large and flat, lending themselves towards sticking together. The first two minutes is crucial, if you want to avoid being left with clumps of noodles. Not stirring could result in the noodles sticking to the bottom of the pot. Separate the lasagna noodles effectively by using a chopstick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't let the water boil over.",
      "content": "Don't let the water boil over. After you’ve added the lasagna noodles, you will notice the water simmering. When it returns to a boil, adjust the element to keep the water boiling consistently. This should help to prevent the water spilling out. Stay attentive as this could occur later in the process too. Using a lid is more likely to cause a boil over. Covering the pot will trap steam, causing starch molecules to overheat. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the pot two or three more times.",
      "content": "Stir the pot two or three more times. Now that the water is boiling, the lasagna noodles should stay spaced apart. Don't risk them sticking together or sinking to the bottom, so return to the element and stir a few more times. If noodles are heating too close together, they won't release starch properly. The starch can turn to glue, leaving you with unusable lasagna noodles. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check that 8-10 minutes have passed.",
      "content": "Check that 8-10 minutes have passed. Be precise with your timing. After 8-10 minutes you can begin the final stages of the process. Read the packaging as the suggested cooking time could vary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a piece out and test if it's ready.",
      "content": "Take a piece out and test if it's ready. Ideally, a properly cooked lasagna noodle has a hint of firmness and offers some resistance to your bite. Does it taste good? Now you can switch the element off. Lasagna noodles should be cooked to the 'al dente' stage, an Italian term which means 'to the tooth'. This is when the middle isn’t too hard, soft or mushy.

    {
      "title": "Pour the lasagna noodles into a colander.",
      "content": "Pour the lasagna noodles into a colander. Make sure they have been drained of all water. Release them slowly into the colander because the noodles could potentially still stick together. Be cautious when draining the lasagna noodles to avoid getting hit by steam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the lasagna noodles to cool before adding them to your dish.",
      "content": "Leave the lasagna noodles to cool before adding them to your dish. You can do this by laying them out on paper towels. Now your noodles will be easier to use when you go to make lasagna. For better results, instead of paper towels you can place lasagna noodles on oiled baking paper.
