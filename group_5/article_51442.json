This will show you the placement of the value in the data set that is at the three-fourths, or 75 percent mark, and thus the place where the data set is split into the upper quartile and the lower quartiles. This will not give you the number of the upper quartile. [7] X Research source For example: Q 3 = 3 4 ( 11 ) {\\displaystyle Q_{3}={\\frac {3}{4}}(11)} Q 3 = 8 1 4 {\\displaystyle Q_{3}=8{\\frac {1}{4}}} So, the upper quartile is given by the number at the 8 1 4 {\\displaystyle 8{\\frac {1}{4}}} position in the data set."

This will give you the upper quartile of your data set. [8] X Research source For example, if you calculated 8 1 4 {\\displaystyle 8{\\frac {1}{4}}} using the formula, then the upper quartile is between the 8th and 9th number in the data set. In the set [3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 21], 11 and 12 are the 8th and 9th number. Calculate 11 + 12 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11+12}{2}}} to find the average: 11 + 12 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {11+12}{2}}} = 23 2 {\\displaystyle ={\\frac {23}{2}}} = 11.5 {\\displaystyle =11.5} So, the upper quartile of the data set is 11.5"

Note that with the release of Office 2010, there are two different quartile functions: QUARTILE.EXC and QUARTILE.INC. These functions cannot be used in earlier versions of Excel, and QUARTILE can still be used. The two Excel quartile functions use a different formula to calculate the upper quartile. QUARTILE/QUARTILE.INC uses the formula Q 3 = 3 4 ( n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle Q_{3}={\\frac {3}{4}}(n-1)} , and the QUARTILE.EXC function uses the formula Q 3 = 3 4 ( n + 1 ) {\\displaystyle Q_{3}={\\frac {3}{4}}(n+1)} . Both formula are accepted ways to calculate quartiles, although the former is becoming standardized in statistical software."
