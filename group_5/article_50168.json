They speak when they need to speak and listen to other people, engaging in conversation in socially appropriate ways. [2] X Research source For example, don’t constantly talk about yourself. When you constantly talk about your achievements, people start to think that you’re looking for approval and acceptance. A confident person doesn’t try to seek much external approval. Instead try asking other people about their achievements and lives! Accept compliments graciously. When people give you positive feedback, thank them and accept the compliment. Confident people know that they are worthy of compliments and respect. Don’t self-deprecate by saying you’re not good at something, or acting as though your success was just lucky."

      "content": "Wear clothes that are well-fitting, neat, and situation-appropriate. People often make snap judgments based on a person’s appearance. Sometimes, acting confidently means that you need to dress the part. If you're wearing clothes that look like you've just got out of bed, the average person may not take you seriously. On the other hand, if you look like you're ready to get things done, people will assume you are confident and will likely be more respectful. Making an effort to be serious about your appearance will make it look like you're more serious about your demands."

If you speak up for yourself and show people that you’re not going to stand to be treated with disrespect, they will see your confidence and show you the respect that you deserve. For example, if you are trying to speak and someone interrupts, say, “Excuse me, I’d like to finish my thought.”"

If you’re always self-deprecating, other people will begin to treat you that way. By having self-respect, you can demonstrate that you will not settle for anything less from others. For example, don’t talk to other people about how much you hate your hair. Find something about your appearance that you’re pleased with and focus on that. Or, get a new haircut and turn a negative self-image into a positive one."

For example, you don’t have trouble speaking with other people at school. But you clam up when talking at parties. When you are at a party, imagine that you are just talking with someone in your classroom.

For example, if you feel nervous about a job interview, activate your body’s calming response by taking ten deep breaths, breathing in for a count of four, holding for a count of four, then exhaling for a count of four.

Assertive communication helps ensure that everyone’s rights (the speaker and listener) are protected. It also ensures that everyone enters into the conversation with an understanding of cooperation. This also means that everyone’s opinions are considered when working out a solution. For example, to act confident during an interview, take the interview as an opportunity to see how your work experience and knowledge will help fulfill the company’s needs. You could say, “From what you’ve told me, one of the skills you are looking for is help expanding upon existing clients' use of intermodal rail services. In my position at ABC Transport, I was able to help three major national clients expand and brought in an extra one million dollars for the company. I would love to do the same, if not more, for XYZ Intermodal.”"

There are several things you can do to help your self-confidence and self-esteem, which in turn will help you feel better in a variety of situations. Believing in yourself is the secret to confidence. While you can act confident, you will be much more convincing if you believe in your confidence. Look deep inside yourself and acknowledge your best attributes. You may not think you have anything special in you, but you do. This inner confidence will naturally make you feel and look great. Set realistic goals and meet them. Give yourself the confidence to know that you can successfully accomplish goals. Love yourself for who you are. Accept yourself for your positives and negatives. Give yourself leeway for mistakes and give yourself accolades when you are successful. Talk with your loved ones. People who love you can help you see the positive in yourself.

      "content": "Identify what makes you feel confident. Once you understand the situations in which you feel confident, you can transfer your confidence skills to other situations. Write a list of each situation where you feel confident. For each situation, write down what it is that enables you to feel confident in that situation. For example: “I feel confident when I am with my friends. Reasons why I feel confident: I have known them a long time. I know they don’t judge me. They accept me for who I am.” Write down each situation where you don’t feel as confident. For each of these situations, write down what it is that prevents you from feeling confident. For example: “I don’t feel confident when I am in work. Reasons why I don’t feel confident: It’s a new job and I am not sure about what I am doing. My boss is a bit picky, and she has pulled me up on the work I have done.”"

Confident people focus on how to improve what they do until they succeed. People who lack confidence will focus upon how they appear, worrying about their perceived shortcomings (which are most often not true), and worry about failing rather than trying to find a way to make things work. Reflect on a recent situation that you were in, such as giving a public talk or interviewing for a job. Count at least three things that went well in the situation. This will help keep negative thinking at bay. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Quiet your inner critic. Negative thoughts cause a lot of misery for a lot of people. Negative thoughts are often based upon self-beliefs that are untrue. These types of thoughts might include, “I’m not good enough,” “I’m unlucky,” or “I mess up all the time.” Acknowledge those thoughts as they occur. You simply have picked up some bad habits along the way. Changing them is completely within your reach. Counter negative thoughts. Offer an opposite thought and then test out which one is true. For example, if you catch yourself saying, “I’m unlucky,” counter that thought with all the things you have in your life that make you lucky. For example, remind yourself, “I have a roof over my head, food on the table, and clothing on my back. I have friends and family who love me. I won $40 last year from lottery scratch tickets.” Acknowledge that your inner critic is never really correct. Quieting the inner critic can help you act confidently because you will feel more confident without someone (you) putting you down all the time."
