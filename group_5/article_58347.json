      "title": "Set up a gaga pit on a flat section of ground.",
      "content": "Set up a gaga pit on a flat section of ground. A gaga ball pit is usually octagonal or hexagonal, and the dimensions can range between 15–25 feet (4.6–7.6 m) in diameter. [1] X Research source Choose a large open spot on grass, sand, or mulch, and set up the pit walls. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a gaga ball pit, make your own pit by taping together broken-down cardboard boxes or using short fence panels for the walls. If you want a cheaper alternative to play gaga ball without a pit, lay out disc cones for each corner of the octagon to create the boundaries. Just be aware the ball may roll away more easily and you won’t be able to bounce the ball off the pit walls."

      "title": "Gather players inside the pit and have them touch the pit walls.",
      "content": "Gather players inside the pit and have them touch the pit walls. While you can play with however many people fit inside the gaga pit, stick to around 15 players at a time so there’s space to move around. Make sure each player has either a hand or foot touching the inside edge of the wall so no one has an unfair advantage. [3] X Research source If more people want to play gaga ball, have them form a line outside of the pit. After the first game is over, the winner stays inside the pit and new players can enter."

    {
      "title": "Toss the ball into the pit and let it bounce 3 times.",
      "content": "Toss the ball into the pit and let it bounce 3 times. Choose a player to act as the referee and give them the ball. When all players are ready, the referee tosses the ball up so it lands in the center of the pit. During the first and second bounces, all the players shout “Ga!” After the third bounce, players shout “Go!” and can stop touching the wall. If a player stops touching the wall before the third bounce, they’re immediately eliminated and must leave the pit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hit the ball toward other players with your hands.",
      "content": "Hit the ball toward other players with your hands. Once the ball is in play, picking up, carrying, or throwing it is not allowed, but any player can strike it using an open hand or their fist. When a player hits a ball, they have to wait until it touches another player or the pit wall before they’re able to hit it again. [4] X Research source If a player carries the ball or touches it twice in a row, they’re eliminated and must leave the pit until the end of the game. If a player accidentally hits the ball so it bounces outside of the pit, then they’re eliminated from the game. Players cannot kick the ball with their feet, or else they’ll get eliminated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eliminate players if they’re hit below the waist or knees.",
      "content": "Eliminate players if they’re hit below the waist or knees. If the ball touches any player below the waist or knees, either from a direct hit or rebound of the wall, they’re immediately eliminated. Eliminated players must leave the pit as soon as possible. If the ball hits a player above the waist, then they’re still in the game. [5] X Research source Players may catch the ball if it's coming toward them. If a player catches the ball before it bounces, then the player who last hit the ball is eliminated instead. Variation : If an eliminated player catches the ball when it’s hit outside of the pit, then they’re back in the game and the player who hit it is eliminated."

    {
      "title": "Win the game if you’re the last player standing.",
      "content": "Win the game if you’re the last player standing. Continue playing the game hitting the ball and trying to eliminate other players. Once there’s only one player left inside the pit, they win the game! [6] X Research source Alternatively, play with a time 10- to 15-minute time limit. Anyone who’s left in the pit at the end of the time limit wins the game together. If you’re playing in a large gaga ball pit and there aren’t a lot of players left in the game, toss in a second ball to help speed up the end of the game. Because gaga ball games are pretty short, you’ll typically play multiple rounds."

    {
      "title": "Face the ball at all times.",
      "content": "Face the ball at all times. As you’re playing, turn your body toward the ball and stay aware of where it is throughout the game. If you’re watching the ball, you’ll be able to react more quickly and dodge it if it’s hit toward you. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Hunch over to protect your legs with your hands and arms.",
      "content": "Hunch over to protect your legs with your hands and arms. Bend at the waist and lean forward so your arms dangle in front of your feet or legs. That way, when someone hits the ball toward you, you’re already in a defensive position and can swat the ball in a different direction. [8] X Research source This technique is called “turtling.” Some rules prohibit you from turtling, so check with the other players and the referee to see if it’s allowed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dribble the ball against the wall to control it better.",
      "content": "Dribble the ball against the wall to control it better. When you’re near the ball, gently swat it at the wall so it rolls back to you. You’re able to hit the ball again after it touches the pit wall, so use this to your advantage to move the ball closer to your other players so it’s easier to hit them. [9] X Research source If you’re trying to hit another player near the wall, swat the ball hard so it bounces back to you if you miss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to ricochet the ball off the pit wall to hit your opponents.",
      "content": "Try to ricochet the ball off the pit wall to hit your opponents. Look for players standing near the wall because it’ll be easier to hit them with the ball. Aim for the wall next to or behind the player and strike the ball with enough force so it rebounds back. Even if the ball touches the wall before it hits the other player below the waist, they’re still eliminated from the game. [10] X Research source Use a little misdirection to surprise the other players. Face away from the player you want to eliminate and strike the ball from the side or backward so it rolls toward them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the pit wall for support to jump higher and avoid the ball.",
      "content": "Use the pit wall for support to jump higher and avoid the ball. You may always jump or dodge the ball when it’s coming toward you. If you’re next to one of the pit walls, plant your hands down and lift your feet to jump higher so you’re out of the ball’s path. Using the walls for support or sitting on them may be illegal depending on the people you’re playing with. Confirm the rules before trying this strategy so you don’t get eliminated on accident."
