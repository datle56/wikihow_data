      "title": "Limit information you put on your public profiles.",
      "content": "Limit information you put on your public profiles. While some predators may ask you for personal information, others may stalk you and look at your public profiles to get information about you. To avoid this, limit the amount of specific information you put on your chatroom or social media profiles. Put only very general information about yourself, such as your general interests or the country you live in."

      "title": "Do not tell people where you live or frequent.",
      "content": "Do not tell people where you live or frequent. Perhaps the most important part of staying safe while in a chatroom is not providing information about your actual physical location. Without this information, people can't physically harm you. As a result, don't tell anyone where you live, the places you hang out, or where you go to school or work.

      "content": "Avoid giving out your full name. Instead of using your name, try using a nickname or an alias. This way, you'll be able to personalize your online presence, but safeguard your personal information and life. Ultimately, people you meet in chatrooms don't really need to know your real name. [2] X Research source Your nickname can be a version of your real name or something your friends and family call you."

      "title": "Do not give your phone number out.",
      "content": "Do not give your phone number out. While it may seem okay to give someone your phone number, that person can use your number to harass you, stalk you, and/or intimidate you. In addition, they could use the telephone to get you to trust them and then manipulate you. As a result, never give out your phone number to people you meet online."

      "title": "Avoid posting photographs.",
      "content": "Avoid posting photographs. Even if your photographs don't show street names, license plates, or other information that can be used to identify you, posting them can still open you up to danger. Photographs that show what you (or your friends) look like can give away enough information to encourage unwanted attention. Ultimately, you could attract the attention of a predator or stalker.

      "title": "Avoid meeting people you've met online.",
      "content": "Avoid meeting people you've met online. One of the easiest ways to protect yourself when in a chatroom is to refuse to meet people you've met there. This is important, as predators, stalkers, and others who want to do you harm may suggest meeting up somewhere at some point. In the end, simply say no to meeting in real life. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Never meet in a private location, if you do plan to meet someone.",
      "content": "Never meet in a private location, if you do plan to meet someone. Any meeting you schedule with someone you met online should be in a public location. This way, there will be others around in case something goes wrong. Meet in a place where security or police are nearby. Consider places like malls, coffee shops, or at large social gatherings. Don't go to a location you're not familiar with already. [5] X Research source"

Tell them the location, and ask them to call you if they haven't heard from you in a certain amount of time. Bring friends with you for extra backup, if you'd like."

      "content": "Call the police if you think someone you met online is stalking you. If for some reason you suspect that someone you met online knows where you live, is following you, or stalking you, call the police immediately. While your local police may not be able to stop someone outside their jurisdiction from harassing you, they may be able to work with authorities elsewhere. Describe the person who is stalking you. Let the police know you may have met the person online. Explain to them that you feel threatened."

      "title": "Block threatening or scary people immediately.",
      "content": "Block threatening or scary people immediately. The very instant someone threatens or scares you, you should use whatever tools the chatroom or social media site has to block that person.
