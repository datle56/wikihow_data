Using shears will make your cut look sharper, cleaner, and more professional. Borrow shears from a friend or buy a set of your own before you start cutting. [1] X Research source You can find hair trimming shears online or at a local salon supply store. If you don't already have one, purchase a flat, fine-toothed comb."

Even though you usually cut hair when it's wet, this dry cut will allow you to get your angles more precise and also to get the length that you want. [3] X Research source If your hair is damp or wet, just give it a quick blowdry until it is completely dry. When your hair is wet, you won't be able to see your natural hair growth pattern or cowlicks as easily. When it's dry, it will fall more naturally.

      "content": "Part your hair in the center and find the top of your head. Use a fine-toothed flat comb to draw a part right down the middle of your head. This will help you make sure that your bangs comb out evenly. Next, use the same comb to locate the top of your head. Start by holding your comb to the top of your forehead, and then work your way back on your head until you hit the spot where the comb lies flat. [5] X Research source That’s the center of your head and will be the place where you start to section out your bangs. Section out a triangle of hair to cut. Use that top spot on your head and the arch of your eyebrows as your guides. Comb a sharp part from the top of your head to the top of the arch of your right brow, parting on the diagonal. Secure that section of hair with a small clip, then hit the other side using the same method. [6] X Research source Now you have the section of hair that you’ll cut into bangs. Comb the entire section straight down, letting it fall right in front of your face."

      "content": "Start cutting longer than you think you want. This part is key! [7] X Research source Run the comb through your hair until you get to your chin. Once you get to the chin, place your first 2 fingers right underneath the comb. This is where you’ll start cutting. Make your first cuts straight across the entire section. Hold the scissors parallel with your chin. [8] X Research source By cutting right under your fingers, you'll create your chin-length bangs. Don't go any shorter right now. You can always cut more later if you want to. One of the most common mistakes when cutting your own bangs is going shorter than you wanted to. To avoid this, make your first cuts longer than you planned. You can always make them shorter, but you won’t be able to put back any hair you wish you hadn’t trimmed."

      "content": "Use the arch of your eyebrows as your guide again. Hold one section of your bangs between 2 fingers just a little bit above the ends. Hold your fingers parallel to the angle of your brows at a slightly downward angle. Use the shears to cut just below your fingers. Do the same thing on the other side, but make your cut the opposite angle. Sweep your curtain bangs to the side of your face and enjoy your new look. [9] X Research source The gentle downward angle from the top of your brow arch to the end of your brow is the same slight angle you’re going for with your bangs. Step back a little from the mirror before you make these cuts. That way, you can get the bigger picture of how your bangs look. It's easy to cut too much if you're too close to the mirror.

      "content": "This final step will help make your bangs look natural and help them blend. Comb your bangs so that they hang straight down in front of your face. Hold your shears vertically and make small snips across the bottom of your bangs. [11] X Research source Make these snips random as you move across your fringe, making about 4-6 cuts total. This will help your bangs blend into the rest of your hair. This snips should be really short, with barely any length coming off at all."
