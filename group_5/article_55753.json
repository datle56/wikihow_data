      "content": "Usually, it takes between 1 day and 1 week for a resizing. In reality, it only takes a jeweler about 10 or 20 minutes to resize a ring. However, they might not have time to resize it right when you come in, so it often takes a bit longer. Ring resizing can also take extra time depending on the complexity of your ring and how many sizes you need it to be adjusted. [1] X Research source While you can try to resize a ring yourself , experts recommend taking it into a professional to avoid damaging it. If you’re planning a wedding, it’s a good idea to get any rings resized at least 2 months in advance. That way, there’s plenty of time to drop them off and pick them up, plus wiggle room for any delays. If you cut it a bit close and you don’t have time to get your ring resized at a jeweler, use a ring resizer to make your ring fit tightly on your finger."

      "content": "Rose gold, tungsten, and titanium rings Materials like these are too hard for most jewelers to resize. If your jeweler has the right tools to melt the metals, then they may be able to work on your ring—however, most jewelers won’t be able to. [4] X Research source Stainless steel rings are also very hard to resize. You can look for a jeweler who will resize these metals for you, or you can get the center stone in the ring recast into a different band."

      "content": "Eternity bands Eternity bands, or the bands with diamonds all around them, are custom-made to include the right amount of diamonds for the size of the band. Since adding to the band or subtracting from it would affect the size, most jewelers won’t resize eternity bands. If your eternity band doesn’t fit, the jeweler will likely recommend removing the diamonds and recasting them on a new band. You may have to add or subtract diamonds depending on the amount you need to be resized."

Most jewelers won’t adjust tension rings or resize them. Since tension rings are custom made, your best bet is to remove the center stone and put it on a new band."

      "content": "Sizing up or sizing down Sizing down almost always costs less than sizing up, since the jeweler is taking away material instead of adding it. [7] X Research source When you size down, all you’re paying for is the cost of the jeweler’s labor, not any new material for the ring itself."

Talk to your jeweler to see if they recommend resizing the ring or just casting a new band entirely. [8] X Research source"

[9] X Research source If you bought the ring online or you can’t go back to the original jeweler, consult with local jewelers in your area. In general, finding a small, local jeweler is better than resizing at a large chain jeweler. Local jewelers often have fewer customers, meaning they can resize your ring quicker than a chain store can."

There are 2 main ways jewelers will size rings up: the most common way is by cutting the band, then soldering on new metal to make the band bigger.
