Get 8 to 9 bands for every 1 inch (2.5 cm). You can make them all the same color or you can use different colors. [1] X Research source If you don't have a measuring tape, wrap a piece of string around your wrist, pinch where the end overlaps, then measure it against a ruler. Rainbow is a popular color scheme, but you can also use 2 colors, like black and white. If you want to make a double-strand fishtail bracelet, double the amount of bands that you need."

[2] X Research source This is the only band that you will twist; you won't twist the others. To make double-fishtail, simply use 2 bands of each color. Treat them as a single band.

Push the band towards the bottom of the pegs so that you have room for 2 more bands. [4] X Research source If you don't have a Rainbow Loom, use 2 fingers or 2 pencils instead. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add 2 more bands but without twisting them. Take your next color, and slide it over the 2 pegs. Take your third color, and slide it over the 2 pegs as well. Leave tiny gaps between the bands so that you can see them clearly. [6] X Research source For example, if you started with red to make a rainbow bracelet, your next 2 bands should be orange and yellow. If you are making a double-strand fishtail bracelet, use 2 bands of each color for a total of 4 bands."

Pull it over the left peg and release it on top of the uppermost band. [7] X Research source The band will land on top of the third band, right between the 2 pegs. If you lost or broke the hook that came with your kit, you can use a real crochet hook instead. You can find them in the yarn section of a craft store. If you are using your fingers or pencils, you may be able to do this without a crochet hook."

As you continue to add bands, the bracelet will grow longer. Once it is long enough to wrap around your wrist, stop. [11] X Research source The bracelet should be long enough to wrap loosely around your wrist. Don't worry, it will stretch to fit over your hand. Every so often, wrap the bracelet around your wrist to test the length. Don't stretch it."

[12] X Research source This step is similar to the previous steps, but instead of pulling 1 band over the pegs, you are pulling 2. When you are done, you should have only 1 band on the Rainbow Loom. If you are doing a double-strand fishtail bracelet, then you will have 1 set of bands left on the pegs."

This hand will act as the loom; the other hand will act as the hook. While you can use a Rainbow Loom for this method, it will be easier to use 2 fingers or 2 pencils.
