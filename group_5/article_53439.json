      "content": "A classic ponytail is a quick and easy way to style your hair before school. Start by pulling your hair back with both hands. Then, grab a hair tie and slip the ponytail through the elastic. Twist the elastic into a figure-8 shape and pull the hair through again. Then, keep twisting the elastic and pulling your hair through until the elastic is tight. [1] X Expert Source Shun Pittman Master Cosmetologist, Global Salon Educator & Author Expert Interview. 16 June 2021. Feel free to tie your hair with a scrunchie , a ribbon, or a bow in your school colors as a fun alternative to a traditional hair tie. If you don't want your hair tie to be visible, take a strand of hair and wrap it around the base of your ponytail several times, covering the elastic. Tuck the end of this strand into your hair tie, just beneath your hair. Then, secure it in place using a bobby pin. You can wear your ponytail high on the top of your head , low at the base of your neck, or medium-high at the very back of your head. You can even wear it on the side of your head, if you’d like."
