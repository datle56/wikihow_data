They love food, roll around in the mud, squeal with glee, and tend to make a big mess–and we love them for that! 🐷 is often used in an affectionate way to refer to someone with these kinds of characteristics. [1] X Research source Pigs are also chubby animals, so 🐷 is sometimes used jokingly to say someone is eating a lot. My son just tasted chocolate for the first time! Such a little 🐷❤️ Erin is so cute and she loves her bottle! 🐷👶🍼 Can she sit up on her own yet?"

      "content": "The 🐷 (pig face) emoji can mean someone is being dirty, greedy, or lazy. Pigs can be adorable, but they’re associated with a few not-so-cute characteristics, too, like being gluttonous, filthy, and lazy. Pigs are also heavy, so 🐷 could be used to say someone is overweight. You’ve probably heard phrases like “pigging out” (eating too much) and “hogging” something (keeping something for yourself), and 🐷 is a snarky way to say someone has these negative traits. Your bedroom is a total pigsty! You need to clean this up ASAP 🐷 Omg I seriously cannot stop eating these chocolate chip cookies 🐷 Ugh, my brother has been laying around doing absolutely nothing 🐷"
