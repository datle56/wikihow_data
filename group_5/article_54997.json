      "content": "Get rid of water sources. [4] X Expert Source Elmer Bensinger Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 5 February 2021. Water sources, like small ponds and fountains, will attract toads to your yard, particularly during breeding season. To help reduce the attraction, take out these water features. [5] X Research source Also, pour off any standing water in buckets or other areas. Even birdbaths that are low to the ground may attract toads. Toads like to lay eggs in the water during breeding season. Keeping the water moving with a fountain or waterfall will reduce mosquitoes, a popular attraction for toads. However, toads may still venture into your yard to lay eggs in the water."

You can simply put the eggs on a dry surface, and they won't hatch. [12] X Research source The eggs will look a little like caviar, small and dotted.

Check online for the local species in your area, and research which ones are endangered. [15] X Research source Invasive species are ones that are not native to the area, cause destruction, and deplete the natural resources for the native species. In some cases, it can be good to euthanize these species so native species thrive."

After about 40 minutes, it should be nearly dead, at which point, you can place it in the freezer for 3 days to fully euthanize it.
