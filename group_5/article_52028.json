      "content": "Determine whether the chimney needs to be cleaned. Chimneys should be cleaned at least once a year, and more often if you use your fireplace frequently. [1] X Research source Take a flashlight and peer inside the chimney flute. Use a pencil or plastic knife to scrape off a bit of the creosote that has accumulated on the side of the chimney. If it's 1/8-inch thick or thicker, it's time for a cleaning. If you only clean your chimney once a year, do it in the fall, before the burning season begins. Otherwise, you risk sparking a chimney fire the first time you light up your fireplace in the winter."

      "content": "Measure your chimney flue. To clean your chimney, you'll have to use properly-sized tools. Measure the sides of your chimney from the bottom, through the fireplace. You could also climb up a ladder and measure it from the top. Determine the size and shape of the flue. It will be either square or round, 6\" or 8.\" Determine the height of the chimney. If you're guessing, it's better to overestimate, so you have more than enough extra rope or piping to make sure the chimney brush can reach the entire length of the chimney."

If you're unsure about the quality of your roof, or if your roof is slanted and you're not sure you'll be able to keep your balance, use the other method."

Have one person take it up a ladder to the roof. The person on the roof should hold one side of the rope, and drop the other side, with the brush in the middle, through the flue to the other person waiting below.
