You can check the volume with Siri (\"Hey Siri, what's the volume?\") or by pressing either volume button on your iPhone or iPad. [1] X Research source This is most likely the culprit if someone else used your AirPods recently. Also check the volume of your music app. The settings in your music app could be causing your AirPods to play music at a low volume! To fix this, go to Settings > Music and make sure the \"EQ\" is off as well as \"Volume Limit\"."

You can check the volume by placing your AirPods inside the charging case and opening its lid near your iPhone or iPad. If you're using a Mac, click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, hold the mouse cursor over the AirPods on the menu to see the battery level. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Since your AirPods spend a lot of time in your ears, they are prone to develop waxy buildup. Even a small amount of buildup over the speakers inside of your AirPods can significantly lower the volume. Try cleaning your AirPods to see if this resolves the audio issue. Apple recommends cleaning the delicate speaker mesh inside of your AirPods with a dry cotton swab, as liquids or sharp objects, like toothpicks, can damage your AirPods. [3] X Research source Gently swab away any buildup, but be careful not to push too hard on the speaker mesh. For more difficult jobs, try a soft bristle toothbrush or a high-quality electronics gel putty. Be very careful not to push the wax deeper into the speaker meshâ€”just scrape gently across the holes and around the edges until the gunk is gone. Make sure you also clean the microphone holes that are on the stem of your AirPods using the same technique above (like a soft bristle brush). Cleaning out the microphone holes can help issues with the sound cutting in and out."

This is true even if your AirPods are fully charged but your iPhone or iPad's battery life is low. To turn off lower power mode: Open the Control Center by swiping down from the top corner of the Home screen (if your iPhone has Face ID) or swiping up from the bottom of the Home screen (if your iPhone has Touch ID). If the battery icon is yellow on a white background, tap it to turn it off. If you don't see a battery icon, go to Settings > Battery and disable Low Power Mode there. [4] X Research source"

You can disable it by tapping the switch off or set a cutoff limit (100 decibels).

With your AirPods paired to any of your devices, start playing some music. Then, turn the volume all the way down to 0 with the music still playing. Next, open your Bluetooth settings and disconnect your AirPods (don't \"forget\" them, just disconnect from them) by turning off Bluetooth. Keep your AirPods in your ears. Continue playing music on your device, but keep the volume at 0. If the volume increased when you disconnected the AirPods, reduce the volume all the way back to 0 again. Finally, reconnect your AirPods to Bluetooth and then turn the volume back up."

[7] X Research source To change the EQ: Start playing any song in the Music app, then go to Settings > Music > EQ and try the different EQ settings until you find one that sounds good. The Late Night setting seems to be the loudest of the group, but you might find better results with a different setting. Despite its name, the \"Loudness\" EQ setting actually decreases the loudest sounds."

If you're using AirPods Pro or AirPods Max and switched to a different mode, such as Transparency Mode (which lets outside noises in) or disabled both modes completely, your music and phone calls may seem quieter when there's a lot of background noise. On your iPhone or iPad, swipe down from the top-right of the Home screen (if you have Face ID) or swipe up from the bottom (if you have Touch ID), press and hold the volume control, tap Noise Control , and select Noise Cancellation . [8] X Research source On a Mac, click the AirPods icon in the menu bar and select Noise Cancellation . If you're using AirPods Pro, you can also press and hold either of the Force Sensors on the stem of your AirPods until you hear a chime. Each time you do this, you switch between Noise Cancellation and Transparency Modes. If you have AirPods Max, press the noise control button on the top of the right headphone to switch between modes."

Press and hold the button on the back of the case for about 15 seconds (the lid should still be open) until the status light flashes amber and white.
