Because it's a large government agency, the USDA prioritizes large cases of food stamp fraud featuring vendor or retail fraud, although it will investigate individual acts of fraud. Retailers may be guilty of fraud if employees knowingly buy SNAP benefits for cash, or if they sell food in exchange for SNAP benefits that are ineligible for the program.
