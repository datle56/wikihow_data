[2] X Research source If you want to give the other person a positive and encouraging reply without giving them details of your life, a simple \"Me! I'm good!\" does the trick, followed by a \"thank you\" so they know you're happy to hear from them. \"I am! I appreciate you thinking of me üòä\" \"I'm pretty good, thanks! And you?\""

If you're comfortable sending the person on the other end of the phone your negative thoughts, feel free to type out a glum response.
