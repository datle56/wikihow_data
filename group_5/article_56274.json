      "content": "Imagine who you want to be and where you want to go before you start. With the Julia Method, you don’t have to write out a script with details about your Desired Reality. However, imagining the reality you want to enter, what you’ll look like, and what you’ll do and experience when you get there can help you focus your attention and enter your Desired Reality more seamlessly. [1] X Research source For example, if you want to shift your mindset to being more confident, think about how you’d look and act. You might have straighter posture, stand taller, and speak more clearly. It’s totally okay to write out a script for yourself if you want! It can be a helpful way to organize your thoughts. Simply write down what you’ll look like, where you’ll go, and who you’ll meet."

      "content": "Meditating helps you relax and get into the shifting mindset . To start meditating , find a comfortable position in a peaceful, quiet room. Some people like to practice the Julia method lying down before bed because they are already in a relaxed state. If sitting or standing is more comfortable for you, that’s okay too! Remember to breathe deeply as you meditate. Count to 4 as you inhale through your nose. Then, slowly exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds. Listening to theta waves can help you ease into a meditative state. There are tons of relaxing theta wave sound compilations on YouTube."

      "title": "Recite positive “I am” affirmations to lead you to your Desired Reality.",
      "content": "Recite positive “I am” affirmations to lead you to your Desired Reality. Chanting your affirmations, whether out loud or in your head, helps you focus on what you want to shift and change. You can say the same affirmation over and over, or cycle through a few. Just keep saying them until you feel your skin tingling or have a sensation like you’re floating. [2] X Research source For example, you might recite that you are worthy, happy, successful, healthy, and in control of your life. Specific shifting affirmations such as “I am shifting,” “I am in my Desired Reality,” and “I am feeling relaxed and calm” can also help guide you into your Desired Reality. Other symptoms that you are shifting into your reality are feeling numb, itchy, or seeing a bright light."

      "content": "Ground yourself by counting to 100. When you’re counting, stay still and take notice of your breathing. Continue to take slow, deep breaths and exhale out of your mouth. As you count, you want to feel as if you are detached or disconnected from your body. [3] X Research source If you don’t feel detached when you reach 100, start counting again. Continue to count to 100 until you feel numb or like you’re floating. If it helps you focus, you can also repeat your positive affirmations after every 10th number. If you find it more intuitive and calming to count down from 100, that’s totally okay too."

      "content": "Repeat affirmations about who you are to strengthen your new mindset. State your name and your new desired qualities. If you are shifting your mindset to be more confident, say affirmations like “I am confident,” and “I am capable.” This chanting helps you further detach from your body and prepares you for the next step. [4] X Research source If you are shifting to your dream world, repeat affirmations using your desired name, where you live, and how old you are in this world."

What features are different about you? What’s the weather like? What sounds do you hear? Can you smell anything? This will help you fully immerse yourself and transport you into your Desired Reality.

      "content": "Fully enter your Desired Reality by slowly opening your eyes. It’s totally normal to feel some doubt and hesitation about successfully making it to your Desired Reality. However, when you open your eyes, it’s possible that your surroundings will fade away and you’ll find yourself transported. [6] X Research source You can expect to stay in your Desired Reality for several minutes before you “wake up” and return to your Current Reality. As you become experienced with the Julia method, you might be able to stay in your world for 20 to 30 minutes. If you open your eyes and you aren’t in your Desired Reality, that’s okay too! It can take time and practice to perfect this method."
