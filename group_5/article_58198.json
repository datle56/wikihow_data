      "content": "Get a good night's sleep. You will do better on your test if you are well rested. If you are sleepy, you will have difficulty thinking and will be more forgetful. If you are a teenager, you need between 8-10 hours of sleep a night. [1] X Research source If you are between the ages of 6 and 13, you need 9-11 hours of sleep each night. [2] X Research source Cramming for the test the night before won't help you. It is better to relax and get a good night's sleep instead. Adjust your schedule the week of the test so you can get enough rest."

      "title": "Do something fun.",
      "content": "Do something fun. Don't spend the night before your test worrying about it. Do an activity that you enjoy and that will take your mind off of things. Spend time with your friends or family, watch a movie, play video games, or read a magazine that is not school related. You will do better on the test if you are relaxed and in a good mood."

      "title": "Pack your bag the night before.",
      "content": "Pack your bag the night before. You do not want to be in a rush the morning of your test. This can cause you to feel even more nervous and anxious. Pack your school bag the night before with everything you will need for the day. Make sure you have all necessary materials for the test, including pencils and erasers."

    {
      "title": "Eat a healthy breakfast.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy breakfast. Wake up early enough to eat a nutritious breakfast. Food is necessary to fuel your brain. If you take your test without eating, you will be more distracted and have problems concentrating. Do not experiment or try any new foods the day of your test either. [3] X Research source Good breakfast choices include fruit, whole grain-cereal, and protein rich foods (e.g. eggs, nuts, and yogurt). Stay away from processed and sugary foods such as cookies, cakes, etc. Also avoid eating a carbohydrate (e.g. bread, pancakes, etc.) heavy breakfast because it will cause you to feel sluggish and sleepy. If you do not feel like eating in the morning, try having a smoothie or a breakfast shake."

    {
      "title": "Read each question carefully.",
      "content": "Read each question carefully. Before you answer a question, read the entire question before you choose an answer. It is important to do this even if you already feel like you know the answer. Underline any words that are important or that stand out to you. If the question is difficult to understand, try to rewrite/rephrase the question so it makes sense to you. [4] X Research source Be sure to follow any written or verbal instructions you receive about the test. If you are unsure about an answer, eliminate the answers you know are wrong and choose between the other possible choices. This will increase your chances of getting the question right."

      "title": "Monitor your time.",
      "content": "Monitor your time. The STAAR test is a timed test. Wear a watch or make sure you can see the clock during your test. Your teacher will probably give you warnings about the time, but you should keep track of it as well. If you have extra time, go back and double check your answers. Be sure to leave some time at the end to answer the questions that you skipped. It is better to guess than to leave a question unanswered. For example, if you have 45 minutes to complete a section, try to finish in 40 minutes so you have time to go back."

    {
      "title": "Stick with your first answer.",
      "content": "Stick with your first answer. When you take a test, the first answer that you choose is usually the best answer. You get into trouble when you begin to second guess yourself. Do not got back and change your answer unless you are absolutely sure. [5] X Research source If you go completely blank on a question, skip it and come back to it later. You do not want to waste time thinking about one question when you could be answering the questions that you already know. Make some type of mark by the questions that you skipped. You do not want to forget to go back and answer them."

      "title": "Take a deep breath.",
      "content": "Take a deep breath. If you find yourself getting anxious during the test, stop and take a deep breath. Close your eyes and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Take a couple of breaths and then get back to your test. Practice deep breathing before you take your test so you can get in the habit of doing it. As you take a deep breath, tell yourself, \"I am in control. Everything is going to be fine.\" If you get a headache, start sweating, feel like you might pass out, get butterflies in your stomach, start sweating, or start shaking, you may be feeling anxious. These are signs that you should take a deep breath. [6] X Research source Try breathing in for 4 seconds and breathing out for 8 seconds. This helps you shift from the sympathetic nervous system to the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps calm and ground you. Do this a few times and see if this helps calm you down."

      "title": "Pause if you experience fear.",
      "content": "Pause if you experience fear. Test taking can be scary. If you experience fear or become overwhelmed during the test, stop and acknowledge it. When you pause, remind yourself about the task at hand. The task is to answer the question in front of you. If your mind goes blank or you feel like you have no idea what you are doing all of a sudden, you may also be experiencing fear. Fear is completely normal. You will not be able to eliminate fear completely, but you can manage it so it does not affect your test. Place your hand on your belly and take 3 deep breaths. As you inhale and exhale, notice how your belly gets bigger then smaller. You can also write the word \"breathe\" at the top of your test booklet to remind you take deep breaths when you begin to feel stressed out. [7] X Research source Tell yourself, \"I can do this,\" or \"Just keep going.\""

      "content": "Focus on one question at a time. It is easy to get worked up about a test. You may be thinking about what will happen if you do not pass or how many more questions you have to answer. You may still be thinking about the last question you answered. Stay in the present and answer one question at a time. If your mind begins to wander, bring it back and tell yourself, \"I will only focus on one question at a time. If you tend to have problems focusing or get nervous every time you take a test, talk to a teacher, parent, or school counselor about it. They can help you with other techniques to stay calm during the test. Tell yourself, \"I am smart. I can do this.\" [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand the test components. Become familiar with the test subjects and format of the test before your exam date. You do not want to be surprised by anything when you take the test. The test structure will vary depending on what grade you are in. [9] X Research source If you are in 3rd grade, your test will include reading and mathematics. If you are in 4th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, and writing. If you are in 5th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, and science. If you are in 6th grade, your test will include reading and mathematics . If you are in 7th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, and writing. If you are in 8th grade, your test will include reading, mathematics, science, and social studies.

      "content": "Do practice questions. Your teacher will give you practice questions at school, but you should also do some practice questions on your own. Visit the Texas Education Agency website and click on the \"Student Testing and Accountability\" section. Once you are in that section go to \"Testing,\" \"State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR),\" and then click on \"STAAR Released Test Questions.\" Find the questions that correspond to your grade level. [10] X Research source You can see the practice questions and the answers. Try to answer the questions without looking at the answers. Commit to studying for a designated amount of time. [11] X Research source For example, you may spend an hour on Tuesdays and Saturdays doing STAAR practice questions."

      "content": "Talk to your teacher about developing a study schedule. Having a regular study schedule is more effective than cramming for your test. You need to spend enough time studying for your STAAR without neglecting your other school work. [12] X Research source You may study only once a week or every other week in the beginning of the school year and then increase your study time as the test approaches. You may be studying 3 or 4 times a week as your test date gets closer. An appropriate study schedule varies by each student. If you took the STAAR test last year, pay attention to the areas that you struggled in and devote more study time to those. If you did not take the STAAR test last year, spend more time in the general subject areas that you struggle in. For example, you may spend more time studying mathematics than reading."

      "content": "Pay attention in class. Your teacher will prepare you for your STAAR test during the school year. Your curriculum will include the things that you need to know. It is important that you pay attention in class, take notes, and do your homework. Your teacher may do more intense STAAR prep in the weeks leading up to your test. This is a time that you really need to focus. If you do not understand a concept or have a question, get help from your teacher as soon as you can. If you wait until it is time for your test, it may be too late. Try to be a good student throughout the school year, not just a few weeks before the test. This will increase your chances of passing the STAAR."

A tutor can help assess your skills and teach you standardized test taking techniques. Your tutor can also develop a study plan based on your skills and how soon you need to take your exam. Some private tutoring organizations such as 'Mathnasium' (math learning center) and Sylvan Learning offer STAAR specific training. [13] X Research source [14] X Research source You can also ask your teacher or school counselor about any prep programs in your area."
