      "content": "Draw a circle with guidelines for the head. Make it as round as possible, with lines arcing horizontally and vertically that cross approximately where his nose will be."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch the body and body position using geometric shapes.",
      "content": "Sketch the body and body position using geometric shapes. Draw a vertical rectangle for the torso and a horizontal rectangle for the lower body, connected to each other and the head by a curved line (like a spine). Draw straight lines for the hands and legs, with circles for joints. Add rectangles for hands and feet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch ovals in place of the angular guidelines from step 2.",
      "content": "Sketch ovals in place of the angular guidelines from step 2. The body should actually be thinner the head, in the style of the puppet that Pinocchio is, with a vertical oval for the torso and arms that are almost as long as the legs. His feet should be fairly large ovals, and his thumbs should overlap the main portions of his hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline the body over the sketch and add in details.",
      "content": "Outline the body over the sketch and add in details. Give him a chubby, boyish face with a long nose (his trademark feature) and a curved line for his smile. His hair should tuft out in the front from under his feathered hat, and his clothing is pretty basic. Specifically, make a big bow under the head, a vest, and a blouse with long sleeves. His shorts have suspenders attached to them. Also put gloves on his hands and round shoes, only slightly altered from the ovals you drew in the previous step."

    {
      "title": "Line the drawing with black ink and fill in his hair entirely with black.",
      "content": "Line the drawing with black ink and fill in his hair entirely with black. Try to make a modular line passing from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add color as seen at the right.",
      "content": "Add color as seen at the right. Erase the pencil from your drawing and try to put in shading and highlights. Use the illustration as a reference."
