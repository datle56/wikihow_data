      "title": "Choose three bakugan capsules.",
      "content": "Choose three bakugan capsules. Look through your collection of Bakugans and pick the three you want to play with. Use your favorite ones, or look for the ones with the highest G-power rating. You’ll eventually learn to strategize which Bakugans to play with, but when you first start, it’s okay to pick whichever ones you like the most. Before you start playing, make sure all three Bakugans are closed so that they’re in their ball shape. You’ll roll them when you play, so they need to be closed. Set the three that you’re playing with in front of you and put all the other Bakugans off to the side. You aren’t allowed to switch out partway through the game."

      "title": "Select three gate cards to use in the battle.",
      "content": "Select three gate cards to use in the battle. Look at your gate cards and choose one each of Gold, Copper (sometimes called Bronze), and Silver. Gate cards have colored circles on the side, which go along with the color of your Bakugan capsules. Pick gate cards with high numbers in the circles that match the colors of your Bakugans. For example, if your chosen Bakugans include one red, one blue, and one yellow, select gate cards with high numbers in the red, blue and yellow circles. You won’t always get perfect matches, but try to find the best options. The gate cards are made of metal, so they are heavier than the ability cards."

      "title": "Pick three ability cards.",
      "content": "Pick three ability cards. There are three different colors of ability cards: red, green, and blue. Pick one of each of these to use in the game. Each type of card is used in different ways. Lay the cards facedown to your right until you are ready to play one of them. [1] X Research source Blue cards add G-power during battle. Red cards are played during a roll to impact your roll or your opponent’s roll. Green cards have many different functions."

      "content": "Get a pen and piece of paper for each person. Each time a battle occurs, you’ll be adding numbers together. It’s helpful to have a pen and paper to jot those numbers down to help you add them. It’s not absolutely necessary to write down your scores, but it is helpful."

      "title": "Lay gate cards facedown in the middle of the Bakugan arena.",
      "content": "Lay gate cards facedown in the middle of the Bakugan arena. Choose the gate card that you want to play first and lay it between you and your opponent. Lay your card closer to your opponent in the game area. They will lay theirs closer to you, as well. Keep the rest of your cards facedown in front of you, still unused. Each player sets their gate card down at the same time so the narrow sides of the cards are touching."

      "title": "Roll your Bakugan capsule toward the gate cards.",
      "content": "Roll your Bakugan capsule toward the gate cards. The youngest player rolls first. Your goal is to get your Bakugan to open up on one of the gate cards. Roll the Bakugan with just the right speed so that it stops on one of the gate cards and opens. If the Bakugan opens, leave it on the gate card. [2] X Research source If your Bakugan doesn’t land on the gate card and open, pick the Bakugan up and put it in your used pile. It does not stay in play for that round. The Bakugan counts if one of three things happens: it lands on the gate and opens; it lands on the gate but doesn’t open; it opens on the gate but slides off of the card. If it lands on the card but doesn’t open, move it around so that it opens. If it opens and slides off of the card, move it onto the card."

      "content": "Allow your opponent to roll their Bakugan. After you roll, your opponent tries to get their Bakugan onto the same gate card that you landed on. If their Bakugan opens on the same gate card as yours, you’ll battle to see who wins the gate card. If your opponent’s Bakugan lands on the gate card that is empty, play goes back to you. Roll your second Bakugan, trying to land it on the card your opponent is on."

      "content": "Battle when two Bakugans open on the same card. Flip the gate card over and follow its instructions (if there are any). Then add your Bakugan’s G-power score to the gate attribute bonus. You’ll find the gate bonus in the colored circle that matches the color of your Bakugan. [3] X Research source The gate attribute bonuses are located along the left side of the card in colored circles. Your Bakugan’s G-power score can be seen printed inside the opened Bakugan. For example, if you have a green Bakugan, find the green circle and add that number to your Bakugan’s G-power score. If your G-power score is 300 and the gate bonus is 50, your current total is 350. Some gate card instructions may not apply until the end of the battle."

      "content": "Play ability cards if you want to. Once you add the gate bonus to your Bakugan’s G-power, you have the option to play an ability card to boost your Bakugan. Play the card and follow the instructions it gives. You don't have to play an ability card during every battle, but they often decide who wins the battle. If you play an ability card and your opponent plays one, you are allowed to play another one or more cards. You rotate back and forth. If the first player doesn’t wish to play a card, but the second player plays an ability card, the first player still has the option to play an ability card. For example, play a blue ability card that allows you to add the gate bonus to your score twice. This gives you an edge over your opponent."

Follow any remaining gate card instructions. The player with the higher score wins the gate card, unless the gate card instructs otherwise.
