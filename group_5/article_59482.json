      "content": "Decide how you'll respond once you've thought about all possibilities. The word \"narcissistic\" is tossed around a lot, but it's not always used correctly. [1] X Research source There are a lot of reasons someone might call you that, and each one requires a different kind of response. In some cases, an accusation like that isn't genuine or cause for worry, while in others, it might be something you need to carefully consider. Someone might call you \"narcissistic\" in the heat of the moment but not really mean it. The person who called you narcissistic might really be upset and think you're acting selfishly. However, that doesn't automatically make you a real narcissist (AKA, somebody with narcissistic personality disorder). Someone could be using that word because it's become so normalized that most things seem selfish to them. [2] X Research source The person could even have traits of a narcissist. Gaslighting is common among narcissists, and they might be trying to turn the tables on you by saying you're \"selfish\" or \"only thinking about you.\" If your therapist or psychologist says you're a narcissist, then it's something to be taken seriously—and to discuss further with them."

      "content": "Unless a psychologist agrees, being called narcissistic is no guarantee. However, the general term \"narcissism\" and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are two very different things. NPD is a medical disorder, and people who have it are manipulative and selfish, with an inflated sense of self-importance. NPD also refers to people who act that way consistently; if you don't, you probably don't have it. [3] X Research source If you had one moment of poor behavior that led to someone calling you \"narcissistic,\" it doesn't mean you have NPD. Everyone makes mistakes! \"Narcissistic\" is often a subjective label, especially with the rise of social media. People become concerned with their online image in a way that can be interpreted as narcissism—but most cases aren't actual NPD. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Take the high road and don't overreact to the accusation.",
      "content": "Take the high road and don't overreact to the accusation. Instead of fighting back or accusing this person of being narcissistic themselves, take a deep breath and walk away if you need to. It's important to stay calm so that you can better control your behavior and more clearly understand the other person's words and actions too. [5] X Research source It's tempting to fight back, but getting angry, calling names, or being childish will only keep the conflict going. If your goal is to resolve the issue, calm is the way to go."

      "content": "In most cases, someone calling you narcissistic doesn't really mean it. Often, a person will use the word to make a quick emotional jab at someone before the moment passes. If they do mean it, you can easily address that in a respectful, non-confrontational way. Regardless, being called narcissistic is usually a short-lived issue that you can fix with careful conversation and effort. When you take everything personally, you're more likely to be defensive and resentful around this person. Empathize with their feelings instead, and then sort out your own feelings once you're alone.

      "content": "Own up to your mistakes and show them you're not narcissistic. If it's clear that you acted selfishly without considering someone else's needs, give them a genuine and thorough apology. The best apologies include acknowledging what you did wrong, how it made the other person feel, and what you plan to change to do better in the future. [7] X Research source For example: \"I'm so sorry that I was selfish about the time we were spending together. I know that my behavior made you feel stifled, and I don't want that. I got jealous and let that control my actions, but I plan to control my actions in the future. If you don't already have a plan, ask the other person how you can make amends. They will tell you what they need to move forward. True narcissists with NPD rarely apologize and mean those apologies even less. [8] X Research source [9] X Expert Source Jay Reid, LPCC Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. By apologizing earnestly, you're already showing this person that you're not narcissistic."

If you ignore someone calling you a narcissist, then you're refusing to add fuel to the fire and start a bigger conflict with them.

When someone with narcissistic tendencies calls you out for it instead of acknowledging their own shortcomings, be non-committal and don't take the bait. Other common warning signs of NPD include: a need for constant praise, living in a fantasy world, delusions of grandeur, entitlement, exploiting others shamelessly, and bullying others.
