      "title": "Early puberty is technically known as gonadotropin-dependent or central precocious puberty.",
      "content": "Early puberty is technically known as gonadotropin-dependent or central precocious puberty. Puberty begins when the body releases hormones called gonadotropins. Gonadotropins include luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulation hormone (FSH). If the hypothalamus signals to the pituitary gland to start releasing these hormones early, puberty begins early. This is more common for females than males. [3] X Research source A less common reason for puberty to begin is the release of sex hormones. This is called gonadotropin-independent or peripheral precocious puberty. A healthcare provider can run blood tests to measure your child's hormones and determine which type of early puberty they're dealing with.
