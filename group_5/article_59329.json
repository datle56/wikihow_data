      "content": "“Reply guys” are men who leave unwanted comments on women’s social media posts. “Reply guy” is an internet slang term for someone whose comments are often condescending, annoying, occasionally inappropriate, and always unsolicited. “Reply guys” can be any gender, but the term is most strongly associated with men replying to women’s posts. In some cases, their responses are angry, and they believe the poster is obligated to respond. [1] X Research source “Reply guys” often show up in the replies to tweets made by women with a large number of followers. Journalist Amanda Marcotte was quoted in a Raw Story article as saying that “reply guys” would email female journalists before Twitter existed. [2] X Research source “Reply guys” are sometimes seen responding to men’s social media posts. There is such a thing as “reply girls,” but they don’t post direct responses. “Reply girls” are female YouTubers who post videos responding to popular or trending videos. Their thumbnails often have sexually suggestive images or text. [3] X Research source"

Originally, “reply guys” was a mildly derogatory term for people who constantly replied to celebrities who were active on social media, specifically Donald Trump.

      "title": "They insert themselves into conversations or threads.",
      "content": "They insert themselves into conversations or threads. “Reply guys” always comment even when their input is unnecessary or unrelated to the topic. They may make multiple responses to the original post and other comments. They do this to prolong the conversation and gain recognition. They may even tag the original poster on every one of their comments because they want more attention, validation, and engagement with her. They may continue to respond with advice, explanations, and contrarian comments even after it’s clear that they have nothing interesting to offer."

      "title": "They make flirty and overly familiar comments.",
      "content": "They make flirty and overly familiar comments. In some cases, the comments are overtly sexual, but they can be any compliment that has nothing to do with the original post. Some compliments are overly flowery, such as, “That color brings a rosy bloom to your cheeks, m’lady.” A man replied to a tweet from Kamala Harris about conditions in a Brooklyn criminal detention center with, “I almost hate to bring this up - Kamala - I truly believe in and entirely endorse you and, oddly enough, kinda have a crush on you. (I just couldn’t help myself; watching you perform a metaphoric ‘castration’ on that useless sot, Kavanaughty, prompted a very visceral reaction…” When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about flipping red districts to blue, a man replied with, “Ms Ocasio you may be very sexy but you are a Dudebro and so I can never vote for you!”"

      "title": "Their comments are often sexist.",
      "content": "Their comments are often sexist. Many of the replies to women’s social media posts contain “benevolent” sexism. This type of sexism is less aggressive and often flies under the radar because it has a veneer of kindness. The “reply guy” acts as a protector and, most of all, a teacher who is there to show the female poster how the world really works. He may genuinely feel the need to care for women because he believes they are weaker and in need of protection. [5] X Research source Most “reply guys” fall under this label, but some can show a more hostile form of sexism with abusive or threatening comments. While benevolent sexism may seem less harmful because it seems to idealize and flatter women who fit into traditional gender roles. Benevolent sexism can seem more acceptable because it makes the benevolent sexist seem more caring, even when he has views that align with more hostile sexism, but it’s just as dangerous as overt misogyny.

From Twitter: A woman in STEM posts about women’s research being overlooked. A Tone Police reply guy commented , “Could the citation gap be a result of the fact that there are fewer women in top level lab head roles? I’d find it odd if people were selecting references based on sex. Also, some may see the use of “dude” as condescending and therefore there is a risk of reduction of reach.”"
