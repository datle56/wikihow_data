      "title": "If you argue with him, hot-tempered Aries will just get mad too.",
      "content": "If you argue with him, hot-tempered Aries will just get mad too. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet of aggression and assertion. When you pick a fight or demand an apology, your Aries ex will be defensive. Instead, do your best to come to terms with your breakup. Talk it through with trusted friends and allow yourself to be sad without blaming anyone for what happened. Your maturity and cool acceptance will make Aries second-guess the breakup. To move on, allow yourself time to grieve for the relationship, get your emotions out, and rely on a support system of friends and family. Get rid of clothes and other keepsakes that remind you of him, as they may make moving on more challenging. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Aries might see it as a sign of desperation if you chase after him.",
      "content": "Aries might see it as a sign of desperation if you chase after him. In his mind, desperation is weakness, and he's attracted to strength. Hold off on contacting him directly for at least a couple of weeks after you break up. Aries is quick to forgive and forget and hates being alone. He's likely to get over any hard feelings about the breakup quickly, and after that, he'll regret distancing himself from you. Try the no-contact rule , which encourages you to cut off contact for 30 days. This gives your Aries enough time to get over any initial anger that he had about the breakup and start feeling wistful instead. If you want to reconnect with your Aries, send him a friendly \"how are you?\" text after the no-contact period ends. From there, ask him to meet up with you in person to build your friendship or rekindle the romance."

      "content": "Keep him in the dark about your life, so he'll wish he knew more. Once you're texting him again, hint at what you're up to but be vague with details. Aries loves a challenge, and if you're distant around him, it'll bring out his competitive spirit. He'll want to know the details of your life again and regret being so out of touch with you. For instance, you could say, \"I've been getting into some pretty cool creative projects lately. What about you?\" without telling him exactly what you've been working on. You could also try, \"Remind me to tell you more about my trip last month! I have so many stories, but I'll have to save them for another day.\" If you want to get your Aries man back, it's essential to let him take the lead. Be available to him‚Äîand a little mysterious to keep him interested‚Äîbut let him set the pace."
