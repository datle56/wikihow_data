[2] X Research source You will want to look at the port on the controller and line it up so you insert the cable correctly. You'll notice that the port on the controller is square and the cable plug-in is more like a rhombus, with slanted edges. Look inside the cable's plug-in shape for an idea of how to insert it into the port on the controller so it fits correctly. [3] X Research source Continuously inserting the plug into the port the wrong way will loosen the tongue inside the port and cause damage. You can mark the top of the cable with nail polish so you can easily recognize which way to insert the plug-in. You can also purchase a reversible USB cable and you shouldn't have any issues with plugging-in and charging your controller."
