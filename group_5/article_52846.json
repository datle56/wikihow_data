To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on."

This is called \"Tie-ing off the end\". Once the yarn is tied off, sew or \"weave\" in the ends. Some patterns use the word \"weave\". To sew or weave in the ends, use a Yarn Needle. Fold the yarn end over the Yarn Needle forming a small tight loop. Slide the yarn needle out of the loop, then insert this tight loop into the eye of the Yarn Needle. Push it through far enough that you can grasp the loop and pull the yarn all the way through the eye. Gently weave the needle tip under and over stitches on the back of your work where it will not show. Do this for a distance of 7 to 8 stitches. Now turn around and alternate. Go over the stitches you previously went under and visa-versa. Now turn it around and do it a third time, this will make the \"tail\" or \"yarn-end\" stay put for many years. Remember to sew in both \"tails\" on the outside edge and in the very center."
