      "content": "Dial Thailand’s exit code “001.” To make an international call, you must dial your country’s specific exit code. The exit code will direct your call out of Thailand. In this case, to exit a call out of Thailand, your number will begin with “001.” [1] X Research source These codes may also be called International Direct Dialing or International Subscriber Dialing codes. If you are making an international call from a mobile phone to another mobile phone, the exit code can often be replaced with the + (plus) sign. You will enter the + (plus) sign directly before entering the country code. [2] X Research source To find out if you should use the + (plus) sign rather than Thailand’s exit code, talk to your mobile provider. You may acquire additional long-distance charges when making international calls from a cell phone or landline."

For example, if you are calling Denver, CO, which has two area codes, “303” and” “720,” misdialing one number can direct you to parts of Ohio with a “330” area code or areas of Maine that use a “207” area code. For example, if you are trying to reach Denver, CO, your dial, so far, should read “001-1-303.”"
