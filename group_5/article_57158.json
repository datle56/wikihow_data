      "content": "Brainstorm ideas of what word you want to shine in neon. This can also be a phrase, easiest if made up of only two to three words. It is also possible to make designs or symbols with this technique. Use your creativity to imagine what you want the sign to look like"

      "title": "Draw the word, or outline a design with pencil on a piece of paper.",
      "content": "Draw the word, or outline a design with pencil on a piece of paper. Draw it as if you are unable to pick up your pencil, since to make the design the whole thing needs to be connected. If writing a word, use cursive. If making an image, try to draw something simple enough to look clear as an outline."

    {
      "title": "Using the string, trace around the letters or the design.",
      "content": "Using the string, trace around the letters or the design. Cut the string when done and measure its length to determine how much wire you will need. If the string measures longer than the amount of wire you have, make the letters smaller or use a shorter phrase."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend the metal wire in the shape of your letters.",
      "content": "Bend the metal wire in the shape of your letters. Use pliers to shape sections that are harder to bend/need to be sharper such as cursive \"i\" or the stem of an \"n\". Tip: Have another person hold down the initial sections of the wire as you move further along, to keep its shape."

      "title": "Using your EL wire and a hot glue gun, glue the EL wire to the metal wire.",
      "content": "Using your EL wire and a hot glue gun, glue the EL wire to the metal wire. Do this section by section. Work slowly and hold the EL wire down to the metal wire for 5-10 seconds to make sure that it is set in place."

At the end of the first letter, when the wire will go back behind the board, use red pen. Think about how the wire will need to enter and exit the board to create the words."
