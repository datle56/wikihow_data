      "content": "Research different scrolls. Researching different types of scrolls will help you decide how you want your scroll to look. Scrolls were used for centuries in countries like China, Egypt, and Greece. Look at different scrolls online and see if any inspire you! [2] X Research source Decide whether you want your scroll to look modern or ancient. If you choose to go for an ancient look, consider ageing your paper. Your scroll doesn’t have to look like the ones you see online! You can make a completely unique scroll, or combine features you like from many different scrolls. Select your paper. Pick the paper you want to use for your scroll. You can use colorful construction paper, drawing paper, or plain printer paper. All of these can be aged later by soaking them in tea or coffee. Brown paper bags work if you want your paper to look aged, but don’t want to go through the process of staining it yourself. Just cut a rectangle out of the bag. [3] X Research source You can tape multiple pieces of paper together to make an extra-long scroll, if you want. Feel free to mix and match different colors, but make sure each piece of paper is the same size. [4] X Research source If you’re feeling really fancy, try using papyrus like the ancient Egyptians did! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide what to write. Scrolls were traditionally used as decorations, or to document information and tell stories. [6] X Research source Think about what you want to write or draw on your scroll. You can do both if you want! If you want to make an Egyptian inspired scroll, consider including some hieroglyphics, the ancient Egyptian form of writing. [7] X Research source You can also draw a treasure map, or write a story about one of your favorite experiences. Get creative! If you want to include typed text on your scroll, print it onto your paper now. You won’t be able to do it after you age your paper."

      "title": "Crumple your paper.",
      "content": "Crumple your paper. Crumpling your paper makes it look wrinkled and aged. Spray your paper with a little water and crumple it into a ball. Then, smooth it out again. Crumple it a few more times for a more wrinkled appearance. [8] X Research source You can iron your paper very lightly if you want it extra flat. Stop here if you like the way it looks! If you want to stain your paper to make it look even older, keep going. If you are using a brown paper bag, you don’t need to stain it."

      "title": "Brew coffee or tea.",
      "content": "Brew coffee or tea. You can age your paper by soaking it in either coffee or tea. Pick whichever one is most convenient for you, and brew enough to cover the sheet you want to age. If you are younger, ask a parent for help. [9] X Research source You can brew coffee in a coffee machine, or use instant coffee. The darker the coffee, the better. [10] X Research source To brew a strong cup of tea, soak at least three tea bags in a cup of hot water. [11] X Research source Be sure to brew extra if you are aging multiple sheets."

      "content": "Apply the mixture. Place the paper in a large pan, and apply the coffee or tea to using a method of your choice. You can dab it on with a sponge, paint it on with a paint brush, or dip your paper in the mixture until your achieve your desired color. Make sure the coffee or tea is not too hot. [12] X Research source Try using your teabag as an applicator. Wipe the wet teabag all over paper, squeezing as you go until you achieve the color you want. The paper will look a little darker when it’s dry, so stop applying the coffee or tea when it’s a couple shades lighter than you want it. [13] X Research source Add grains of instant coffee or flecks of tea to your paper for extra texture."

[14] X Research source If your paper turns out too light, repeat the staining process until you achieve the shade you want. Weigh the dried paper down with a book or other heavy object if you want it flatter. [15] X Research source"

You can burn the edges by lighting a match over a safe, non-flammable surface and waving it back and forth over the edges. Continue until you achieve the desired look, shaking and brushing away burnt edges. Alternatively, you can rip the edges with your fingers. [16] X Research source Practice distressing the edges on a few scrap sheets of paper before attempting on your scroll paper. You don’t want to tear or burn away too much of the edges! You can also burn the edges using lemon or lime juice and a heat gun. Apply a little juice to the edges of the paper, then heat with the heat gun until you get the desired effect.

Feel free to use crayons or colored pencils if you want your scroll to be colorful! [18] X Research source Be careful when using paints or heavy markers, especially if you are using a paper bag. These can bleed through more delicate papers. Allow the ink to dry completely before moving on to the next step. After all, you don’t want to smear your writing or drawings!"

      "content": "Select dowels, if you like. Dowels are the sticks you sometimes see at the end of scrolls that make them easier to roll and unroll. You can purchase craft sticks from your local craft store to make your dowels. Cut them to the width of your paper. You will need two dowels, one for each end. Alternatively, you can use chopsticks. Decorate the ends of your dowels using ribbon or dowel caps, which can be purchased at your local craft store. Secure your decorations with hot glue."
