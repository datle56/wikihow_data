Use the star-shaped end to unscrew the 2 security screws on the bottom of the doorbell. Turn the screws counterclockwise with the screwdriver to remove them. Home Improvement Specialist Gino Colucci says to “use a T6 torx head screwdriver if you misplaced the original screwdriver that came with the device.” Alternatively, use any small, star-shaped screwdriver if you don’t have the original screwdriver."
