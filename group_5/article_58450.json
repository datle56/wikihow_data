  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Use his passive.",
      "content": "Use his passive. His passive is named Dagger Specialist, and if you use your skills multiple times, a rune will add to his basic attack. [1] X Research source After 3 uses of any skill, his next basic attack will deal an increased amount of physical damage, and with how much the enemy has lost HP. You can also heal with this skill (80% of damage given). This passive is recommended when soloing and when you are chasing squishy heroes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try his 1st skill (Sword Spike).",
      "content": "Try his 1st skill (Sword Spike). This skill will launch a single dagger but will mark an enemy. Gusion can then blink at the enemy and attack. [2] X Research source Use this to begin your killing-spree without having the enemy notice! If you manage to use both versions on the enemy, you will give 650 magic damage to the enemy, so take this as a bonus."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do his 2nd skill (Shadowblade Slaughter).",
      "content": "Do his 2nd skill (Shadowblade Slaughter). This skill will let Gusion throw 5 daggers in one direction while dealing with damage. The enemy can also get hit if Gusion decides to recall them altogether. [3] X Research source This should be used as your main skill in case your ultimate isn't ready. You might have to add this alongside his 1st skill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attempt his ultimate (Incandescence).",
      "content": "Attempt his ultimate (Incandescence). Using his ult will let Gusion blink in a direction immediately, and reset the cooldown of his first two skills. [4] X Research source Reusing his skill after this can let him blink in another direction as well. This should be used as your team-fight skill, as adding the damage of all of these skills can give enemies up to 5,000+ magic damage, and potentially more if you add his equipment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the equipment.",
      "content": "Add the equipment. While you might think Gusion can jungle because his main role is an Assassin, not all assassins require getting the purple buff multiple times! Instead, think of equipment that deals with high magic damage (Holy Crystal, Concentrated Energy), along with Fleeting Time to lower his high cooldown to the ultimate, and add in Rapid Boots, Starlium Scythe, and Glowing Wand to add in the finishing touches. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Know his emblems.",
      "content": "Know his emblems. For his emblems, you can juggle between the Mage and the Assassin emblems. For the Assassin emblem, use Rupture (gain Adaptive Penetration), and Weapon Master (equipment increases his damage). For the last talent, you can use Lethal Injection (dealing damage to enemies heroes scorches enemies) or Killing Spree (killing a hero recovers HP/Movement Speed). If you want to use the Mage emblem, select Rupture (or if you want reduced cooldown on skills, select Inspire), Bargain Hunter (reduce the cost of buying equipment), and Lethal Injection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try his combos.",
      "content": "Try his combos. There are three combos that you can use for Gusion. First, try using a combo that can kill squishy heroes, by using his 2nd skill, followed by his 3rd, 2nd (again), his 1st skill twice, and his 2nd skill. You can also use the combo to escape the battle quickly to regain HP, which is his 1st skill twice, his 2nd skill, his basic attack, and his 2nd skill. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Chase squishy heroes for kills.",
      "content": "Chase squishy heroes for kills. As said before, using his passive and his 1st skill can make him a perfect storm for Mages/ADCs as adding his 2nd and ult skill can increase his damage multiple times. Always gank (and time it) and kill the enemies off!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice.",
      "content": "Practice. If you manage to get his hero-trial card (or see that he is a free hero for the week/the Starlight membership), you might have to use it to practice his skills. As Gusion can be hard to master, you can practice the timing of his 1st skill and his combos."
