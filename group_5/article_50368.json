      "title": "Do not over-beat your eggs.",
      "content": "Do not over-beat your eggs. This will add too much air to the cookies. With high altitude baking, the low air pressure causes the air bubbles to expand faster. The cookies will rise quickly and then collapse, making them dry and brittle. [1] X Research source If your cookie recipe calls for egg whites, only beat them to a soft-peak."

      "content": "Reduce the amount of sugar you use in your recipe by 1 to 3 tbsp. (12 to 36 g) for each cup (191.6g) used. Reduce the sugar by 1 tbsp. (12 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 2 tbsp. (24 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and 3 tbsp.(36 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m). [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Reduce the amount of baking powder or baking soda you use by 1/8 tsp. (0.47 g) to 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g). Reduce baking powder by 1/8 tsp. (0.47 g) at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. (0.47 to 0.94 g) at 5,000 feet (1,524 m) and a full 1/4 tsp. (0.94 g) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m). Metric reductions for baking soda are 0.54 to 1.07 g. [3] X Research source"

Increase it a further 1 to 2 tbsp. (14.8 to 29.6 ml) at 7,000 feet (2,133.6 m). [4] X Research source If you are cooking at 3,000 feet (914.4 m), it is not necessary to increase the liquid unless your recipe calls for a large amount of flour."

This step will also save the cookies from being too dry because they aren't under the hot element for very long. [5] X Research source"
