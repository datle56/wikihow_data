      "content": "Cut out two cardboard circles. Cut out two cardboard circles and then cut out a wedge and a small hole in the middle of each circle so that your disks look like they have keyholes. Remember, the bigger the circles, the bigger your pom pom will be (and vice versa). [1] X Research source You can cut out a circle freehand or you can use a bowl or glass as a guide to trace the area you want to cut and then cut out the circle."

      "content": "Place a piece of yarn between the two cardboard circles. Place a piece of yarn so that it is going around the keyhole and then place the other cardboard disk over the yarn. Arrange the circles together so that the keyholes are lined up. [2] X Research source This piece of yarn will serve to secure your pom pom later on. Make sure the piece is long enough so that the ends hang out on either side of the keyhole. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wind the circles with yarn.",
      "content": "Wind the circles with yarn. Insert the yarn through the wedge and into the center of the circle. Then, begin wrapping the yarn around and around the circle. Wrap the yarn around the circle about 100 times or until the yarn is as thick as you want it to be. [4] X Research source The thicker your yarn is, the denser your pom pom will be."

      "title": "Cut the yarn.",
      "content": "Cut the yarn. Put the scissors in between the two circles of cardboard and cut open the wound thread or yarn around the outer edge. Go slowly and cut evenly. [5] X Research source As you cut the yarn, hold onto the ends of the extra piece of yarn that you placed between the cardboard circles. This yarn is what will secure the pom pom."

      "content": "Trim the pom pom. Trim around the outside of the pom pom to even out the threads. Keep trimming until you are happy with the look of your pom pom. Trimming will make the pom pom fluffy, dense, and round. [8] X Research source Make sure that you do not trim the ends of the yarn that you used to secure the pom pom unless you do not need them."

This is when you fold the piece over in one direction first and then in the opposite direction after that. Keep folding in this alternating way until you reach the end of the stack. [11] X Research source If you want to make a small pom pom, then cut the strip in half after you do the accordion folds. This will give you two shorter strips that you can use to make pom poms.
