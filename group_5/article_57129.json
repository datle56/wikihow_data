      "content": "Obtain your beads . Traditionally, worry beads have an odd number of beads, usually one more than a multiple of four, 5, 9, 13, etc. Additionally, you will need one \"shield\" bead, usually somewhat larger than the others. Natural materials such as stone, amber, and wood are considered more pleasant to handle, but you may use any type of bead you like."
