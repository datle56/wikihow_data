      "content": "Choose the right tree. The health of the tree you select is absolutely crucial for building a foundation for your treehouse. If the tree is too old or too young, you won't have the support you need for your treehouse and you will be putting yourself and anyone else who goes into the treehouse in great danger. Your tree should be sturdy, healthy, mature, and living. Ideal trees for treehouse include oak, maple, fir, and apple. It's a good idea to have an arborist inspect your tree before you start building. An ideal tree has the following qualities: [1] X Research source A strong, sturdy trunk and branches. Roots that are deep and well-established! No evidence of disease or parasites that could weaken the tree."

If your treehouse will be visible from or overlook a neighbor's property, they will be glad you're taking their opinion into consideration. This simple step can head off future complaints and even potential lawsuits. Though your neighbors will most likely comply, this will help make them more amenable to your project."

      "title": "Choose your tree.",
      "content": "Choose your tree. If you're building a treehouse in your backyard, then you may only have so many trees to choose from. Once you have chosen a healthy tree, you can start thinking about the design of the house that can go on it; or you can take the opposite route and think of the design first, and then make sure that you have a fitting tree. Here are some things you keep in mind as you choose the tree for your treehouse: For a standard 8'x8' treehouse, choose a tree with a trunk at least 12\" in diameter. To calculate your tree's diameter , measure its circumference by wrapping a string or measuring tape around the trunk at the point where you want the treehouse to sit. Divide that number by pi (3.14) to get the diameter."

You can find treehouse designs online, [3] X Research source or if you're knowledgeable about building, you can create your own. You need to make accurate measurements to ensure that your design works with the tree you've selected. You may find it helpful to make a small cardboard model of your tree and treehouse to identify any potential issue areas. In creating your design, don't forget to plan for tree growth. Allow ample space around the trunk of the tree for the tree to grow. It's worth doing some research on your specific tree species to determine its growth rate."

      "content": "Decide on your support method. There are several ways to support your treehouse. Whatever method you choose, it's important to remember that trees move with the wind. Sliding joists or brackets are essential to make sure your tree and treehouse are not damaged by winds. Here are the three main support methods for your tree: [4] X Research source The post method. This method involves sinking support posts into the ground close to the tree, rather than attaching anything to the tree itself. It is the least damaging to the tree. The bolt method. Bolting the support beams or floor platform directly into the tree is the most traditional method of supporting a treehouse. However, this method is the most damaging to the tree. You can minimize the damage by using proper materials. The suspension method. In this method, you would suspend the treehouse from strong, high branches using cables, rope or chains. This method will not work for every design, and it is not ideal for treehouses that are meant to carry any significant weight."

      "content": "Decide on your access method. Before you build your treehouse, you'll need to decide on a method of access, such as a ladder, which easily allows a person to enter the treehouse. Your method should be safe and sturdy, so this rules out the traditional treehouse ladder, which is made up of boards nailed to a tree trunk. Here are some safer methods of access for a treehouse: The standard ladder. You can purchase or build an ordinary ladder for climbing into your treehouse. A ladder made for bunk or loft beds can work as well. The rope ladder . This is a ladder made of rope and short boards, which is hung from the treehouse platform. The staircase. A small staircase is the safest access method if it's compatible with your vision of a treehouse. If you choose this method, make sure to build a railing for safety."

Will you cut them off, or incorporate them into the plans of the treehouse? If you decide to incorporate branches into the treehouse, will you build around them or frame them in a window? Ask yourself these questions before you start building. That way, your treehouse will reflect the care and preparation of its builder when finished."

[5] X Research source Falling out is one of the biggest hazards of a treehouse. There are a few precautions you can take to make sure that everyone who is building the treehouse stays safe. Don't build too high. Building your treehouse too high could be dangerous. If your treehouse is going to be used mostly by children, the platform should not be any higher than 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m). Construct a safe railing. The point of your railing, of course, is to make sure that the treehouse occupants don't fall out. Make sure the railing around your platform is at least 36\" high, with balusters no more than 4\" apart. Cushion a fall. Surround the area below the treehouse with a soft natural material like wood mulch. This won't entirely prevent injury, but it will provide some cushioning for a fall."

      "content": "Create a 4\" slot at each mark on both 2x10s. This is so that the trees can sway in the wind and move without damaging the structural integrity of the treehouse. Do this by drilling two 5/8\" holes, each 2\" to either side of your mark. Then use a jigsaw to cut between the holes, creating a 4\" slot, with your mark completely centered. Now when the tree sways in the wind, the platform actually moves a bit to accommodate the swaying. If the platform were simply bolted onto the tree, it would move along with the tree. This is not good for the platform, as it could gradually or suddenly be pushed in different directions and begin cracking."

Drive four 6\" or 8\" long, 5/8\" diameter galvanized lag screws into the four 4\" slots of the 2x10 using a wrench. Place washers in between the screw and the wood board. Repeat with the other board on the opposite side of the trunk, making sure both boards are at equal height and flush with one another. Pre-drill both the tree and the 2x10s for an easier time installing the screws, and to minimize cracking in your boards. Undercut both supports at each for an aesthetic finish. Of course, do this before mounting the supports to the trunk with your screws. Consider doubling up each support with another 2x10 for added strength. In effect use two 2x10s on each side of the trunk, flush against one another. This allows the supports to bear more weight. If you do decide to double up on your supports, use bigger lag screws (at least 8\" long and 1\" diameter)."

This is so that you can attach the 2x4 to the inside of the platform. Form a \"V\" with your 2x4 so that they overlap at a straight part of the tree but also cleanly abut onto the inside of the platform. Attach the top of the bracing to the platform from the bottom and on the inside. Make sure both are completely flush before you drive nails into them. Drive an 8\" lag screw through the overlapping 2x4s at a sturdy point on the tree. Use a washer between the 2x4s and the lag screw for the best results."
