      "content": "Search online for classes in your area. Do a search online and look for gyms, dojos, and clubs that offer fighting or martial arts classes in your area. See if you can find general MMA classes that have both striking and grappling included in their curriculum. If a hybrid gym doesn't exist, you may have to go to more than one gym to build both your grappling and striking skills. [1] X Research source If you don't live in a major city there may not be classes for the particular styles that you want to learn. Stay flexible. Sites like FindMMAGyms and Fight Resource have an archive of MMA gyms across the U.S.A.

You should wear a regular T-shirt and gym shorts to most first classes, but make sure to ask the trainer to see if there's anything specific you need to wear. Other fighting gear includes gloves, hand wraps, shin guards and headgear. [2] X Research source If you don't have any gear, ask if they have equipment that you can borrow."

You might be tempted to go full intensity as soon as you hit the mat or ring, but this will just make you exhausted and unable to train further. Remember to breathe deeply and try to execute the moves and work on your technique rather than exhausting all of your energy. [5] X Research source"

Don't expect to be amazing at fighting if you've had no training. It will most likely take you a lot of hours and work training before you can compete in your gym.

      "content": "Spar with your classmates. Sparring is the portion of your training when you get to test your technique on a fellow classmate. Don't be scared to exchange punches and kicks with your classmate. When sparring, go in with an end goal in mind, like scoring a flush roundhouse kick or working to improve your distance making with your jab. [10] X Research source Work on perfecting the basics on a moving target, and remember to pace yourself. The goal of sparring is to perfect your technique, not to hurt your opponent. It's good manners to shake your opponent's hand before and after sparring. Sparring partners will often try to match your intensity, so expect to get what you give."
