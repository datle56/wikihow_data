      "title": "Shift positions to take pressure off of strained ligaments.",
      "content": "Shift positions to take pressure off of strained ligaments. If your body stays in one position for too long, the weight of the baby may start to put uncomfortable pressure on the round ligaments. The easiest way to put a stop to the pain is to shift your body's position. Moving yourself to a new position should relieve the strained ligaments by redistributing the weight of the baby. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you feel pain while sleeping on your back, roll over and sleep on 1 side or the other. Or, if you’re lounging on a sofa and feel round ligament pain, seat yourself in a different position."

      "title": "Elevate your feet to take pressure off of your round ligaments.",
      "content": "Elevate your feet to take pressure off of your round ligaments. After spending hours on your feet, the weight of the growing baby will weigh on your round ligaments and stretch them downward. Take a seat to give the ligaments a rest. Elevating your feet by about 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) will further ease the ligaments and help the pain fade away. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source So, if you’ve been on your feet all day and are experiencing round ligament pain, put your feet up and sit down for 5–10 minutes."

      "title": "Slow down your movements so the ligaments have time to adjust.",
      "content": "Slow down your movements so the ligaments have time to adjust. If you’re moving around at work, doing chores around the house, or busy with any physical task, you may inadvertently be placing excessive strain on your round ligaments. If you don’t have time to sit down and take a break, focus on moving your body more slowly. This will allow ligaments to move and stretch painlessly, rather than being abruptly stretched. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you feel ligament pain while you’re doing yoga, slow down your movements until you’re moving at half your normal speed."

      "title": "Rest as often as you can.",
      "content": "Rest as often as you can. Round ligament pain gets worse when you’re exerting yourself, so take frequent rest breaks throughout the day if you can. [5] X Research source It’s especially important to rest frequently if you’re doing any strenuous activity, like household chores, exercise, or manual labor. Getting enough rest can also combat other pregnancy symptoms, like fatigue."

      "title": "Flex the muscles in your hips before you sneeze.",
      "content": "Flex the muscles in your hips before you sneeze. Women who experience round ligament pain often feel it acutely when they sneeze. The physical act of sneezing can strain your round ligaments, and the weight of a baby only worsens the strain. Flexing your hips when you feel a sneeze coming on should hold the ligaments steady and prevent them from being painfully stretched. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you experience hip pain from stretched ligaments in general, spend 5–10 minutes stretching your hips and lower back each morning or evening."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about using an over-the-counter pain reliever.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about using an over-the-counter pain reliever. If you can’t get relief from resting or shifting your position, ask your doctor if you can take a mild pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Don’t take any medications during pregnancy without consulting your doctor first. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not take aspirin or NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) while you are pregnant, since these may cause complications for you or your baby.

      "content": "Strap a belly band around your stomach to hold some of its weight. A belly band is a 4–5 in (10–13 cm) wide loop of elastic fabric. You can wrap the band around your stomach to lift up some of the baby’s weight, and the bands also help with ligament pain by taking weight off the round ligaments. Place the band low around your lower belly to hold its weight. [9] X Research source Purchase a belly band (also called a belly belt) at any department store or store that specializes in maternity wear."

      "title": "Apply a hot compress to your lower abdomen.",
      "content": "Apply a hot compress to your lower abdomen. Applying heat directly to the location where your strained ligaments feel painful is an effective way to reduce your discomfort. Hold a hot compress or heating pad against your skin (or beneath your shirt) for 10–15 minutes or until the pain subsides. [10] X Research source Purchase a hot water bottle or a heating blanket at any local drugstore or pharmacy. It may also help to lay in a hot bath for 20–30 minutes. The heat will relax your ligaments, and soaking in water will allow your body to relax. Avoid soaking in hot tubs or baths that are hot enough to raise your core body temperature above 102 °F (39 °C). Raising your body temperature too much can be harmful during pregnancy.

      "content": "Massage the affected area gently. Lie down and gently rub your abdomen, focusing on the areas where you feel the most pain. Massage can be even more effective if you combine it with heat. [12] X Research source You could massage yourself, ask your partner to do it, or visit a massage therapist who has experience doing prenatal massage."

      "title": "Schedule an appointment if ligament pain lasts longer than 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Schedule an appointment if ligament pain lasts longer than 5 minutes. If you often have bouts of round ligament that last for 10, 15, or even 20 minutes at a time, it’s worth letting your doctor know. [13] X Research source Make an appointment and describe the severity of the round ligament pain to your doctor. Also mention the duration of time that the pain typically lasts for. Your doctor may prescribe a pain medication to help with the discomfort. Or, they may refer you to a physical therapist so that you can learn a few stretches to take the strain off of your round ligaments."

      "content": "Contact your doctor if flu-like symptoms accompany ligament pain. While occasional round ligament pain is normal during pregnancy, it’s not normal for the pain to be accompanied by a fever or chills. If you experience either of these during a bout of ligament pain, visit your healthcare provider. Also visit your doctor if the round ligament pain becomes extreme. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you experience severe ligament pain at night or over the weekend, you may need to visit the emergency room."

      "content": "Visit an urgent care clinic if vaginal discharge or blood accompany the pain. In some cases, abdominal pain may be caused by a medical issue other than round ligament pain. If you experience any degree of vaginal bleeding during bouts of pain, or if you notice abnormal or discolored vaginal discharge, see your doctor or visit an urgent care center immediately. [15] X Research source Also visit an urgent care center (or your general practitioner) if you experience pain while urinating with ligament pain."
