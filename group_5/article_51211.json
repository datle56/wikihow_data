Dry stacked rock walls are typically built against a hillside, as it can be used as a tool to prevent soil erosion from ruining a garden [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Select your stones from a stone supply yard. Give a representative your measurements, as that affects the quantity and size of stones you need. Dry stack walls can typically be made from three types of stones: round field stones, relatively flat stacking stones and uniformly cut dressed stones. [2] X Research source Each type will give your wall a different look and feel, so make sure you look at pictures to determine which would be the best fit for your house and landscape. Note that flatter stones tend to be easier to work with than rounder ones, as they are more suited for stacking."

Pull a string line the length of the wall (about 8 inches (20.5 cm) off the ground level) to define the front of the wall. Freestanding dry rock walls can be stable if they are up to three feet in height [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Dig a ditch the length of the wall that is about a foot wide and 8 to 12 inches (20.5 cm - 30.5 cm) below the ground level. This ditch will act as the wall's footing and prevent the rocks from sliding forward due to pressure from the earth behind. [4] X Research source Try to cut the ditch into native soil rather than loose added soil, as the former provides a more stable foundation for the wall. Level the foundation trench. Smooth over the ground beneath your wall with a shovel, and line it with crushed stone pieces called stone screenings, stone dust or fines. This material will also be useful for filling in gaps."

The rock should just miss touching the string line, and be supported by dirt filled in behind it. Do this for the length of the wall, with each large rock touching the one next to it.
