      "content": "Start with your feet in a “T” shape. You should begin with your feet in a “T” shape, or 3rd position in ballet. Put your feet with your heels together and your toes pointed outwards, so that your feet make a “V” shape. Then, slide one foot forward so that the heel is connected to the middle of your back foot. Your feet should now make a “T” shape. It doesn’t matter which foot is forward. Your front foot should be pointed out at an angle."

      "content": "Pick up your back foot and move the toe of your front foot at the same time. Put your weight on the heel of your front foot, and rotate your foot point straight forward. At the same time as you turn your front foot, you pick up your back foot off of the ground. Your front toe should rotate toward your back foot to end up with your foot pointing straight. For example, if your left foot is forward, your foot should rotate towards the right."

Put your weight on the toe of your front foot and rotate your foot back into the starting position by moving your heel. At the same time, place your back foot back down to have the middle of the foot meet the heel of your front foot in the “T” position. Your feet should end up in the same “T” shape about 6 inches from where you started from."

At the same time lift your back foot and put it back down to meet your front foot. You should slowly move across the floor to the side when you continue to do this basic move repetitively."

On the last dance step before you want to change directions, put your back foot down in front of your other foot so that you end up in the “T” position with your back foot in front. At the same time as putting your back foot down in front, rotate your other foot into the “T” position by moving the heel to position the foot at the starting angle."

At the same time, place your other leg back down on the floor with your knee slightly bent. You should end up in a lunge with one leg forward and one back. Don’t do a big hop. You should only hop high enough to slide your foot back into a lunge position."

At the same time, bring your back leg forward and lift it so that your foot is off the floor and your thigh is parallel to the ground. This position should be the same as the first position you made, but with the opposite leg raised off the ground. You should be ready to do the moves again with the opposite leg as the standing leg."

You should end up doing two small hops on one foot as you slide it to center and then back into a lunge while you raise the other foot up to do the same thing on that side. Continue doing the dance steps on one side and then the next to dance the Running Man. The hops are really small. The dance move is actually sliding your foot backwards so make sure you only lift it enough to slide. The dance move should be smooth and not look like you’re jumping."
