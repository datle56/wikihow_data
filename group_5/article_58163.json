      "content": "Wipe away any dust or debris with a damp cloth. You don't need to sand the surface as long as you clean the record. All the grooves on the surface of the record give it a textured surface so the primer sticks. [1] X Research source Usually, sanding is done to scuff up the surface of a wall or canvas so the primer has something to stick to."

      "title": "Prime the record with gesso so the paint doesn’t peel away.",
      "content": "Prime the record with gesso so the paint doesn’t peel away. Fortunately, it's super easy to prime a vinyl record. Lay the record on a flat surface and dip a paintbrush or foam brush in gesso . Brush the gesso across the area of the record that you wish to paint and let it dry for at least 1 hour. [2] X Research source Gesso is a paint mixture that fills in your painting surface so it's smooth. It also gives the acrylic paint something to stick to so it doesn't peel away over time. It's true that you can try to paint the record without priming it, but your paint will probably curl at the edges and peel up over time."

      "content": "Use acrylic paint to paint the record by hand. In general, go for acrylic paint so it sticks to the primer on your vinyl record. Acrylic paint also dries fast so you can quickly enjoy your vinyl artwork. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Get spray paint if you want quick, even coverage or a bold, edgy effect.",
      "content": "Get spray paint if you want quick, even coverage or a bold, edgy effect. Pick up a few cans of spray paint in any color you like. If you're planning on painting a solid background color before going in with a paintbrush, just spray the entire surface of the record with spray paint and let it dry. For a cool effect, spray the paint onto a few spots of the record—these are great for painting planets or giving a starry sky effect. [4] X Research source For example, spray paint the entire surface in matte black spray paint. Then, spray a circle shape in orange-red spray paint to represent a planet."

      "title": "Use a paintbrush or foam brush to apply an even base coat.",
      "content": "Use a paintbrush or foam brush to apply an even base coat. Dip a 2 in (5.1 cm) flat paintbrush into acrylic paint and brush it smoothly across the surface of the record if you want a solid background color. You could also use a foam brush to paint small areas of the record like the foreground of a landscape that you plan on doing. [5] X Research source This works great for making a sunset or ocean scene on your record. Want to make a cloudy sky? Apply a pale blue base—once it dries, you can go back with a foam brush and make white clouds. Experiment with fun abstract designs! Brush splashes of color on the record and add a few spritzes of spray paint for a unique design."

      "content": "Dip a small round paintbrush in paint to apply tiny details. Want to paint flowers, words, or exquisite designs on your record? Get out a variety of small, round paintbrushes that have fine tips. This way you have more control when you paint these details. [6] X Research source For example, paint a vining plant with tiny flowers across one side of the record or paint song lyrics from the album on the record. You can use the pointed wooden end of the paintbrush to apply paint, too! Dip the end in acrylic paint and dab it onto your record to make a bold dot. You can arrange these dots in a gorgeous geometric design."

      "content": "Cover the hole in the record and set it on a rack to contain the mess. If you don't want paint falling through the middle of the record, stick a piece of painter’s tape on the underside of the hole. Set the record on a wire rack with a container underneath to catch the paint. [7] X Research source Feel free to cover as much of the center of the record as you like. For instance, you might put tape over all of the album info so you can still see the artist and album name once you've painted it."

      "content": "Combine pouring medium with your choice of acrylic paint so it's thinner. Put 1 cup (240 ml) of pouring medium into a cup and stir in a 2 fl oz (59 ml) tube of acrylic paint. If you want to use more than one color, repeat this with another color in a separate cup. To make a pouring medium, mix 4 cups (0.95 L) of floetrol , 1 cup (240 ml) of craft glue , 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of liquid pouring medium , and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of water. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the thin acrylic paint over the vinyl and swirl it to cover the record. There's no right or wrong way to pour the paint—you could overturn the paint cup onto the center of the record and let it slowly flow out or you could pour the paint in a circular motion around the grooves in the vinyl. Then, pick up the record by its sides and gently tilt it to get a swirled effect that covers the whole surface. [9] X Research source Although the record will probably be dry to the touch within a few hours, it's best to wait overnight so the paint can really harden."

      "content": "Apply a top coat of clear gloss paint if you want a shiny coating. Let your painted vinyl record dry completely before you apply the topcoat. Dip a clean brush in clear acrylic gloss paint and brush it over the surface of the record. Then, let your top coat dry for at least 2 hours before you hang the record. Your record will have a bold, glossy look. [10] X Research source A glossy top coat is totally optional! The painted vinyl record is safe to hang or display without it—the topcoat just adds a little shine."

      "content": "No—the paint fills in the sensitive groves on the vinyl. If you put the painted vinyl on a turntable and put the needle down, it would probably get stuck. This may even damage the needle, so you probably don't want to try it! [11] X Research source This is one reason why you should only paint vinyl records that are damaged or that you don't want to listen to anymore."
