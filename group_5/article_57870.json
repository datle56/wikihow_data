Then, add that number to the numerator of the fraction. Place this new sum over the original denominator of the fraction to get an improper fraction equivalent to your original mixed number. [1] X Research source For example , let’s say your first mixed number is 4½. Multiply the whole number (4) by the fraction’s denominator (2) → 4 x 2 = 8 . Add that number (8) to the fraction’s numerator (1) → 8 + 1 = 9 . Replace the original numerator with this sum to get your improper fraction → 9 / 2 . Repeat these steps with your second mixed number. In our example, the second mixed number will be 6⅖, which converts to the improper fraction 32 / 5 . An improper fraction is a number whose numerator is greater than its denominator."

The GCF is the biggest number by which both the numerator and denominator can be divided. Once you’ve found the GCF, divide both the numerator and denominator by that number.

Write down the whole number part of the quotient—this is your new whole number. Take the remainder and write it over the original denominator. You now have the completed product of multiplying your mixed numbers. [4] X Research source For example , take the improper fraction 144 / 5 . Divide the numerator (144) by the denominator (5) to find the quotient and remainder . 5 goes 28 times into 144. Therefore, the quotient is 28 . The remainder , or the number that’s left over, is 4 . The original denominator was 5. Therefore, the final mixed fraction is 28⅘ . Finished! Unless otherwise instructed, your final answer should be in mixed number form, just like the original question. If your teacher or workbook says that your final answer should be an improper fraction, you can skip this step."

      "title": "A mixed number is a whole number and a proper fraction combined together.",
      "content": "A mixed number is a whole number and a proper fraction combined together. Mixed numbers (or mixed fractions) are made up of three parts: a whole number, a numerator, and a denominator. The numerator and denominator form the proper fraction, which combines with the whole number to create a mixed number. [14] X Research source For example, the mixed number 2⅓ is a combination of an integer or whole number (2) and a proper fraction (⅓). The proper fraction (⅓) is made up of a numerator (1) and a denominator (3). Mixed numbers generally represent a number between two whole numbers. The mixed number 2⅓, for example, is greater than 2 but less than 3. Therefore, it’s a mixed number between two whole numbers. The fractional part of the mixed number must be a proper fraction. In other words, it has to be less than one whole, and the numerator (top number) must be greater than the denominator (bottom number). Mixed fractions are always greater than 1. Fractions like ½ or ⅛ are not mixed numbers because they are less than 1 and aren’t represented with a whole number."
