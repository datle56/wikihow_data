      "title": "Choose shirts in bright colors and prints.",
      "content": "Choose shirts in bright colors and prints. The main goal of dressing a pear figure is to draw attention to the torso and away from the hips and thighs. Outfit your upper body in bold colors and big prints . These catch the eye at the top, making your shoulders and chest seem a bit broader than they actually are. [2] X Research source From magenta to poison green and leopard-print to polka-dots, the options are endless! Choose whatever colors and patterns you love."

      "title": "Go for wide necklines.",
      "content": "Go for wide necklines . Choose tops that broaden your shoulders and emphasize your bust. Boat necks and scoop necks visually widen your shoulders. A sweetheart neckline enhances your bust, making it look fuller. Strapless or off-the-shoulder tops and dresses can also make your upper half look wider. Try v-necks, scoop-necks, cowl necks, square necks, and high necklines, too! [3] X Research source"

[4] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Go for tops that are tight around your natural waist and flow out to accent your gorgeous hourglass figure.

[5] X Research source Stylists usually recommend avoiding crop-tops on a pear-shaped figure, but you if want to rock a crop top and show off your body, go for it!"

      "title": "Choose shirts with wide sleeves.",
      "content": "Choose shirts with wide sleeves. Keep an eye out for tops with bell sleeves or kimono sleeves . Wide sleeves add volume to your arms, and as a result, your naturally voluminous hips and rear look more balanced and proportioned. Or, opt for shirts that have rolled or scrunched sleeves.

      "title": "Layer your tops.",
      "content": "Layer your tops. Layering adds bulk to your torso, which evens out your body’s proportions to create visual interest and give the illusion of added size. If you’re wearing multiple layers which take away the smallness of your waist, use a thin belt to cinch them in and give yourself that hourglass figure again. [8] X Research source Layer a tank top, blouse, and cardigan in complementary colors or patterns."

      "title": "Stick to dark colors.",
      "content": "Stick to dark colors. Visually, dark colors give a slimming effect and aren’t distracting; the eye tends to skim over dark colors. Go for dark wash denim and shorts, skirts, and pants in shades of black, gray, navy, brown, and olive green. Not only are dark, neutral colors slimming, but they will match nearly any shirt in your closet easily. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for knee-length or longer skirts.",
      "content": "Opt for knee-length or longer skirts. Skirts that hit the knee or ankle are perfect for pear-shaped ladies. They draw the eye down rather than to your hips. Look for high-waisted skirts with a tulip or A-line shape . Go for skirts with ruffles or beading along the bottom hem, too.

      "content": "Avoid details at the hip or rear. Although jeans with detailed, beaded, or embroidered pockets are cute, they draw the eye to your hips and butt. If you want to minimize those areas, avoid glitzy pants and belts, and stay away from bottoms embellished with buttons, gemstones, sequins, or bold embroidery near your hips and rear."

      "content": "Throw on a scarf. Scarves add volume and dimension to your upper half, and the extra detail at the neck draws the eye away from your fuller lower half. Try a variety of scarves tied in different ways to see what you like best. Infinity or circle scarves are great for pear shapes, as their lack of tail ends prevents the eye from traveling downwards as quickly."
