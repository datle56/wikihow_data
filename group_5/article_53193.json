      "content": "Pour descaling solution or vinegar and water into the reservoir. Turn off your Keurig Duo by pressing the power button. Remove the reservoir’s lid, then pull the tank straight up out of the brewer. Pour out anything inside the reservoir, then pour in an entire bottle of descaling solution or about 30 oz (3.75 cups) white distilled vinegar. Fill the rest of the reservoir up with fresh, clean water. [1] X Research source Pour 2 bottles of descaling solution into the reservoir for better cleaning power. Fill the rest up with water. Most Keurig Duo machines can hold up to 60 oz (7.5 cups) of water. [2] X Research source This machine doesn’t have a descaling mode like other coffee makers. Instead, you descale your machine by brewing the descaling solution or vinegar and water."

      "content": "Place a large cup on the drip tray and brew a 12 oz (1.5 cup) cup. Open the K-Cup compartment to ensure there are no K-Cups inside the machine. Place a large mug or container on the drip tray under the K-cup part of the machine, then press the “OZ,” “POD,” or mug-shaped button. Press the “12” and “K” buttons to start the brew. [3] X Research source If you used vinegar, the machine may emit a strong vinegar smell—this is nothing to worry about. Later, you’ll rinse your machine to get rid of any remaining smell or taste."

      "content": "Brew 12 cups of the descaling mixture through the carafe side. With the carafe on its heating plate, press the “CUPS,” “CARAFE,” or carafe-shaped button. Press the “12” button, then press the “K” button to start the brew. After the brew finishes, press and hold the “CUPS,” “CARAFE,” or carafe-shaped button to turn off the heating plate. [4] X Research source The carafe button will glow red to signal that the heating plate is on. After you press and hold it for a few seconds, it will turn off. If you’re using the Keurig-brand descaling solution, you may notice a foam dispensing from the brewer. This is completely normal, and won’t affect your machine."

      "title": "Let the Keurig sit for 30 minutes and rinse the reservoir, cup, and carafe.",
      "content": "Let the Keurig sit for 30 minutes and rinse the reservoir, cup, and carafe. Letting the machine sit allows the vinegar or descaling solution to dissolve the mineral deposits inside. After about 20 minutes, empty the carafe, your cup, and the reservoir. Rinse them thoroughly with clean water. [5] X Research source Rinse out the filter basket inside the carafe side of the machine, too."

      "content": "Fill the water reservoir and brew a 12 oz (1.5 cup) single cup. Fill the reservoir with fresh, clean water. Place your cup on the drip tray and press the “OZ,” “POD,” or mug-shaped button, then press the “K” button to start the brew. [6] X Research source Check the water reservoir after the brew is finished. If it’s low, fill it with fresh water to the fill line. The water will rinse the descaling solution out of the single-cup part of the machine. If your machine is heavily scaled, the water may not come out and you may hear air blowing through instead. If that happens, turn off and unplug the brewer. Empty and fill the reservoir with fresh water, then plug it back in and repeat this step."

Press the “CUPS,” “CARAFE,” or carafe-shaped button, then press the “12” and “K” buttons to start the brew. [7] X Research source Make sure to turn off the heating plate after the water is finished brewing. Press and hold the “CUPS,” “CARAFE,” or carafe-shaped button for a few seconds until the red light goes out. This will rinse out all the vinegar sitting in the tubes in the carafe side of the machine."

      "content": "Repeat the previous two steps 3 times to make sure it’s clean. You will brew fresh water through the single-cup side 4 times, and brew water through the carafe side 4 times. This makes sure that no vinegar or descaling solution remains in the machine. [8] X Research source Once you’ve finished the 4th cycle on both sides of the machine, rinse out the carafe, reservoir, and filter basket inside the carafe side. Now you’re ready to make a cup of your favorite coffee!"

[9] X Research source This will reset the descale sensors and the notification will turn off. If the light still stays on, press the power button to turn the machine off. Turn the machine back on, then try this method again. [10] X Research source If you postpone the descaling process and dismiss the descaling notification, the system may remind you again in 6 weeks."

      "content": "Descale your Keurig Duo brewer every 3 to 6 months. Calcium and other mineral deposits can quickly build up in your machine, reducing its efficiency and hindering its performance. [11] X Research source Try to repeat the steps above every 6 months to descale your brewer. [12] X Research source If you have hard water, descale it every 3 months instead. [13] X Research source It might also be time to descale your machine if it struggles to pour a cup or if it starts to affect the quality of your brew. [14] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Sears says “The harder your water, the more often you should descale. A trick to avoid this cleaning time would be to consider using… bottled water with low mineral content for your coffee water reservoir.” Keurig advises against using distilled water because its sensors rely on the minerals in water. Your brewer may not be able to detect water in the reservoir and the “add water” light may stay on. [15] X Research source"

Wash each part of the coffee maker with a soft scrub brush, then rinse them off with clean water. [16] X Research source Allow them to dry completely before putting them back inside the machine. Wash these components after every use to keep them clean."

Grab the rim of the plastic piece where the pod sits and pull it straight up. Separate the top of the pod holder from the funnel. Wash the pod holder with a small brush , dish soap, and water. [17] X Research source Put both pieces back together and insert the pod holder into the brewer after you’re done. To clean the exit hole, insert the end of a toothpick or paper clip into the bottom of the tube, moving it around to dislodge any debris. [18] X Research source The pod holder has a sharp needle inside the exit hole that pokes a hole in the bottom of K-Cups. Try to be careful as you wash it."

      "content": "Clean the entrance needle with a toothpick or paperclip. To unclog the needle, Santos says to “unplug your Keurig and remove the water reservoir and drip tray. Next, use a paperclip or a toothpick to gently clear any clogs or debris from the needle. You can also use a small, soft-bristled brush to gently scrub the needle and surrounding areas.” It may be easier to do this step if you remove the pod holder first. [19] X Research source After you’re done, “reassemble your Keurig and run a few cycles of hot water to flush out any remaining debris,” Santos recommends. The needle is very sharp, so be careful as you clean it."

Antibacterial wipes can ensure that your machine is clean while preventing the spread of bacteria, viruses, and other germs. [20] X Research source Wipe the top, sides, and the area behind the carafe or coffee mug until they’re clean. Alternatively, Sears recommends cleaning “the exterior of your Keurig with a microfiber cloth, and an all-natural plant-based cleaner such as Better Life .” Wipe down the outside of your Keurig Duo after every use to keep it clean."
