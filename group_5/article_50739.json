A “bald fade” gets so short that it becomes bare skin, making for a clean and modern look.

      "content": "Bald taper fade A “taper” refers to the actual hair that gets shorter, while a “fade” refers to the hair blending to skin. [3] X Research source A taper fade combines the two for a clean and sensible style that usually fades low and leaves plenty of hair on top.
