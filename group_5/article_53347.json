Remember that a fraction bar means “divided by,” so when you see a fraction over a fraction, you need to divide the top fraction by the bottom fraction. [1] X Research source For example, you might see 2 x 2 y − 3 x 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}{\\frac {x}{4}}}} . You can rewrite this as 2 x 2 y − 3 ÷ x 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\\div {\\frac {x}{4}}} ."

To divide a fraction by a fraction , you take the reciprocal of the second fraction, and you change the division sign to a multiplication sign. A reciprocal is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are reversed. [2] X Research source For example: 2 x 2 y − 3 ÷ x 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\\div {\\frac {x}{4}}} becomes 2 x 2 y − 3 × 4 x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2x^{2}}{y-3}}\\times {\\frac {4}{x}}}"

[3] X Research source Remember that you cannot cancel out a single term (like y {\\displaystyle y} ) from a binomial (like y − 3 {\\displaystyle y-3} ). Also remember that if you have an x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} term in the numerator, and an x {\\displaystyle x} term in the denominator, you can cancel out one x {\\displaystyle x} , and the x {\\displaystyle x} in the denominator disappears, and the x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} in the numerator becomes x {\\displaystyle x} . For example, you can cancel an x {\\displaystyle x} in the numerator and denominator in the expression 4 ( 2 x 2 ) x ( y − 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4(2x^{2})}{x(y-3)}}} : 4 ( 2 x 2 ) x ( y − 3 ) {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4(2x^{\\cancel {2}})}{{\\cancel {x}}(y-3)}}} 4 ( 2 x ) y − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4(2x)}{y-3}}}"
