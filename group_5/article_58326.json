      "content": "There are other emulators, but they can get you banned. There are other mobile emulators, such as BlueStacks and NoxPlayer, but CoD: Mobile players should avoid these emulators for this game. Many users have reported that using any other emulator besides GameLoop will result in a ban. Some users have stated they were banned within minutes of playing the game on BlueStacks. This is anecdotal evidence, and not all of the bans seem to be permanent. However, to avoid the risk of losing your account, it's safer to stick with GameLoop."

      "content": "You could use screen mirroring apps, but they're laggy. Some users have tried to use screen mirroring apps (that mirror your phone screen on your computer) such as scrcpy or qtscrcpy. While these apps likely won't get you banned on CoD: Mobile, users that have tried them state that the controls are somewhat limited and there is a lot of input lag, which makes the game difficult (or potentially even impossible) to play. For the best playing experience, it's best to stick with GameLoop."
