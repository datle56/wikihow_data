      "content": "Dead skin can make your skin feel rough. There are two main types of exfoliants—chemical and mechanical. Chemical exfoliants use acids like AHAs and BHAs to break down the dead cells on the surface of your skin so you can rinse them away. [1] X Expert Source Melissa Jannes Skincare Specialist Expert Interview. 30 August 2019. They're great for sensitive areas like your face. Mechanical exfoliants, like body scrubs, pumice stones, or sponges, use friction to scrub away dead skin. They can be a little harsh, so they're best for tougher areas like your heels and elbows. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If your skin looks pink or feels tender after you exfoliate, use a gentler exfoliant or exfoliate less often.

      "content": "Brush away dead skin cells before you get into the shower. Start by swiping a long-handled dry brush across your legs in long, smooth strokes, working your way up from your feet. Next, brush your arms, working upward from your hands. Finally, use circular motions to brush your back and torso. Take a warm shower to rinse off, then apply moisturizer and enjoy your glowing, smooth skin! [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Brush gently on sensitive areas like your inner thighs, stomach, and neck—and don't use your dry brush on your face. Dry brushing can leave your skin looking smooth and healthy because it polishes away dead skin and boosts your circulation. Also, it might be more gentle than other exfoliants because you do it while your skin is dry. If you have sensitive skin, you can get a similar effect by gently scrubbing your skin with a dry washcloth before you get into the shower."

      "content": "Never shave your skin when it's dry. If you're going to shave, do it at the end of your shower, so the warmth of the water can help soften your skin. Lightly exfoliate with a loofah first so the blades don't get clogged up with dead skin. Then, lather up with a foam or gel shaving cream—or even hair conditioner or body oil—so the razor can glide over your skin. This will help you get a closer shave, so your skin will be softer and smoother when you're finished. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't use soap to shave—this will dry out your skin, which could leave it feeling rough. Always use a sharp razor to ensure you get a close shave. Also, some people find they get smoother results when they use a razor with multiple blades. If you don't want to shave, you could try waxing, sugaring, or using a depilatory cream instead."
