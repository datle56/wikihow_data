      "title": "Switch to a stronger antiperspirant.",
      "content": "Switch to a stronger antiperspirant. The first thing to do when attempting to combat excessive sweating is to switch to an antiperspirant with a stronger formula. While prescriptions are required for the strongest of these, there are several clinical strength formulas available over-the-counter from brands like Dove and Secret. Be aware of the difference between antiperspirants and deodorants. Antiperspirants will actually clog the sweat glands and prevent excess moisture, while deodorants simply mask odors. Therefore, if you are suffering from excess sweating, it's important that you use an antiperspirant (although antiperspirant-deodorants are also available). Prescription-strength antiperspirants typically contain 10 to 15 percent of an active ingredient called aluminum chloride hexahydrate. This ingredient is highly effective at reducing perspiration but can sometimes cause skin irritation, so you may need to shop around to find a formula that works for you. Some people are also opposed to wearing antiperspirants due to the alleged links between the aluminum-based compounds found in antiperspirants and diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. However, multiple clinical studies have found no evidence to support this link. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply antiperspirant at night.",
      "content": "Apply antiperspirant at night. This may come as a surprise, but doctors recommend applying your antiperspirant at nighttime, just before bed. The reason for this is that it takes approximately six to eight hours for the antiperspirant to enter the sweat ducts and adequately clog the pores. Your body also tends to stay cooler and calmer while you're sleeping, which reduces sweating and prevents the antiperspirant from being washed away before it has time to sink in (which is what happens when you only apply antiperspirant in the morning). [2] X Research source However, it is a good idea to apply the antiperspirant a second time, after your morning shower, for optimum results. Remember that antiperspirants aren't reserved for use on the armpits, they can be used almost anywhere you find yourself sweating - like the palms, feet, legs and back. Just avoid using them on the face, as stronger formulas have a tendency to cause irritation, especially on sensitive skin."

      "title": "Choose clothing wisely.",
      "content": "Choose clothing wisely. Wearing the right clothing can make a huge difference when it comes to keeping sweating under control. Firstly, wearing breathable clothing can prevent you from sweating excessively in the first place and secondly, making clever clothing choices can help to mask sweat stains and stop you from feeling self-conscious. Wear lightweight fabrics. Lightweight, breathable fabrics - such as cotton - will allow your skin to breathe and prevent your body from overheating. Opt for lighter colors if you need to keep cool. Light colors help reflect the sun and will keep you cooler throughout the day. They will show sweat stains more than dark colors, though, so consider whether you want to prioritize staying cool or masking the sweat. Choose dark colors and patterns to mask sweat stains. Wearing dark colors and patterned clothes can help to make sweat stains less obvious or even unnoticeable, giving you greater peace of mind as you go about your day. Wear breathable shoes. If you suffer from sweaty feet, it's a good idea to invest in high-quality, breathable shoes. You can also place moisture-wicking insoles inside shoes and wear 100% cotton socks for added sweat-reducing benefits. Layer up. Layering your clothing, no matter what the season, can help with the appearance of sweat, as the bottom layers can soak up any excess moisture before it gets a chance to soak through the outer layers. Men can wear undershirts, while women can opt for a camisole. Consider using dress shields. If it's too warm for extra layers, you can also consider using dress-shields. These are small adhesive patches which you can stick to the inside of your clothing to soak up any excess moisture. They are available at most pharmacies. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Shower at least once a day.",
      "content": "Shower at least once a day. Showering daily can really help to eliminate bad odors caused by excessive sweating. Interestingly, sweat does not have an odor by itself - as it is simply a mixture of water, salt, and electrolytes. Odor forms when the apocrine glands - which are found in the underarms and groin - release a viscous substance containing fats, proteins, and pheromones. This viscous substance then mixes with regular sweat and bacteria on the surface of the skin, creating the bad smell you associate with sweat. Washing daily (especially with an antibacterial soap) can help to prevent excess bacteria from building up on the surface of the skin, thus reducing odors. It is also important to wear clean clothes after a shower, as bacteria can also reside on dirty clothes. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring a change of clothes.",
      "content": "Bring a change of clothes. Keeping a spare (non-creasing) shirt or blouse in your bag at all times is a good idea if you suffer from excessive sweating. Just knowing that you always have a fresh change of clothes readily available can decrease your anxiety levels and make you feel more secure. It has been proven that worrying about your sweating can actually cause you to sweat more, so knowing that you have a safety net (in the form of a change of clothes) to fall back on can actually prevent you from sweating so much in the first place. Carry a clean handkerchief. Another sneaky back-up is to carry a handkerchief in your pocket at all times, replacing it with a clean one every day. That way, if you're confronted with the necessity of shaking hands with somebody, you can quickly and inconspicuously dry your palms first."

      "title": "Avoid spicy foods.",
      "content": "Avoid spicy foods. Spicy foods such as hot peppers or Indian curries can increase the amount of sweat you produce, so avoid eating anything spicy - at least during lunch on workdays or on a date. Also avoid eating foods such as garlic and onions, as the strong odors associated with these foods can come out through your sweat. [3] X Research source Overall, eating clean foods such as whole grains, fruit and veg is a good idea. Although they won't stop you from sweating, they can improve the odor of the sweat."

      "content": "Keep your bed cool. If you suffer from nighttime sweating, there are several things you can do to keep yourself cool in bed. Make sure you are using breathable, lightweight bed linen no matter what time of year it is. Also, make sure to choose sheets with an absorbent material such as cotton - silk or flannel sheets are not ideal. Opt for a lightweight duvet or comforter. You can always layer more blankets on if necessary, but if you're sleeping under a heavy down duvet - even in summer - it's no wonder you suffer from nighttime sweats. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Reduce stress . Feeling stressed, nervous or anxious is a major sweat trigger for some people, so it makes sense that by controlling your stress levels, you can control your sweating. When you're stressed or nervous, these feelings stimulate neurotransmitters in the brain which send signals to your body to start sweating, leaving you feeling hot and bothered. To cut down on stress, try to avoid biting off more than you can chew at work. If you find yourself sweating due to nerves before a presentation or meeting your boss, focus on relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation .

      "title": "Use dry shampoo.",
      "content": "Use dry shampoo. If you find that your scalp gets sweaty at the slightest physical activity, consider spritzing your hair with some dry shampoo every morning. Most dry shampoos have a powdery finish which soaks up additional moisture from the hair and scalp. Keep a travel-size bottle of dry shampoo in your purse or in a desk drawer at work - then you can have a quick spritz in the bathroom whenever you want to freshen up. Scented dry shampoos also smell great - helping to mask any sweaty odors. However, if you're looking for a more D.I.Y. option, baby powder or baking soda will also do the trick."

      "content": "Cut back on bad habits. Things like smoking, drinking alcohol and excessive caffeine consumption can all lead to increased sweating, so it's a good idea to cut back on these things where possible. Being overweight also leads to increased sweating, so if you could stand to lose a few pounds, that's a good place to start. See articles on quit smoking , quit drinking alcohol , quit caffeine and lose weight for help."

      "title": "See your doctor for a possible cause of your excessive sweating.",
      "content": "See your doctor for a possible cause of your excessive sweating. In some instances, excessive sweating may be due to an underlying medical condition, such as menopause, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperhidrosis, or some types of cancer. It is important to identify this underlying cause as soon as possible so treatment can begin. This is particularly true since some of these causes can become potentially life-threatening if they are left unchecked. Once the underlying problem is successfully treated, the patient can effectively reduce excessive sweating as well. It is also important to consider whether any medications you are currently taking could be causing the problem. Some medicines can contribute to excessive sweating, such as drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions or high blood pressure. Antibiotics and some types of supplements can also lead to the problem. This is of particular concern if the sweating appeared after the medication was started, or if the sweating is a generalized, rather than a localized, variety."

      "title": "Try laser hair removal on your underarms.",
      "content": "Try laser hair removal on your underarms. Laser hair removal is often recommended by doctors to curb excessive sweating and eliminate bad odors. The reason this works is fairly simple - hair is present to keep the body warm, but sometimes it causes it to sweat more. Bacteria also cling to hairs much more easily, which leads to bad odors. By removing the hair, the area will sweat less and hold onto fewer bacteria, resulting in reduced odor. Laser hair removal works by targeting hair follicles with pulses of laser light which destroy them. The treatment is relatively non-painful but may require several sessions to complete. From then on, hair growth will be significantly reduced. Laser treatment can be somewhat pricey, but the results are permanent. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider iontophoresis treatment. This FDA-approved procedure is typically performed by a dermatologist and uses electrical impulses to \"turn off\" the sweat glands temporarily. It is particularly effective in the hands and feet. Most patients require multiple sessions to see positive results. These sessions are typically performed once a day for up to 2 weeks. After that, maintenance sessions can be done on an \"as needed\" basis. Few side effects are reported with this procedure and some patients eventually perform maintenance sessions as needed in the comfort of their own homes. Machines can be purchased from R.A. Fischer Co. and generally cost around $600. Patients must be trained by their doctor to use the machine properly."

The procedure works by temporarily blocking the nerves that stimulate the sweating process. This procedure is also considered relatively safe, with few unpleasant side effects and no downtime afterward. Results usually last around 4 months and repeat sessions are needed to maintain positive results."

If successful, this can stop excessive sweating for good. The two main treatments offered are: Sweat gland removal. This is performed using liposuction, via small incisions in the skin. This treatment is only possible for sweat glands in the armpits. Nerve surgery. This treatment is performed in order to cut off, clamp or destroy spinal nerves which activate excessive sweating, particularly on the palms of the hands. Unfortunately, it may accidentally trigger excessive sweating on other parts of the body.

      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. Sweating happens when your body temperature gets too high and your body secretes water in order to cool it down again. Drinking plenty of cool water throughout the day helps to regulate your body temperature and prevent it from getting too high in the first place, thus preventing the need to sweat. In addition, drinking lots of water allows toxins to be flushed from the body through urine, which would otherwise be sweated out through the skin. When toxins are eliminated through the skin, they mingle with sweat to create bad odors. Therefore, drinking lots of water can improve the odor of your sweat. Try to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day to help your sweating and provide a range of other health benefits, including clearer skin and improved digestion."

      "content": "Use a facial scrub on your underarms. This may sound a bit odd, but using a facial scrub on your underarms (or anywhere you experience excessive sweating) can help to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. Do so with caution, though, as an exfoliating scrub may cause small abrasions and irritation if used too frequently or vigorously. If you notice your deodorant stings after you use a scrub under your arms, stop this treatment. Once the pores are unclogged, this will release any trapped toxins that have been blocking the pores and causing unpleasant-smelling sweat. You may sweat even more than usual at first, but after a couple of days you should notice a reduction in the volume and frequency of your sweating. Continue to use the scrub once or twice a week.

Baby powder is also a good option, but should be used with caution as some research suggests it may be linked to certain forms of cancer. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source When dabbed on the skin, these powders will quickly soak up any excess moisture and keep the area dry for several hours.
