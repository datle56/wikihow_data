      "content": "Using a tape measure, lay out a rectangle 16 feet (4.9 m) by 40 feet (12.2 m) on the ground to define the base of your greenhouse. You'll probably want the 40 foot (12.2 m) dimension to run as close to east-west as you can, so the plants will get the maximum possible exposure to the sun. Measure the distance between opposite corners to make sure you have square corners. If the corners are square, the diagonal measurements will be equal (43 feet in this case). Push or hammer a 3 foot (0.9 m) piece of rebar into the ground at each corner, leaving about one foot protruding from the ground."
