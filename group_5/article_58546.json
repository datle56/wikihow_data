      "content": "The number one thing you want is for your pet to get better. It’s important to recognize the signs that you should take your dog to the vet (if they’re low energy, not eating or drinking, or acting strange for more than 24 hours), but it can also be reassuring to pray to ask for their health to return. Some prayers for health are: God, I know you are merciful not just to humankind, but to all creation. My dog is sick, I’m sure they’re scared, and I can’t imagine the pain they’re in. I beg you to have mercy, to carry them back to health, and take away their suffering. I ask you because I know you are gentle and merciful, filled with love. Amen. Jesus, mighty healer, savior of mankind, please bring your presence that causes sickness to retreat, please rest in the heart of my dog, who has fallen ill. I can’t alleviate their pain, I beg for the help of your boundless mercy. Help them recover swiftly, as your love extends to all beings. Amen. Lord, giver and holder of life, who sustains and nourishes, please hear my prayer. My best friend, my beloved dog, has fallen ill. They are the light of my life, I love them so much. Please, in Jesus’s name, bring them back to health. Send your spirit to wash over them, restore their energy, and take away their sickness. Amen. Jesus, you have destroyed sickness and death through the sacrifice of your body, so please, extend that now to my dog. Take the sickness out of them, and replace it with love and light. I beg for the redemption of my dog, who I love, who has always been good to me. Please, deliver them from illness. Amen. Lord, you created all good things. I thank you for creating dogs, they bring humanity incredible joy and are one of your creations I am most thankful for. Their love is your love, I know this. Now, Lord, my dog needs help. They’re getting sicker—I ask that you go to them, fill them with your spirit and healing touch. Remove the sickness from my dog, so they too can continue living in gratitude to you. Amen. Lord, when you saw corruption upon the land and called for a great wave to overtake everything, you let Noah and his family be saved, you let them save the animals, who had not sinned. You showed your love and mercy in that moment, and I beg you to show it again now. My dog is sick and isn't showing any signs of recovery. Please, purge the illness from them as you purged sin from the world. Let my family and I be filled with peace as we try our best to take care of them. Amen. Lord, deliver my dog from illness with your healing touch. Restore their energy and appetite, and prevent sickness from reaching them again in the future. Amen. Oh God, your prophets told us the entire world is saved, that salvation will flow over everyone, every creature. Now, I beg for that salvation for my dog. They’re ill and not showing signs of recovery, they need the peace of a lion laying with a lamb. Grant them this, and give them their redemption early, in this life. Let us see your eternal healing and bask in its glory. Amen."

You want to be the best caretaker you can for your dog, and cementing that intention through prayer can be helpful. Some prayers for your abilities are: God, I come to you in my hour of need. My dog has gotten sick and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared and feel helpless—please lend me your strength. Help me be kind and patient while they’re ill, understand their needs, and be the best friend and caretaker I can during their illness. Amen. God, you have given me the responsibility to look after this dog. You have given me the power, the tools, and the social standing to keep them safe, but now my dog has fallen ill. I ask you to give me renewed strength in my stewardship, to give me the ability to meet my dog’s needs, to get adequate medical care, and to give me the peace to make it through this. Amen. God, I ask you to send me a sign. My dog is ill, and I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell how serious it is, and I’m wondering if I should treat them at home or go to a clinic. Please guide my decisions here, and let me do what’s best for my companion. Help me understand what’s happening so I can go back to taking care of my favorite of your wonderful creatures. Have mercy on us, lord. Amen. Dear lord, please guide me to the best veterinarians I can, who will look after my dog with love and kindness. Give me the strength to do what’s best for my dog, and to relieve their pain humanely, however I can. Send me advice through my dog’s medical staff and let me be ready for what’s to come. Amen. Dear God, please help me get through my anger at what’s happening so I can be with my dog in their hour of need. Let me be a good friend and servant, let me find the best care for them and trust their medical team. Amen."

      "content": "Sickness affects your mental state, as well as your physical one. You and your dog are probably experiencing a lot of stress right now, so here are a few prayers for taking a load off your mind: Dear God, my best friend has been handed over to people I don’t know. I want to trust them to take good care of my dog, but I’m scared. Please give me the courage, the peace of mind, and the strength to let them do their work without interfering. I know that trusting them is trusting you, God, and you work miracles every day. Please give these medical professionals your miraculous power of healing. Amen. Merciful God, take the fear and anxiety away from my dog. I know they have a mind, too, and can be burdened the way I can. Please fill their mind with good memories and dreams, and help them find peace as they receive treatment. Amen. Please soothe my dog’s spirit when I cannot be there for them. Let them feel gentle hands on them, and be relaxed and at peace. Give them the strength and courage to let the doctors help them to the best of their abilities."

      "content": "Dogs are wonderful creatures and companions. One of the most beautiful parts of having a dog is that you can experience their entire life as a friend and family member. It’s painful to see your dog pass on to the other side, but find peace knowing you loved them dearly, and their time on earth is short. God, please be with my pet as they get older. Help them recover from their illness quickly, and give them peace and tranquility. Help me cherish them for the rest of their life, and meet their needs in their old age. Amen. Lord, thank you for sending me this dog. I have loved them so much, our companionship has meant the world to me. Thank you for letting me take care of them their whole life. Now, in their old age, let me be the best friend I can possibly be. Fill their mind with positive memories, and let their passage be easy when it’s their time to come to you. Please let our time left together be filled with love and joy. Amen. I pray the light of love finds my pet during their transition to the other side. I hope they feel called home, that they’re a puppy again, that they are filled with happiness and love, and taken care of wherever they go after they leave. I hope my dog’s suffering ends soon, and that they’re guided from their body by goodness and love. I know when they enter the kingdom of Heaven they will be surrounded by souls who love them. I will miss my dog so badly, but I know they are safe with you, God. Amen."
