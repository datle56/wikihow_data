People who are at an increased risk of developing POTS include women, people between the ages 12 and 50, and those who have been exposed to triggers (such as an infection, pregnancy, and/or stress). People taking multiple medications may also be at increased risk of noticing symptoms. This is because certain blood pressure medications and heart-related medications may exacerbate the signs and symptoms of POTS. [5] X Research source"

It is also important to have a list of your past medical history, including any surgeries or hospitalizations from your past, as well as any ongoing health concerns that you have suffered from.

POTS is a form of \"autonomic dysregulation\" (a nervous system disorder) in which your heart rate spikes upon standing (among other symptoms). In order to diagnose POTS, your doctor will need to measure your heart rate when you are sitting at rest. You will then stand and, after one or two minutes, your doctor will measure your heart rate again. If your heart rate increases by 30 BPM (beats per minute) or more when you stand, this means that you have POTS.

After your doctor measures your heart rate and its variance when you are sitting versus standing, she will also want to measure your blood pressure. The reason for this is to rule out a condition called \"orthostatic hypotension\" (this is when your blood pressure drops significantly when you stand, leading to a compensatory elevated heart rate). Because your doctor does not want to diagnose you with POTS if you actually have orthostatic hypotension (that is, if your blood pressure is actually more of a problem than your heart rate), she will need to measure your blood pressure while sitting, then again after you stand up. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you have POTS and not orthostatic hypotension, then your blood pressure should not drop significantly when you stand up versus when you are sitting. Alternatively, if your resting heart rate is above 120 BPM when you stand, this is also in itself diagnostic of POTS.

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source The tilt table test is where you lie on a table that changes positions at set time intervals. As this occurs, you are attached to machines such as an ECG and blood pressure cuff to continuously monitor your vital signs, including heart rate and rhythm, and blood pressure. Your doctor can evaluate the series of results and use this to diagnose POTS or other heart-related conditions."

Approximately 25% of people diagnosed with POTS have impaired quality of life similar to someone who is officially categorized as disabled. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This includes not being able to work, as well as possible difficulty with day-to-day tasks such as bathing, eating, walking, or standing; however, while some people with POTS suffer from a reduced quality of life, others are able to live normally and you might not know they have a medical condition unless they told you. The prognosis for POTS is highly variable from case to case. For POTS where the onset follows a viral infection (termed a \"post-viral episode\"), approximately 50% of patients recover in two to five years time. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have been diagnosed with POTS, your doctor can provide you with information that is specific to you in terms of prognosis, as well as working with you to develop a personalized treatment plan. Your prognosis will depend upon the subtype of POTS that you have, your overall health history, the underlying cause of your disorder, and the constellation of symptoms (as well as the symptom severity) that you are experiencing. Non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of POTS include eliminating aggravating factors, addressing dehydration, and increasing activity. As far as medication goes, there have been no-long term studies on the efficacy of medications to treat POTS and all medication is used off label."
