      "content": "Cover up to protect your skin from the vines. Some species of vines, such as English ivy , may irritate your skin. Protect yourself by wearing thick gardening gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, pants, and closed-toe shoes to cover your skin when you handle vines. [1] X Research source Proper attire also protects your skin from scratches and bug bites while you work."

      "content": "Cut the vines down to the ground with pruning shears or a saw. Snip the climbing vines as close to the ground as possible to help make removing the roots more manageable. Just use pruning shears or a razor tooth pruning saw to sever the vines, depending on their thickness. [2] X Research source If the vines are very long and growing up a structure, cut them 1 to 2 feet (30-61 cm) above the ground. Then, make a second cut as close to the ground as possible. Place all of the vine cuttings in a trash bag as you work. New plants can easily grow from cut stems, so make sure you bag every cutting."

      "title": "Pull or dig the base of the vines out of the ground.",
      "content": "Pull or dig the base of the vines out of the ground. If the vine is still fairly small, it’s usually easy to track down the roots and pull them out by hand. If the vines are overgrown, use a shovel or trowel to dig at the base of the stem. Then, lift the shovel to pull up the root system. [3] X Research source Remove all of the underground structures from the vine, including any bulbs and tubers, to effectively kill it. Wait to remove the vines’ roots until the spring. The soil is usually more moist and soft, which gives you better access to the root system."

      "title": "Pry away vines attached to trees or buildings with a flat tool.",
      "content": "Pry away vines attached to trees or buildings with a flat tool. To avoid damage to any trees, buildings, or fences that the vines are clinging to, gently insert a screwdriver, crowbar, or similar tool between each stem and the surface. Then, slowly pull the vine up and away. [4] X Research source Work in small sections to help avoid damaging the structure the vines are attached to. If you are removing vines from a tree, pull them off slowly to avoid damaging the tree's bark. As another option , let the vines dry and decompose while they’re still attached to the structure before you pull them off. This strategy can help lessen any potential damage."

      "title": "Mow down vines growing on the ground for an easy alternative.",
      "content": "Mow down vines growing on the ground for an easy alternative. If you’re dealing with groundcover vines instead of climbing vines, use a gas-powered lawn mower that is powerful enough to cut through the stems instead of just rolling over them. This removes the vines’ leaves, which drains the root system and helps keep it from regrowing. [5] X Research source Repeatedly mow the vines 3 to 4 times a year to kill any plants that resprout. Electric or rotary mowers are more likely to run over vines rather than cut through them. If you want to reduce the hard labor of killing vines, this is the best option to try, though it will take regular and repeated mowing for it to be effective."

      "title": "Place the vines in a trash bag and dispose of them in your trashcan.",
      "content": "Place the vines in a trash bag and dispose of them in your trashcan. The stems, roots, leaves, and any other leftover pieces of the vine can easily re-root into the ground. Make sure to pick up all of the cuttings you made and place them in a trash bag. Then, throw the bag away in your regular trash bin. [6] X Research source Do not compost the vine cuttings, as this can cause them to re-root into the ground as well."

      "content": "Cut the vines down to ground level. If the vines are climbing on structures in your yard, use pruning shears or a pruning saw to sever the stems just above the ground. If they’re growing on the ground, mow over them with a powerful mower. [7] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Carefully pry off any vines growing on trees, buildings, or fences after severing the stem at ground level.

      "title": "Cover the cut stems with several layers of cardboard and mulch.",
      "content": "Cover the cut stems with several layers of cardboard and mulch. Place 2 to 3 layers of cardboard over the area where the vines grow. Then, add a 3 to 5-inch (7.6-12.7 cm) thick layer of leaf or wood chip mulch . Build up another layer of cardboard and mulch until the total covering is between 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) thick. [8] X Research source Covering the vines prevents them from getting the light, water, and air they need to survive. If you don’t have mulch, use other organic materials like grass cuttings, tree bark, old newspaper, or dead leaves. Using organic materials is crucial to ensure that they decompose into the soil after killing the vines. Alternatively, cover the vines with tarp or plastic sheeting . Sheeting also robs the plant of oxygen and builds up intense heat, which helps kill off the vines."

      "title": "Keep the sheet mulch over the vines for at least 2 years.",
      "content": "Keep the sheet mulch over the vines for at least 2 years. Vines are hardy plants that may regrow even when they’re covered with sheet mulch. Keep the covering over the vines for at least 2 growing seasons to help ensure the vines are completely dead. [9] X Research source The sheet mulch will naturally decompose with time. When the covering starts to thin out, add another layer of cardboard and mulch to keep it between 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) thick."

      "content": "Cut large vines and treat the stems with a vine and stump killer . Larger, well-established vines often grow intertwined with other plants or attach themselves to buildings or trees. Cut these vines close to the ground with a pruning saw or shears, leaving a 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) stump. Then, apply an undiluted triclopyr herbicide, like a vine and stump killer, directly to the freshly cut stem. [10] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source The herbicide transfers from the stump down to the roots. It typically kills the vine within 1 to 2 weeks. This method is a great alternative to spraying an herbicide on the vines. Applying a vine and stump killer directly onto the stems keeps other nearby plants from being exposed to the herbicide. Warning : Wear gloves, long-sleeved clothing, goggles, and a respirator mask when applying any herbicide. Exposure to herbicides can cause skin irritation, headache, dizziness, and nausea.

Herbaceous vines are not as durable as woody vines and can be killed with a milder systemic herbicide, like Roundup . Follow the instructions on the glyphosate herbicide to apply it to the vines’ leaves. Like triclopyr, glyphosate travels through the plant’s circulatory system and kills the roots. [13] X Research source Please note: The WHO considers glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen. [14] X Research source Its use is prohibited in some states and countries. Please check your local laws and use caution when handling this chemical."

      "content": "Spray isolated vine leaves with a systemic herbicide. If you are killing vines on the ground or on a building that are not touching other plants, spray them with herbicide. Apply enough herbicide to completely wet the foliage of the vine. Just avoid dousing the leaves so that herbicide seeps onto the ground, as this can damage the soil and the roots of nearby plants. [15] X Research source Do not spray vines growing on trees or other plants. It may take several weeks or months to kill the vines, depending on their thickness and how developed their root system is. Multiple applications of herbicide may be necessary to completely kill the vines."

      "content": "Pour boiling water onto the root crown of the vines. Cut away the bulk of the surface vines with pruning shears. Then, use a shovel or trowel to dig into the ground until you reach the vine’s roots. Simply pour 3–4 cups (0.71–0.95 L) of boiling water directly onto the top of the root system, where the roots meet the base of the plant. [18] X Research source Boiling water is typically most effective on newly growing vines. Throw away the vine cuttings in a trash bag and place the bag in your trash can."

      "content": "Repeatedly apply your removal method until the vines stop growing. Vines are invasive, quick growers that aren’t usually killed with 1 single treatment, whether you dig out the roots, cover them with sheet mulch or apply an herbicide. It can take several years of regular treatment to kill them completely. [19] X Research source Check on the vines every few weeks after applying your first treatment. Whenever you see new vines sprouting, apply your removal method."
