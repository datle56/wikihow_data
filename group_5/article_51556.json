    {
      "title": "Cook.",
      "content": "Cook. Figure out what she likes to eat (this is the part where you find out if she's a vegetarian or not). After you figure out what she likes to eat, practice cooking the meal a few times. Once you're comfortable, invite her over and serve her dinner (as long as the food is edible she'll be impressed). The thought of you taking the time and effort to actually cook a dinner for her will show her that you care enough about her to devote your time to make her feel special."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fight.",
      "content": "Fight. You should never hit a woman, but a friendly disagreement is a good way to get a girl's attention and keep it. The next time you talk to her, find something to disagree with her about and don't give in. By standing your ground, you will show her confidence and a willingness to defend yourself. Be careful not to be too stubborn. The livelier the discussion, the more time she will spend thinking about it afterwards which equates to time thinking about you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember.",
      "content": "Remember. When you first start spending time with a girl, pick two or three small details to remember about her appearance and commit them to memory. Make sure that the time you choose to try this method is a time that will be brought up often in future conversations (a first date is a great time to use this). Now simply wait for her to bring the event up. When she does, casually say something like \"yeah, I remember that, you were wearing that black dress and those heart earrings.\" This simple statement shows that she is important to you and that you pay attention to her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen.",
      "content": "Listen. Communication is very important to women. If you want to really understand a woman and capture her heart then listen to what she says carefully. Maintain eye contact and take part into the conversation. Share your opinion and your ideas freely. A real conversation does not mean that you have to agree with everything she says. An active communication shows that you are confident and serious. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Surprise.",
      "content": "Surprise. Women love surprises. Surprises do not have to cost a lot of money. They can be simple but original. After all, it is the thought that counts the most. Also, put some imagination in your surprise. For example, plan a trip to a place she loves and that is important to both of you. Randomly buy her flowers or take her on an activity that she may be open to trying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give support.",
      "content": "Give support. There will always be difficult situations in a woman's life. Support her through problems that she might confront. Show her that you are there to help her. Let her feel protected and confident around you. Also, be supportive when she tries to achieve her goals and dreams, and be happy for her achievements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call or text.",
      "content": "Call or text. If you want to capture a woman's heart, obviously you need to keep the lines of communication open. Call and text her throughout the day, just to let her know you're thinking of her. When you know she has to be at work at 9:30AM, text her about 10 and say something like \"good morning, beautiful\". Ask her how she slept, or what she dreamt about. Women love to feel like you're thinking about them, so don't hesitate to make it obvious."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compliment.",
      "content": "Compliment. A compliment is valued when there is a surprise element to it. Telling her how witty you find her, how her intelligence turns you on, appreciating how thoughtful and generous she can be, or her gentle nature, all these are deeper compliments, which when paid sincerely make the recipient feel ten feet tall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give her space.",
      "content": "Give her space. Don't be possessive and make her account to you regarding her whereabouts. Let her know you trust her. Don't expect her to spend all her free time with you. Let her have her own life too. Often when in a relationship people make the mistake of spending every waking moment that they can manage together, and in the process alienate themselves from friends and even lose their identity. Let her be her own person."
