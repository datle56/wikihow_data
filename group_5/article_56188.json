      "title": "Aquarius and Aries are very compatible signs.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Aries are very compatible signs. While this pair isn’t exactly sweet or romantic in the traditional sense, an Aquarius-Aries pairing is intense in its own way. Air sign Aquarius helps fuel the fire of Aries, and Aries’ natural energy helps Aquarius learn to take action. These two probably won’t be writing each other love letters—you’re more likely to find them debating the humanitarian issues of our time or planning to take over the world. Aquarius and Aries both value adventure, ambition, honesty, and independence. These two are very compatible sexually and intellectually, but their lack of tenderness might lead to issues in emotional compatibility."

      "title": "These two might struggle to open up to each other.",
      "content": "These two might struggle to open up to each other. Aquarius can intellectualize relationships and come off as cold since they’re ruled by the distant planet Uranus. In contrast, Aries’ temper and emotions heat up fast. Aries might interpret Aquarius’ naturally aloof nature as a sign that the water bearer doesn’t reciprocate their intense feelings. Emotional compatibility might be the weak spot for this pairing, but these fiercely determined signs can work things out. Compatibility Tip: If you’re an Aquarius, practice actively checking in with your Aries partner. Ask questions like, “How are you feeling about us?” and reassure Aries that they can be vulnerable with you."

      "title": "Aquarius and Aries can help each other grow.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Aries can help each other grow. These signs might seem fundamentally different, but their strengths and weaknesses complement each other well. Aquarius can help stubborn Aries learn to try new approaches to problems and look at the big picture. Aries can encourage logical Aquarius to go with their gut and trust their intuition, rather than relying on reason alone. Compatibility Tip: If differences pop up in your relationship, focus on addressing individual behaviors or situations, rather than criticizing your partner’s personality. [1] X Research source This can be a struggle for both signs since Aquarius and Aries can both lack a filter."

      "title": "Aquarius and Aries have blazing hot sexual chemistry.",
      "content": "Aquarius and Aries have blazing hot sexual chemistry. Ruled by Mars , the planet of desire, Aries will bring fiery stamina and passion to this relationship. Meanwhile, Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of innovation and originality. This individualistic sign will add a sense of novelty and adventure to the couple’s sex life. Compatibility Tip: Aries loves to be in charge, and Aquarius loves to try out new things, so don’t be afraid to experiment with power play."

      "title": "Aries and Aquarius both love to debate.",
      "content": "Aries and Aquarius both love to debate. These two signs are fantastic conversationalists, and they’ll keep each other entertained for hours. Neither Aries nor Aquarius are trivial signs. They prefer tackling big issues like international politics, world religions, and technological advances to small topics like celebrity gossip. Compatibility Tip: It can be tough to get into an argument with hot-headed Aries. If a debate gets too heated, say something like, “I’m so glad we can talk about things like this. But let’s put this on hold and take a timeout for now.”"

      "title": "Trust can be a tricky spot for these two.",
      "content": "Trust can be a tricky spot for these two. Aquarius loves freedom, and Aries loves control. While neither of these signs would actively betray their partner, there’s a definite risk that jealousy will pop up on Aries’ side. Just keep in mind, it’s totally normal for your Aquarius partner to want space. When they come back, they’ll want to share all their wacky ideas and new discoveries with their Aries partner. Compatibility Tip: Set clear expectations for communication. If an Aquarius disappears into one of their personal projects without texting or calling, an Aries might wonder what’s up—and they might assume their partner’s cheating."

      "title": "Despite their differences, Aquarius and Aries make a good match.",
      "content": "Despite their differences, Aquarius and Aries make a good match. Fundamentally, they’re both creative signs who share a need for stimulation and challenge in their lives. Their relationship can suffer from a lack of vulnerability and tenderness, but fortunately, these two signs are expert communicators. Even through rough patches, these two trailblazing signs can work together to solve their problems. An Aries in love forgives their partner easily. If a conflict comes up, they’ll stay loyal. An Aquarius in love doesn’t easily change their mind. When they say “I love you,” they really mean it."
