Since you are the one sending the invoice, you may choose the numbering system that works best for you. You can number your invoices numerically (1, 2, 3, 4) or by date (for example, 2010-10-16, for the year, month and day of the invoice). If you choose the latter, you can add \"-01\" to the end to differentiate between invoices sent on the same day. In any case, make sure you number your invoices in sequential order so you don't confuse yourself. The invoice date. Even if you choose to number your invoice by date, you should clearly write the date on a separate line. The invoice due date. If you have an agreement with the business you are invoicing about when you can expect to get paid, write that date as the due date. If you don't have an agreement, figure out the standard pay-by period in your industry; in most cases, it's 30 to 45 days."
