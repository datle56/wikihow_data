      "content": "Water rose bushes once a week or 3-4 times a week in hot weather. It’s better to give rose bushes a large amount of water less often than a small amount of water more often. For example, giving a full can of water once a week rather than a quarter can every other day will allow the water to penetrate down to the roots. [1] X Research source Keep an eye on the weather. If it’s especially dry and hot outside, water your roses every 3 or 4 days, as the plant will be thirstier. If you’ve had a lot of rain, hold off on watering. The type of rose you’re planting may have special watering instructions. For instance, bare-root roses require daily watering for the first 2 weeks until buds start to form. Check the label on your newly purchased plant for more individualized details."

      "content": "Water potted roses daily to ensure the soil stays moist. Unlike ground-planted rose bushes, roses in a container or pot need to be watered daily, especially if they’re outside. Pots provide the roots with very little insulation from the sun, meaning that the soil can dry out more quickly. To avoid scorching your plant, aim to water the roses every morning.

      "title": "Give ground-planted roses about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water.",
      "content": "Give ground-planted roses about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water. Aim to water the soil to ensure 18 in (46 cm) below the surface is saturated, which is about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of water. Focus the water on the base of the plant, pouring fairly slowly and pausing for the water to sink in. This ensures that all the roots get enough water. [3] X Research source Remember that after dry spells, it can take longer for soil to absorb water—be patient."

      "content": "Water potted roses until water runs out the bottom of the pot. Like ground-planted roses, water roses in containers until the roots are saturated. Water your plant until water comes out of the bottom of the pot to ensure that all of the soil and roots are moist. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Water roses first thing in the morning.",
      "content": "Water roses first thing in the morning. It’s usually best to avoid watering your rose bushes during the heat of the day. Try to get in the habit of watering them first thing in the morning before the sun gets too high. This lets foliage dry off by the time the cooler evening air gets to them. If a rose has wet foliage, it can be more at risk of mildew and blackspot . [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Overwatered roses have yellow, droopy leaves. Plant specialist Andi Xoch explains that “an indication of [roses] being overwatered is yellow leaves.” Too much water can make leaves droop and wilt. [6] X Expert Source Andi Xoch Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2021. If you water your roses too much, they can experience root rot and start to decay. Root rot is when a plant’s root system deteriorates because of a fungus that thrives in wet soil conditions. [7] X Research source Make sure container-planted roses never sit in water. Avoid putting containers or pots in trays, bowls, or saucers, as this can hinder drainage and contribute to root rot."

      "content": "Water the soil, not the foliage. Overhead watering can foster disease by keeping the stems, leaves, and flowers wet, and also washes away insecticides or other treatments you may apply. Water the ground around the base of the plant, instead, aiming to soak the soil rather than the roses themselves.

      "content": "Use a showerhead-style watering can. The best watering can to water roses with is one with a showerhead-style spout (or one with multiple holes in the spout). Using a can that has a single-stream spout can erode the soil around the roots and potentially cause damage. If using a garden hose, avoid a high-pressure jet, which can also erode the soil from the roots. Alternatively, you could set up an irrigation system but monitor it carefully."

      "title": "Water more when the weather is hot and dry.",
      "content": "Water more when the weather is hot and dry. Additionally, water more in windy and cold weather conditions, which can dry out the plant. So, pay attention to the weather patterns and regularly test your roses' soil to ensure they’re getting enough water. [9] X Research source As a rough guide, on a standard summer day, water every 2 or 3 days; during average and colder temperatures, water about once a week. Xoch says a sign of underwatering is if the leaves start drying up or getting “crispy tips.” [10] X Expert Source Andi Xoch Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 4 August 2021."

      "title": "Water sandy soil more and clay soil less.",
      "content": "Water sandy soil more and clay soil less. Soil type and drainage influence how often you need to water your roses. Sandy soil drains easily and won’t retain water very well. If your garden has clay-type soil, it’ll retain moisture better; however, if the soil is extremely clay-heavy, add some compost or similar horticultural material to improve it at planting time. [11] X Research source Test your garden’s soil by purchasing a DIY soil test kit or bringing a sample to your local garden center."

      "content": "Water container-grown roses more frequently. Container-grown or potted roses tend to dry out a bit faster than ground-planted ones, so these will need watering more often. In hot conditions, be prepared to water container-grown roses every day. [12] X Research source You can help reduce water requirements by mulching. Inorganic mulches such as pebbles or gravel can work well in containers and look attractive."

      "title": "Water newly planted roses more often.",
      "content": "Water newly planted roses more often. Recently planted roses still haven’t developed their root system, so if you’ve planted in the last few months, it’s important to water the roses regularly during dry spells (even if you planted just before winter). Lack of water is the most common reason newly planted plants fail. [13] X Research source Once established, plants will be more adept at seeking water from a wider soil area, so you can start to ease off your watering regime after 6 months."

      "title": "Give large rose bushes more water.",
      "content": "Give large rose bushes more water. Larger rose bushes have roots spread over a wider area of soil. This means larger rose bushes require more water to ensure the water reaches all of their roots. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a thick layer of mulch in the spring to minimize watering. Mulch helps keep the soil moist and reduces the need for watering as often. [15] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Every year, remove the spent mulch and replace it with a fresh layer. The start of the growing season (spring) is a good time to feed your roses and replace the mulch. Alternatively, you can use a well-rotted manure. Apply the manure after feeding the roses in a 3 inch (7.6 cm) depth around the bush. This is ideal in late spring when the ground isn’t cold or frozen."
