      "content": "Put cash in your mugger's wallet. It should be enough that if muggers thumb through it, they won't suspect you're pulling one over on them. However, don't put in an amount that is too large, that you would regret losing to a mugger. Some people put a bigger bill in front of many smaller bills so that a hasty mugger thinks there's a lot of money in there. If possible, consider mixing fake money in with real bills. However, remember not to spend the fake bills, as this is considered counterfeiting and is punishable by jail time."

      "content": "Add an ID card which has already expired, or which can be easily replaced. Any mugger will be skeptical if there is no form of ID in your wallet. A photo ID library card is good because it doesn't have your address and can be easily replaced. Plus, the mugger can't use it if he or she should decide to rack up overdue fees on your behalf for revenge. An old driver's license with an old address is convincing as well, but keep in mind that someone might be living in a house by that address."

      "title": "Add an expired credit card.",
      "content": "Add an expired credit card. When the muggers sees this, they might think they've hit the jackpot, and might hurry off to charge things before you report the card as stolen. Make sure that the account is closed, and write \"Please see ID\" clearly in the signature box in the back. A credit card with photo ID is preferred. Or if you have a realistic looking card from a credit offer, use that. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the mugger's wallet for minor expenses. This is especially important if you pay for something in public. Muggers might be watching, and you'll want them to see you using the decoy wallet, not your real one."

      "title": "Tuck your real wallet in a less accessible and noticeable place, like the inside of your jacket, or elsewhere underneath your clothes.",
      "content": "Tuck your real wallet in a less accessible and noticeable place, like the inside of your jacket, or elsewhere underneath your clothes. Another good place is in your front pocket instead of your back pocket - you are much more likely to notice someone getting into your front pocket. Keep it light and streamlined. Some people purchase a money belt, or put their money and a credit card in a sock."
