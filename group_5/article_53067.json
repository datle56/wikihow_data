      "content": "Blaming your mother-in-law can cause her to become defensive. Instead of telling her the things she’s done wrong, let her know that she is important to you, but that you have felt hurt by her in the past. Use I-statements to talk about your feelings, rather than make accusations about the kind of person she is. For example, you might say something like: [7] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. “I feel humiliated when you say I need to be a better wife. I’m trying my best, and we have a strong marriage.” “I feel frustrated when you talk to your friends about issues in my marriage. I really want to trust you, but it makes me uncomfortable to think that our conversations aren’t private.” “I feel hurt when you say that I’m not a good father. I’m working on raising our daughter the best way I know how, and I don’t think that kind of comment is helpful.”"

      "content": "At the end of the day, your in-laws are your spouse’s responsibility. If you’re finding your mother-in-law to be impossible to deal with after your best efforts, let your spouse know that they’ll need to be the key point of contact between you and her. When you have pressure from your in-laws, having a united front with your spouse is more important than ever. [8] X Research source Try not to get angry at your spouse for the behavior of their parents. You should expect solidarity from them when you’re being attacked, but keep in mind that they aren’t responsible for their mother’s behavior. Harshly criticizing your mother-in-law can cause your spouse to become protective of them. Focus on how your mother-in-law makes you feel using I-statements, rather than calling her names. If issues with your in-laws are threatening your marriage, seek out marriage counseling. This is a problem that you and your spouse can work through together, and having a professional support you is a great source of help. Tell your spouse you need more support by suggesting something like, “I love you, and I’m excited that we’re a part of each other’s families. But you know that your mom and I have been having issues. Can we work through this together? It makes me uncomfortable to say, but I need your support here.”"

For instance, if you’ve told your mother-in-law not to call you while you’re working and to send you a text if it’s urgent, don’t make exceptions. [11] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 27 October 2021. To set up boundaries with your mother-in-law, tell her something like, “I have a lot of respect for you, but in order for our relationship to work, we should have some rules. It’s important to me that you stay away from posting about us on social media. It attracts a lot of attention that we’re not comfortable with.” Other boundaries you might want to give your mother-in-law include limiting the amount of time she spends with your kids, not using abusive language when speaking with you, and not making comparisons between you and her other children-in-law. If your mother-in-law crosses one of your boundaries, let her know that you won’t speak with her until you receive an apology. If you’re recovering from a particularly traumatic event with your mother-in-law, it’s OK to take time to heal. Don’t feel obligated to immediately get back in touch with your mother-in-law—wait until you feel like you’ve recovered from the incident before making amends.
