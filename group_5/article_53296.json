      "content": "Start the car. Prius cars made from 2004 to 2009, called \"Generation 2,\" have a combination of in-car commands you can utilize to disable the reverse beeping, but the vehicle must be started in order to do so. Start a Toyota Prius by inserting the key into the ignition. Unlike a normal vehicle, you will not need to turn the key. Instead, press your foot firmly on the brake and hit the start button to the driver’s right. [1] X Research source The Prius is extremely quiet, so pay attention to the instrumentation to know if it is running. Some newer model cars will not require that you insert the key, as long as it’s in the vehicle."

On the right side of the steering wheel, there are a number of buttons you can use to control the settings and display of the dashboard. Press the button labeled “TRIP” until the letters “ODO” appear on the display. On some models of Prius, the button may be next to the odometer on the dashboard itself. [2] X Research source In later generation models of the Prius, this function will not display ODO and this method will not work. You may need to press the button more than once to make it display the letters “ODO.” Turn the vehicle off the letters “ODO” appear."

In many newer models of the Prius, you cannot disable the reverse beep using the method listed above and must instead access the on board computer using an application on your phone and Bluetooth adapter. Purchase an OBDII Bluetooth adapter from an automotive or electronics specialty store. Some Bluetooth OBDII adapters are designed specifically for certain smart phones, so be sure to purchase one that works with yours. Android phones may be better for this specific application."
