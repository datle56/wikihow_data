      "content": "Washing your hair every day can actually make it greasier. Instead, try to go 2 to 3 days in between washes for the best results. It might take a few weeks, but your hair will actually stop producing as many natural oils every day, leading to less greasy hair. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Evan Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 January 2019. On days you aren’t washing your hair, wear a shower cap in the shower to keep your hair dry. If you sweat a lot, you may have to wash your hair more frequently. Try shampooing more or less often until you find the schedule that works for you."

      "content": "These shampoos are milder and cause less buildup in your hair. Look for products that say “for oily hair” “clarifying shampoo” or “less buildup” to find the one that’s right for you. Oily hair shampoos work to gently strip away dirt and grime without irritating your scalp. [2] X Research source Look for a shampoo with zinc sulfate in it to help cleanse your scalp and control greasy buildup. [3] X Research source When you wash your hair, try not to scrub your scalp too hard. It won’t make your hair any less greasy, and you could tangle up your luscious locks. You don’t need to use a ton of shampoo—a quarter-sized amount is perfect for cleansing your scalp, even if you have super long hair."

      "content": "Hot water strips your hair of its natural oils. For the best results, keep your shower water as cool as you can, especially when rinsing shampoo and conditioner from your hair. Cool water closes the cuticle of your hair, which will help to keep moisture in. [4] X Research source Hot water also causes your pores, including the ones on your scalp, to produce more sebum, or thick oil. This thick oil will start traveling down your hair strands from your scalp as soon as you leave your hot shower."

      "content": "Conditioner is very moisturizing, but it can also be greasy. If you already deal with greasy hair, don’t add more to it by putting conditioner on your roots. When you use conditioner after shampooing, apply it starting halfway down your hair and go all the way to your ends.

      "content": "Over-brushing can actually make your scalp produce more oil. Instead, stick to brushing your hair once before you shower, then using a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair when it’s wet. Make sure the brush touches your scalp to remove dead skin and make your hair feel clean. [7] X Research source Be super careful when you comb your hair while it’s damp or wet. Start from the ends and slowly work your way upward to avoid ripping or tearing your hair. If you’ve already brushed your hair that day but it gets super messy, don’t worry about giving it a quick brush. Focus on the ends of your hair to smooth them down and make your hair look perfect again."

Try to find products that are meant for oily hair to keep them from building up. [8] X Research source Vegetable glycerin, aloe leaf, and citric acid are common ingredients in oil-free products. [9] X Research source Heavy styling products can also weigh your hair down and make it look greasier, especially if you have fine or thin hair.

If you need to fix your hair, use a clean brush or comb instead of your fingers. [10] X Research source If you want to keep your hair in place, try using hairspray or clay so you don’t have to touch it constantly. Keep your hair out of your face by using clips or a headband so you don’t have to swipe it out of your eyes."

While this is good for hair that is actually dry or damaged (the thin film makes your hair look shiny and smooth), all it does to hair that’s prone to oiliness is add more weight to the hair and make it look greasier. If you do need to use these products, keep them on the ends of your hair. [15] X Research source You should also avoid smoothing or glossing products, since those can do the same thing."
