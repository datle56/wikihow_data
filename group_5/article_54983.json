      "title": "Sprinkle boric acid in areas where you’ve seen roaches.",
      "content": "Sprinkle boric acid in areas where you’ve seen roaches. Dust small amounts of boric acid powder along baseboards, behind appliances, and in any other areas where you’ve spotted roaches in your home. When roaches come into contact with the powder, their exoskeleton is damaged and they eventually die. [1] X Research source You can also make a DIY roach bait trap with boric acid by mixing two parts of the powder with one part flour. Stir in enough corn or maple syrup to create a peanut butter texture. Use a popsicle stick to put a small dollop of the bait in any of your target areas. The roaches will be attracted to the flour and syrup in the bait and will bring it back to their nest, eventually poisoning most of their colony. Alternatively, make a mixture of equal parts boric acid, sugar, and flour. Roll spoonfuls of the mixture to create small dough balls, then place these dough balls around the house as bait for the roaches. [2] X Research source After the roaches die, act quickly to sweep them up with a vacuum or broom and use vacuum attachments to suck them out of cracks or crevices, if necessary. Avoid picking the roach up with your bare hands. Immediately change the vacuum bag and dispose of it in an outside trash can. [3] X Research source Boric acid is toxic to humans and animals when ingested —only use the boric acid in places where kids and pets can’t access it. If that’s not possible, then you’d be safer using a different method. You may also want to wear a dust mask when handling the acid."

      "content": "Spread a 3:1 borax and sugar mixture in roach-infested areas. Stir together three parts borax with one part sugar. Spread the mixture in any spots where you’ve noticed roaches, such as underneath your sink, behind appliances, and in dark corners of your home. [4] X Research source Using borax to kill roaches is effective as it will slowly dry out their exoskeleton and kill them, while the sugar will attract them to the bait. After the roaches die, vacuum them up immediately and avoid touching them with your bare hands. Change the vacuum bag frequently and dispose of it in an outdoor trash can. [5] X Research source If you have pets or small children in your home , keep the borax out of reach as it can be toxic when ingested. If it’s not possible to keep the borax solution away from animals and kids, you’d be safer using a different method."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda onto a piece of food and leave it out overnight. Coat any piece of food—like an onion for example—in a few spoonfuls of baking soda. Leave the piece of food in an area where you’ve seen roaches before and let it sit overnight. [6] X Research source When roaches eat baking soda, it expands inside them and causes the pest to explode. If you find a dead roach, vacuum it up and avoid touching it with your bare hands. Immediately change the vacuum bag and dispose of it in an outside trash can. [7] X Research source If further cleaning is necessary, wear gloves and use a moistened, soapy cloth to wipe the area clean. Baking soda is typically harmless to pets unless ingested in large quantities, although small amounts can cause stomach upset or urinary tract issues. [8] X Research source If you have pets , use only small amounts of baking soda or try a different method."

      "content": "Spritz an essential oil spray around infested areas. Mix 10-15 drops of essential oil into a spray bottle filled with water. Shake well to combine, then spray the essential oil mixture around areas prone to roach activity. For example, you may want to target kitchen cabinets, baseboards, and entry points of your home. [9] X Research source Peppermint oil is one of the most effective natural roach repellents, and it’s also non-toxic and safe to use around children. Eucalyptus oil and lavender oil are also effective natural roach-repellents. However, be cautious using peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil if you have pets , as both can be harmful to cats and dogs. Lavender oil is okay to use around animals as long as you dilute it and only use small amounts. If you have pets, try neem oil , which is a potent, naturally-occuring pesticide that’s effective at getting rid of roaches and is safe for animals. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Set a DIY cockroach trap with leftover coffee grounds. Put coffee grounds in small paper cups, then place those cups in jars filled with water. Pierce small holes in the lid of each jar and place them against walls, baseboards, or in other areas where you’ve seen the bugs. [11] X Research source The scent of the coffee will lure cockroaches to the jars. Once they enter the jar, they won’t be able to escape and will be killed. Check the jars daily so that you can empty them of dead cockroaches as soon as possible. To dispose of the dead roaches, unscrew the lid to the jar and dump the contents into a double-bagged trash can. Immediately tie off the garbage bags and carry them to an outdoor trash can."

      "content": "Sprinkle crushed bay leaves in areas where you’ve seen roaches. Crush some bay leaves and sprinkle the fragments in your kitchen cupboards or other target areas. Alternatively, boil some bay leaves in water and spray the cooled mixture in infected corners of your home. [12] X Research source Bay leaves are helpful to deter cockroaches but they won’t kill them, making this method ideal if you’d prefer to let the roaches live (just not in your house). However, bay leaves are considered toxic to dogs if ingested , so keep the bay leaves out of reach of your pets or use a different method to get rid of your roaches. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray diluted dish soap in areas of high roach activity. Mix 4 tablespoons (59 mL) dish detergent into 1 litre (34 fl oz) water. Pour into a spray bottle and spritz the mixture anywhere where you’ve seen roaches. [14] X Research source Soap is not toxic to roaches, but it will disrupt their ability to breathe if they find themselves sufficiently coated in a soapy substance. Dish soap is not safe for pets or humans to consume , particularly in large quantities. If you have animals or small children in the home, only spray the solution in hard-to-reach areas (or choose a different method)."

      "content": "Sprinkle diatomaceous earth anywhere you notice roach activity. Scatter a few spoonfuls of diatomaceous earth in your target areas, or anywhere that you’ve seen roaches in or around your home. This method may take several attempts, so you can repeat this process until you stop seeing roaches appear. [15] X Research source If you see a dead roach, sweep or vacuum it up and avoid touching it with your bare hands. Immediately change the vacuum bag and dispose of it in an outside trash can before washing your hands thoroughly. [16] X Research source Diatomaceous earth can irritate your lungs if inhaled, so wear a respirator mask during application and clean the area thoroughly the next day. If you have pets or small children in the home , it’s best to avoid this method unless you can completely keep them away from the area you’re using it in. Diatomaceous earth is a natural insecticide that quickly kills roaches by dehydrating them."

      "content": "Mop the floors of your home with a lemon juice solution. In a large bucket, mix 2–3 tablespoons (30–44 mL) of lemon juice with a few gallons of water. Dip a mop into the solution and wash any surface areas where you’ve noticed cockroaches previously. Avoid using lemon juice on hardwood floors, natural stone, or any flooring with brass accents. The acid in the lemon can cause damage to these surfaces. [17] X Research source Lemon juice is safe to use in homes with pets and small children as long as it’s diluted and used in small amounts—an animal would have to ingest a sizable amount of the juice before it would produce negative health effects. Lemons have anti-pathogenic properties to naturally repel and get rid of roaches . Even after your roach problem is gone, cleaning your floors with lemon juice regularly can help stave off any future pest infestations. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Use diluted fabric softener as a natural roach-killing spray. Mix three parts fabric softener with two parts water and store it in a spray bottle. When you see a cockroach in your home, spray the mixture directly onto the pest. The solution should kill the roach immediately, but it’s not particularly effective against large-scale infestation. [19] X Research source Once you’ve killed the roach, sweep or vacuum it up and immediately dispose of it in an outdoor trash can. Then, put on gloves and use a damp, soapy cloth to disinfect the area. [20] X Research source Fabric softener is toxic to both humans and animals if consumed in large quantities. If you have pets or small children in the home, only spray the solution in areas that can’t be accessed—or choose a safer method."

      "title": "Kill roaches with sticky traps or chemical sprays if home remedies don't work.",
      "content": "Kill roaches with sticky traps or chemical sprays if home remedies don't work. Place sticky traps in an area that roaches tend to gather in, such as under the sink or behind the fridge. Alternatively, place a poison bait trap so that roaches are lured by the promise of food and then carry the poison back to their colonies. [21] X Research source With either trap, check the area frequently to remove or refresh the trap. You can also use a fogger or insecticide spray that’s made to target cockroaches. These chemical cockroach killers can be found in most grocery and hardware stores, but make sure to follow their instructions exactly. Spraying a roach with insecticide will “kill [it] on contact, but most of the roaches hiding away will sense the chemical and…[they’ll] just run away to another room,” says Bin Break. If your roach infestation persists, then you may need to hire a professional pest control service to rid your apartment or house of the bugs. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Inspect cardboard boxes and packages before bringing them inside. Cockroaches often hitch a ride and “come in on products…from warehouses directly to your home,” explains Carrillo. Carefully look over any delivered items or grocery bags to make sure there aren’t any pests clinging to the packaging. Roaches gravitate toward cardboard, so be especially mindful “if you’re one of those people who stores all of your bags under the sink or you keep a big pile of cardboard in your home,” advises Carrillo."

      "content": "Look for signs of a more serious infestation, like egg casings or a musty scent. While it’s good to take daily measures to prevent roaches, keep an eye out for signs of an infestation that may require further intervention or professional pest control. Look for droppings that resemble coffee grounds or black pepper, as well as small egg casings and a musty scent around areas that roaches might frequent. [27] X Research source Check for dark, irregular smear marks or molted skin in target areas around your home. “Thoroughly search inside the cabinets under your kitchen and bathroom sink,” instructs Carrillo, as “those tend to be the first areas where cockroach nests will start.” Roaches typically come out at night, so look for them scurrying away immediately after you turn the lights on at night."
