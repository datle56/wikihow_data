They might also be trying to look into a situation or learn more information if they feel underinformed. The 🧐 emoji basically means, “I’m looking into it.” [1] X Research source “Trying to figure out how my new coffee maker works. I’ll get there…eventually. 🧐” “Did something happen at work while I was out? Now I wanna hear more! 🧐”"

      "content": "A 🧐 (monocle) emoji can convey a sense of skepticism or irony. Essentially, it can mean that you doubt the validity of something, or don’t really believe what you’re hearing. It can also serve as a sarcastic reaction to someone else’s words; for instance, if someone brags about themselves but you don’t really believe their hype, the 🧐 emoji could represent a sarcastic retort. [2] X Research source Person 1: “I’m the best Mario Kart player in the world!” Person 2: “Considering that I beat you last time we played, I doubt that. 🧐”"

Monopoly players just see him as having a monocle since he’s supposed to represent a rich and sophisticated person."
