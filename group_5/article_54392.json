Clicking any spot on the map will show the coordinates in the box that appears underneath the search bar. You may need to click twice if you have a previous spot selected, as the first click will deselect that spot, and the second click will load the coordinates. Clicking on a marked location will not show the coordinates. Instead it will show the information about the business or location you selected. To find the coordinates, you will need to deselect it and click near it.
