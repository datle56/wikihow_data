You’ll need to score seven points if your opponent manages to get at least five points on you. One set means winning at least six games, three sets involves winning at least 18 games and five sets means you need to win at least 30 games."

      "content": "Circular markers on your court side indicate where the ball will land. Get near or behind these circles in order to intercept the ball, and strike it in a way that your opponent will have difficulty returning it back to you. Base Swing – This is the default return that is useful for returning most shots. It is the easiest to consistently hit for the beginning tennis player. Lob Shot – Launch your ball high in the air to catch opponents unawares. This can force them toward a particular side of their court and give yourself time to re-position yourself accordingly. Top Spin – A fast, high-bounce ball to take advantage of opponents that are far away from the side of the court opposite yours. Available when the marker turns red. Back Spin – A slow, low-bounce shot that has a tendency to make it difficult for your opponents to return balls the way they want to – sometimes resulting in them hitting them the net with the ball instead of returning it to your side of the court. Available when the marker turns yellow."
