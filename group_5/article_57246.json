      "content": "Understand how this works. The air is full of warm water vapor molecules inside the jar. The air is compressed by the glove because the glove takes up some of the space inside the jar. Pulling the glove fingers out of the jar releases some space in the jar and allows the air to expand. The air inside the jar cools because pressure and temperature have a proportional relationship when pressure and temperature drops. The smoke from the match acts as a vehicle that the water molecules can attach to. They stick to the smoke particles, condensing into cloud droplets. [2] X Research source When the glove fingers go back into the jar, the air inside the jar warms up again and the cloud disappears."

      "content": "Understand why this works. You created hot, moist air in the jar when you poured in the boiling water. The ice on the lid works to cool the air as it rises. This water vapor will turn back into a liquid when it cools, but it needs a surface to condense on. When you spray the aerosol into the jar, you’ve given the water vapor a surface. The molecules stick to the aerosol and condense into cloud droplets. The clouds swirl around inside the jar because the air inside is swirling around. The warm air is rising while the cool air is sinking. You can see the movement of air as the clouds swirl."

[3] X Research source Putting pressure on the bottle's sides forces the water particles to compress. When you let go of the sides of the bottle, the air expands, decreasing the temperature. When the air cools, the particles can stick together a little more easily, which causes them to clump into little tiny droplets around the smoke molecules. This mimics the process of clouds forming in the sky. Clouds in the sky are made up of water droplets that have clung to tiny particles of dust, smoke, ash, or salt."
