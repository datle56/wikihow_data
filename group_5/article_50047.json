Typically, the other 2 cards are the Jokers or black Kings, but any cards will work for the trick. Lay the cards face-up in a line so the queen is in the middle. [1] X Research source While 3-card monte usually uses the Queen of Hearts, any red card will work. Just choose a card that stands out from the other two. Bend the cards vertically down the middle so they’re easier to pick up and perform the trick."

If you’re quick enough, the player will think you just put down the queen. [3] X Research source To add a little more flair to your trick, let go of the queen first and pick it up with your other hand. Then, throw the queen back down on the table and pick it up with your original hand. After that, then throw down the black card. Before you perform the trick, practice tossing down the card so it looks natural. Be sure to use the same hand motion when you put down the other card so it doesn’t look any different."
