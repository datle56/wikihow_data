      "content": "Wipe the surface with a damp microfiber cloth to remove dust. While dust may seem small, left unaddressed, it can act like sandpaper and damage the wooden surface. To get rid of dust, run a microfiber cloth under warm water. Wring the cloth out so it's not dripping wet and wipe the surface. [1] X Research source You can also use a lint-free cloth or a feather duster. Be sure to dust weekly to keep your table clean and eliminate potential allergens. If you don't have any of these materials, use an old t-shirt or a washcloth to wipe the surface."

These can etch the stone. It's best to stick with dish soap and warm water or purchase a granite countertop cleaner. For stainless steel tables, use microfiber towels and stainless steel cleaners to get rid of any stains, smudges, and streaks. Scrubbing pads can scratch the surface. Clean soapstone tables with non-abrasive multipurpose cleaners. For tough scratches or stains, use very fine sandpaper (no rougher than 80 grit) and apply mineral oil afterward."

Allow it to absorb into the stone for about 15 minutes before wiping off excess sealant with a clean, dry cloth. [18] X Research source Refer to the manufacturer's instructions on the sealant box. Leaving sealant for too long can discolor the stone. Granite will need to be resealed every 1 to 5 years."
