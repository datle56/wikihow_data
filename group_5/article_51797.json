      "content": "Ink cartridges usually have a protective covering, which has sheltered them during shipment. If you have Epson, Canon or Brother, look for a yellow tape seal or plastic red tab that tell you to remove them. Do not remove the additional transparent plastic, or a pointed mechanism, otherwise your cartridge will leak or malfunction. If there is an additional piece of plastic in your ink cartridge box, this is an adapter that needs to be connected to your cartridge. Follow the included instructions in your package, and carefully connect the adapter to the compatible ink cartridge. If you have HP, Lexmark or Dell look for a cap and protective tape needing removal. Do not let anything touch the micro-chip, this is usually copper or green, and is sensitive to touch."

      "content": "Make sure that you are installing the cartridge in the appropriate carriage for the new color. For example, if you have a new magenta ink cartridge, replace it in the carriage intended for only the magenta cartridge. If your Brother cartridge does not seem to clip in where it usually fits, it will still work, some re-manufactured cartridges clip from underneath. Some thicker inks need to settle for 1 hour after installation before printing. If you have printed or performed a head cleaning with less than desirable results, let the cartridge settle in its new printer for 1 or 2 hours before attempting another print. Excessive print head cleanings will deplete your ink. If your new cartridge is not recognized by the printer, simply leave it in place then unplug the printer for 10 minutes. After waiting 10 minutes, hold down the power button for 30 seconds then plug the printer back in. This will clean the printer memory, allowing it to re-sync to the new cartridges."
