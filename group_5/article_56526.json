      "content": "Choose a safe launch site. In the vast majority of cases, sky lanterns are perfectly safe and fun. Usually, the sky lantern climbs gently into the sky, the candle or rag inside eventually runs out of fuel, and the balloon floats harmlessly to the ground. However, because they're powered by an open flame and are often made of flammable tissue paper, there's always the chance, however small, that a sky lantern can burn out of control. Use common sense when choosing a launch site. Here are just a few things to consider: [2] X Trustworthy Source National Fire Protection Association Nonprofit organization devoted to eliminating death, injury, property and economic loss due to fire, electrical and related hazards. Go to source Pick a spot free from obstruction. Parks and wide open fields are great for this purpose. There should be no trees, roofs, power lines, or other possible obstructions in the immediate area when you launch your sky lantern. Don't launch sky lanterns in areas where dry timber is present. Because of the small risk of fire, it's best not to launch sky lanterns where dead wood, foliage, or grass is present. Keep in mind that sky lanterns can drift fairly far before they land, and though the internal flame has usually burnt out by this point, there's still the risk that embers may remain. Finally, know your local laws. Don't launch sky lanterns in areas where it's illegal. [3] X Research source Most local jurisdictions have laws regarding fireworks and other types of entertainment involving open flame. Obey these laws - it's not worth getting a fine over."

      "content": "Launch during good weather. Sky lanterns are meant to hang tranquilly in the sky, providing a beautiful sight for miles around. Try to launch sky lanterns during calm, clear, still nights. Don't launch sky lanterns when there's a strong wind or a chance of rain. Inclement weather can put a damper on your festivities by making it difficult to launch a sky lantern in the first place or even knocking your balloon out of the sky."

      "title": "Open your lantern.",
      "content": "Open your lantern. When you're ready to launch your lantern, gently check to ensure the hole at the bottom of the balloon is open and the balloon material is secured to the frame. At this point, if you haven't done so, you may attach your candle or fuel-soaked rag by securing it to its seat at the bottom of the frame. For wire frames, this usually means pulling the wires through the center and twisting around the fuel source. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill your lantern with air.",
      "content": "Fill your lantern with air. Before launching, you want to ensure your balloon is fully inflated with air so that none of the material hangs inward. Not only does this make it easier to get the lantern off the ground, it also makes it less likely that the balloon's material will drift over the flame and catch fire. Grab the balloon by the bottom of its frame and gently swing the lantern back and forth (as you would with a trash bag) until it's full. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Light the fuel source.",
      "content": "Light the fuel source. Whether you're using a fuel-soaked towel, a candle, or another fuel source, it's time for ignition. Keeping the balloon vertical, light the fuel and allow the hot air from the flame to inflate the balloon. It may take a minute or two for your lantern to become buoyant - as you wait, hold on to the sides to keep the balloon open and vertical. [6] X Research source If you're worried about the possibility of your sky lantern immediately collapsing and burning up, don't be afraid to have a hose or a bucket of water on hand."

      "title": "Let go and enjoy!",
      "content": "Let go and enjoy! [7] X Research source Wait until you begin to feel a gentle upward tug, then simply let your balloon go - there's no need to throw it. Your sky lantern should float up into the night sky as it gives off a beautiful warm glow. Enjoy this peaceful, magical experience. If the thought of watching your sky lantern slowly drift out of view makes you sad, tie a light, non-flammable string to its frame so that you can hold on to it like a kite."

      "title": "Make a wish (optional).",
      "content": "Make a wish (optional). In some traditions, sky lanterns bear the wishes of the person or family who created them. If you or your family would like to partake in this fun tradition, you may make a wish as your lantern drifts into the sky or write your wish on the material of the lantern before you launch it."
