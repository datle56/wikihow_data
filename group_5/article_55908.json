      "content": "Pet the puppy to see if it has a dense, water-resistant coat. Run a hand over the puppy’s fur, stroking the dog’s back. Most standard, purebred Labrador Retrievers have a short, thick coat. If the puppy doesn’t have dense fur, there’s a good chance that they’re not a purebred Labrador. [1] X Research source Labradors were originally bred to hunt and retrieve waterfowl; today, their coats are still water-resistant."

      "title": "See if the puppy has a solid black, brown, or yellow coat.",
      "content": "See if the puppy has a solid black, brown, or yellow coat. Standard Labrador puppies come in 3 colors: black, chocolate brown, and varying shades of yellow. Check that the puppy is one of these colors and doesn’t have any patterns or markings of color on their fur, like stripes or splotches. Most Labrador puppies are completely solid in color, though they can sometimes have small patches of white on their chest or legs. [2] X Research source If your puppy is any other color or has distinctive markings, there’s a good chance that they’re a mixed-breed pup."

      "content": "Examine the puppy for a thick and sturdy tail. Look closely at your puppy’s tail to see if it’s thick at the base and then grows thinner towards the top. If it also has a rounded shape, like an otter’s tail, and is mostly straight, your puppy is likely a purebred. If the puppy’s tail is narrow, spindly, or very curved, they’re likely not a purebred. [3] X Research source The fur on a purebred Labrador’s tail is also short and thick. If the puppy’s tail has long, feathery hair, they’re probably not a purebred. Keep in mind that the pup’s tail becomes larger and thicker as they grow older."

      "content": "Look for an angular head with a moderately sized muzzle. Examine the puppy’s skull shape for a wide head that gradually slopes into a muzzle that’s neither long nor stubby. If the pup’s head is more triangular or has an especially long or short or short muzzle, there’s a possibility that your dog isn’t a purebred.

Purebred yellow and black labs typically have brown eyes, while chocolate labs often have hazel eyes. Some puppies also have yellow or green eyes, though they’re more rare. [5] X Research source Labrador’s eyes typically also have a kind, intelligent look to them. If the puppy has different colored eyes than brown or hazel, they’re likely not a pure Labrador."

If they’re set far back behind your pup’s eyes and only hang to the bottom of their jaw, they’re likely a purebred Labrador. If the puppy’s ears are rounded, stick straight up, or long, they’re probably not a pure Lab. [6] X Research source"

At around 8 weeks, purebred male and female Labradors weigh between 8 to 12 lbs (4-5 kg). Then, look at how tall they are. At this stage, both male and female labs stand at around 7 to 12 in (17-30 cm). [9] X Research source These weights and heights are average benchmarks, so a purebred or mixed lab might fall outside of these measurements. However, if the pup is already much bigger or smaller, there’s a greater chance that they’re not purebred. When Labrador Retrievers are fully grown, which is typically at the 1-year mark, male dogs weigh around 65 to 80 lbs (29-36 kg) and are 22.5 to 24.5 in (57-62 cm) tall. Female dogs weigh 55 to 70 lbs (25-32 kg) and stand about 21.5 to 23.5 in (55-60 cm) tall.

Go to source Purebred labs aren’t known for being shy, so if the puppy is slow to warm up to you, it might be a mixed breed. As their name suggests, Labrador Retrievers have a strong instinct to retrieve. If the pup chases after a toy, catches it, and brings it back to you, it might be a purebred! Most puppies are energetic and excitable in their first few months of life, so look for other characteristics to tell if your pup is purebred or not. As purebred Labs grow up, they still maintain their exuberant nature and eagerness to please."
