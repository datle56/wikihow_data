      "content": "Line the label with hemming tape . If you don’t want to risk damaging the garment by cutting off the label, use hemming tape to adhere the label to the garment entirely. Cut a few small pieces of tape and place them along the sides of the label. Then, iron down the hemming tape to secure the label in place. Now your label has no loose edges and is completely fastened to your garment. Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron could damage your item."

      "content": "Cut the label out as close to the seam as you can. Fashion designer Ira Lysa agrees that one of the best ways to remove labels from your clothes is to cut them off. Use a sharp pair of scissors and cut as close to the garment as possible without fraying the garment itself. A small strip of the label may remain behind, stitched into the seam. It’s possible that the freshly cut label may be itchy or irritating on the back of your neck. Some of the stiffer, more papery labels can cause this. After a few washings, the edge will likely soften; however, if you’re worried about this, avoid cutting the label off, using a tag comfort cover , or try a different method. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a piece of hemming tape the width of the label and place it on the seam. Opt to use iron-on, no-sew hemming tape for this. Place the hemming tape across the bottom of the label. Once it's in place, iron the tape down. This method is also great for smaller tags that can’t easily be cut off. Do not attempt this if your garment is made of a delicate fabric. The heat from the iron can damage your item."

      "title": "Use a seam ripper if it won't ruin the seam of the item.",
      "content": "Use a seam ripper if it won't ruin the seam of the item. Check for multiple tags or labels. Then, notice how the labels are attached to the garment. Is the label sewn into the same seam that holds the garment together? Look closely at the threads—if you pull out the tag stitching, will it cause the seam to loosen and unravel? [2] X Research source If there are multiple tags, start with the top tag when you begin the removal process. If the seam will loosen, avoid using a seam ripper (since doing so could damage your clothing) and opt to cut the label off."

      "content": "Push the tip of the seam ripper under one stitch. Make sure the seam ripper is resting on top of the label rather than underneath it when you begin. [3] X Research source Gently pull up with the seam ripper to cut through the thread. Pulling the top stitches out first lessens the chance of an accidental tear in your clothing. You can start anywhere, but it’s generally best to begin pulling stitches at the top right corner of the label."

[4] X Research source Be sure to be very gentle as you cut through the stitches so that you won’t damage your clothing with the sharp tip of your seam ripper. For a slightly faster removal, stop at about the halfway mark and pull the label up so you can see underneath."

      "content": "Remove the threads in between and underneath the tags, as needed. Wrap your finger around the tag to expose the stitches underneath. Your label will be loosened at this point, and you can get your seam ripper through the threads underneath it quickly and easily. Rip through those stitches and continue alternating until all of the stitching is removed. [5] X Research source Make sure to cut through each stitch."

      "content": "Keep the label to reference garment care information. One downside to removing a label is that most of them include care instructions for that particular item. Hang on to it if you think you’ll need it in the future. If you don’t want to keep the label, make a mental note or write the information down and keep it in a safe place."

Removing them with care is ideal so you don’t damage the garment. [7] X Research source Look for the best approach and point of entry to begin removal. Another common example of an outside tag is one that you see sewn into an outside seam on a garment. Use tiny cuticle scissors to cut these off since they are normally quite easy to remove."

      "content": "Hide or cover tags you can’t remove. Occasionally, you will have garments with outside labels that simply can’t be removed because doing so would damage the garment or because the label is part of the garment itself. In these cases, there are a few options: Check with a tailor or dry cleaning professional to see if they can remove it for you. If the label is on your sleeve cuff, you can roll up your sleeves. Outside labels on the back pockets of jeans can be covered with a long shirt or jacket. Try using an iron-on patch to cover the label."

Pull tight until the bag handle is wrapped around the base. Then, continue wrapping the handle around the tag until the needle in the tag releases. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that it may take 10 or 15 wraps for the tag to pop off."

Then, take another fork and wedge it between the other fork and tag with the prongs face up. Pry the second fork up to pop off the security tag. [11] X Research source This method may require a bit of finagling and a few attempts. Be aware that this method may trigger any dye that might be in the security tag. Proceed with caution."
