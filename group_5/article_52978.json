      "title": "For creatives.",
      "content": "For creatives. If you have a creative spirit, you likely want to meet someone who’s just as passionate about all things imagination. Highlight your talents, hobbies, and artistic interests in your bio. For example: “Hi, I’m [insert name]! One thing interesting about me is that I love ice skating. I’ve been skating since I was really little. My dad got me into it, and now I can’t stop! I’d love to have a partner I could skate with (and kick their butt in hockey).” “Fair warning: I’m a writer, and I’ll totally put you in my book (whether you’re the villain or dashing knight). You can find me playing with my dogs or baking when I'm not writing. I love spending time with friends and family, and I’m looking for a partner I can spend the rest of my life with.” “My name’s [insert name], and I’m an actress. So far, I’ve only done community theater, but my dream is to be on Broadway. But an even bigger dream is to have a family. I’m looking for someone just as enthusiastic and dramatic as me to start a family with.”"

      "title": "For jokesters",
      "content": "For jokesters If you’re the funniest in your friend group, think about going for a comedic profile bio to capture people’s attention. Not only is this a great way to make potential partners smile, but it’s also an excellent way to find others with like-minded humor. Try out one of these: “I’m looking for the Edward to my Bella, the Peeta to my Katniss, the Ron to my Hermione. Yeah, I’m that girl, and I’m not ashamed.” “So, you’ve also been forced into the online dating world because life sucks? Cool. Glad we’re here together. While I’ve got your attention, I’d just like to say that I love dogs, ice cream, and football. Do with that what you will.” “If you’re reading this, it means I hit rock bottom. I finally caved and made a dating profile. Don’t let my efforts be in vain. At least message me a ‘Hi’ or ‘What’s up?’”"
    },
    {
      "title": "For romantics.",
      "content": "For romantics. Don’t be afraid to get personal and sappy in your “About Me” section. If you’re looking for someone who can match your romantic vibe, what’s the harm? So, pour your heart and soul into your bio to capture the attention of other romantics. “I won’t lie, I’m incredibly sappy. If you bring me flowers, I’m yours. If you write me a sweet but poorly written poem, I’ll sob happy tears. I’m not hard to please, but I do need someone who will treat me like a queen.” “Hey, I’m [insert name], but all my friends call me Hopeless Romantic. What can I say? I’ve got a big, sappy heart and no one to fill it! At the end of the day, I want to find someone I can grow old with. I want that picket-fence life, no matter how cliché it sounds.” “My favorite holiday? Valentine’s Day. My favorite color? Lilac. My greatest passion? Giving excellent hugs.”"

    {
      "title": "For thrill seekers.",
      "content": "For thrill seekers. Do you love to travel or do daring stunts? If so, don’t forget to mention that in your bio! Your dating profile should express who you are, so don’t hide that daring part of yourself. Mention your interests, even if you think it’ll scare some away. Remember, it’ll also attract the right person. “When I’m not working as a nurse, you can catch me skiing, snowboarding, or skateboarding. I love sports and anything that sends me flying at full speed. What can I say? I live life to the fullest.” “One thing you should know about me is that I love to travel, and I’m on the hunt for a travel buddy (with a few romantic benefits, of course). I recently just went to Rome and loved every second. I’m open to new adventure ideas, so hit me up!” “Hi there! I’m [insert name] and want to see the world. I love history, and it’s always been my dream to find someone to come with me. Basically, I’m looking for the Aladdin to my Jasmine. So, can I show you the world?”"

    {
      "title": "For introverts.",
      "content": "For introverts. If you’re a bit shy or awkward, have no fear! You can cultivate your dating profile to show off your quirky personality and attract those with the same communication styles. Try being upfront about your likes and dislikes and being more introverted than the rest. Who knows? You may just find your soulmate. “Hey! It’s nice to meet you! I’m [insert name], and I’m a bit of an introvert. I prefer quiet nights reading, watching movies, or listening to music. I enjoy going to concerts and theaters, but I do need extra time to recharge afterward. I’m looking for another introverted person to match my energy. So, if you like these things too, message me!” “Creating a profile wasn’t exactly my idea. I’m an introvert and would much rather spend my Saturday nights curled up in bed with Ben and Jerry than out on the town looking for guys. But my friends say this will be good for me.” “Howdy! My name’s [insert name], and I’d describe myself as an awkward bean. I’m pretty introverted at first, but as you get to know me, I’m the most awkwardly expressive person you’ve met.”"

      "title": "For workaholics.",
      "content": "For workaholics. If your main love is for your job, don’t be afraid to express that. Believe it or not, dating apps and websites are a great place to find like-minded people. Who knows? You may just match with someone who’s as dedicated to their career as you! “If my name sounds familiar, you’re not going crazy. I’m the owner of a not-so-little company that’s taken the internet by storm. I’m pretty proud, but I’m also pretty lonely. I need someone who isn’t afraid of my success and is willing to stand by my side no matter what.” “My friends call me a workaholic, but is loving what you do really all that bad? I’ve got a big heart but an empty house. I’m looking for someone who can make me laugh and isn’t afraid to let their woman be independent.” “Hi! My name is [insert name] and I’m a small business owner. Working from home, I’m pretty much always on the clock, but I’m ready to take a little time for myself. So, I thought, ‘Why not try this online dating stuff?’ I’m 34. I have no kids but a husky who loves going on hikes. I can also name every team in the NFL (but maybe that’s a weird flex).”"

      "content": "Your wants and needs. What do you want most in a partner? What do you need in a relationship? These things are great to put in your bio because they help attract others who want the same things or can provide your needs. [1] X Research source For example, perhaps you need someone who’s a good listener, loves Star Wars , or enjoys takeout."

      "title": "What you have to offer.",
      "content": "What you have to offer. In a relationship, what do you bring to the table? Determine what makes you catch and lead with that!

      "title": "Your personality.",
      "content": "Your personality. Double-check that your profile showcases your incredible personality. Have a friend read your bio—does it embody you? [2] X Research source If not, it may be time to go back to the drawing board. After all, your profile should be a representation of you, not a bunch of clichés. [3] X Research source This could mean throwing in a joke or fun fact, or writing like you talk in real life."

      "title": "Pick strong photos that show your personality.",
      "content": "Pick strong photos that show your personality. When creating a dating profile , it’s important to make a good impression. Your profile photos are the first thing potential matches will see, so choose wisely! Follow these tips for success: [4] X Research source Use images that showcase you doing what you love. If you like to run, add a picture of you completing a marathon. If you like to bake, add a selfie of you with a cupcake you made. Opt for full-body cameo shots rather than selfies. While 1 or 2 selfies never hurt anyone, adding too many to your profile can give off the wrong vibe. Skip pictures with friends. It can be confusing to know who’s who in a group picture (especially if it’s the first picture someone is seeing of you). When it comes to the order of your photos, dating and relationship coach Suzanna Mathews recommends putting your strongest picture first (the one that showcases you best) and the second best last. This way, they start and end with a gorgeous photo of you."

      "content": "Sell yourself to potential partners. At the end of the day, a dating profile is a pitch to sell yourself. Think of it like an advertisement. What can you say about yourself in your profile to get the most bids? Don’t be afraid to include numerous hobbies and interests—there’s no way to share too much! [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be positive but specific.",
      "content": "Be positive but specific. While there may be things you don’t want in a partner, try to avoid being negative. Having a positive attitude helps you come across as friendly and approachable, especially online. [6] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “Don’t even bother swiping if you just want a one-night stand,” you could try, “I’m looking for a lifelong partner who’s ready to settle down.”"

      "title": "State your intentions.",
      "content": "State your intentions. Relationship coach Maya Diamond says it’s best to explain why you’re on a dating app right away to avoid confusion later on. Somewhere in your profile, describe what led you to the app or website. You can be brief! A simple “My friends thought it’d be a good idea for me to put myself out there” or “I’m looking for a hook-up” get the point across."

      "title": "Be unique.",
      "content": "Be unique. We know filling out a dating profile can seem tedious, but try to answer all the questions honestly and personally. Avoid clichés like “I don’t know” or simply “I like __.” Provide details about you and your life. The more you can say about yourself in your profile, the better. [7] X Research source For instance, instead of simply writing, “I like traveling,” try, “I spent my senior year in Spain and have caught the travel bug ever since! My latest adventure brought me to Italy, and I hope to go to Japan next.” As a general rule, write what’s true to you rather than what you think people want to hear."

      "content": "Stay true to yourself. Diamond explains it best, “The most important thing is to make a profile that represents your interests, lifestyle, and personality.” When in doubt, go with your gut. While a dating profile is an “advertisement” for yourself, it also represents you. Be yourself to attract people you’d like."
