      "content": "Change the charger you're using. If you're not using an Apple-brand charger or a high-quality, Apple-approved third-party charger, there's a chance that your charger could be the culprit of your phone getting too hot. Try replacing your charger with an Apple one or an MFi (Made For iPhone) charger by brands like Anker, Belkin, Scosche, Nomad, or AmazonBasics. [1] X Research source You can tell if an accessory has MFi certification by looking for the \"Made For iPhone\" logo on the packaging."

      "title": "Stop using a wireless charger.",
      "content": "Stop using a wireless charger. Wireless chargers generate more heat than standard chargers, so if you use one you may notice your phone is warmer than normal. Try swapping to a standard charging cable, or purchase a wireless charger with built-in cooling to reduce the excess heat generated from charging,"

      "title": "Don't use your phone while it's charging.",
      "content": "Don't use your phone while it's charging. Using your phone takes up energy, and while doing basic tasks like sending a text or checking your email likely won't ramp up the temperature of your phone while it's charging, doing intensive tasks like playing games or recording videos will make your phone hotter."

      "title": "Take your phone case off to increase ventilation.",
      "content": "Take your phone case off to increase ventilation. If your phone case isn't properly ventilated, it can cause heating issues with your device due to blocked vents. Your iPhone also dissipates heat from the back plate, which can get trapped between your phone and the case, causing the phone to stay warm. Try removing your phone case while charging to see if it lowers the temperature of your device."

      "title": "Don't allow your phone to charge in a high-temperature environment.",
      "content": "Don't allow your phone to charge in a high-temperature environment. Phones naturally get warm when they charge, but this can be exacerbated by extremely high temperatures. If you're trying to charge your phone in a hot room you may notice that your device has a hard time cooling off. Try letting the phone's temperature come back to normal and charge it in a room that is room temperature (between 68 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit)."

      "title": "Replace your phone's battery.",
      "content": "Replace your phone's battery. If your phone is constantly overheating (turning off) while charging, you may have a damaged battery. Contact Apple or head to an Apple Store to talk to an associate for help. You can also contact one of your local phone repair shops that specialize in Apple products if you'd rather not go through Apple directly. If you're tech savvy, you might be able to replace the battery yourself. However, if you do this it will void your iPhone's warranty, so consider this before trying to replace it yourself."
