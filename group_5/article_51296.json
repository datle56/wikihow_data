      "content": "Burning sage isn’t specifically mentioned in the Bible. Burning sage or smudging is the practice of burning a bundle of herbs (typically sage, cedar, or lavender) to purify or bless a space. This ancient spiritual practice is deeply rooted in native and religious cultures, but it’s not directly mentioned in the Bible. [1] X Research source While smudging isn’t stated in the Bible specifically, God does instruct Moses to burn a blend of herbs and spices as an offering: “The Lord said to Moses, ‘Take sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense (of each shall there be an equal part), and make an incense blended as by the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy” (Exodus 30:34-35).

      "content": "The Bible states that faith should always be in God, not objects. While the Bible may not mention smudging directly, it does offer insight into the essence of the spiritual practice. Burning sage is often done to ward off evil spirits and cleanse negative energy. The Bible says the Lord should be responsible for such things, not a deity, ritual, or object. As Ephesians 6:10-18 explains, the armor of God (faith in the Lord) is all one needs to conquer evil: “take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arouse of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Burning incense symbolizes prayers in the Bible. While burning incense and sage are different practices, they have similar spiritual meanings. Christians believe that burning incense is a visual representation of prayers rising into Heaven: [4] X Research source “May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice” (Psalm 141:2).

      "title": "Scripture does not encourage or forbid burning sage.",
      "content": "Scripture does not encourage or forbid burning sage. In the Christian faith, smudging is a matter of conscience and personal choice. Because the Bible does not directly state whether or not burning sage is a sin, Christians can make their own choice on the matter based on their personal beliefs and interpretations. At the end of the day, it’s the intent behind the practice that makes it a sin or not. [6] X Research source For instance, some may believe smudging is a sin because it's often used in witchcraft and pagan practices; however, others may find its spiritual benefits help them feel closer to the Lord. Know that there’s nothing wrong with burning sage for non-spiritual reasons. You can simply burn the herb because you enjoy the smell or aroma it gives off."

      "content": "The Bible may not specifically talk about smudging or burning sage, but it often mentions the practice of burning incense. Take a look at these Bible verses and think about how you may interpret them: “which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant” (Hebrews 9:4). [7] X Research source “olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense” (Exodus 25:6). [8] X Research source “Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the altar every morning when he tends the lamps. He must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the Lord for the generations to come” (Exodus 30:7-8). [9] X Research source “And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people” (Revelation 5:8). [10] X Research source “The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand” (Revelation 8:4). [11] X Research source “he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside” (Luke 1:9-10). [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Sage is used to cleanse negative energy. Burning sage or smudging is one of the oldest spiritual practices. Many believe smoking a bundle of sage (or other herbs) can cleanse a person or space of unwanted energy or spirits. Sage smoke is believed to be antibacterial and extremely absorbent, helping release negative toxins and improve mood. [13] X Research source Scientifically, sage has been linked to helping naturally prevent, reduce, and control health problems like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and cancer; however, more studies are needed to explore the topic.

      "content": "Burning sage isn’t always an act of witchcraft. While the spiritual practice has roots in pagan history, it isn’t always used to cast spells or perform rituals. For many, burning sage is simply a way to make a space smell good. There doesn’t have to be any spiritual intention behind the act. Remember that, as a Christian, you have the freedom to exercise your own beliefs, as long as it’s to “serve one another in love” (Galatians 5:13). [15] X Research source"
