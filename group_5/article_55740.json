Your Scorpio woman will always make sure to set aside time to connect with you—whether that means planning a romantic evening or sending a cute goodnight text. Make your Scorpio feel like she’s a priority, too. Set aside a regular “date night” time and respond quickly whenever she reaches out. These signs take a while to warm up to their partner, and they need reassurance that you’re totally dependable."

      "content": "Scorpios are incredibly focused people, especially around their partners. If you spend time with a Scorpio lover, she’ll make you feel like you two are in your own little world. Forget beeping notifications, background noise, and distractions. She’ll be totally dialed into you. Match her energy by leaving your phone on silent and making lots of eye contact when you two talk. Most of a Scorpio’s intensity comes from the fact that they’re ruled by Mars—the planet of action and passion."

      "content": "A Scorpio in love will turn her signature “Scorpio stare” into total doe eyes. Scorpios are known for their powerful eye contact, but once they’re smitten, their normally piercing stare will melt into a soft, caring gaze. Your Scorpio woman look right into your eyes when you two talk. You might even catch her stealing quick glances from across the room. Look a Scorpio woman straight in the eye when you communicate with her. Since Scorpios are naturally suspicious signs, it’s important for her to realize you’re never going to hide anything from her."

      "title": "Scorpio women bring passion and heat into any romantic relationship.",
      "content": "Scorpio women bring passion and heat into any romantic relationship. Because they’re ruled by Mars , they’re pretty physical people. A smitten scorpion will find every possible excuse to curl up next to you, touch you, and kiss you. In the bedroom, Scorpios are equally intense, but because they’re water signs, they crave emotional intimacy alongside physical intimacy. Scorpios are highly sexually compatible with earth signs like Taurus and Capricorn. Earth signs provide the steadiness and emotional connection that water signs, like Scorpio, want during sex. You can be compatible with a Scorpio regardless of your sign as long as you communicate about what you like and don’t like (both in and out of the bedroom)."

      "content": "Scorpios get a bad rap for being “cold,” but they just need time. You’ll know a Scorpio woman loves you when she feels like she can be vulnerable with you. The second she starts to let you in on her hopes, dreams, and secrets during late-night chats or text convos, there’s no going back! To a Scorpio, sharing personal info is a huge sign of trust and love. Be accountable and upfront with your Scorpio woman about what you want from the relationship and who you are. She’ll open up to you faster if she thinks you’re trustworthy and solid."

If you catch your Scorpio woman writing you poetic love notes or stealing your favorite hoodie, she’s head over heels in love.

      "content": "As fixed signs, Scorpio women won’t just take anyone’s advice. So if a Scorpio woman takes the time to listen to your input, it means she thinks you’re special. Look for moments when she changes her mind because of something you’ve said or makes a slightly out-of-character choice because of your guidance. Hold off on giving a Scorpio woman advice unless she asks for your input. These determined and creative people definitely like to solve problems themselves."
