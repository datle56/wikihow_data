      "content": "Yes, but expect to pay more for shipping. It’s easier than ever to purchase products from Japan, but it still requires some extra steps. Many Japanese companies don’t ship outside of the country. If they do, shipping will cost extra. [1] X Research source Before you check out online, make sure to look at the shipping options and prices. Factor shipping costs into your budget when you are looking to make a purchase. Those costs can add up quickly."

      "title": "Yes, but payment and language barriers can be tricky.",
      "content": "Yes, but payment and language barriers can be tricky. Many Japanese companies don’t accept international credit cards as a valid form of payment. This can make it hard to figure out how to make a purchase. A lot of websites are also only in Japanese, so unless you can read that language you might struggle to find the products you want. While Google translate can help with this a little bit, it’s still really difficult to navigate websites in Japanese if you’re not fluent. For security, if you don't understand what the website says about payment and ordering, don't use it. Find a site where you can understand the terms."

      "title": "Consider a borderless multi-currency account for payment.",
      "content": "Consider a borderless multi-currency account for payment. Look for a company that offers international personal banking accounts. Wise is one of the most trusted of these companies. You can set up an account that will allow you to keep multiple currencies in your digital wallet. Use this account to convert your money to the Japanese Yen and use the debit card from this account to order goods from Japan. [2] X Research source This will allow you to avoid losing money on the conversion rates if the exchange rate isn't favorable. When it's time to submit payment, just enter your debit card number in the same way you would enter any other payment information. This is a secure way to make payments, as these online banks have to follow traditional banking protocols."

Use the filter tool on the site (found in the column on the left-hand side of the screen) to select “International Shipping Eligible”. [4] X Research source Be aware that when you checkout, the price will be in JPY (the Japanese yen). It’s also good to know that there is an import fee that will also be included in the final total. Once you hit \"Checkout\" you will be able to see the breakdown of all of the shipping and import (customs) costs. Before your order is submitted, you'll have the option to customize your shipping options. For example, you can choose standard shipping if you want the cheapest option."

      "content": "A buying service is a great option for buying items that don’t ship to you. Since it can be tricky to order from Japan if you don’t live there, you can use a buying service that acts as a middleman. Basically, you are paying the buying service to purchase the product you want and ship it to you. [5] X Research source A buying service can handle the payments for you and once they receive the product, they will ship it to you. Be prepared to pay a fee for this service, as well as shipping costs. Some of the most popular buying services are Zen Market, From Japan, and Dejapan. Read reviews before you choose a company to make sure it has a solid reputation. You should also check out the FAQ page so that you can make sure the terms and services are acceptable to you."
