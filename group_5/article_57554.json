      "content": "Decide if you want to use an avatar creator or make a completely custom avatar. If this is your first time using VRChat, you won't be able to make a completely custom avatar just yet. However, if VRChat has cleared you to make a custom avatar, consider the following when making your decision: Account type and rank: You must have a VRChat account (not a Steam, Oculus, or Viveport account) with the trust rank of \"New User\" to make a custom avatar. [1] X Research source To get a higher trust rank, keep using VRChat until you get upgraded to \"New User\" status. Time investment: Creating a custom avatar will take longer than using an avatar creator. If you want to get into VRChat sooner, you may want to opt for the avatar creator. Also, if you don't know how to use Unity, a software development kit (SDK), or 3D modeling software, it will take longer to make a custom avatar as you learn how to use the tools. Skill: Making a custom avatar involves using Unity, the VRChat SDK, and 3D modeling software. If you don't know how to use these tools, making a custom avatar will be a bit more difficult (but not impossible if you can dedicate time to learning). In this section of the article we'll mainly be covering how to use an avatar creator to get your first avatar into VRChat. Later we will discuss how to use 3D modeling software to make your own avatar."
