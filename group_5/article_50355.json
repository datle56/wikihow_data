      "content": "You won’t risk breaking your lenses if you support your frames. Use your non-dominant hand to pinch the bridge of your glasses between the lenses. Do your best not to touch or put pressure on the lenses so you don’t break them. You’ll use your dominant hand to make your adjustments. [1] X Research source Put a glasses cleaning cloth over the lenses to prevent smudges just in case your hand brushes against them."

      "content": "You can easily move the nose pads without tools. If you need to fix your glasses quickly, you can make minor adjustments by hand. Put your thumb on the side of the pad that touches your nose and your pointer finger on the back side. [2] X Research source Be gentle when you’re adjusting your pads by hand since they’ll be easier to break."

      "title": "Pliers give you the best grip and the least risk of damage.",
      "content": "Pliers give you the best grip and the least risk of damage. Nose pad pliers have a small gap so they fit perfectly around your nose pad when you grip it. Line the gap on the pliers up with where your frames connect to the nose pad and squeeze the handles together firmly. [3] X Research source You can get nose pad pliers in a glasses repair kit or online."

      "title": "A wider space between the pads also keeps them from pinching your nose.",
      "content": "A wider space between the pads also keeps them from pinching your nose. If your nose pads sit high up and feel tight on your nose, use your thumb or the pliers to gently move the nose pad toward the frame arm. Move one nose pad at a time when you make your adjustments. [4] X Research source Only make a slight adjustment at a time. Even just moving the pad a few millimeters can make a world of difference."

      "title": "A narrower gap prevents your glasses from sliding down further.",
      "content": "A narrower gap prevents your glasses from sliding down further. If you always have to push your glasses back up on your face because they slip off, then the nose pads are too wide. Carefully pull the nose pad toward the center of your frames and away from the lens. [5] X Research source Be careful not to bring the nose pads too close together, or else they could pinch your nose and be painful to wear."

      "title": "Your glasses will sit crooked if the nose pads are uneven.",
      "content": "Your glasses will sit crooked if the nose pads are uneven. Hold your glasses up at eye level and check if the nose pads look symmetrical. If one looks further in or out than the other, take a second to bend them into the correct position so the pads are in the same position on each side. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Testing how your glasses fit keeps you from overworking the nose pads. Even after the slightest adjustment, your glasses may fit a lot better. Check how the frames look in a mirror and see if they feel more comfortable on your face. If you still feel like they’re not a perfect fit, take them off and make another small adjustment to the nose pads before trying again. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Crooked nose pads could dig into your nose and be uncomfortable.",
      "content": "Crooked nose pads could dig into your nose and be uncomfortable. When you put your glasses on, check if the fronts of the nose pads are flush against your nose. If they look uneven or one end of the nose pad digs into your nose, take off your glasses and adjust them slightly to the side so they fit better. [8] X Research source Even if the nose pads are crooked and aren’t bothering you, you’ll start to feel more pressure on your nose the longer you wear them."

      "title": "New nose pads will make your glasses feel more comfortable.",
      "content": "New nose pads will make your glasses feel more comfortable. Your nose pads will either screw or snap into your frames so they’re easy to replace . For screw-in pads, use a small screwdriver to loosen the screw on the back of the nose pad to remove it. Then, slide the new one into place and screw it back in. For snap-on pads, simply pry the old one out with a flathead screwdriver or butter knife, and push the new pad into the socket. You can buy replacement nose pads in a glasses repair kit or online. Replacing your pads with wider ones can also help if your frames sit too low on your face."

      "title": "Your frames may be the culprit if your nose pads fit well.",
      "content": "Your frames may be the culprit if your nose pads fit well. Hold the arm of your glasses just before it starts curving down to support your frames. Use your other hand to gently bend the end of the arm down if your glasses slip down or up if the arm doesn’t reach around your ear. [9] X Research source Avoid bending your glasses near the hinges since you could easily snap them."

If your glasses still aren’t fitting perfectly and you don’t want to risk damaging them, contact an optician and ask if they’ll make the adjustments for you. When you go in, your optician will use special tools to make sure the glasses sit evenly and comfortably on your face."
