[2] X Research source Be on the lookout specifically for water bucket symbols, which provide wash instructions. If you notice any circle symbols, the garment is likely dry-clean only. Get the stain treated at your local dry cleaner rather than attempting to fix it at home."

Gorgis notes that “butter and/or oil stains both leave a greasy texture on clothing,” so it’s important to “first use a dry paper towel to wipe away as much of the stain as possible.” [3] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. If a big clump of butter is stuck on the fabric, use something with a flat edge (like the back of a knife) to clear away the extra grease."

Then, stick the clothing item in the wash at the hottest temperature allowed by your care label. [4] X Research source Liquid detergent, body wash, and hand soap can also work well for this. Give the garment a chance to air-dry once it’s clean. Gorgis notes that “you can also use a mixture of warm water and vinegar and spray it directly on the stain. Let it sit for a few minutes and then drop the item in the wash with warm water and regular laundry detergent.” [5] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021."

      "content": "If the stain is pretty new, pour a layer of baking soda on top of the butter stain. Wait 5–10 minutes for it to soak up the grease before working the baking soda into the fabric with a toothbrush. Chances are, the powder will turn brown—just clear it off, apply more baking soda, and repeat the same cycle. When the baking soda no longer turns brown, stick the clothing item in the washer at the hottest permissible temperature. [6] X Research source According to Gorgis, you can also use “baking soda mixed with a little bit of warm water” to clean butter stains. “Brush the mixture into the grease stain in a circular motion until you see the stain subside.” [7] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021."

Materials like spandex, polyester, cotton, linen, Lycra, and canvas are all safe bets."

If the stain is super fresh, let the cornstarch sit for 5 minutes before dusting it off. If the stain is older, wait at least 1 hour (or even overnight) before clearing away the extra powder. [11] X Research source Ideally, the powder will absorb and remove the powder without the need for any washing. If the stain is still there, apply more cornstarch to the stain (and potentially let it sit for longer than the first time). If necessary, hand wash your delicate items to remove stubborn stains after treating them with cornstarch."
