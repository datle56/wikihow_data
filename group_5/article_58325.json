      "content": "Use stickers to help locate each note if you're a beginner. If you’re just starting out learning the piano and haven’t memorized which key plays which note (or if you just need a friendly reminder), it might help to put little stickers on each key. Write each note (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) on a separate sticker and place them on the corresponding keys. [1] X Research source Then, if you know how to read sheet music, print out a copy for yourself. Place the stickers on the end of the keys that are closest to you so that you can see them better. Don’t write directly on the keys themselves. This might damage your piano. “Chopsticks” doesn’t require you to play any of the black keys, so just make stickers for the white keys. Print out this PDF file of the sheet music for “Chopsticks.” If you don’t know how to read sheet music, simply write down the letters of the notes you’ll be playing in order and use that as a reference."

      "content": "Position your index fingers so that the outsides rest on the keys. Turn your hands sideways so that your pinkies are closest to the keyboard. Place your left index finger on the F key in the center of the keyboard and place your right index finger on the G key directly next to it. You’ll use your two index fingers to play the entire song and press down on the keys as though you’re chopping something. In fact, that’s where this fun song gets its iconic name. [2] X Research source Another option is to play the song with your pinkies, which was how the composer, Euphemia Allen, originally intended for this song to be played. To play with your pinkies, curl your hands into fists and stick out your pinky fingers. Rest the outsides of your fingers on the keys and bring them down in a chopping motion to play each note."

      "title": "Count 1, 2, 3 repeatedly to get the timing down.",
      "content": "Count 1, 2, 3 repeatedly to get the timing down. “Chopsticks” is a waltz written with a 3/4 time signature. [3] X Research source This means that each measure has 3 beats. To get the proper timing down for the tune, count 1, 2, 3 out loud or in your head repeatedly and make sure that the intervals between each number are the same length. Another option to keep time is to use a metronome . Either use a mechanical metronome , a digital metronome , or even a metronome app. Set your metronome at around 80 bpm (beats per minute) when you’re starting out. This speed is slow enough to let you get the hang of playing the notes."
