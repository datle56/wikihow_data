      "content": "Add an essential oil. If you want to add a nice fragrance to your natural moisturizer, add 4 to 5 drops of essential oil to your mixing bowl.

      "title": "Apply the moisturizer.",

      "title": "Let the mask set.",
      "content": "Let the mask set. Depending on what natural ingredients you used, your mask may begin to dry out quickly or remain wet and lotion-like. If you're using the oatmeal-fennel mask, leave the mask on your face for 20 minutes. If you're using the avocado mask, let it set for 10 to 15 minutes. [10] X Research source Most moisturizing masks won't dry out as much as facial masks designed for oily skin. If your skin seems irritated or begins to dry out, remove the mask immediately."

      "content": "Rinse off the mask. Use tepid water to gently wash off the mask using your fingertips.

      "title": "Switch your moisturizers.",
      "content": "Switch your moisturizers. Since you can easily control what oils you use when you make your own moisturizers, you can adjust your moisturizer as the season's change. If you find that your natural moisturizer isn't keeping your skin hydrated through a very dry winter, try swapping the oil you're using for a thicker one (like shea or cocoa butter). [13] X Research source Remember to switch back to a lighter oil when the seasons change and the temperatures rise."
