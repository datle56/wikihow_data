      "content": "Shut off the water supply to make sure no more water flows into your toilet. Find the supply line leading away from the tank and into the floor or wall, instructs Schuelke. Look for the valve, which is generally a small knob found on the wall or floor near the toilet. Turn the knob completely counterclockwise to turn off the water supply and allow the toilet to drain. Be careful not to break the valve or the pipe if you’re in a really old house. Hold the base of the valve with one hand and turn it with the other."

      "content": "Flushing the toilet should clear water out of your toilet tank. Schuelke says you just press down on the handle the same way you normally would when flushing. Hold down and keep pressing on the flush valve until all the water drains from your toilet tank. If the water starts refilling, double-check that you’ve fully rotated the shutoff valve. Make sure you twist it as far as you can (in a counterclockwise direction) to switch off the water supply. If the toilet knob will not shut off properly, try temporarily shutting off the water supply to your house ."

      "content": "Getting rid of residual tank water can save you extra clean-up later. There will be a very thin layer of water at the bottom of the tank. If you do want the tank 100% empty, grab a big sponge or dry towel and blot all of the water up. You can skip this step if you’re replacing the entire toilet (the little bit of water left in the tank will evaporate over time). If you’re disassembling the toilet, though, you’ll save a bit of cleanup time by soaking the water up."

      "content": "There’s always a little bit of a mess when you drain the bowl. This is one of those simple DIY jobs that’s going to involve a little cleanup—no matter how careful you are, the process can be a little messy. Lay down a tarp or some old towels near the base of the toilet. This will soak up any water that spills out during the process. Throw some rubber gloves on, too. Getting toilet water on your hands is a little icky—even if the toilet is relatively clean."

      "title": "Force flushing is the easiest way to remove most of the water.",
      "content": "Force flushing is the easiest way to remove most of the water. Pour 3 gallons (11 L) of water into the bowl. It may seem counterproductive, but pouring a few gallons of water from the sink or tub will force the water through the drain. Lift the lid of the toilet and slowly pour the water into the bowl, lifting the bucket as you pour. This method will draw the water out of the bowl. [1] X Research source If pouring slowly doesn’t do the trick, quickly dump the remaining water in the bucket into the bowl, as sudden action can help the water drain."

      "title": "The force flush may leave some residual water pooled in the bowl.",
      "content": "The force flush may leave some residual water pooled in the bowl. Grab a wad of paper towels or a sponge. Press this on the bottom of the bowl to soak up any remaining water. [2] X Research source You can also plunge the water down the drain by using a traditional plunger. A turkey baster can also remove all of the water if you’re in a pinch. If you are 100% dedicated to not touching any water, use a garden hose to siphon the water into a bucket. Put your finger on the end of a hose, insert the other end into the bowl, and remove your thumb once the hose is over a bucket to drain it out."
