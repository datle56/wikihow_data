      "title": "Make sure that you have cable installed.",
      "content": "Make sure that you have cable installed. If a Comcast representative didn't come to your house to install cable, you'll need to call Comcast and request the installation. If you call Comcast, be sure to have your account information and ID on-hand."

      "title": "Confirm that you have the correct cables.",
      "content": "Confirm that you have the correct cables. If your TV is an HDTV, you can use an HDMI cable to connect your Comcast box to your TV; if not, you'll need standard A/V cables (the red, yellow, and white cables) to connect the box to your TV. [1] X Research source The cable box should come with A/V cables. You can usually buy HDMI cables for under $15 online or in a tech store."

      "content": "Turn off and unplug your TV. Press your TV's \"Power\" button (or the \"Power\" button on the TV's remote), then remove the plug from the back of the TV. Leave the TV's power cable plugged into the wall during the setup process."

      "title": "Place the cable box near the back of the TV.",
      "content": "Place the cable box near the back of the TV. It's good to have a general idea of where the cable box will go before you start plugging in wires, so make sure the box is roughly where you want it before continuing."

      "content": "Attach the Comcast coaxial cable to the box. Find the cable that Comcast installed—it will usually be sticking out of the floor or the wall behind your TV—and plug it into the metal coaxial input in the back of the cable box, then screw the connector clockwise to tighten it. [2] X Research source The cable's end has an attachment resembling a needle in the middle of it. Your cable box should have a coaxial cable included. If Comcast didn't install a cable for you, you can attach the other end of this cable to the coaxial input in the wall."

      "content": "Plug in one end of the HDMI cable. It goes in the wide, narrow port in the back of the cable box. On most Comcast cable boxes, the HDMI port is either in the bottom-right corner of the box or at the bottom of the box's back. [3] X Research source If you're using A/V cables instead, plug each cable into the same-colored port on the back of the box (e.g., plug the yellow cable into the yellow input)."

[4] X Research source If you have a receiver with multiple HDMI ports plugged into your TV, you can plug your cable box's HDMI cable into the receiver instead. If you're using A/V cables instead, plug the cables into the same-colored ports on the back of your TV."
