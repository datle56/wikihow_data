      "content": "Find a reference photo. It will be much easier to pick out the correct colors if you have a photo to look at, as well as help with the shape and shading. You can use a picture of your own eye or one from the internet. If you're having difficulty drawing the eye shape, look at drawing books and do a lot of practicing. With time, you'll be able to draw it."

      "content": "Draw the outline for your eye using a regular pencil. Pay attention to the size of the tear duct and waterline, as this will be important for making it look realistic. Also notice areas where there are glared or reflective spots; you should draw these areas out so you know to avoid coloring inside them. If you plan to go back over light areas afterwards with something such as a white gel pen, only draw out the largest light spots."

      "content": "Pick out which colors you plan to use. Be sure to test them out before using them to make sure they match your reference photo. Having a white pencil will help you blend over areas if you make a mistake. Don't sharpen the pencils too much, as the tip is more likely to break if it is at a very sharp point. When you're starting, it's usually a good idea to have a color wheel with the different tones and colors so you can mix and match them until you get to the desired colors for the eye."
