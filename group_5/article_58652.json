      "content": "Improve your breathing techniques and diaphragm control with these three exercises: Hissing: Take a deep breath and expel the air by hissing for as long as possible. Imagine the air seeping out of your lungs, like air seeping out of a balloon. Ahhh: Take a deep breath and expel the air by saying “ahhh” for as long as possible. This usually takes less time than the hissing version. Again, imagine the air leaving your lungs and being pushed into the room. HA!: Take a deep breath and expel all of the air with a sudden, forceful, “HA!” sound. Repeat, gradually getting louder and louder."
