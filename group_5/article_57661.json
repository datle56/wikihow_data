Pinch with both hands starting by placing your thumb and forefingers about four inches apart. Then \"pinch\" down to about half the distance. Then grab the next couple of inches a finger at a time allowing the previous grab to slide under your thumb. Your forefingers end up crawling and your thumb keeps the \"roll\" in check and sliding forward. The easiest area to do this is side by side the spine, but not on it. You end (or don't begin) when it is difficult to grab a roll."
