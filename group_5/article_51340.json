      "content": "The dolls are more valuable if the box, doll, and adoption papers are intact. One of the factors that can push the value of a Cabbage Patch Kid doll from the hundreds to the thousands is if the doll comes with the original box, birth certificate, and adoption papers, and if the doll itself and its original clothing have limited damage or staining. [1] X Research source The original “Little People” dolls are also more valuable if their adoption papers, original clothes, birth certificate, and Xavier Roberts signature are intact. The values of Cabbage Patch Kid dolls vary wildly—the average doll might sell for $20 to $500. However, if the right collector comes along, you may be able to sell it for even more money. For more information, you can also join the Cabbage Patch Collector’s Club to communicate with other collectors and buy or sell your doll. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Transitional dolls or 1980s dolls made by Coleco can also be valuable. The earliest dolls were renamed from “Little People Originals” and have a different head mold than those produced after the 1990s, so they tend to sell for more money. Mint-condition transitional dolls produced by Hasbro or Coleco in 1989 might also be more valuable than other dolls. [4] X Research source Hasbro acquired Cabbage Patch Kids in 1989—transitional dolls were those that circulated during this period. These dolls tend to be more valuable because the Kids might have Coleco head molds and Hasbro bodies and clothes. [5] X Research source"

Every mass-marketed Cabbage Patch Kid doll has a number printed on the back of its head, which indicates the mold design. [7] X Research source Coleco molds include numbers 1 through 49 (there is no 7 or 13), and the rare molds include “Brat” faces from 1983 (they tend to go for $100 to $500). Growing Hair, Designer Line, Sippin’ Kid, and Talking Kid dolls might also be rare because they have unique head molds. Dolls that were recalled, like the mechanized Snacktime Cabbage Patch Kid dolls, might also be worth a couple of hundred dollars or more, depending on the condition. Prototype dolls that are made out of a slightly different material than newer or older dolls are super rare and tend to sell for thousands of dollars. [8] X Research source"
