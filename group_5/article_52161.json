Unhook any levers or tabs that are holding the filter in place and gently pull the dirty filter out. Most filters come out with little effort, but heavy grease build-up may cause some filters to stick. Slide a butter knife around the edges to loosen up a stubborn filter. [2] X Research source Depending on your range hood, your filter might have handles you can grab and slide backward to pull it out. Other filters might have tabs to pinch in order to slide out. If you have trouble removing your grease filter, consult your owner’s manual or visit the manufacturer's website to find information for your specific make and model."

[4] X Research source If your sink isn’t big enough, use a sponge to saturate the filter before you add the baking soda. You can also use a deep sheet pan or container instead of the sink. Instead of dish soap and baking soda, place a dishwasher tab in hot water and let the filter soak for a couple of hours. [5] X Research source Alternatively, boil water with 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of dish soap and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of baking soda. Pour the cleaning solution over the filter.
