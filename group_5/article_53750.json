For larger diameter holes, use a template or draw a precise circle that corresponds exactly with the diameter of the hole you’re drilling.

[4] X Research source Make sure the drill bit is specifically designed for drilling through granite and that it can handle the depth of drilling your application requires. Diamond core drill bits have a good reputation for drilling through granite with ease; a good one should be able to get through a ¾-inch (1.9 cm) slab in less than a minute."

      "content": "Begin drilling at a steady speed. Some drill bit manufacturers recommend using water to cool and lubricate the drill bit while drilling. Others say you won’t need to do that for their bits. Either way, water will serve to reduce the amount of granite dust in the air. If you use water, form a dam around the drilling area using plumbers putty. If you don’t use water, you can have someone use a shop vac to vacuum the granite dust as you drill."
