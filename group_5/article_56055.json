      "content": "Visit the Java home page. Java installs system files which all browsers use, so there is no need to follow special instructions for specific browsers. You can get to the Java installer from the Java home page. The Java installer will download files during the installation process. If you need to install Java on a device without a network connection, download the Offline Installer, available on the Manual Downloads page. Depending on your browser settings, you may need to accept the Java installation download before it begins. For Mac OS X 10.6, Java comes preinstalled. For OS X 10.7 and above, Java is not preinstalled. You will need OS X 10.7.3 or newer to install Java. You must also be using a 64-bit browser such as Safari or Firefox (i.e. not Chrome). [1] X Research source For Linux, Java needs to be downloaded, manually installed, and then enabled in order to work. See this guide for detailed instruction on installing Java in Linux."

      "content": "Start the installer. Once the installer has finished downloading, run it to begin the installation. On OS X, double-click the .dmg file to begin the installation. Close any browser windows before starting the installation, as they will need to be restarted anyway after installation is complete."

      "content": "Follow the installation steps. Read each screen of the installation program. Java will try to install extra software such as browser toolbars unless you uncheck the boxes. If you don't want your browser changed, make sure to read each screen carefully."

      "title": "Test the installation.",
      "content": "Test the installation. After you have finished installing Java, test the installation to make sure everything went OK. You can find the Java testing applet on the Java website, or by searching for \"java test\" and selecting the first result. You will need to allow the plugin to run, and you may be asked multiple times before it can load. This is because, in general, Java can be a dangerous tool which can grant others access to your computer if you are not careful. Always be sure you trust the website that you are running Java applets on. [2] X Research source"
