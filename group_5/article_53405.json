Though not scientifically tested, you might still find that it helps. [4] X Research source Hold your arm straight out in front of your face. Switch between focusing on your thumbnail and the tip of your own nose. This will exercise your eye muscles. You can also add a third point out on the horizon. Do this several times before resting by palming for 5 minutes."
