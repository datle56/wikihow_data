      "title": "Capricorn and Scorpio are a good match with a lot in common.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Scorpio are a good match with a lot in common. They’re driven, methodical, and will do anything to achieve their goals. Both of these signs are slow to let their guard down, but when they do, they will commit to each other for the long haul. These two constellations form a sextile on the zodiac wheel (they’re 60 degrees apart), which means they can get along well and grow together. Capricorn and Scorpio are ruled by Saturn and Mars, respectively. These are intense planets, and the two lovers can bond over the obstacles they’ve overcome in life."

      "content": "A Capricorn-Scorpio relationship has great sexual chemistry. They have some issues with intimacy at first, but with patience, they can give each other the security and safety they both need. Capricorn is likely to suggest new things that Scorpios would love, and Scorpio can be the welcome distraction from work that job-obsessed Capricorn needs. [1] X Research source In general, Scorpio demands much more emotional closeness to enjoy sex than the reserved Cap. Sexual friction might arise from Scorpio’s desire for control and Capricorn’s love of order and procedure (even in bed). With compromise and balance, they’ll grow to enjoy their time together. Capricorn’s sensual, physical nature will ground Scorpio, and Scorpio’s emotional intensity in bed will help Capricorn open up."

      "title": "Capricorn and Scorpio can achieve an emotionally balanced partnership.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Scorpio can achieve an emotionally balanced partnership. Capricorn will teach emotional Scorpio how to stay grounded and temper their mood swings, and Scorpio will show the reserved Cap how to get in touch with their feelings. Scorpio needs a lot of emotional validation, so Capricorn will have to work on opening up while their Scorpion partner tries to feel secure without constant attention. Both partners try to present themselves as “the strong one” in the beginning of a relationship. If they don’t learn to let their guard down quickly, these two can drift apart emotionally. Capricorns are not generally a “mushy” sign—they are practical about the people they love and care about life’s necessities. Scorpio will find this cold and uncaring at times."

      "title": "Communication is the area where this couple struggles the most.",
      "content": "Communication is the area where this couple struggles the most. Capricorn can be blunt with their delivery, which easily offends the ever-sensitive Scorpio. This leads to a cycle of intense fighting and making up unless they learn how to tactfully talk to each other. These two are very serious and there’s not a lot of laughing or fun in these conversations, although dark humor is a bonding point for them. Both signs need to lighten up to make conversation more enjoyable. Their tendency to dwell on dark or serious topics can bring down the mood, especially to outsiders. On the plus side, these signs understand each other’s need for silence and alone time. They can patiently wait for the other to open up before approaching."

      "title": "Trust between these signs is unbreakable once they let their walls down.",
      "content": "Trust between these signs is unbreakable once they let their walls down. Scorpios are very shrewd and cautious. They don’t trust easily, but they’ll realize eventually that Capricorn is beyond reliable. Capricorn also needs time to evaluate their partner and be sure they’re not getting together on a whim. Once these signs decide they can trust each other, their relationship is locked in for the long haul. Capricorn needs to show their trustworthiness to Scorpio. If the Goat can look the Scorpion straight in the eyes and be accountable, upfront, and solid, Scorpio will finally relax. If these signs don’t trust each other, it’s because of a lack of emotional intimacy. Once they get to know each other deeply, they’ll understand they can trust each other.

      "title": "These signs value safety and security and work together to achieve it.",
      "content": "These signs value safety and security and work together to achieve it. When they share a goal (in or outside their relationship), there is nothing that can stop them. They tend to feel that nothing is ever good enough, and will push themselves and each other to pursue personal growth. This determination is a defining factor of their relationship, and they will make clear goals for their life together. [2] X Research source Their individual desires for self-improvement can become unhealthy when neither partner assures the other that they’re good enough. They both want to find the truth in all things, and they’ll easily spend lots of quality time together with clear ideas about what they want to do. Scorpios are more private and introverted than Caps, who like to be in the center of things to network and solidify their reputation."

      "content": "These signs have what it takes to build a strong, lasting relationship. Capricorn and Scorpio will both be inspired by their partner and their relationship. Neither takes anything lightly, and combined with their strong trust, this means that they will commit to each other for a lifetime. When their relationship is their top priority, there’s nothing they won’t do to make it work. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Their tendency to be dark and serious is the only thing in their way. Capricorn and Scorpio need to find ways to feel light and have fun with each other, or they might try to satisfy this need with somebody else. Part of this comes down to their communication. If Capricorn can express their feelings openly but tactfully and Scorpio can respond less dramatically, they’ll have what it takes to make it far."
