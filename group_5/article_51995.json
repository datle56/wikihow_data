      "content": "Make a parenthetical in-text citation when quoting in your paper. When you want to quote from a book chapter in your paper, you need to create a parenthetical in-text citation that follows the quote. This will include the author’s last name, a space, and then the exact page number the quote appears on, all of that contained within parentheses. The final period to indicate the end of the sentence should appear after the in-text citation, not before it. [1] X Research source For example: Many scholars believe it is important to “help the student talk about his or her fears” (Harris 29). For book chapters with 2 authors, list both last names, separated by the word “and.” For example: (Harris and Smith 29). For book chapters with 3 or more authors, just include the first listed author followed by the phrase “et al” and a period. For example: (Harris et al. 29)."

List the author’s last name first, followed by a comma, then include their first name, followed by a period. [2] X Research source For example: “Harris, Muriel.” Make sure your entry is listed in alphabetical order by the author’s last name. If there are 2 authors, include both names in the same format (last name, first name) separated by an “and.” For example: “Harris, Muriel and Smith, John.” For a book chapter with 3 or more authors, include just the first author’s name, followed by a comma and the phrase “et al.” For example: “Harris, Muriel, et al.”"

Add a period inside the final quotation mark. [3] X Research source For example: “Harris, Muriel. “Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers.”” Make sure to capitalize all major words in the titles. If the title of the book chapter includes a word or phrase in quotation marks, you’ll need to use the double quote mark (“) around the entire chapter title and the single quote mark (‘) around the words within the title that appear in quotes.

      "title": "Include the editor’s name.",
      "content": "Include the editor’s name. If you want to cite one book chapter, it’s likely that this is because the chapters are written by different authors and gathered together into the collection by an overseeing editor. This is true for most collections, anthologies, and even some textbooks. The editor’s name will be preceded by the words “edited by.” Then you will list the editor’s name with the first name appearing first and no punctuation between the first and last name (the reverse of how you listed the chapter author’s name), followed by a comma. [5] X Research source For example: “Harris, Muriel. “Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers.” A Tutor’s Guide: Helping Writers One to One , edited by Ben Rafoth,” If there are 2 editors, list both with “and” between them. For example: “edited by Ben Rafoth and Sam Smith,” If there are 3 or more editors, list each name separated by a comma, with “and” before the last name. For example: “edited by Ben Rafoth, Sam Smith, and Bob Brown,” If there is no editor, just move on to the next step."

      "title": "Create an in-text citation after the quoted material.",
      "content": "Create an in-text citation after the quoted material. If you want to quote from a book chapter in APA format, you’ll need to let the reader know where the quote came from by including the author’s last name, the date of publication, and the exact page the quote appears on inside parentheses. The final period of the sentence should appear after the parenthetical citation. [7] X Research source For example: Many scholars believe it is important to “help the student talk about his or her fears” (Harris, 2000, p. 29). For a chapter with 2 authors, include both author’s last names in the in-text citation, separated by an ampersand (&). For example: (Harris & Smith, 2000, p. 29). For a chapter with 3-5 authors, list all of the authors’ names, separated by commas, and include an ampersand before the last name. For example: (Harris, Smith, & Thomas, 2000, p. 29). For a chapter with 6 or more authors, you’ll just include the first author’s last name and the phrase “et al” followed by a period. For example: (Harris et al., 2000, p. 29). If you include the author’s name and/or the publication date in the sentence preceding the quote, you can omit them from the parenthetical citation. For example: According to Muriel Harris (2000), it is important to “help the student talk about his or her fears” (p. 29)."

(2000).” For a chapter with 2 authors, list both names in the same order (last name, first initial), separated by a comma and an ampersand. For example: “Harris, M., & Smith, J. (2000).” For a chapter with 3-7 authors, list each name in the same way, separated by a comma, with an ampersand preceding the last name. For example: “Harris, M., Smith, J., & Thomas, E.
