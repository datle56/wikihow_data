      "content": "A Capricorn man and an Aries woman are a case of opposites attract. An Aries woman loves the thrill of the chase, which makes a Capricorn guy perfect for her. He's naturally introverted and takes some time to warm up to new people, but she doesn't mind keeping after him. And they both have a strong sense of loyalty. Once they get together, it's hard to tear these two lovebirds apart. The sea-goat and the ram do face some challenges, mainly because they don't have a lot in common. Their interests are so different that they can have a hard time landing on the same page."

      "content": "Capricorn and Aries click because they share the same approach to romance. Emotionally, things can work out well for these two. Capricorn isn't a particularly mushy guy—he'd rather fix your toilet than serve a candlelit dinner. He'll express his love in practical ways, not by writing you a song or sending you flowers. This suits an Aries lady just fine, since she's not particularly romantic either. Capricorn, surprise your Aries lady with a little bit of a show from time to time. She secretly enjoys the occasional rom-com-worthy grand gesture of affection. Aries, recognize that when your Capricorn guy asks you practical questions, like whether you're adequately prepared for the next big storm, he's really showing you how much he cares."

      "content": "Sea-goats are more reserved while rams wear their hearts on their sleeves. The Aries lady can get frustrated here because it's hard to get a Capricorn guy to express his emotions.

As a practical earth sign, he tends to look at things more logically, while the dynamic fire sign Aries tends to burn with passion. Capricorn, take the time to think about how you feel and talk to your Aries woman about your feelings from time to time. She'll appreciate it when you open up . Aries, have patience with your Capricorn man. Let him know that you're interested in how he feels and show gratitude when he does open up. If he sees that it's something you value, he'll make an effort to do it more."

      "title": "A Capricorn man and an Aries woman have great communication.",
      "content": "A Capricorn man and an Aries woman have great communication. When it comes to communication, Capricorn guys want you to cut to the chase and say what's on your mind. This works out great for an Aries woman because she's always very direct and to the point. Capricorn, try not to take offense if your Aries woman says something critical. She's just being honest and thinks you deserve to know the truth. Aries, sometimes you can be honest to a fault. While your Capricorn guy does admire your honesty, it's also important to find kind ways to phrase things so you don't inadvertently hurt him."

      "content": "Capricorn and Aries are both cardinal signs driven toward success. These two are born initiators and they're so driven they'll usually accomplish whatever they set out to do. Capricorn's ruling planet, Saturn, gives him plenty of perseverance to stick it through to the end. For the Aries lady, her ruling planet, Mars, gives her the passion and energy it takes to go that extra mile. [2] X Research source Capricorn, let Aries take the lead when it comes to joint goals. She'll hit the ground running and clear any obstacles standing in your way while you make your plans in the background. Aries, listen to your Capricorn guy when he warns you about possible pitfalls.

      "title": "Capricorn and Aries can be as different as night and day.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Aries can be as different as night and day. The biggest challenge for this couple is really that they don't have a lot in common. For this reason, it's rare for them to hook up—and even rarer for them to go the distance. That doesn't mean they'll necessarily butt heads, though (even if the sea-goat and the ram both have horns). [3] X Research source Capricorn, your Aries lady's impulsive nature will be the hardest thing for you to get past. You're so used to carefully planning everything, you need to be willing to step back and just let her go every once in a while. Aries, your Capricorn guy's serious, methodical nature is probably the thing that will get to you the most. It's best to just have patience with him and recognize that he's not likely to jump headfirst into anything without thinking it through."
