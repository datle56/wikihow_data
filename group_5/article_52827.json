It also depends on how many sports you play, but you should have at least one pair of running shoes. You may also need football or hockey boots if you play. Sneakers: You will need at least one pair of non-athletic sneakers such as Converse, Vans or Nike blazers. These are great for the mall, park or a friends house. Sandals: Have one or two pairs of cute, comfortable sandals, for the beach and for walking. Moccasins are also fabulous. Boots: This also depends on where you live, but for anybody, have one pair of hiking boots. Also, you should have a pair of long black boots, for warm or cold. Black is good, but no bright colors. Uggs are very popular. Flats: It's good to have a couple of pairs of flats because they go with a lot of outfits. Bright colors or pretty patterns always complete the outfit and make your whole look change. Have back up always, and maybe a pair of regular blacks or greys in handy. Heels: Have one or maybe two pairs. One should definitely be in black, and maybe some others in stylish colors, but make sure they match with your dresses/formal clothes. Flip Flops: have one pair of flip flops for summer, you can get them in pretty patterns or simple ones."

Necklaces are pretty and come in a variety of different styles and colors. Try to avoid necklaces and bracelets that say \"Best Friends\" on them. They are nice when little kids wear them, but for teens, they are a little much. They also may make your other friends feel bad. Buy all accessories last because they are meant to accent the outfit. Scarves: Scarves are good for the winter on in the fall, spring, and even the summer. It is good to have bright colors, and cool patterns, rather than the browns and ugly colors. Go with the flow and have fun with them."
