      "content": "Determine how much you will borrow. Typically, buyers will make a cash down payment on their new car and borrow from a lender to cover the remaining cost. This borrowed amount, known as the principal, will serve as the basis for your car loan. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that you should put as much money down on your car as possible to minimize the amount borrowed and reduce your finance charges. This step will require you to know roughly how much your new car will cost. See How to Buy a New Car for more information about finding a good price and working within your budget."

      "content": "Figure out the annual percentage rate (APR) and duration of your loan. The APR reflects how much additional money you will have to pay beyond your principal for each year of your loan. A low APR will reduce the yearly and monthly amounts of finance charges on your loan. However, many low-APR loans are longer in duration, so the overall cost may remain relatively high. Alternately, a short-term loan with a higher APR may end up being cheaper overall. This is why it is important to calculate your finance charges beforehand. Getting a low APR on your car loan may mean seeking other lenders beyond your car dealership. Be sure to do your research and select the cheapest available combination of APR and duration. See How to Get a Low APR on a Car Loan for more information."

When calculating your monthly payments, you will need to know both how many payments you will make each year and how many payments you will make in total. This information can be easily found in the terms of your car loan. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Find your interest rate due on each payment.",
      "content": "Find your interest rate due on each payment. Start by converting your APR to a decimal by dividing it by 100. For example, if your APR is stated at 8.4%, 8.4/100 = 0.084. Next, find your monthly percentage rate by dividing your APR decimal by 12. So, 0.084/12 = 0.007. This is your monthly percentage rate expressed as a decimal."

      "content": "Multiply your monthly percentage rate times your principal. If, for example, your principal were $20,000 (if you borrowed $20,000 to buy your car), you would multiply this by 0.007 (from the previous step) and get 140."

      "title": "Input this number into the monthly payment formula.",
      "content": "Input this number into the monthly payment formula. The formula is as follows: Monthly Payment = (Interest rate due on each payment x principal)/ (1 – (1 + Interest rate due on each payment)^ -(Number of payments)) [4] X Research source The top part of the equation (interest rate due on each payment x principal) is your number from the previous step. The rest can be calculated using a simple calculator. The \"^\" indicates that the figure (-(Number of Payments)) is an exponent to the figure (1 + Interest rate due on each payment). On a calculator, this is entered by calculating 1 + interest rate due on each payment, hitting the button x^y, and then entering the number of payments. Keep in mind that the number of payments is made negative here (multiplied by negative one). In our example, the calculation would go as follows (assuming a loan duration of 5 years or 60 months): Monthly Payment = (0.007 x $20000)/(1-(1+ 0.007)^-60 Monthly payment = $140/(1-(1.007)^-60) Monthly payment = $140/(1-0.658) Monthly payment = $140/0.342 Monthly payment = $409.36 (this number may be off by a few cents due to rounding)"

      "content": "Subtract your principal paid each month from your monthly payment. In our example, this would be $409.36 - $333.33. This equals roughly $76. So, with this loan agreement, you would be spending $76 per month in interest payments alone."
