      "content": "Put on a helmet before engaging in wrestling or boxing. This is a crucial step in preventing cauliflower ear. If you’re engaging in sports like boxing, wrestling, or rugby, always wear a helmet that covers your ears. Wrestlers and boxers should wear soft helmets that cover the entire head (ears included) and also provide some protection for your forehead and the sides of your face. [2] X Research source Even if you’re only sparring or practicing in a non-competitive setting, it’s still smart to wear a protective helmet."

      "title": "Use ear guards before participating in martial arts.",
      "content": "Use ear guards before participating in martial arts. Martial arts like ju-jitsu typically prohibit participants from wearing full helmets. So, protect your ears by wearing an ear guard. An ear guard will wrap around the sides of your head and may be held in place with a chin strap. While ear guards provide less overall protection than helmets, they’re still an effective means of preventing cauliflower ear. [3] X Research source You can purchase protective ear guards at most sporting goods stores, including stores whose inventory is dedicated to wrestling and martial-arts supplies."

      "content": "Wear a helmet when you ride your bike, rollerblade, or skateboard. Although it’s most associated with wrestling and boxing, you can get a cauliflower ear from any blunt trauma to the head. This means that you could get it from falling over on a bike or taking a hard fall on a skateboard. Wearing a helmet will protect your ears and prevent cauliflower ear. [4] X Research source Using a helmet will also prevent serious brain injuries and concussions. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Visit an emergency room immediately after your ear receives trauma.",
      "content": "Visit an emergency room immediately after your ear receives trauma. Many athletes are inclined to wait a few days before seeing a doctor after receiving a sharp blow to the ear. Cauliflower ear will not go away on its own and it will not get better with time. So, as soon as you notice that you have a cauliflower ear (e.g., after a wrestling match), visit a local emergency room or urgent care center.

This may take as little as 2-3 days. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Ask a doctor to drain the ear.",
      "content": "Ask a doctor to drain the ear. This needs to happen before the fluids have dried in your ear. A doctor will use a scalpel to make a small incision in the outer surface of your damaged ear and allow the coagulating blood and other fluids to drain out from the hematoma. The draining process will take from 5 to 15 minutes. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Draining the ear will “deflate” the swollen cartilage and help the ear return to its normal shape. This may seem scary, but having your ear drained is a relatively quick and painless procedure. It will also help your ear return to a normal shape."

      "title": "Let the doctor apply a pressure dressing to repair damaged cartilage.",
      "content": "Let the doctor apply a pressure dressing to repair damaged cartilage. Just draining the ear will not restore the skin and cartilage to their normal shapes. To re-shape the outer ear, the doctor will apply a sterile compress to the damaged portion of your ear. The compress will hold together the 2 sides of skin and press them against the ruptured cartilage. [9] X Research source > Ask the doctor how long you’ll need to wear the compress. They may ask you to keep it on for 3 or 4 days."

      "title": "Allow the doctor to stitch your ear if it’s disconnected.",
      "content": "Allow the doctor to stitch your ear if it’s disconnected. If your upper ear received severe trauma, the internal cartilage may be torn or disconnected from the base of the ear cartilage. Once a doctor has drained the ear and has restored the cartilage to its normal shape, they can stitch together your torn upper ear. The doctor will do this by stitching the torn portion of your ear back onto the base. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ask the doctor how long you should leave the stitches in for, and if you can remove them yourself."

      "content": "Take any oral antibiotics that your doctor prescribes. Untreated cauliflower ears are susceptible to infection or perichondritis (a type of ear infection which can deform the ear cartilage). To prevent infection, your doctor may prescribe you an oral antibiotic medication. Take this medication as directed by your doctor. [11] X Research source An infected cauliflower ear can lead to serious health conditions and may necessitate the ear’s eventual amputation."

      "title": "See an ENT specialist if your doctor refers you.",
      "content": "See an ENT specialist if your doctor refers you. If your doctor’s office isn’t equipped to re-shape and sterilize your cauliflower ear, or if the damage is severe, the doctor may refer you to an ENT (ears, nose, throat) specialist. Visit the specialist as soon as you can, and work with them to prevent the damage to your cauliflower ear from becoming permanent. If your ear is severely disfigured, your general practitioner may also refer you to a plastic surgeon to reconstruct the ear."

      "title": "Have the cauliflower ear drained again if it refills.",
      "content": "Have the cauliflower ear drained again if it refills. Hematomas that have been drained once can refill with blood. This commonly occurs if the ear is re-traumatized, although hematomas can refill even without being struck. If you notice that your cauliflower ear has changed shape or has turned purple or red in color, pay another visit to your doctor. [12] X Research source Some cauliflower ears need to be drained multiple times before the hematoma stops recurring. When cauliflower ear is treated quickly and aggressively, it usually does not cause permanent damage. If you delay treatment, however, there is a risk that insufficient blood flow to your ear may result in further damage or deformity."
