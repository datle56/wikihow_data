      "content": "Joshua Reynolds and Maris Ambats invented mood rings in 1975. Reynolds was a retired stockbroker who came up with the first mood ring design. Silver-plated mood rings sold for around $45, while gold rings sold for $250. Whether or not they were accurate, mood rings quickly became a popular fad that are still made today. [2] X Research source Reynolds made over $20 million in his first year but declared bankruptcy a year later when other cheaper mood rings flooded the market. He later went on to design the ThighMaster."

      "title": "Mood rings contain liquid crystals that respond to changes in temperature.",
      "content": "Mood rings contain liquid crystals that respond to changes in temperature. Modern mood rings work because they contain thermochromic pigments (substances that change color in response to temperature) that combine various temperature ranges. [3] X Research source When you put on a mood ring, the crystals inside react to your body temperature, twisting wavelengths of light into different colors. [4] X Research source In a neutral emotional state at the normal body temperature (98.6℉ or 37℃), the crystals don’t twist and naturally reflect a blue/green color. Old mood rings were highly susceptible to water damage and high temperatures. They would often lose their ability to change color, turning black instead."

      "title": "Mood rings aren’t accurate emotional predictors, but they’re fun to wear!",
      "content": "Mood rings aren’t accurate emotional predictors, but they’re fun to wear! Body temperature changes are associated with changes in emotions, which does give some scientific backing to mood rings. For example, stress tends to decrease the blood flow (and therefore heat) to your feet and hands. However, other factors would be needed to accurately predict your mood. [5] X Research source Body temperature can also change due to other factors than emotion, like being in extremely hot or cold environments or releasing heat due to exercise. Different areas of your body may show different moods. For example, mood necklaces can show a different reading than rings because your chest is warmer than your fingers. Because the materials they’re made of have changed, modern rings don’t necessarily follow the same color patterns, and temperatures trigger which colors might vary from ring to ring."
