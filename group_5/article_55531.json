      "title": "“Goodnight” is often reserved for close friends and family members.",
      "content": "“Goodnight” is often reserved for close friends and family members. Since “goodnight” is an expression used right before bedtime, it’s typically directed toward loved ones. Speaking to someone right before they sleep is fairly intimate, so most people do not use “goodnight” in formal settings. At the end of the workday, “have a good night” would make more sense because the other person has to commute home and eat dinner before going to sleep. Them: “Can you wake me up tomorrow?” You: “Sure thing, sweetheart. Goodnight.”"
