      "content": "Go grunge. Grungy style is an overall \"sloppy\" look that suggests you didn't spend very much time putting together your outfit, and yet managed to look awesome anyway. To achieve the grungy look, opt for the triple threat: denim, band tees, and leather jackets. [1] X Research source Wear loose-fitting clothes. Find cutoff, acid-washed, or otherwise destroyed jeans. When possible, have holes or rips in your clothing. Consider going faux rather than wearing genuine leather. Keep your hair messy. Ideally, avoid washing it for a few days to achieve a greasy look. Try to find t-shirts of bands that were popular before and during the '90s like Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and The Doors. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get dolled up. Babydoll dresses were very popular in the '90s, and were usually short-sleeved and floral-print. These babydoll dresses were variations of the flowered dresses that were popular in the 1930s. They were often \"dressed down\" for the daytime with a pair of combat boots, sneakers, and/or a jean jacket. Body-conscious velvet dresses (try maroon or black) were also in style at the time. Wear crop tops. Try pairing high-waisted jeans with a cropped t-shirt, tank-top, cardigan. Tight-fitting tees (opt for a size or two smaller than what you would normally wear) were also trendy for women. Wear butterfly clips in your hair. These tiny, plastic, multicolored hair clips were popular among girls of all ages. One trendy look was to pull back the front of your hair in one inch segments and pin each one with a butterfly clip. The end result should look as though you're wearing a \"headband\" of butterflies. [3] X Research source"

Try layering a plaid button-up over the rest of your outfit (leaving it unbuttoned), or wrap a plaid shirt around your waist. Try finding plaid as worn out as possible, giving it the grungy look."

With the booming economy of the 90s, many teens and young adults had glamorized the \"poor life\" of the 1930s which includes the grunge fashion. [5] X Research source Wear anything with tie-dye, peace signs, or flowers on it. Find a pair of bell-bottoms. Bell-bottoms are pants that are fitted at the top and flare out dramatically at the bottom. Try them in jean or corduroy. Add a peace sign or flower patch to the pants for an extra flare! Wear platform shoes. These disco-inspired shoes were full-throttle in the '90s. Platform shoes are available in sandals, heels, wedges, and even sneakers, and come in a variety of colors."
