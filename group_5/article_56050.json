[2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source LED (Light Emitting Diodes) are very bright and have a long life. [3] X Trustworthy Source Energy Star Program run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy focused on educating consumers about energy efficiency Go to source They also use less energy and are not as prone to vibration. The downside is their cost, as they are quite a bit more expensive than halogens. HID (High Intensity Discharge) use xenon gas to produce a high quantity of bright light. HIDs are popular because the light produced is closer to daytime light. Halogen is the oldest type of light, but also the most widely available and cheapest to obtain. It is made with a single filament bulb and halogen gas. These lights typically run hot and are prone to burnouts. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the style of lights. There are a large variety of fog light styles available, but they all break down into three mounting categories. Decide which style fits your vehicle best. Bumper Mount. Bumper mount lights fit in specifically designed holes and are usually round or rectangular. This style is the way that most fog lights come from the factory. If you’re replacing your stock fog lights, this is where to start. Grill Mount. Larger, usually round. These lights are installed on the front grille or mounted directly behind it. This style is typically seen more with trucks and SUVs. Rack Mount. Round or rectangular lights. These are mounted above the vehicle or onto a front brush guard. This style is also seen more with trucks and SUVs."
