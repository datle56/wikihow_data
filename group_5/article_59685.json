      "title": "Say “kokoro.”",
      "content": "Say “kokoro.” This is the Japanese word for heart. It is pronounced “koh-koh-roh.” The “roh” syllable is pronounced quickly and softly. Kokoro is the word for the metaphysical heart, as in “heart, mind, spirit.” Put the emphasis slightly on the first syllable of the word. Say the syllables fast. Don’t draw any of them out dramatically. [1] X Research source One way to remember the word is to think about “Cocoa Puffs.” The Japanese word for heart has a similar sound to the American cereal’s name. Kokoro has a meaning related to the soul. This is why the word is often used in Japanese literature and music to refer to \"heart and soul\" in one."

      "title": "Listen to people saying the word.",
      "content": "Listen to people saying the word. If you have a Japanese friend or relative, ask them how to say it. You could also take Japanese lessons online or at a local college. If you have no friends who speak Japanese, go online. You will find many sites that allow you to listen to native speakers saying Japanese words out loud. It's a lot easier to master the pronunciation of a word in another language rather than simply using written pronunciation guides.."

      "title": "Say “shinzou.”",
      "content": "Say “shinzou.” This is the Japanese word for heart when it refers to the actual organ in the body. [2] X Research source Thus, if you are trying to use the word heart to refer to love and emotion, it’s better to use “kokoro” than “shinzou.” Shinzou is pronounced, “shin-zoh.” Put the emphasis on the first syllable. [3] X Research source The word for chest in Japanese is “mune.” Mune is pronounced “moon-eh” with emphasis on the first syllable. [4] X Research source The bottom line is that the Japanese place an emphasis on separating the metaphysical and spiritual from the tangible physicality of the body. A person can have heart (kokoro), or the person’s heart needs medical care (shinzou). That’s the difference."

      "content": "Write heart using Japanese characters. Perhaps you want to write the word heart as a Japanese person would write it, not in English. The Japanese character for kokoro is 心 . Using the Japanese script is much better if you want to write the word. The Japanese characters for shinzou are 心臓. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Determine the context.",
      "content": "Determine the context. The phrase will actually help you determine the word you will choose, kokoro or shinzou. Remember, if your phrase at all has the connotation of spirituality, you will need to use the word kokoro, not shinzou. In English, of course, the word heart is the same whether you are referring to the spiritual heart or the physical heart, so this can take some getting used to."

If you want to say your heart is beating but in a sentimental way because it’s beating due to love or being anxious, say, “Kokoro ga doki doki suru.” (心がドキドキする。) [6] X Research source If your heart is beating in a physical or medical sense, say “Shinzou ga doki doki suru.” (心臓がドキドキする。). To say the phrase “it’s a heart,” say “coke-oh-ruh des.” (心です。) To say your heart is broken, say “Watashi no kokoro wa kizutsuite imasu.”( 私の心は傷ついています。)To say you’ve had heart surgery, say “shi-n-zo-u shujutsu.” (心臓を手術)"
