      "content": "Trace a violin mould template onto a piece of wood that’s 400 × 250 × 12 mm (15.75 × 9.84 × 0.47 in). Look online for templates for 4/4 violins, which are the standard sizes for adults, and print one out at full size so you can work off of it. Make sure the template you find has 8 large holes in the middle of the outline or else you won’t know where to cut. Transfer the outline directly onto a piece of plywood that’s 400 × 250 × 12 mm (15.75 × 9.84 × 0.47 in), making sure you’re as accurate as possible or else your finished violin may not fit together well. [1] X Research source Any type of plywood works for making your mould template since it won’t be included in the final instrument. You can choose a template for a smaller violin, such as a 1/2 or 3/4, if you want to make one for a younger violinist. Violin templates may vary slightly in size and decoration, so pick a template that you like to work from."

Turn on your scroll saw and carefully guide the blade around the outline for your template. Make sure the saw blade stays on the outside of your outline so you don’t remove too much material from the template. Work slowly around the edge of the entire outline until you're able to remove the piece from the block of wood. [2] X Research source If you aren’t able to remove all of the excess wood with your saw, use a sander or file to shape it to size. Be mindful of where the saw blade is at all times so you don’t accidentally cut yourself while you’re working. Try to avoid cutting sharp turns continuously when you're using a scroll saw. Instead, cut one angle and then cut another angle separately. You might find that backing out of your current cut and approaching from a different angle is helpful when cutting fine turns or small details."

Let go of the handle to raise the drill bit and adjust your mould. Continue drilling all of the holes on the mould.

Continue gluing the rest of the corners by removing clamps, applying the glue with your knife, and then again clamping them. Once the corners are glued, work around the curves of the instrument so the glue holds the pieces together. Once you’ve applied glue around the entire back piece, let the glue set for at least 24 hours before removing your clamps.
