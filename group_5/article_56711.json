Basically, you want to stock up on classic pieces like T-shirts, tanks, blouses or polos, sweaters, a black dress or suit, cardigans, jeans, and slacks. Then, you can mix and match them quickly when you're getting dressed. [1] X Expert Source Natalie Kay Smith Sustainable Fashion Writer Expert Interview. 25 May 2021.

Sort through your wardrobe and get rid of things that are too big or small. If something doesn't fit right, it won't look right either. [4] X Expert Source Natalie Kay Smith Sustainable Fashion Writer Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. Periodically go through your clothes and try them on to see if they are comfortable and flattering. [5] X Research source If you have pieces that you can't part with but they don't fit you well, consider bringing them to a tailor. Keep in mind that some pieces are supposed to fit you a little differently. For example, you might have a luxurious oversized sweater that's supposed to drape over you."

You know what we're talking aboutâ€”the sweater or pair of pants that's always in your closet, but you don't really like wearing. Clear them out to make room for pieces that you truly like wearing. [6] X Expert Source Dina Scherer Wardrobe Stylist & Personal Shopper Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Aim for quality over quantity when it comes to garments. [7] X Research source You don't have to hang onto clothes just because they were a good deal or because they fit you. It's totally fine to donate or sell them so you can invest in stylish clothes that you look forward to wearing.

[9] X Expert Source Dina Scherer Wardrobe Stylist & Personal Shopper Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. If you're wearing a top that has cool colors like blue, green, or purple, pair it with pants or a skirt that's also cool-toned so they don't clash. Black, white, and gray pieces are neutral so they can work with warm or cool shades. Warm tones include red, yellow, orange, and brown."

The idea with any of the body shapes is to create balance and stylish symmetry. For instance, If you have an apple-shaped body, you have a rounded silhouette so belts can really help to define your waist. Long skirts or deep V-neck tops can also extend your torso. [11] X Research source Pear shapes that have a wider waist than bust work well with patterned or textured tops since they draw the eyes up instead of down near the waist. Straight or rectangle shapes don't have a lot of definition so choose blouses or sweaters with gathers or ruffles to help create dimension. Inverted triangle shapes have a wider bust than waist so choose wide-leg pants or A-line skirts to bring attention to your hips. Hourglass shapes have a bust and hips that are the same so wrap dresses, fitted blazers, and mid-to-high rise pants all accentuate your shape."

      "content": "Come up with a day-to-day look that you can easily customize. You might not have lots of time to plan your outfit every day, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice style! This is where a basic uniform really helps. For instance, you might feel great wearing slacks, a fitted shirt, and a blazer. Use this as your outfit base and swap out pieces with different colors or textures. [12] X Research source For example, if your uniform is jeans and a blazer, you might wear light-washed jeans and a casual tan blazer one day or skinny jeans with a moto jacket on another day. For a more professional look, wear black-fitted jeans with a structured blazer."

      "content": "Check the forecast and take your day into account. If you look stylish but your outfit makes you uncomfortable, then you're not really winning! Look at the forecast before you get dressed so you know your outfit will be warm or cool enough. You should also consider your day. Running lots of errands? Chasing after toddlers? You'll probably want to skip stilettos and reach for fashionable flats. [13] X Research source Being prepared for the weather might mean grabbing a light sweater or jacket to throw on if it cools off later in the day. Don't want to sacrifice style for comfort? You don't necessarily have to! If you'll have a meeting or presentation, consider bringing those slightly uncomfortable sleek leather shoes to wear for your meeting, but change into casual flats or loafers when you're done."

You've spent time creating a fashionable outfit, but you can really take it to the next level with some key accent pieces. Carry a designer handbag with a color that really pops or complete your look with an eye-catching belt. Don't forget jewelry! Men might reach for a simple chain necklace or classic watch while women can accessorize with earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. [14] X Research source The key to accessories is balance. You don't want to overwhelm your look, so stick with 1 or 2 statement pieces. For instance, if you're rocking a neutral-colored outfit, wear earrings that really stand out or a bold-colored belt that adds interest."

Sure, you can throw on a button-down shirt and sweater, but you'll instantly elevate your outfit if you pull the cuffs out so they're peeking from under the sweater. Look at your outfit and find ways to look polished. This might mean popping your collar, tucking in your shirt, or rolling up the cuffs of your pants. Play around to find what looks best on you. [15] X Research source You might roll up the sleeves on your blazer, for instance, or tie a silk scarf around your neck."
