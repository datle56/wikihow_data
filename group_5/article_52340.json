      "content": "Choose a green-tinted concealer to cancel out redness. Color-correcting concealers cover up red spots resulting from acne breakouts, scars, or skin conditions like rosacea. When choosing a color-correcting concealer, opt for those that are green-tinted; green is the opposite of red on the color wheel, which is why a green concealer offsets and neutralizes red spots. [1] X Research source Apply the concealer to the area you wish to neutralize and blend the edges for an even finish. Work with thin layers of product to avoid giving your skin a green hue."

      "title": "Use high-end concealers for more coverage.",
      "content": "Use high-end concealers for more coverage. Inexpensive products rarely help conceal large areas of red or dark spots because their formulas are usually weaker, thin, and/or more runny. High-quality concealers, such as the Dermablend Cover Care Concealer , or those designed to deliver “extra coverage,” are heavier and made to cover darker spots, acting as a concealer and a foundation at the same time. Take a small amount of the product and rub it between your fingertips to soften it. Apply the concealer directly over imperfections. Allow the product to dry before applying additional layers (if needed). Set each layer of product with setting powder."

      "content": "Apply foundation to even out your skin tone. Foundation is used to cover up uneven skin tones, red spots, or acne lesions. Applying concealer before your foundation is also an option; however, adding foundation first allows you to really see where you need more coverage. [3] X Research source Prep your skin with a primer to soften lines, dry patches, or rough areas. Apply a dime-sized amount of foundation to your hands and use your fingers to dot it on your forehead, nose, and chin. Smooth the product all around with a makeup brush or beauty blender, working from the center outward."

      "content": "Dab on concealer for added coverage. Use a high-end concealer to achieve a flawless result. The best concealers counteract discolorations, lighten shadows, disguise hyperpigmentation marks, and work together with your foundation to achieve an even skin tone. [4] X Research source Dab the concealer onto discolorations with a clean finger, brush, or sponge. Blend until there are no lines. Continue adding small, thin coats of concealer until the blemish or imperfection is concealed. Pro Tip: Don’t apply liquid or cream concealers over powder foundation. If you use powder foundation, apply the concealer first and allow it to dry before putting on the foundation."

      "content": "Set your makeup with a setting powder . Once you’ve reached the amount of coverage you’re looking for, finish your base with a translucent powder. This helps set your foundation and concealer and makes it last longer. [5] X Research source Apply setting powder with a fluffy brush to areas where your face gets oily—the bridge of your nose, chin, and forehead. Pro Tip: There are differences between loose and pressed powder. Loose powder gives a more natural look and is usually translucent, whereas pressed powder gives more coverage and comes in a variety of skin tones."
