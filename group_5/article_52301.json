      "content": "If you aren’t sure, ask your friend what’s wrong. It’s not always easy to figure out why your friend is upset, so it’s best to just ask them what’s wrong. If your friend is hesitant to tell you, let them know that you aren’t going to judge, and that you’ll be here to help them no matter what. [1] X Research source Try something like, “Hey, what’s going on? I can tell you’re upset. I promise I won’t judge you; I just want to know how I can help.”"

      "title": "Try not to assume you know what’s going through their head.",
      "content": "Try not to assume you know what’s going through their head. If they just went through something upsetting, they might be feeling angry, sad, hurt, or even uncomfortable.

      "content": "Sometimes the best way to comfort someone is to be quiet. Let your friend talk as much (or as little) as they want to, and try not to interrupt.

      "content": "Tell your friend that however they’re feeling is okay. When you go through a tough time, you sometimes feel a wide range of emotions, which can be confusing.
