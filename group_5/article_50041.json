Spend extra time on your creative projects when you see 234, or launch a new endeavor you’ve been putting off. Now is the perfect time to start something new (especially if it’s something you’ve always wanted to try!). [10] X Research source For example, say you have a background in creative writing but haven’t penned anything new in a while because of work stress. Now might be the time to get back in a writing routine or start that poetry collection you always dreamed of putting together. This investment in your talent could have a big payoff—maybe you’ll get to know other writers and creatives through feedback sessions, or an agent might see your work and think it’s worthy of publishing."

      "content": "Focus on your goals and make a plan to get started. The universe is hinting that it’s time to make your dreams a reality, so seize the moment! Trust yourself and your talents and take the first step. First, get super clear on what you want to accomplish—maybe you want to open a small business, or get in the best shape of your life. Then, create a specific and attainable plan for how to get started. If you’re starting a business, for example, your first steps might be to draft a business plan and secure a loan from the bank to get things started. Once you’ve taken the first step, there’s no stopping you from taking the rest! No matter what obstacles you hit, stay positive and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Practice gratitude for every blessing and accomplishment along the way, no matter how small. Sometimes, a small victory is all you need to keep your motivation up."
