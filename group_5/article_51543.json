      "content": "You’re maternal and nurturing. Warm and caring Cancer is the mother of the Zodiac. [1] X Research source If you have a Cancer Lilith, you have a special gift for understanding others' needs, and you love to take care of people. This can be a positive thing, but Lilith also represents the shadow side of these traits. For example, you may overextend yourself to care for others, and then get frustrated when they don’t go to the same lengths for you. [2] X Research source How to thrive : Taking care of others can be a beautiful thing, but not when it comes at your own expense. Prioritize self-care to avoid burnout. Take a relaxing bubble bath, then watch a marathon of your favorite movies. Or, take a peaceful hike in nature to reset. Whatever your heart desires! Be sure to tell your loved ones that you won’t be available for this period. This time is just for you, to show yourself the love and care you show to others."

      "content": "You’re extremely empathetic. Ruled by the moon, Cancers are known for being sensitive. They’re very in touch with their own emotions and the emotions of others. [3] X Research source If your Lilith is in Cancer, you likely feel others’ pain deeply, and you tend to take it on as if it were your own. You might find yourself rushing to the rescue when loved ones need help, even when you don’t have the time or space to do so. [4] X Research source How to thrive : Your empathy is your superpower, but when you give it free rein, it can become toxic , leading to imbalanced relationships where you give far more than you get. Learn to set healthy boundaries to avoid this. This could mean not answering phone calls after 10:00 p.m., or not dropping important tasks when a friend asks you to come over for emotional support. Whatever boundaries you decide, do your best to stick to them. Remember, you can’t be everything to everyone at all times, and that’s okay!"

If you have complicated feelings about these issues stemming from childhood, consider talking to a therapist. They can help you process and heal. [6] X Research source"
