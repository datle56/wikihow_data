    {
      "title": "Research a particular god or goddess as your starting point.",
      "content": "Research a particular god or goddess as your starting point. You can choose any, from Zeus to Priapus to Thalia. Find out all you can about the god. Just keep in mind which ones are famous for not having demigod kids (ex. Hestia, Hera, or Artemis)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't worry if they're virgin or already in a relationship.",
      "content": "Don't worry if they're virgin or already in a relationship. Maybe Persephone's children can be born from flowers. The possibilities are endless and you can keep adding to and designing your character for as long as you like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go in-depth into your character.",
      "content": "Go in-depth into your character. Work out when they were born, how they got to Camp Half-Blood or Camp Jupiter. It's important to understand them completely, including all their flaws and relationships."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw up a rough copy of your demigod.",
      "content": "Draw up a rough copy of your demigod. This includes sketching out how they look, what they wear, and particularly facial expressions. This allows you to picture the character better. Moreover, if you're adding them into a story, it'll be easier to explain how they look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select an enemy for your character.",
      "content": "Select an enemy for your character. Each demigod has the worst enemy equivalent, such as Luke, Kronos, and even Gaia, so start to gather up the characters and work out which one would be their worst enemy. This enemy could also shape your character, maybe they caused a wound or killed someone they loved. This adds effect and makes your character more interesting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a weapon for your character.",
      "content": "Choose a weapon for your character. Every demigod has a weapon, even if it's a saucepan. Maybe their weapon is cursed or used to be used by a famous hero (for example, Hercules). Their weapon doesn't have to be enchanted at all, maybe they just use their powers, such as water, or whatever powers they have that are related to their godly parent. Then again, it could just be a knife that doesn't need to be enchanted."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't hesitate to make your demigod different from their parent.",
      "content": "Don't hesitate to make your demigod different from their parent. Hades' children don't have to be all gloomy; try making them happy, this way your character is different from the others. Sometimes making them like their parents is useful though, such as using Hermes' craziness or Hecate's weirdness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue developing the demigod character.",
      "content": "Continue developing the demigod character. Keep in mind what is in actual Greek or Roman mythology, and what is in the books. Also, researching a bit before or during making a character could make a more interesting character."
