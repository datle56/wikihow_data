      "content": "Measure the width of the door frame. You'll need to know how wide your door frame is so the jamb fits in it. Hold a tape measure up to the top of the door frame. Note the measurement and save it for later. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that if the door has 2x4 walls, then the frame will be 4-1/2\" (11.4 cm). If the door has 2x6 walls, then the frame will always be 6-1/2\" (16.5 cm). While many people use “door jamb” and “door frame” interchangeably, a door jamb refers to the 3 boards the door is directly mounted onto."

      "title": "Measure the sides of the door frame.",
      "content": "Measure the sides of the door frame. Take your tape measure to one side of the door frame. Note the length and mark this on one piece of wood. If you have level ground, this measurement will be the same for the other side. Most likely they'll be different, so measure the other side of the frame and mark its length on another piece of wood. Don't forget to also measure the top part of the frame for the smaller piece of wood. [2] X Research source When measuring the height of the door frame, add about ⅝” (1.58 cm) to the height of the jamb, or slightly more if you have a thick floor material like carpet. To keep track of which piece of wood goes on either side, label them as “hinge jamb” and “latch jamb.” The hinge jamb is the side where your door hinges will go, and the latch jamb is the opposite side. This is especially helpful if the jambs are different lengths."

Cut the wood down to size by sawing into the marks you made earlier. If you measured correctly, the wood should now be correct length to fit within the door frame. If the board is too thick and extends past the frame, use the saw to shave it down until it’s the proper shape. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Glue and nail the wood together. Lay one of the longer pieces of wood on its side and add a bit of wood glue to the end. Attach the shorter piece to one end of the longer piece. Using wood glue keeps the wood in the proper position until you secure them with nails. Then, get your nail gun and hold it square on the outside of the area where the wood meets. Add the nails to secure the pieces together. Align the other piece of wood on the opposite side and attach it the same way. [4] X Research source"

[6] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Make sure that you do not lift the jamb too much, and determine where you need to place the shims to level the hinge side from top to bottom. Slip them between the jamb and frame as needed. [7] X Research source Home improvement specialist Ryan Tuttle says to always start with the side where the door will attach to the hinges: “Find your hinge side first and locate which way the door is going to swing. Is it going to swing inside-outside, right side-left? Then center the door frame in the rough opening and shim it into place.” [8] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 13 January 2021. Make sure to fasten the hinge side jambs directly to the stud. You can fasten them loosely in case you need to slide a jamb behind it, but it is best to keep it tight. Find wood shims at your local home improvement store."

The gap between the door and jamb should be 1/8 of an inch (.32 cm) on all sides. Add or remove shimming so the door fits. When you're sure the measurements are correct, remove the door.

Unless you are installing a prehung door, trace the outline of the hinges on the jamb and cut an indentation using a router or utility knife. Place the door in the jamb and fasten it to the hinges. Make sure it's tight and opening in the right direction. [14] X Research source It's ideal to do this first so you can gauge how much space you have for the door stops and align them properly behind the hinges."

      "content": "Measure out the stopper width. Buy a pre-cut door stopper (also called stop molding) or fashion your own out of wood strips. Measure how wide the stopper needs to be so that the pieces on each side of the door frame fit together. The molding goes behind the hinges and rests in the middle of the jamb. Measure it against the jamb until you're sure it's the right thickness. [15] X Research source The stop molding is thin. When cutting it yourself, the wood strips only need to be about 1 or 2 inches (2 to 5 cm) wide."

Keep the stopper pieces even and centered in the jamb. Nail the shorter piece to the frame, then nail the other pieces to the sides. When you're done, the closed door should rest inside the jamb.
