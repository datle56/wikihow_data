      "title": "Stand up the mast.",
      "content": "Stand up the mast. This is the hardest part of the entire rigging process, so be careful, no-one likes a broken mast or hull. You stand up the mast, make sure it's right next to the bow of the laser, and pick it straight up off the ground, and put it into the mast step (the hole at the front of your laser). A way to make this easier is to grab the mast around the middle, then walk forward thereby pushing the sail up. While walking you should also move your top hand up to have better control of the mast. The sail should now be flapping in the wind."

Do not put it through the pulley itself; you're going to need that pulley in a moment. Now that it's tied off, find the other end of your line, and run it through the traveler on the stern of the boat. Then run it back up, through the pulley on the end up the boom, then forward across the bottom of the boom, through that metal loop, through the next pulley, and then down through the main block at the front of the cockpit. Make sure that your main block clicks when you pull the mainsheet through it - if it doesn't, you have to run the mainsheet through the other side of the main block. Then tie a knot in the very end of the mainsheet, so the line can't run back through the main block when you are sailing or if you capsize. [7] X Research source"

Then put on the tiller by sliding it into the space on the top of the rudder. Once it's in, insert the pin to hold it there. Tie the dagger board with a long loop of elastic to the eye at the very front of the boat. Verify the elastic creates enough friction that the daggerboard will stay up or down (even when you invert the boat)."
