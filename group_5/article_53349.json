[1] X Research source For example: Let’s say the problem is ( 9 × 10 8 ) / ( 3 × 10 5 ) {\\displaystyle (9\\times 10^{8})/(3\\times 10^{5})} Our first step would be to divide the coefficients: 9 / 3 = 3 {\\displaystyle 9/3=3}"

      "content": "Use the rule of exponents to divide the bases separately. Now that you have your coefficient, it’s time to find the base. The rule of exponents tells us that to divide numbers with exponents, you just subtract them. [2] X Research source To continue our example from above, dividing the bases would look like this: 10 8 / 10 5 {\\displaystyle 10^{8}/10^{5}} Using the rule of exponents, we’d convert it to 10 8 − 10 5 = 10 3 {\\displaystyle 10^{8}-10^{5}=10^{3}} , because 8 − 5 = 3 {\\displaystyle 8-5=3}"

Whole numbers are easy: all you have to do is take your coefficient that you found earlier and pair it with your new power of 10.

      "content": "If your coefficient is not a whole number, convert it to scientific notation . Let’s say that when you divide your coefficient, the answer is a number that’s less than 1. In that case, there’s one more step you need to do: move the decimal point to the right, then decrease the exponent by the number of places that you move the decimal point. [4] X Research source Let’s try a new problem: ( 2 × 10 3 ) / ( 4 × 10 − 8 ) {\\displaystyle (2\\times 10^{3})/(4\\times 10^{-8})} ( 2 / 4 ) × ( 10 3 / 10 − 8 ) {\\displaystyle (2/4)\\times (10^{3}/10^{-8})} 0.5 × 10 11 {\\displaystyle 0.5\\times 10^{11}} Since the coefficient is less than 1, we now have to convert it to scientific notation: 0.5 = 5 × 10 − 1 {\\displaystyle 0.5=5\\times 10^{-1}} Now we multiply the coefficient by the new power of 10 we solved for earlier: ( 5 × 10 − 1 ) × ( 10 11 ) {\\displaystyle (5\\times 10^{-1})\\times (10^{11})} The solution is 5 × 10 10 {\\displaystyle 5\\times 10^{10}}"
