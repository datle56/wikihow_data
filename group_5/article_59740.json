      "content": "Wash the cast iron with hot water, dish soap, and a scouring pad. Whether you just got a new cast iron skillet or you’re getting an old pan out of storage, it’s important to strip away debris, grime, and old seasoning. House cleaning professional Raymond Chiu recommends scrubbing the pan in hot, soapy water with a scouring pad. If your cast iron skillet is rusted , cleaning expert Ryan Daniel Santos says to mix “equal parts of white vinegar and water” and then “pour the solution onto the rusted areas. Let it sit for about 30 minutes. Then, sprinkle baking soda onto the rusted areas and use a scrub brush…to gently scrub away the rust.” Note : It’s not recommended to clean your cast iron skillet with dish soap regularly, as it strips away the seasoning. Dish soap is only recommended for initial cleanings or to remove old seasoning buildup."

When it’s hot, pour about 1 tbsp (15 ml) of unsaturated oil into the skillet, such as vegetable, canola, grapeseed, or flaxseed oil . Wad up a few paper towels and use them to carefully spread the oil over the bottom, sides, and lip of the skillet. [2] X Research source Heating the oil in the pan bonds the oil to the cast iron (called polymerization), which creates a shiny, nonstick surface that protects the metal. [3] X Research source Note : Only add a thin layer of oil to the skillet. If there is a lot of oil left over after you rub it into the cast iron, wipe up the excess with paper towels."
