      "title": "Establish a domicile in Texas.",
      "content": "Establish a domicile in Texas. The easiest way to establish a domicile is to own or rent a home somewhere within the state. If you're living with your parents, that would typically mean that they own or rent a home in Texas. Generally, this needs to be your primary residence—in other words, the place where you live most of the time, not a summer or vacation home. [1] X Research source Employment is an important part of establishing a domicile. Either you (or your parents, if you're a dependent) must be gainfully employed in Texas in addition to owning or renting a home. If you are unhoused, talk to staff at a local shelter. They can complete an affidavit verifying your state residency. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Live in Texas for at least 12 months if you aren't a dependent.",
      "content": "Live in Texas for at least 12 months if you aren't a dependent. The clock counts backward from the official enrollment date for the year when you want to start school (also called the \"census date\"). Your 12 months must be continuous—you can leave the state to visit people or go on vacation, but you have to keep your home in Texas and have an intent to return. [3] X Research source Intent is important when it comes to establishing residency for tuition purposes. No one's going to ask you to prove this one way or the other, but technically, you don't qualify for in-state tuition if you move to the state solely for the purpose of attending a state college or university as an in-state student. As an independent student, you typically also have to be able to show that you've been gainfully employed in the state (not including student employment) and have bills coming to you in your name at your Texas address."

      "title": "Graduate from a Texas high school if you are a dependent.",
      "content": "Graduate from a Texas high school if you are a dependent. If you still live with your parents and they still claim you as a dependent on their taxes, you're typically looking at qualifying for in-state tuition as a dependent student. The easiest way to do this is to graduate from a Texas high school, as long as you lived in Texas for the 36 months immediately before high school graduation. [4] X Research source You can also establish residency by taking the GED in Texas, but this is a double-edged sword since you have to show proof of residency to take the GED. If only one of your parents lives in Texas and the court granted them custody of you, you qualify as a Texas resident for tuition purposes as long as they didn't seek custody for the sole purpose of making you eligible for in-state tuition.

      "title": "Provide proof of residency to your school's registrar.",
      "content": "Provide proof of residency to your school's registrar. Typically, you'll answer some questions from your school's registrar's office. The registrar uses the information you provide to determine if you're eligible for the in-state tuition rate. Documents you can use to validate your answers to these questions include: [6] X Research source A mortgage statement or lease Utility bills with your full name and address (or a parent's full name) A state identification card or driver license with your full name and address Texas car registration A visa, green card, or other immigration paperwork (other than a student visa)"

      "title": "Buy or rent a home in Texas with the intent to stay there.",
      "content": "Buy or rent a home in Texas with the intent to stay there. As in other situations, intent is important here. You can only claim Texas residency for tax or legal purposes if the place where you live in Texas is the place you intend to make your home. That is, you plan on living there indefinitely, not for a limited time. When you're talking about taxes and courts, it doesn't matter how much of the year you live in Texas, only that you intend for that to be your residence. For example, you're a Texas resident if you consider your parents' home in Texas your home even though you spend most months of the year in school in another state. If you're unhoused, staff at the nearest shelter can help you establish your residency. Typically, they'll include the address of the shelter as your mailing address and complete an affidavit on your behalf. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Change your address with your employer and your financial institution.",
      "content": "Change your address with your employer and your financial institution. Changing your address with your employer and your financial institution signals that you intend to be taxed as a Texas resident. Texas doesn't have state income tax, so if you're moving from a state that does, make sure you do this as soon as possible. [8] X Research source Working and banking in the state is one of the primary ways to establish that you're a legal resident of Texas, regardless of your purposes for doing so. Doing this also means your Texas address will be printed on your bank statements and pay stubs, which you can use as proof of residency."

      "content": "Register your vehicle in Texas. If you have a vehicle that's registered in another state, you can leave it that way if you don't intend to stay in Texas indefinitely. But if you want to make Texas your legal home, get Texas tags on your car within 60 days of making the move. [9] X Research source Before you get your vehicle registered and titled in Texas, you'll also need to change your residence with your car insurance company. To register your vehicle, you have to show proof that you carry car insurance that meets the state's minimum coverage requirements."

      "title": "Cut ties completely with your previous state of residence.",
      "content": "Cut ties completely with your previous state of residence. The more ties you continue to have with the state where you lived before, the more difficult it will be for you to convince legal authorities that you intend to make your home in Texas. How you cut these ties depends on what you still have connecting you to another state. [10] X Research source For example, if you own property in another state, you might need to sell that or lease it out to a tenant to make it apparent that you don't intend to move back there. Other things you might do to cut ties include getting a local bank account, registering to vote with your new address, or registering your car from your new address. Cutting ties with your previous state is especially important for military folks stationed in Texas. If you don't cut ties with your previous state, you'll likely still be considered a resident of that state and not the state of Texas."

If you're ordered to a base in Texas and want to change your state of legal residence, it's not quite as simple as just filling out a change of address card. That's because orders to a new duty station don't change your state of legal residence. Instead, you have to send a letter to your former state's Income Tax Commission indicating your intent to become a legal resident of Texas. Information you could offer as proof of this intent includes: [11] X Research source Titling and registering your vehicles in Texas Selling any property you own in the previous state where you lived Registering your children for school in Texas Living continuously in Texas Getting a Texas driver license Paying personal or real property taxes in Texas Becoming a member of religious or civic organizations in Texas"

      "content": "Live in Texas for at least 6 months if you plan to file for divorce . When you file for divorce, one of the facts you're required to plead is that you've lived in the state of Texas for at least 6 months before you filed the divorce action. Easy enough, but you also have to file in a county where you've lived for at least 90 days. [12] X Research source This means that if you and your spouse separate and you move to the next county over, you'd need to live there for at least 3 months before you'd be able to file for divorce in that county. You could still file for divorce in the county where you previously lived, though. The clock starts ticking on the 6 months the moment you change your address on something official or sign a mortgage or lease agreement. This is why it's important to get your address changed as quickly as possible. The more places and ways you've listed your residence as an address in Texas, the more likely a court will consider you a Texas resident. If you meet these requirements, your spouse can also file for divorce in the county where you live, even if they don't live in Texas."
