This bracelet is a little thicker than the basic bracelet, so you'll probably need around 30 bands for a child's bracelet and around 40 for an adult's bracelet. You will also need one C-clip or S-clip. If you don't want to work on your fingers, you can use unsharpened pencils, knitting needles, or even chopsticks to hold the bands.The process is the same no matter what you use. [1] X Research source Just hold the pencils in your non-dominant hand and work with your dominant hand. Using two (or more!) colors of bands will bring out the fishtail design better than using only one."
