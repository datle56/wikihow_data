      "content": "The only way to leave a server secretly is to abandon your account. There are many variables when it comes to how noticeable your exit from the server will be, but there is no way to completely hide that you left a server. If the server has thousands of members and you weren't active it's not likely that you leaving would be noticed, but a smaller server or one that you chatted in often would likely notice your absence. When you leave a Discord server, these are some of the ways the remaining users may find out that you left: You aren't on the member list anymore You aren't chatting in the server anymore The audit log shows the server admins that you left The server has a bot that notifies some or all members of users that leave The server has a bot that prints audit messages to admins in a dedicated server, where it would show that you left As such, the only way to truly leave a Discord server without being noticed is to stop using your account. The remaining users may notice that you aren't coming around anymore, but there would be no audit logs or bot messages announcing that you left."
