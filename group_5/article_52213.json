      "title": "Turn your heat up to a higher setting than you normally use.",
      "content": "Turn your heat up to a higher setting than you normally use. If you use soft wax (also called jelly wax) that melts under medium heat, turn your pot to medium-high. If you’ve been using a hard wax that melts at medium-high, turn the heat up as high as it will go. According to Mendes, the wax has to melt thoroughly before you can clean out the interior pot. Keep your lid open if possible. This makes it easier to monitor your wax as you heat it. Use a higher setting than you normally use to ensure that your wax reaches a thinner consistency than when applying or melting it. This will keep older wax buildup from sticking to the sides. The inner pot is the only portion you need to clean regularly on most wax pots."

      "title": "Mix the wax as it melts, then turn off the pot.",
      "content": "Mix the wax as it melts, then turn off the pot. Continue heating until your wax melts, and use a mixing stick or spoon to stir it and check for chunks of solid wax. Continue mixing until the wax is completely melted. Be careful when mixing and heating your wax. The wax can burn you if you get it on your skin. Turn the heat off after the wax has fully melted."

      "title": "Remove the inner pot safely with the handle, oven mitts, or tongs.",
      "content": "Remove the inner pot safely with the handle, oven mitts, or tongs. If your wax pot has a temperature-safe handle, use it to lift the inner bucket out of the pot. [1] X Research source If there is no handle, use oven mitts or tongs to remove the inner pot. Wear a thick oven mitt on the hand that braces the bottom to prevent yourself from getting burned. If you have a one-piece pot without a removable inner piece, pour the wax out by carefully tilting the whole unit. If you’re using a silicone wax pot liner , allow it to cool completely then bend the liner so the wax pops out."

      "title": "Pour the wax into a disposable container for removal.",
      "content": "Pour the wax into a disposable container for removal. If you don’t have a container, line a bowl with a piece of aluminum foil and pour the wax into it. [2] X Research source Put a paper towel under the container in case of a spill. Wear oven mitts or use a potholder and tilt your wax over the container to pour it out. Avoid pouring the wax down the drain, as it can clog your pipes. Do not pour the hot wax into a soft plastic or porous material that can leak. Store the excess wax if you want to use it later."

    {
      "title": "Set the inner pot aside and wait for it to cool.",
      "content": "Set the inner pot aside and wait for it to cool. Set the container in a safe place and wait 1-3 hours for the pot to cool off. Put it on a plate and stick it in the refrigerator if you’d like to accelerate the process. Don’t put the inner pot into the refrigerator if it has an electrical component. Set your pot on granite, glass, or thick rags since they can handle heat without much problem."

      "title": "Use a rubber scraper or spatula to remove any remaining wax.",
      "content": "Use a rubber scraper or spatula to remove any remaining wax. Put on a pair of rubber gloves if you want to keep your hands clean. Use a rubber scraper or spatula to scrape any remaining wax off your inner pot's interior. Allow the pieces that you scrape out to collect at the bottom of the pot and then dump them out into the trash. An alternate method is to wipe the pot out with a paper towel while it is still hot. This can be effective, but there’s more danger of burning yourself. Use heat-resistant gloves or wrap the paper towel around a long wooden stick to wipe the wax off the hot surface."

      "title": "Wipe your pot with wax cleaner or mineral oil and wipe it down.",
      "content": "Wipe your pot with wax cleaner or mineral oil and wipe it down. Some wax pots come with a wax cleaning solution specifically designed to remove wax residue from the inner pot. If your pot didn’t come with cleaner, Mendes recommends using mineral oil to wipe down the inside of your pot. Pour some oil or cleaner onto a paper towel and thoroughly rub it into every surface in your pot. [3] X Research source Do not use an acidic cleaner on an inner pot with plastic parts. The cleaner can damage or crack the pot. Vegetable oil and baby oil are also effective in helping remove wax."

      "content": "Use a popsicle stick or disposable straight edge to scrape the rim of a pot. Hold a popsicle stick in both hands with the long side horizontal to the pot’s rim. Pinch the flat end on both sides between your thumb and index finger. Use the thin edge of the popsicle stick to scrape wax off your wax pot’s rim. [5] X Research source If the wax is totally melted, it will blend in with the rim. Wipe it up with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel. Use any small, wooden straight-edge instead of a popsicle stick. Just remember that you’ll have to throw it out after the wax dries."

Wipe the rim and face by rubbing in one direction with each swipe to lift the wax. Clean any knobs or dials by lightly turning them with the paper towel in your hand.

      "content": "Heat your improvised pot like you normally would to melt the wax. Removing wax from a glass container or metal pan is the same as removing candle wax. If your improvised wax pot is a metal pan or heat-safe glass container, heat it up the way you normally would to begin melting the wax. It’s usually best to heat glass containers in the microwave and metal pans on the stove. Use a blow-dryer if you don’t have your normal heating method available or the heating element is damaged."

Pour it into the jar or pan slowly until there’s 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of space remaining at the top of the container. [9] X Research source If you accidentally fill the container to the point that it overflows, carefully dump out some of the water out. Only dump the water out if there aren’t any wax bits in it."

Add cold water to the container. [10] X Research source As the water cools, the wax will harden again, allowing you to strain the water in a colander . Do this outside or over another pot to prevent any wax from getting in your drain. Discard wax you don’t want to reuse."
