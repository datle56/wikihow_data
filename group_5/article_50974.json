      "content": "Choose a style you’re passionate about to base your posts around. Your Instagram feed looks a lot cleaner and more uniform if all of your posts follow a similar pattern. Make a list of the styles of pictures you like and the color schemes that you want to experiment with. Take a few pictures with each style that you wrote down to see which ones you’re the most comfortable doing. Remember that most, if not all, of your posts should fit into a similar niche, so pick a style that you won’t get tired of. [1] X Research source For example, if you want to model fitness wear, you may focus on posting pictures of yourself playing sports, hiking, or being active. As another example, if you want to make your profile feel warm and inviting, try incorporating reds, oranges, and yellows into each of your photos. If you already have pictures on your Instagram feed, delete or archive the ones that don’t fit in with your style"

[5] X Expert Source Annie Tao Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 3 March 2021. When you find a location that you like, ask someone to take your picture or use a tripod if you’re by yourself. Pose yourself off-center in the image to create a more interesting composition. Try an action pose, like picking a flower or dancing, or go for a more traditional model pose to see what you like best. [6] X Research source Take a lot of pictures so you can always choose the most flattering one. Make sure the background isn’t too busy, or else it will distract people from your look. Play around with different angles. For example, if you want to look taller, position the camera closer to the ground.

[9] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “In love with this new sundress from H&M. It goes perfectly with these bracelets. What’s your favorite accessory to wear with a sundress?” As another example, if you’re a fitness model, you could share a post-workout photo and say, “Really felt the burn today with my core exercises.

Then add a few of them to the end of your caption to help other people find your account. [10] X Research source Other specific hashtags you can try include “#fitnessmodel,” “#plussizemodel,” “#guyswithstyle,” or “#altmodel.” [11] X Expert Source Ramin Ahmari Social Media Expert Expert Interview. 5 April 2019.

If you had someone else take your pictures, either tag them directly in the photo or mention their Instagram account in the caption. If you’re wearing specific brands, be sure to tag or mention them as well. That way, people who visit those accounts might find your page and start following you too. The account may even repost your image onto their own feed. [12] X Research source It’s never a guarantee that another account will repost your pictures even if you tag them."

      "content": "Ask questions to keep your followers involved. Instagram Stories are great for showing your life behind-the-scenes and involving your followers in your daily life. Ask for their opinions about outfits, post polls about what you should do for the day, and share links to products and things you’re excited about. That way, your fans feel like they’re a part of your life and are getting to know more about who you are. [16] X Research source For example, you could ask or create a poll for, “What should I have for lunch today?” with a couple of options. Once you get enough responses, post more stories about you making the meal."

As you get closer with other models, ask them to collaborate for photo shoots or Instagram Live sessions. That way, some of their fans will follow your page and your followers will visit theirs. [17] X Research source Ask other models to be in an “engagement pod” with you, where you like each other’s photos within a few hours of posting them to help boost your visibility."

A media kit is your portfolio that showcases your feed’s aesthetic and statistics to convince brands to pay for posts. Gather professional images of yourself that have the same colors and styles as the pictures in your feed. Write a few paragraphs about yourself and what you post on Instagram. Then, include how many followers you have and how they actively engage with your content. [18] X Research source Save your media kit as a PDF and upload it to a website. That way, you can easily link to it in an email to a brand’s PR or marketing department. You can link your media kit directly to your profile or send it out to potential brands that you’re interested in representing."

If there are brands that you really want to showcase in your posts, send them a direct message or find their email contact on their website. Let them know about your Instagram page, how many followers you have, and how engaged they are with your feed. If they’re interested in working with you, they’ll follow up and give you more details. [19] X Research source When you’re first starting off, you may only get freebies from a company in exchange for posting about them. As you get more popular and gain followers, then they may pay you per post. Don’t take it personally if you don’t hear back from a brand. Be polite in case you want to work with them in the future, but look for another interested brand in the meantime."
