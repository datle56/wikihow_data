      "title": "Linger at the end of the date.",
      "content": "Linger at the end of the date. At the end of your outing, linger with your date before parting. Even if you’re nervous, try not to fill every moment with words. Draw out natural pauses, which allows a moment of anticipation to build. [1] X Research source Remember, you don't have to talk all the time in order to create a special moment. Sometimes, the most memorable moments are those without words."

    {
      "title": "Get physically close.",
      "content": "Get physically close. Minimize the physical distance between you and your date. You can sweep their hair out of their eyes or touch their arm. Touch indicates that you’re ready for a more intimate moment. Remember to look for signs that your touch is welcome. If your date strokes your face or touches you back, that is a positive sign. If your date leans or turns away from you, that is a negative sign. Give them some space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay your date a compliment.",
      "content": "Pay your date a compliment. Say something sincere to make your date feel close to you. Even though you don’t know each other well, try to pay them a genuine compliment about the nice time you’ve had. You’ll be physically close, and your words will create emotional intimacy. [2] X Research source For example, making eye contact, you could say, “I had a really wonderful time tonight.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot a glance at your date’s lips.",
      "content": "Shoot a glance at your date’s lips. Draw out the moment after your compliment and glance at your date’s lips. Hold your gaze there only for a second or two, then make eye contact again. Keep your mouth gently parted, ready to kiss. [3] X Research source If your date looks at your lips too, that is a great sign. They may even make the first move. If your date looks away from your lips, fidgets, looks around, or appears otherwise uncomfortable, that is not a great sign."

    {
      "title": "Ask your date if you can kiss them.",
      "content": "Ask your date if you can kiss them. If you’re not sure about kissing your date, just ask them. This step might prevent you from getting rejected, if you’re worried about that. [4] X Research source You might say, “I’d really like to kiss you right now. Is that okay?” They may say \"sure!\" or they may even reply with a kiss. They may also say \"no,\" in which case, you should respect that and not pressure them for a kiss."

    {
      "title": "Lean in for the kiss, gently pressing your lips against theirs.",
      "content": "Lean in for the kiss, gently pressing your lips against theirs. Your date may take the lead with the kiss, or they may turn away. If they kiss you back, kiss slowly, reading your date’s level of enthusiasm before doing anything more intense. [5] X Research source If you’re unsure if they want to kiss, lean in slowly. This gives them time to stop the kiss if they don’t want to. Pay attention to their body language. If they start to pull away, stop; don't continue going for the kiss."

    {
      "title": "Break the touch barrier.",
      "content": "Break the touch barrier. Whenever it feels appropriate during the outing, gently touch your date. You can put your hand on theirs at the dinner table or guide them through a doorway with your hand on their back. Find opportunities to get comfortable touching one another, which will remove the pressure of touching intimately for the first time when kissing. Try to touch more than once before the kiss. Establishing comfort through touch will make a kiss more likely. If your date pulls away from your touch, that may mean they’re not ready for physical contact."

      "title": "Build intimacy with your date by smiling as you hang out together.",
      "content": "Build intimacy with your date by smiling as you hang out together. A kind smile or laugh lets your date know that you’re interested in what they have to say and find them engaging. It also lets them know you’re having a good time and enjoying their company. [6] X Research source Keep your smile genuine, however. You don't have to keep a big, fake smile plastered over your face like a Barbie doll."

      "title": "Look at your date to let them know you’re paying attention to them.",
      "content": "Look at your date to let them know you’re paying attention to them. Eye contact can also build trust and foster affection. It shows your date that you’re not afraid to be vulnerable. [7] X Research source You don't have to maintain eye contact for the entire date; it's perfectly to look away. You should definitely keep eye contact while both of you are speaking, however."

      "title": "Pay attention while they are talking.",
      "content": "Pay attention while they are talking. Give your date your full attention while they are talking by putting away your phone and looking at them. You can also ask follow up questions to what they’re talking about to express your interest. If your date is talking about her rescue dog, you might say, “I love pets, too. What made you decide to adopt?” You can also show you’re listening through your body language. Lean forward and put your hand under your chin, for example, to show that they really have your focus. Ask your date follow-up questions about their life and interests to show them that you’re genuinely interested in learning more about them.

      "title": "Be on time.",
      "content": "Be on time. Start the date out on the right foot by showing up 5 minutes early. Showing up on time shows your date that you respect their time and that being with them is important to you. [8] X Research source If your rendezvous is in an unfamiliar part of town, leave yourself a little extra time in case there is traffic, difficult parking, or another unforeseen problem. If you are running late, let them know. Give them a call or a text explaining the situation and giving a rough estimate of when they should expect you to arrive."

      "title": "Dress nicely.",
      "content": "Dress nicely. Put on clean, unwrinkled clothes for your date. Even if the date is casual, nix athletic wear, such as gym shorts, and dress in a polished way. Putting effort into your appearance lets your date know that you respect them and that this date is important to you. [9] X Research source For a feminine look, wear a nice dress and some pumps for a fancier date, or a nice blouse and a dark pair of jeans for something a little more casual. For a masculine look, try chinos and a collared shirt. Leather accessories, such as a nice belt, can dress up untorn jeans, too."

      "content": "Practice good oral and personal hygiene. If you want to make yourself as kissable as possible for your date, be sure your breath is fresh and that you don’t have any body odor. It’s also helpful to apply an unflavored lip balm for soft lips. Brush your teeth and tongue twice a day to keep your mouth ready for kissing. Always wear deodorant. This is especially important if you sweat when you’re nervous on first date."

      "title": "Respect your date’s boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect your date’s boundaries. If your date says that they do not want to kiss or pulls away from you, don’t force them to kiss. It may be that they like you but are not ready for physical intimacy yet. If someone turns you down for a kiss, you might say, “No problem. I respect that.”"
