What you see on this list next will depend on what information your Waze friend has given the company access to.

If you are a Waze Map Editor too, this is also the place where you'll find information about your edits to the map that the Waze team has approved. Recognize how you reply. Replies from friends come in as \"Message from (friends name):\" and read a preview of the message below. The box will list the time the message was sent, or if the message was sent more than 24 hours ago, the date instead. Replies must be sent as new messages to the friend using the same method of selecting a message from their friends listing."
