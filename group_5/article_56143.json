There are 2 in the back corners, 2 on the sides, and 2 in the front corners by the park \"P\" symbol. Remove it by lodging the flat-blade screwdriver between the plastic cover and rectangular area and pulling up to pop the cover out of place. The cover is easiest to remove by popping out the front corners located by the park \"P\" symbol and one of the sides. Once at least 3 locations are out of place, the cover can be removed by just pulling it with some force. However, be careful as this bezel can easily crack if one side is pulled farther than the other."

Lodge the flat-blade screwdriver in the seam and push the screwdriver away from you while using your other hand to grip the bottom of the compartment and pop it out of place. The compartment has to pop out of place towards you; therefore, you should pull with your hand from underneath and push away with the screwdriver in order to have this affect. Once the compartment is out of place, pull it out of the area by making sure the compartment door is closed and the bottom of the compartment is removed first. After the compartment is removed, you have access to the wiring of the stereo."

Place the largest compartment into place by pushing it until it clicks into place. If it is fitting correctly it should not move and the compartment door should be working perfectly. Screw in the 2 screws that were removed in step 7 which are at the bottom corners of the large compartment. Next, put the 2 sectioned compartment back into place and screw it in. Reattach the wire from step 7 to the power outlet in the 2 section compartment and push that down into place. Screw in the 2 screws from step 6 which are in the back of the 2 sectioned compartment. Place the rubber tray back into place by just pushing it down. Screw in the final 2 screws and place the plastic cover. Screw in the final 2 screws from step 4 which are the corners of where the park \"P\" symbol is. Place the plastic cover into place surrounding the shift knob. Finally, put the shift knob back into park \"P\" and cap the small piece next to park \"P\". No screwdriver is required for this, since the shift knob is already not in park. You will be able to do this by just pressing the button on the shift knob and moving it. Then, cap the small piece next the park \"P\" symbol and turn the car off. You're done! Now you can enjoy music from your hand held device in your 2003-2007 Honda Accord."
