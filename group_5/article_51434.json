[2] X Research source For example, if you want to find the fifth number in the sequence, your table will have five rows. When using the table method, you cannot find a random number farther down in the sequence without calculating all the number before it. For example, if you want to find the 100th number in the sequence, you have to calculate the 1st through 99th numbers first. This is why the table method only works well for numbers early in the sequence."

This means just entering a sequence of sequential ordinal numbers, beginning with \"1st.\" The term refers to the position number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if you want to figure out the fifth number in the sequence, you will write 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th down the left column. This will show you what the first through fifth terms in the sequence are."
