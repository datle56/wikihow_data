      "content": "Determine your caloric needs while breastfeeding. People who are breastfeeding generally need more calories than usual to meet their nutritional needs. In fact, an additional 330-400 calories per day (compared to the amount you were eating before) is usually needed. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source There are online calculators available to help you determine exactly how many calories you need to stay nourished and healthy while breastfeeding. These calculators use factors like your weight and height to determine how many calories you need, and they give you the option to factor in your breastfeeding status. Try the one from the U.S. Government at https://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlatePlan . This particular calculator tells you how many calories per day you need to maintain your weight, so your goal will be to eat more than this number. Be sure to mark that you're breastfeeding."

This can be over any period of time (several days, a week, a month, etc).

If you're not used to counting calories, you may need to measure your foods to accurately represent what you're eating. For instance, you may not be able to visually estimate what a serving of pasta looks like, but you can use measuring cups or a food scale. There are also online calorie counters and apps that can help you estimate your servings and track your calories."
