      "content": "Place the hay on the Feeding Bench. When you enter a Coop, this bench will be in the far back of the building. Select the hay in your inventory, then interact with each empty spot on the Feeding Bench. In a regular Coop, you'll have 4 slots on the Feeding Bench. For a Big Coop, you'll have 8 slots, and for a Deluxe Coop, you'll have 12 slots. The chickens will begin eating the hay if they haven't eaten already. Be sure to refill the hay every day to keep your chickens happy. You can use their products to create Artisan Goods for a large profit ."

      "content": "Allow your chickens to eat outside (optional). If you don't want to feed your chickens manually, you can allow them to roam outside to eat grass. Interact with the little gate outside of the Coop to open it. Be sure to close the gate before you start the next day. It's recommended to let the grass grow so you can harvest hay at the end of Fall to prepare for feeding in Winter."

To upgrade from a Big Barn to a Deluxe Barn, you'll need 25,000g, 550 Wood, and 300 Stone. Hay will automatically be placed on the Feeding Bench every morning.
