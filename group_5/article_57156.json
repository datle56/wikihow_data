      "content": "Before you make a bead , prepare the mandrels. Take each one and rub firmly with wire wool. This cleans the metal and helps the bead release adhere to the surface."

      "content": "If a powdered bead release is to be used, mix it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dip each mandrel in the bead release and leave to dry. Some bead releases can be dried in the flame; however, if yours does not say to do this, then leave to air dry, as it may crack otherwise."

      "content": "When dry, check each mandrel to make sure that the coating is even and intact. Discard any mandrels with cracked bead release because if the glass comes in contact with the mandrel, it will stick and will likely be impossible to remove."

You will get a thin string of glass, just allow the flame to melt through it. [5] X Research source Place your glass rod onto the rod rest, out of the way. You may want to switch your mandrel into your dominant hand at this point. To do this, carefully bring the mandrel in front of the torch. Never try reach over the flame."

Put the bead and mandrel in between two sheets of fiber blanket, or into a pot of vermiculite to cool. Be careful not to disturb the bead – if it cools too fast it may crack. To check if your bead is cool enough to go into the fiber blanket or vermiculite without damaging it, hold the bead under your work area (don't forget to rotate) and see if it is still glowing – as soon as the glow fades, put it into the fiber blanket or vermiculite."
