      "content": "This sends a subtle sign that she's on your radar. If you suddenly start following her on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and her YouTube channel, she may be a little creeped out by your overwhelming interest. Instead, play it cool and pick her biggest platform so it's not weird if you suddenly start commenting or liking her content. Although any of these platforms are good for flirting, Facebook and Twitter are great at sending lots of notifications that can help you get noticed. [1] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. You don't want to scare her off with your interest, which is why it's important to blend in a little on social media. Reader Poll: We asked 862 wikiHow readers and only 10% recommend following and engaging with social media accounts as a good way to connect with women online. [Take Poll] So, while this approach may work for some people, try to connect with her in other ways outside of social media."

      "content": "Add cool information to your profile that might appeal to her. If your account is private, you won't show up on discovery or search pages so she won't be able to look into you if she sees that you're following her. Tweak your profile a bit to include some hobbies or interests that overlap with hers. [2] X Research source For instance, if she loves a band, mention that you're a fan of their music. If she is outdoorsy, you might similar hobbies like hiking or kayaking."

You can also use photos that play up how great you are! For example, post images of you snorkeling, hanging out with friends at a concert, or playing an instrument. Think about what you want her to see and show that on social media. [3] X Research source Sort through your old photos and remove any that you don't like or that feel outdated."

This isn't to say you can't check out her old posts to learn more about her—just don't comment on or interact with those older posts. Stick to the newest posts if you want to engage her.

      "content": "Don't comment first on her posts or comment on every single one. Doing this can make it look like you've been watching and waiting for her to drop some content. Wait until a few people have already posted before you add your comment. Also, limit yourself to 1 comment per post since multiple comments may turn her off. [5] X Research source Skip commenting on hugely popular posts, especially ones where everyone's basically commenting the same thing like \"Congratulations\" or \"Happy Birthday.\" If you comment on every single one of her posts, she'll think you look way too eager or you've got a lot of time on your hands."

Instead, find something playful or interesting to say so your comment stands out from the rest. [6] X Research source For instance, if she tweets from a concert, you could reply, \"OMG so jealous! Did they play from their newest album? The third track is amazing.\""

      "content": "Post unique or uplifting information so she likes what she sees. Sure, everyone has days that they just want to complain about life, but that's not really the vibe you want to send her. You're trying to show that you have a fun, upbeat personality so she's attracted to you. You might share updates about hitting the gym, eating at a great restaurant, or going out to see the newest blockbuster, for instance. [7] X Research source Glance through her platforms to see what kind of posts she shares and share similar content. For instance, if she loves photography, share a few artsy black and white photos. This can help you create a connection. Avoid negative posts that show you smoking, drinking, or doing things that might turn her off."

[8] X Research source Keep in mind that not everyone has shareable content. You don't want to re-post her pictures or an update about how she's feeling, for instance."

If you always share to your story, you'll be constantly on her mind.

Even though you may not be friends with her in real life, she'll at least be able to put a name to your face when photos of her friends pop up on her platforms.

Tag them and remark on what an amazing time you all had."

If you feel like she's aware of you and interested, send her a direct message and just comment on something she posted or that you have in common. If she messages back, keep it going. You could even suggest meeting up if it seems like you're hitting it off. [11] X Research source For instance, send her a message like, \"Your artwork blew me away. I love how you use photography and painting to make your work.\" If she replies and you message back and forth a few times, it's totally fine to say something like, \"Hey, do you want to grab drinks or coffee sometime?\""
