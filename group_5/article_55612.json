Remove your cover from the packaging and, if necessary, use a handheld saw to cut it down to the proper size.

      "content": "Mount your base to the wall with the screws. The cable cover has two parts: a base and a cover. The base should be marked and will also have small holes running along either side where you apply screws. Use one hand to hold the base of the cable cover against the wall, following in the direction of the line you drew. Use a screwdriver to attach the screws to each hole in the cover. [4] X Research source The screws you need should come with your cable cover kit."

      "content": "Hide your cables in a box. Place a decorative box on a shelf just under the cables. Gather the cables together and close the box to hide them. You can also cut a small hole in either side of the box and feed the cables through this hole to the wall outlet to conceal them. [8] X Research source"

Take some pictures or paintings and hang them over the cords to hide them. [9] X Research source If cords get very hot, this could be a fire hazard. Avoid using pictures for cords attached to powerful devices, such as air conditioners."

      "content": "Use a frame or border around a television. Cables often stem from a television set. You can buy frames meant to be fitted around a TV at a local craft or department store. If you place the frame around the TV and then feed the cables behind the TV stand, this can help hide some of the cables. [10] X Research source"

Work the cables into an interesting shape or design and then secure them in place with tape. For example, you can make the shape of a building with your cables and then tape the shape in place. [12] X Research source A strong type of tape, like packaging tape, works best."

Check behind this device to see where the cables stem out from the back. Mark a spot on the wall level to the cables. [13] X Research source Once you've marked the spot, you need access to the wall. Push back the device, like the television or stereo, that's attached to your cords so you can easily work on the wall.

There should be two small flaps on the side of the cable plate that can be manually pushed up and down. Push the flaps inward so they're tucked into the side of the plate.
