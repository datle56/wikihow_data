      "title": "Stop taking medications that affect your blood 2 weeks before and after your injection.",
      "content": "Stop taking medications that affect your blood 2 weeks before and after your injection. Write a list of all the different medications you take on a regular basis. A variety of different medicines, like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, as well as certain cardiovascular medicines, can raise your risk of bruising after an injection. Talk to your doctor and see which medications may put you at risk, and ask if it’s safe to go off them for a couple of weeks to prevent bruising from your injection.

      "title": "Ditch supplements that raise your risk of bruising 3–5 days before the injection.",
      "content": "Ditch supplements that raise your risk of bruising 3–5 days before the injection. Fish oil, flaxseed oil, cod liver oil, ginger, garlic, St. John’s Wort, melatonin, valerian, niacin, turmeric, and cayenne can all make bruising worse. If possible, stop taking these supplements for 2 weeks before and after your injection."

      "title": "Limit eating foods that have aspirin-like properties.",
      "content": "Limit eating foods that have aspirin-like properties. A lot of fresh foods may raise your risk of bruising, which isn’t ideal before an injection. While you don’t have to cut these foods out of your diet completely, you may want to go easy in the days beforehand. [4] X Research source Some common produce offenders are avocados, apples, apricots, cucumbers, grapefruit, grapes, melons, oranges, peaches, plums, raspberries, and more. Shellfish, soybeans, wheat germ oil, sunflower seeds, flaxseed, fish, and root beer could also make bruising worse."

      "content": "Don’t drink alcohol 5–7 days before you plan on getting an injection. Alcohol can definitely raise your risk of bruising, especially if you drink right before the procedure. Instead, pass on any alcohol the night before your injection, as well as the night after. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Alcohol functions as a blood thinner, and slows your blood’s ability to clot properly.

      "content": "Cool off the injection area with ice right after the procedure. Grab a cold compress or ice pack and place it on top of the injection site. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Always keep your cold pack wrapped in a towel, so you don’t hurt your skin. Only use it in 15-20 minute increments, which will prevent any long-term damage. [8] X Research source This is best to do in the first 8 hours after your injection."

      "title": "Take Arnica or bromelain supplements.",
      "content": "Take Arnica or bromelain supplements. Talk to your doctor about trying special supplements like Arnica and bromelain, which are known to help with bruising. Take Arnica pills 4 days before your injection, and 4 days afterward, as well. Similarly, you can take bromelain pills 3 days before the injection and 1 week afterward. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Check the label for specific dosage instructions or talk to a medical professional for guidance.

      "content": "Spread bromelain or Arnica gel over the injection area. Shop online or in your local pharmacy to find bromelain or Arnica gel. While there’s not a ton of medical research on this, some studies show that bromelain or Arnica is useful after an injection. Coat the injection site completely with ointment, following the instructions on the bottle or container as you go. [11] X Research source High doses of vitamin K may also help with bruising. Eating kale and spinach can reduce bruising, swelling, and inflammation as well."

      "title": "Use a small-gauge needle.",
      "content": "Use a small-gauge needle. If you’re getting a cosmetic procedure, talk to your doctor about the type of needle they’ll be using for your injection. Typically, wider types, like cannula needles, are more likely to cause bruising. Ask the doctor if they can possibly use smaller needles for your procedure, like 30-gauge. There’s no guarantee that they’ll honor your preferences, but it’s worth an ask.

      "content": "Insert the needle at the correct angle for the injection. If you're giving yourself an injection, doing it correctly can minimize bruising. If the needle’s going straight into the muscle, hold it at a 90-degree angle away from your skin. If the needle is going just under the skin (subcutaneous), hold it at a 45-degree angle.

      "content": "Lay back and relax in your seat if you’re getting a cosmetic treatment. Certain treatments, like fillers and cosmetic enhancements, are best injected when you’re sitting in a reclined seat. Check that your seat is reclined at about a 30-degree angle, which can help prevent bruising.
