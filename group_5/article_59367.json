    {
      "title": "Reach out to the interviewer as soon as you can.",
      "content": "Reach out to the interviewer as soon as you can. As soon as you realize that you’re not going to make it to your interview, contact the hiring manager or recruiter that set it up. If you’re rescheduling an interview at the last minute, call them on the phone if you have their number. Even if you only have a few hours before the scheduled time, it’s okay to send them an email requesting a different interview slot. [1] X Research source Letting the interviewer know right away also shows that you respect their time and gave them as much notice as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain why you need to reschedule the interview.",
      "content": "Explain why you need to reschedule the interview. In about 1–2 sentences, tell the interviewer the reason why you want to move the interview. You could explain that you are sick, have a family emergency, or have issues with getting to the interview location. Give as much detail as you’re comfortable with. [2] X Research source “I got really sick this morning and I’m afraid I’ll have to reschedule our interview today.” “I’m sorry but I have to reschedule the interview for this afternoon. My son had an emergency at school, and I have to take care of him.” “My car just broke down on the way to the interview, and I won’t be able to make it in.” Really consider if you need to reschedule. Don’t try to move your interview because you want to go to a fun event. If your potential employer somehow found out, it will look pretty unprofessional. Even if you don’t feel ready for the interview, try to stick with the original date and time. Take a deep breath and prepare for the interview as much as you can by practicing answers to common questions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Express that you’re still interested in the role.",
      "content": "Express that you’re still interested in the role. Show your enthusiasm and excitement for the position so the interviewer doesn’t think you’re rescheduling because you lost interest. Let them know that you’re excited to meet the team and talk about the opening. “I was looking forward to meeting with you, and I couldn’t wait to learn more about the role today. I’d love to work out a different time.” “I’m so excited for the opportunity to talk about this position. I wouldn’t miss it unless it were an emergency.” Tell the interviewer that you don’t take rescheduling lightly and you wouldn’t be doing it under normal circumstances. Hiring managers are pretty understanding that things come up."
    },
    {
      "title": "Suggest alternate times when you’re available.",
      "content": "Suggest alternate times when you’re available. Check your schedule for openings in the next few weeks and pick a few different times that you’re free. Include a few options for days and times so the interviewer knows you’re trying to work with their schedule. [3] X Research source “I have openings tomorrow at 11 AM or 2 PM if either of those work for you. Otherwise, I’m available any time after 3.” “Is it possible to reschedule for Monday at 10:30 or Tuesday at noon? Those are my next available openings on my schedule.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize for the inconvenience.",
      "content": "Apologize for the inconvenience. Let the interviewer know that you feel bad for having to push the interview to another time. After seeing or hearing that you’re sorry the interview couldn’t go on as planned, the hiring manager will see that you’re acting professional and courteous. [4] X Research source “I’m so sorry again that I have to push this interview.” “Sorry again for having to reschedule, but I’m looking forward to meeting you!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank the interviewer for understanding.",
      "content": "Thank the interviewer for understanding. Tell the person interviewing you that you appreciate their time and patience with you. They’ll understand that you’re busy and things come up, but thanking them helps show that you’re courteous and caring. [5] X Research source “Thank you for being so understanding and I hope there’s a time that works for both of us.” “I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to still come in and meet you.”"

    {
      "title": "Be accommodating if the interviewer suggests different times.",
      "content": "Be accommodating if the interviewer suggests different times. If the other person reaches out with a set of times they’re available, look at your schedule to see when you’re free. Choose time slots that are the soonest after your originally scheduled interview to show that you’re really eager to discuss the position. [6] X Research source"
