      "title": "Identify what triggers your spongiotic dermatitis.",
      "content": "Identify what triggers your spongiotic dermatitis. This skin condition often flares up because of a specific irritant. Knowing what triggers your spongiotic dermatitis can help you prevent and relieve it. The trigger could be an allergen, food allergy, cosmetic, environmental factor, insect bite, or harsh soap or detergent. If you suspect a specific trigger, try to limit your exposure to it and see if it relieves your symptoms. Certain external factors can worsen spongiotic dermatitis including dry skin from taking baths or showers that are too hot, stress, sweat, wearing wool, exposure to tobacco smoke and pollution. Certain foods can also worsen spongiotic dermatitis including eggs, milk, peanuts, soybeans, fish, and wheat. Use mild or “hypoallergenic” soaps and laundry detergents. These contain fewer harmful chemicals that can irritate your skin. Rinse clothes twice after washing to ensure that the detergent is well removed. Any product marked “hypoallergenic” has been tested for sensitive skin and will likely not irritate your skin."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use a gentle cleanser made for sensitive skin when you bathe or shower. Recommended choices include Dove, Aveeno, and Cetaphil. Don't use overly hot water, as this can dry out and irritate skin. Apply moisturizer to your skin at least twice a day. The best time to apply is after a shower or bath while your skin is still damp. Later in the day, consider using an oil to moisturize your skin. Make sure to use unscented and uncolored moisturizers that will not irritate your skin. If you aren't sure what moisturizer is best for your skin, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Use creams or ointments, as they are usually thicker and more effective than lotions, and they're usually less irritating to the skin. Taking a 10-15 minute bath in warm water sprinkled with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal oatmeal will help your skin stay moisturized. Make sure to moisturize your skin with a cream or oil after the bath. Keeping a humidifier in your home will ensure that the air is moist and won’t dry out your skin.

Cold packs or compresses can help relieve itching and inflammation associated with spongiotic dermatitis by constricting blood flow and cooling the skin. Histamine is produced when an allergen enters in the body. It is involved in all of the symptoms of allergic reactions, including itching and inflammation. You can place a cold compress on your rashes intermittently for 10 to 15 minutes, once every 2 hours or as needed."

Before taking any new medications, consult with your doctor, as some may interact with other medical conditions or current medications. Chlorpheniramine is available in 2 mg and 4 mg tablets.
