      "content": "Poo-Pourri is an anti-odor spray for your #2s. Don’t want to become known as “party pooper” at work because you have a tendency to stink the bathroom up? Want to avoid embarrassment at your date’s house when you use the can? If so, Poo-Pourri might be for you. Poo-Pourri’s toilet sprays will curb odors when you use the John so that nobody knows you’re taking a bowel movement. [1] X Research source Poo-Pourri’s sprays come in dozens of different aromas . The original citrus product is hands-down the most popular, though. Poo-Pourri is made out of essential oil mixes and none of their products contain harmful chemicals. Not only will Poo-Pourri cover up the odor while you’re pooping, but you’ll walk out of the toilet smelling great, too. This is a phenomenal product if you have IBS, Crohn’s disease, or you’re simply self-conscious about using the bathroom in public."

      "content": "Yes, users tend to be blown away by how well it works. Poo-Pouri is oil-based. Ever hear what they say about oil and water? (Hint: they don’t mix!) When you spray the toilet, the Poo-Pouri coats the surface of the water in a thin layer of essential oils and odor neutralizers. When you go, your dung hits the water and gets covered in this oil, which traps the nasty smells in and keeps them from getting out. Give it a shot yourself—this stuff is seriously impressive. [2] X Research source Once you flush, all of the poop disappears alongside the remaining Poo-Pouri on the water, so the bathroom won’t even smell like you were using anything to cover the odor up when you’re done. Poo-Pourri is 100% natural, so don’t worry about damaging the toilet or the sewage pipes at all."

      "title": "Spritz the toilet water 3-5 times with Poo-Pourri.",
      "content": "Spritz the toilet water 3-5 times with Poo-Pourri. Once you close the stall or bathroom, break out the Poo-Pourri and shake the bottle gently. Then, spray the toilet bowl 3-5 times to cover the surface of the water with the Poo-Pourri formula. [3] X Research source If you feel like this might be an especially stinky experience, go ahead and throw an extra 2-3 sprays in there just for good measure. Keep in mind, Poo-Pourri is pretty potent. If you don’t want people to really notice any odor at all, 3 spritzes should be more than enough."

      "content": "Go about your business and flush the evidence away. Once you’ve sprayed the bowl, go ahead and poop the same exact way you normally would. Take your bowel movement, wipe thoroughly, and flush the toilet just like you’re on the throne in the privacy of your own home. [4] X Research source Keep in mind, if you do any courtesy flushing, you need to reapply the Poo-Pourri. This product is one use per application."

      "content": "Mask If Poo-Pourri’s products tend to stand out on the bathroom shelf, and the name doesn’t exactly hide what it’s meant to do. If you want something a little more incognito, Mask makes some great toilet sprays that won’t raise eyebrows. The name is super innocuous, and it just looks like a black spray bottle. [6] X Research source Mask also makes air fresheners if you want something to keep your bathroom smelling fresh! Mask’s products aren’t exclusively natural, but they are free from preservatives, parabens, phthalates, and other hard-to-pronounce chemicals that may irritate you. It’s vegan and cruelty-free, too!"

      "content": "Squatty Potty Unicorn Gold Toilet Spray Poo-Pourri’s aromas tend to be very subtle and balanced, but Squatty Potty is probably better if you like bold aromas. With flavors like Fruity Booty and Mystic Forest, these strong aromatics will keep the bathroom smelling phenomenal well after you walk out. [7] X Research source Squatty Potty Unicorn Gold is made with literal gold flakes and essential oils. Not only does it smell good, but it looks fancy."

      "content": "Air Wick V.I.Poo V.I.Poo works the same exact way as Poo-Pourri, although you may want to pick V.I.Poo up if you’re already using Air Wick products in your home (or they already use them at work). That way, there will be a uniform smell throughout your home or your place of work. [8] X Research source V.I.Poo and Poo-Pourri even cost the same ($9.99 per 2 ounce bottle)."

      "title": "Aesop Post-Poo Drops",
      "content": "Aesop Post-Poo Drops If you prefer to save your aromatics until after you know you need them, Aesop’s Post-Poo Drops are for you. While Poo-Pourri and other products need to be applied to the water before you go about your business, you can hold off with Post-Poo Drops. This is great if you don’t want to churn through bottles every few weeks and your #2s are only occasionally super smelly. [9] X Research source To use Post-Poo Drops, add 1-2 droplets to the toilet bowl after you finish flushing. You’ll be blown away at how quickly the bathroom starts smelling phenomenal."
