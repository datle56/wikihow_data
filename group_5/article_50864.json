      "content": "Focus on socializing with the people around you. Socializing as an introvert can be difficult if you’re just starting out. It might even be tempting to check your phone when feeling nervous or overwhelmed by a crowd. But if you have your head down with your eyes focused on the screen it can also make you seem closed off and disinterested in meeting new people. Try setting your phone on silent and keeping it in a pocket or purse to avoid temptation. This helps you stay fully engaged with the people around you and gives you the opportunity to branch out and introduce yourself to someone new. [1] X Research source If you’re still tempted to check your phone, leave it in your vehicle or ask a friend to hold it. At first, you might feel a little uncomfortable leaving your phone behind. We’re all used to checking everything from social media to sports scores every few minutes. But once you start to relax and enjoy conversations with others, you’ll probably forget about checking out what’s happening online."

Instead, move closer to the center of the room where other people gather. Try to stay near groups of people you’re interested in talking to so you’re able to get involved in their conversations when the opportunity arises. [2] X Research source Try moving around the room to give yourself the chance to interact with more people.

      "content": "Show you’re enthusiastic to meet and interact with people. When interacting with someone, be friendly and show genuine interest in them to appear more energetic. Smile and vary the tone of your voice when you talk to keep the conversation engaging. Maintain a positive attitude, and the other person will usually respond the same way. [6] X Research source Try listening to fast-paced pump-up music before putting yourself in social situations to help boost your energy levels. People have different social energy levels, so make an effort to adapt your energy to the person you’re talking with. For example, if someone doesn’t seem as energetic, stay positive but act a little more relaxed around them. If they seem more hyper, try to raise your energy level a little."

      "title": "Speak up and take part in the conversation.",
      "content": "Speak up and take part in the conversation. Rather than keeping things to yourself or questioning what you want to say, insert yourself into the conversation, even if it’s just small talk. Raise your voice slightly so other people can hear you. [7] X Research source Remember, using filler words, like “um,” “uh,” or “I guess” might make you seem like you’re low on energy and less excited to be a part of the conversation. Try to speak more directly to keep your vibe positive. [8] X Research source If you have a hard time speaking up in meetings or at parties, practice talking in a louder voice when you’re at home or in the car alone. That way, it’ll be easier to make your voice heard when you’re with a group of people."

      "title": "Share your personal interests.",
      "content": "Share your personal interests. Talk about the things you like so people get to know you better. Rather than letting the other person carry the conversation, try to balance it by confidently sharing some of your own opinions and interests. After bringing up a new subject, ask the other person what interests them, too. Try to find something you have in common to carry on a deeper conversation, get to know them better, and make them feel like you’re interested in them as a person. [9] X Research source For example, if someone at work asks you how your weekend was, avoid saying things like, “It was good,” or “Fine.” Instead, say something like, “It was great! I finished watching Game of Thrones , and I really loved it. Have you seen it?” If the person isn’t interested in the subjects you bring up, go back to having small talk before bringing up something else they might relate to. If you’re having trouble getting them to talk about a subject you’re interested in, ask questions about the subject they want to talk about. Engaging them about their passions might be the key to breaking the ice."

      "content": "Actively listen when others are talking. Give others your full attention so they feel heard, making them more likely to involve you in future conversations. As other people talk, lean in closer to them and react to what they’re saying, such as nodding when you agree. Maintain eye contact and really think about what the speaker is saying. It can be tempting to think about what you want to say in response, but that can distract you from the points the other person is trying to make. [12] X Research source When they finish talking, ask them some open-ended questions to clarify their points and learn more about what they’re saying. For example, ask, “How did that make you feel?”"

Set a time frame, such as 1 week or 1 month, where you agree to do most of what you’re asked to do. If someone asks if you want to join a meeting or come to a party, accept the invitation even if it’s not something you’d regularly get involved with. Try to engage with the experience by taking part in the conversation or socializing with others. You might impress your boss with an insightful observation, make new friends with your quiet sense of humor, or discover a new hobby you love. [13] X Research source Ask people to give you a heads-up the next time they get together. It’s okay to say no to things that make you uncomfortable, especially if they’re illegal or could put you in danger.

It’s really easy to build a comfortable routine, but it might cause you to miss out on discovering something you really love. Think about what you want to achieve in life and open your eyes to new opportunities that can help you get there. Make a point of stepping outside of your comfort zone frequently to meet new people and discover new passions. [14] X Research source Look for places or experiences where people have interests similar to yours. Trying something new doesn’t have to be completely out of left field.

      "content": "Take a break when you’re feeling overwhelmed or worn out. Social interactions give extroverts energy, but introverts need downtime to recharge. [16] X Research source If you’re at a social event and you feel like your batteries are running low, take a break, give yourself space to recharge, and come back after you’ve had a chance to rest. You’re entitled to a few quiet moments, especially after pushing outside your comfort zone. If you feel drained, try taking a quick solo walk or leaving the party early. Duck into the bathroom if you need to. The larger the event, the less likely people will notice you aren’t mingling. Paying attention to your energy levels is good for your mental health, too. It can help you feel more engaged and energetic for socializing."
