      "content": "Remove the drip tray. The drip tray is located below the spout on the front of the machine (it’s the tray that you set your cup on when brewing a cup of coffee). To remove it, simply slide it towards you while keeping it level and holding the rest of the machine in place. [2] X Research source The drip tray may have liquid in it because it holds overflows and spills. Keep this in mind while handling it."

      "content": "Wipe down the drip tray over a sink with a damp rag or sponge. Pour out any liquids that are in the tray. Then wipe all of the surfaces, including the inside that holds excess liquid. In most cases, if you wipe this part down often, it won't be hard to clean with a damp rag or sponge. [3] X Research source If your drip tray is especially dirty, use dish soap to clean it. Just apply soap to your rag or sponge, wipe down the drip tray, and rinse it off with warm water."

This needs to be cleaned out so that it doesn't clog and cause the machine to malfunction. Simply open up a paper clip and poke the end of it through the hole to remove any buildup.

To clean it, pull it straight up and off the machine. Then wash it inside and out over a sink with a bit of soap and your rag or sponge. Rinse it out thoroughly to get rid of any soap residue once it has been wiped down. [10] X Research source If you have a Keurig that doesn't have a removable water reservoir, the descaling cleaning you do to the inside of the machine will clean the reservoir area as well."

If you use your Keurig Mini every day, clean the cup holder and water reservoir every 2 to 3 weeks. If you use it less often, clean these parts just once a month. [11] X Research source If you have a hard time remembering to clean out the cup area and the reservoir, just do it when you clean out the drip tray and you wipe down the exterior. Cleaning it more often will only improve the taste of your coffee."

In most cases, it will take about 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid to fill the machine to the fill line. You can also use a commercial product called the Keurig Descaling Solution.

If you use your Keurig Mini on a daily basis, it's a good idea to descale the inside of it every 3 months. If you use it less often, clean it less often. [20] X Research source If the coffee you make in your machine starts to taste bad, try descaling the machine. It may take less than 3 months to have buildup inside the machine affect the taste of your coffee. Some Keurig models also have a descaling button that will light up when you need to descale your machine. If your descaling button is still lit up after you’ve descaled your machine , run a new brew cycle with fresh water. Then, turn off the Keurig and unplug it from the wall. Use a soft brush to scrub out the inside of the machine and remove any mineral deposits. Then, rinse the machine and plug it back in."
