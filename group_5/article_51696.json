      "content": "Put on gloves, a mask, and eye protection. Since you’ll be in contact with the resin during the film-changing process, it’s important to cover up your skin. Put on latex or nitrile gloves, a construction mask, and some clear eyeglasses or goggles. [1] X Research source Resin can cause skin or eye irritation if it sits on your skin for too long."

      "content": "Loosen the 8 screws on the resin tank with an Allen wrench. Flip over your resin tank and look for the darker-colored screws. Use your Allen wrench to unscrew each one and put them aside to use later. Try not to lose any screws, as you’ll need them to put your resin tank back together. [2] X Research source You can find Allen wrenches at most hardware stores."

      "content": "Take the metal plate off the bottom of the resin tank. Once you unscrew all of the Allen wrench screws, you can gently pull the metal plates away from the plastic body of the resin tank. Set the plastic part of the resin tank aside to work with later. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a screwdriver to remove all of the other screws.",
      "content": "Use a screwdriver to remove all of the other screws. Grab a Philips-head screwdriver and unscrew the screws that are holding the 2 metal frames together. Keep all of the screws in a safe place where you won’t lose them so you can use them to reassemble the resin tank. [4] X Research source There are usually 10 to 12 screws holding together the metal plates."

      "content": "Pop out the old FEP film. Take the top metal frame off and then gently pull the FEP film away from the bottom frame. You can throw away the old FEP film since you won’t need it anymore. [5] X Research source Make sure you wear gloves when you come into contact with the FEP film because it could still have some resin on it."

      "title": "Clean your resin tank with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "content": "Clean your resin tank with isopropyl alcohol. Since your resin tank is deconstructed, it’s a great time to get rid of any residual resin. Dab a clean towel in isopropyl alcohol and run it along the metal frame and the inside of the plastic body of the resin tank to clean it off. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut your new FEP film to be 2 in (5.1 cm) larger than the resin tank. Use scissors to cut your new sheet of FEP film about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider and taller than the metal frame it’s going to sit in. Your measurements don’t have to be exact, but you need to leave some excess on the outside so you can cut it down later. [7] X Research source You can buy new FEP films online. As long as it is labeled “FEP film,” it is the right film for your resin tank. If you have a paper cutter, use that instead of scissors to make perfectly straight lines in your new film."

Adjust the film now if you need to, since you won’t be able to later on. [8] X Research source Line up the screw holes on the metal plates to make sure they are situated correctly."

Center your metal frames with the film sandwiched between them over the bottle cap so that they are propped up on the table. [9] X Research source The bottle cap creates a bulge in the FEP film so that it is pulled taut while you are connecting the metal frames."

      "content": "Put the screws back into the metal pieces with a screwdriver. Gather up the screws that you took out with the screwdriver, not the Allen wrench. Use them to connect the 2 metal frames back together by lining up their screw holes and then using the screws to connect them. [10] X Research source You may need to use a little bit of force since you will be pushing the screws through the new piece of FEP film. Make sure the film stays taut and even while you attach the screws."

Cut the film as close to the metal pieces as you can so that nothing is sticking out. [12] X Research source You can now put your resin tank back into whatever machine you were working with."
