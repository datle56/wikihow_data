      "content": "Clean sugar messes and store food immediately. Sugar ants have earned their name for being attracted to sugar-filled products like candy, fruit, honey, and soda. So, after using sugar products, wipe the counters and sweep the floors for any lingering crumbs. Instead of leaving food out in the open, safely store it in plastic containers. [2] X Research source Some say sugar ants hate the smell of plastic, too!"

      "content": "Apply an insecticide spray to any access points around your home. Opt for a non-repellent insecticide spray , if possible. Unlike repellent sprays, non-repellent sprays prevent ants from detecting it, allowing them to bring the poisonous solution to their colonies. Spritz the solution in the affected areas. [3] X Research source Non-repellent spray may be toxic or harmful to children and pets."

      "content": "Use ant baits. Ant baits are a safe alternative for households with children and pets since they reduce contact with any toxic chemicals. They act as a food source for ants, so ensuring you have enough bait is important. The ants will carry the bait back and spread it within their colonies. Leave the bait in suspected areas for 3 to 4 days until you see no more signs of feeding ants. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a boric acid ant bait for a DIY option. Select a sugar treat that will capture a sugar ant's attention, like peanut butter, jam, or corn syrup. You don’t need a lot of boric acid to make an effective bait. Simply combine 1 tsp (0.33 US tbsp) of boric acid per 2 c (32 US tbsp) of your selected sugary treat. This will be enough to attract them while killing them efficiently. Place the bait inside bottle caps, pieces of foil, or soda straws. Place them wherever needed. [5] X Research source Some people have found success mixing boric acid, white sugar, and warm water to make a thick paste. [6] X Research source Boric acid can be poisonous for animals, so avoid using it if you have pets. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Pesticide Information Center Organization run by Oregon State University providing objective, science-based information about pests and pesticides Go to source You can also use Borax instead of boric acid since Borax is commonly used in ant-killing products. [8] X Research source Use disposable gloves when handling boric acid or Borax."

      "content": "Sugar ants typically nest inside of soil or wood. Look for a mound of soil or wood outside your home. Sugar ants have odor receptors that are four to five times stronger than other insects, and they’re attracted to sweet and sugary-smelling foods like candy, spilled soda, and fruit. Generally, a nest will be outside under cement slabs or in the ground, but it can also be found in wall voids, ceilings, and crawlspaces.

      "content": "Sugar ants are attracted to sweet foods, sugary drinks, and moisture. If you feel embarrassed about having an ant problem—don’t be! No matter how much you clean your home, one soda or piece of candy can have them crawling home. However, they’re also attracted to moisture, so damp areas and standing water make them appear in the bathroom, too. [17] X Research source Similarly, if you have a backyard garden with fruit plants or sweet vegetables, like sweet potatoes or yams, sugar ants may build a nest in your garden. Sugar ants are the most common ants found in homes."
