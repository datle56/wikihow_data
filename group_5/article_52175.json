      "content": "Remove the filter and hand-wash it with warm soapy water. If your dishwasher has a removable filter, it’ll be located in or around the drain. Grab the top of the filter, rotate it counter-clockwise, and lift it out. Take it over to the sink and give it a good scrub with a sponge. [2] X Research source The filter is prime real estate for food particles, bacteria, and fungal growth, so it's important to clean it weekly (or even daily if you use the dishwasher a lot). To remove stubborn food residue, gently scrub with an old toothbrush."

Any dishwasher-safe container will do the trick for this, just make sure it doesn’t have a lid.
