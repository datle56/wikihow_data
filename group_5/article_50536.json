Is now a good time?” Explain that you’re not upset, but you need to know what's happening with you two: “I’m not mad or anything, but I am confused. Do you like me?” Give them time to think without applying pressure: “I feel like I've been getting mixed signals. No pressure. Why don't you take your time and get back to me?\""

      "content": "For a Gemini, being vulnerable can be a struggle. That's because this sign wants either intellectual stimulation or playful conversation 24/7. The truth is, you can’t force a Gemini to divulge their secrets to you. Instead, encourage them through thoughtful questions, leading by example, and active listening. Let them know you’re a safe person to speak to and don’t apply pressure. Open up first to set a precedent. Talk about your childhood, romantic feelings, or deep fears. With a Gemini, chances are you've done this already! Attempt to open up conversation with a subtle but thoughtful question: “Hey, did I notice you journaling this morning? How long have you done that for?” Show them you’re an attentive listener. Nod your head while they speak, validate their perspective, and follow up with clarifying questions."

      "content": "Geminis love freedom, so they may be hesitant to go exclusive. If your Gemini partner is slow to get serious with you, clarify your expectations. To a Gemini, keeping things super casual may not seem like an issue, so initiate the conversation yourself. Otherwise, you run the risk of waiting around for someone who has no intention of moving forward with you or anyone else. “Hey, we’ve been dating for a while now. I’d like to feel like we're moving forward together and getting more serious. What do you think about that?” You can’t convince a Gemini to want to be exclusive if they’re not ready. Instead, ask them clearly, get your answer, and accept their response. If they're not ready yet, then it's still good that you got your answer. Go out and treat yourself. See a friend, get a manicure, or buy some ice cream!"
