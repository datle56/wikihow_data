      "content": "Locate the correct slot on your computer for the wireless card. Find an empty PCI slot on a PC computer. Make sure to remove the faceplate for that port before trying to install the card. This will expose the new card from the back of your PC when you close the case. For a Mac, locate the Airport card slot. On most G5 Power Macs, it is generally part of the metal wall that separates the logic board. On the iMac G4, the card slot is in the rounded base. And in the iMac G5, it's right in the middle when you've unscrewed the whole back plate."

Attach the antenna to the outside of the card, and close your case. On a Mac, connect the antenna cable to the back of the card and plug the card into the board. It will only connect one way, so if it doesn't work the first time just turn it around. Generally you'll turn the label face down so you can see the serial number and other written details on the card."
