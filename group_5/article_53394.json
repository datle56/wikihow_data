      "content": "If you're in love, your mind turns to him constantly. Being in love is like being addicted to the person you're in love with—it even causes changes to your brain that are similar to being addicted to a substance. One of these similarities is that you can't stop thinking about this man you're in love with. You have basically no control over these intrusive thoughts. [1] X Research source If it were anything else, this might be bad—but because being in love feels great, you probably don't mind it. The downside of this, though, is that always thinking about him leaves little room for other things. You might find it difficult to concentrate at work or keep your mind on a task that you're trying to complete."

Or maybe you keep seeing cookies in his favorite flavor, or ads for his favorite restaurant. Everywhere you go, you see constant reminders of him and wonder how you missed all these signs before. [2] X Research source When you see these things, you might show your love by getting him a small present. According to dating and relationship expert Julianne Cantarella, you might go with a book by his \"favorite author, or [his] favorite coffee...something that's not going to be that expensive but will meet the need of something that [he] really likes.\""

Dating and relationship expert Julianne Cantarella explains that \"love grows over time when you spend time with someone and get to know them.\" If you're falling in love, she continues, you want to \"form a bond with them and a connection with them and share experiences with them.\" The more time the two of you spend together, the more likely it is that you'll fall in love more quickly. For example, if you spend every evening with him, you'll likely fall in love more quickly than if you only see him once a week."

      "content": "Being in love makes you curious about the other person. Because of your intense feelings about him, you need to know what makes him tick. The more you learn about him, the more you can trust him —and true love requires a foundation of trust. [3] X Research source You also want to make sure that the two of you are on the same page in terms of what you want out of life. Dating and relationships expert Julianne notes that \"if you don't share the same goals, the same values, the same relationship vision,\" the relationship likely isn't going to last very long. Being curious about him allows you to learn these things."

After all, you've already looked for red flags and he wasn't waving a single one. If you're truly in love with him, you don't care if he leaves the toilet seat up or forgets to take out the trash. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This doesn't mean that you'll always feel this way. When you first fall in love, you're in the honeymoon phase of the relationship. Eventually, these things might start to irritate you, but that just means you're entering a deeper stage of commitment. If you truly think he has no flaws and is perfect, though, that's more likely to be infatuation than true love. Remind yourself that everybody has flaws and that fact doesn't make them any less worthy of love. [5] X Research source"

In fact, if you're in love, you likely think more highly of him than he does of himself. [6] X Research source You think he's a truly unique individual and feel extremely lucky to be with him. This could be where the idea of \"the one\" came from—when you're in love, you can't imagine feeling that way about anyone else. Both of you feel lucky to have found each other and don't think a better match exists. You feel as though you've found the right person for you. [7] X Research source"

While falling in love is a good thing, it's also totally normal to feel a bit nervous or jittery when you're around someone who really matters to you. It's important for you to make a good impression on him and you might be nervous that he'll think badly of you. [8] X Research source There's a scientific basis for this. Falling in love can cause elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that can cause anxiety. Once you feel more comfortable with him, those levels will drop again."

Well, you might say that time flies when you're in love and it would be just as true. You're so focused that you're in something like a flow state—your brain is releasing a torrent of feel-good chemicals that increase your focus.

[12] X Research source You might actually change as well, through the influence of your partner. For example, you might pick up some of his verbal tics. You might also start new habits or routines so you can spend more time with him. For example, you might start jogging with him in the morning."

Love feels so good that you want to focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. This helps you release any lingering worries you had about people in your past.

You're also willing to make sacrifices for him when necessary. But be careful that you don't lose yourself in the process. Only make sacrifices that don't compromise your needs."
