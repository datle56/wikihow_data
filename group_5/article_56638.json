      "content": "Don’t answer unknown calls from these area codes. While any unknown phone number can be a potential scam, certain area codes appear more commonly. If you don’t recognize a phone number with these area codes, do not answer. The caller may be trying to get personal information from you or trying to make you call an international (likely Caribbean) number and rack up costly per-minute fees. Instead, check your voicemail afterward to see if it was a legitimate caller, or Google the phone number to see if it’s associated with any known scams.

      "content": "Ignore calls from unknown numbers using your area code. Some scam callers will “spoof” their identity so a phone number different from their own will appear on your caller ID (this is called caller ID spoofing). Scammers will often spoof the number so it begins with your own area code to look like the call is local or coming from someone you may know, even though it’s likely international or from someone seeking your personal information. [3] X Research source In some cases, all but the last 4 digits of the phone number may resemble yours. If you don’t recognize a number with your area code, let the phone ring or end the call without answering to avoid the scam . If it’s someone who knows you, they’ll likely leave a voicemail and share their identity. Before calling back, listen to the caller’s voicemail (if they left one) to see if it’s someone you recognize. If not, Google the phone number itself—if it’s a scam, chances are someone has posted about it or flagged it on a scam phone number database. Caller ID spoofing can happen in any area code, but these are the US area codes where it occurs most frequently: [4] X Research source 602, 623: Phoenix, AZ 214: Dallas, TX 832: Houston, TX 210: San Antonio, TX 404, 678: Atlanta, GA 704: Charlotte, NC 702: Las Vegas, NV 407: Orlando, FL"

      "title": "“One ring” scams",
      "content": "“One ring” scams Scammers will call your phone number and hang up after the first ring to pique your curiosity and have you call the number back. These numbers are often international and come from countries that have 3-digit area codes that resemble US area codes (for example, area code 232 is from the country of Sierra Leone). If you call back, you’ll be charged fees and/or per-minute charges for calling internationally, in addition to potentially losing money or private information to the scammer. [5] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source To avoid this scam: Don’t answer or return calls from numbers you don’t recognize. Check to see if the unknown area code is international before calling back, and consider asking your phone service carrier to block outgoing international calls from your line (unless you have a legitimate need to call internationally)."

      "content": "Traffic pumping scams By federal law, rural phone service carriers can charge wireless and long-distance carriers higher fees for calls to local subscribers. Some rural carriers then partner with chat lines, adult entertainment numbers, “free” conference call providers, or even international numbers to artificially inflate the call volume in their home area code. This lets them bill wireless and long-distance carriers large amounts of money, which then gets passed onto private consumers. [6] X Research source Some calls begin with a warning about higher charges, while others are assumed to be free (until the consumer sees the charges on their next phone bill). The area codes 712 (western Iowa) and 218 (northern Minnesota) are particularly well-known for this type of scam. To avoid this scam: Do not answer or call back calls from any numbers you don’t recognize (especially with a 712 or 218 area code). Google the phone number to see if it’s associated with any known scam accounts or with any chat lines or other organizations that charge premiums or fees to connect."

      "content": "Package delivery scams Scammers may leave a voicemail with a callback number or leave a “missed delivery” tag on your door with a phone number to call indicating that you have a pending delivery. In some cases, they may text or email you with a “tracking link” that you’re urged to open. Do not call these numbers back, as they may be international and costly (similar to the “one ring” scam) or take you to an “operator” who requests personal information. Never open links from unknown senders, either, since these can prompt you to enter personal information or infect your device with malware. [7] X Trustworthy Source Federal Communications Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for regulating radio, television, and satellite, and phone communications Go to source To avoid this scam: Do not call the phone number or open the provided link. If you’re expecting a delivery, contact the retailer or sender directly or go to the delivery carrier’s website to track your package . Never trust in any “urgent content” (like messages about package deliveries, promises of easy money, or indicating that something really bad happened to your bank account, for example) from unofficial or unknown numbers. Do not share your credit card information or deposit money into requested bank accounts until you’re sure the recipient is legitimate."

This won’t stop all spam calls, but it will make them easier to identify. Most legitimate telemarketers will not contact you if you’re on the registry, meaning any unknown numbers that you see are likely to be scams. [8] X Research source"

US carriers are already federally required to block calls with evidence of caller ID spoofing or other tampering, but they may not automatically block domestic robocalls or other scams from unchanged numbers. Contact your provider to learn about the options they offer—just be aware that these services may cost extra.
