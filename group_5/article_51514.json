[1] X Research source If you’re on your computer, scroll down to the “Meet the seller” section beneath the listing and click on the “Message seller” button. If you’re on mobile, scroll down to the “Meet the seller” section and tap the “Message” icon. You could say something like: “Apologies, but I’m not longer interested in the vintage books I made an offer on. Would you mind canceling the offer for me?” “I typed in $20 as my custom offer when I really meant to type in $30. Would it be possible to decline the offer so I can resubmit it correctly?”"

      "content": "Block the seller if they refuse to cancel your transaction. If the seller is forcing you to pay for an item that you don’t want, you can block their profile to cancel the transaction.

However, several Mercari users report that blocking a seller helped them get out of an unwanted transaction."
