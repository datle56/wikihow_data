      "title": "Divorced men may feel lost due to smaller support networks.",
      "content": "Divorced men may feel lost due to smaller support networks. Even though most divorces are initiated by women, women are more likely to cultivate sympathy and support during the split. They generally have larger emotional support systems than their ex-husbands, and therefore more people to turn to. Many married men, however, lean on their wives for emotional support and can feel very alone when that support is gone. [1] X Research source This loneliness can lead to a loss of interest in social activities or a decline in a man’s social life, which only increases the feelings of isolation. To combat loneliness , try to make yourself volunteer, join support groups, reach out to friends and family, or even consider adopting a pet."

      "title": "Men may suppress their emotions, leading to psychological distress.",
      "content": "Men may suppress their emotions, leading to psychological distress. Women are more likely to seek out emotional support during and after a divorce, whereas men might feel pressure to skip the grieving process and continue on with life as usual. This is usually due to societal expectations that men show little to no emotions and “man up” when faced with adverse feelings. [2] X Research source Bottling up emotions like this leads to chronic stress, especially during and right after a divorce. In prolonged cases, the stress can lead to clinical anxiety or depression. Allow yourself time to mourn the marriage and express your feelings to friends and family members who can support you emotionally. Remember, it’s okay not to be okay after a life-altering change."

      "title": "Divorced men may suffer from poor diet, substance abuse, and more.",
      "content": "Divorced men may suffer from poor diet, substance abuse, and more. Due to lifestyle changes and possible depression, men are more likely to eat an unhealthy diet than women (especially if their ex was largely responsible for meals). They’re also more likely to suffer a lowered immune response to the stress, possibly because they initiate divorce less often. [3] X Research source Men are also more at risk of alcohol and other substance abuse in general. The stress of a divorce can exacerbate this tendency. After divorce, do your best to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. It will lower your stress, and the routine will provide some stability during the adjustment. If you’re struggling with substance abuse, speak with your doctor or a therapist about finding alternative coping mechanisms."

      "title": "Each divorce is unique, but men may blame themselves more for the split.",
      "content": "Each divorce is unique, but men may blame themselves more for the split. Men are more likely to be caught off guard or surprised by divorce. As a result, many blame themselves or their shortcomings for the failure of the marriage, especially if they already had low self-esteem. Men may fixate on happy memories and how they “messed up” or weren’t “man enough,” leading to deeper feelings of guilt and shame. [4] X Research source Since men internalize their reactions more than women, they're more likely to bash themselves and heighten their negative feelings. Ask whether your guilt is warranted or whether you’re blaming yourself for things out of your control. Once you understand your guilt, it will be easier to work through it . Remember that divorce is not right or wrong—it’s whatever you make of it. Reevaluate your guilty feelings to come to peace with your decision or situation."

      "title": "Being a husband is often a large part of a married man’s identity.",
      "content": "Being a husband is often a large part of a married man’s identity. A divorced husband may get stuck feeling like half of a broken partnership, especially if he doesn’t have a wide web of friends or social relationships to identify with. Men are also less likely to engage in new activities or meet new people on purpose, leaving them to struggle with their identity as a single person. [5] X Research source Women, on the other hand, are more likely and willing to try new things or join groups after divorce, giving them more social support to lean on. To get in touch with yourself after a divorce, try engaging in your interests or passion projects, going on a solo trip, or stepping out of your comfort zone to try new things and meet new people."

      "title": "Even with full or partial custody, his bond with his kids will change.",
      "content": "Even with full or partial custody, his bond with his kids will change. Though joint custody is becoming more common, courts side with mothers more often than fathers. This means divorced men often don’t get to see their children frequently, leading to low self-esteem, feelings of inadequacy, and a fear they’re missing out on their kids’ lives or that their mother is saying negative things about him. [6] X Research source Depending on the childrens’ ages and the reason for the divorce, the kids may feel resentful or like he’s abandoning them, leading to harder dynamics. Be clear to your kids about what's going to happen, where they're going to live, and what the arrangement will be to ease their anxiety. Let your kids know they’re loved no matter what."

      "title": "Some men rush into new relationships to avoid loneliness.",
      "content": "Some men rush into new relationships to avoid loneliness. Since some men feel expected to carry on with business as usual, they may enter a new relationship to prove they’re doing well. Often, though, they’re still preoccupied or feeling low from the divorce and haven’t worked through their feelings about it. This means they may struggle to overcome commitment issues in the new relationship. [7] X Research source Onlookers may think a rebound fling is insensitive (to the ex and the new partner), but it’s often a coping mechanism for much deeper emotional pain on the ex-husband’s part."

      "title": "Trust issues or a fear of starting over keep some men from dating.",
      "content": "Trust issues or a fear of starting over keep some men from dating. If a man was cheated on by his ex, he might fear being betrayed again in a new relationship. Other times, he may just feel too old, timid, or damaged from the divorce to try dating again. If you’re a divorced man, remember that what happened in your past relationship has nothing to do with future ones. Signs a divorced man may be afraid to commit again include: Not telling his new partner he loves them after 6-12 months of dating Prioritizing his job, friends, and family above his new partner Canceling plans at the last minute Avoiding meeting his new partner’s family or friends Refusing to introduce his new partner to his friends and family"

      "content": "Divorced men drink, smoke, and have unsafe sex more than married men. If a man is struggling to adapt to his new lifestyle or change, he’s more likely to engage in self-destructive behaviors. In addition to substance use and risky sexual behavior, divorced men eat worse, are less likely to get regular medical care, and generally have a lower standard of living than their married counterparts.

      "title": "Depending on the divorce, the man may pay child support or alimony.",
      "content": "Depending on the divorce, the man may pay child support or alimony. Men are more likely to pay child support and may be on the hook for alimony if they were the sole or significantly higher income earner in the marriage. These expenses come on top of attorney fees, litigation costs, and other expenses, as well as losing half their assets depending on the property division. [9] X Research source These adjustments can lead to financial instability and a change in lifestyle, depending on how much the man earns and what he’s ordered to pay. On average, however, men’s income will increase in the years after a divorce while a woman’s income is more likely to dip and stay low for several years afterward (regardless of whether she has children).
