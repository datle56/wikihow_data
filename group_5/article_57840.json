      "content": "Mouth taping is the practice of sleeping with your mouth held shut by a piece of tape. The practice involves taking a piece of specially designed tape and placing it over the lips, making it harder for the mouth to open. Taping one’s mouth is typically done to force breath through the nose, which some believe prevents mouth breathing , snoring, and other related sleep conditions. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Research suggests that mouth taping may reduce snoring in some cases. In a 2015 study , mouth taping led to reduced snoring in people with mild obstructive sleep apnea. However, more research is needed to show if mouth tape impacts snoring in people without obstructive sleep apnea. For example, if someone snores as a result of nasal polyps or enlarged tonsils, there’s no current evidence to show that mouth taping will lessen their snoring. Mouth taping has also not been shown to improve asthma. In a 2009 study , mouth taping for 26-28 nights was shown to have no effect on asthma control in the research participants."

      "title": "Mouth taping may reduce snoring and even dental issues.",
      "content": "Mouth taping may reduce snoring and even dental issues. Mouth taping forces breath through the nose, meaning that the air entering the lungs will be more humid and less dry. Additionally, the nostrils filter out allergens, debris, and toxins from the air before they can reach the lungs. [2] X Research source While further research is needed to prove the efficacy of mouth taping as a whole, many claim that mouth tape reduces negative effects associated with mouth breathing, including: [3] X Research source Dry mouth Cavities Gum disease Bad breath Snoring Sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea Decreased working memory and cognitive ability [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Slowed growth in children [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A receding chin and jaw"

A medical professional can help you figure out why you breathe through your mouth while you sleep, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils, or sleep apnea. Some of these conditions may require medical intervention before using a home remedy like mouth tape.

Use a piece of tape that's wide enough to cover both your top and bottom lips, or cut two pieces to make an “X” mark over your top and bottom lips. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that there are no official medical or dental guidelines for mouth taping. However, there are certain steps you can take to tape your mouth as safely as possible: Brush your teeth before affixing your mouth tape. Apply a lip balm, petroleum jelly, or food-safe oil onto your mouth and lips before sticking on the tape. This step may help to minimize irritation and leftover residue. Consider folding over a small corner of your tape before application to make it easier to remove in the morning. Follow all package directions when applying the tape. Choose a product like Dream Mouth Tape that comes in various styles to fit your facial features and shape preferences. Take off the mouth tape immediately if you have trouble breathing or can’t breathe through your nose. Tell your doctor that you can’t get enough air in through your nose, as this may be a sign of a treatable obstruction or allergies."

Look for adhesive strips that are specifically suited for the skin, such as hypoallergenic tape, surgical tape, and athletic tape. Avoid tapes that are not intended for use on the body, such as masking tape or duct tape. These tapes are more likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions. [11] X Research source"

Similar to the benefits of mouth taping, there hasn’t been enough conclusive research done on the practice to report concrete side effects. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the following risks and side effects may result from mouth taping: [12] X Research source Pain when removing the tape (especially for users with facial hair) Disrupted sleep due to skin irritation or difficulty breathing through the noise Anxiety for those who feel discomfort having their mouth taped shut Skin irritation on or around the lips. If you have sensitive skin, try a specially designed mouth tape that’s infused with skincare ingredients.

For example, you should not use mouth taping if you have a cold or if you’ve recently consumed alcohol or taken sedatives. Other instances in which you should not use mouth taping include when you have: [13] X Research source An ear or sinus infection Seasonal allergies Acid reflux Nasal breathing problems, such as nasal polyps A body mass index (BMI) over 35 Severe heart or lung problems Severely chapped lips or broken skin around your lips and mouth Note: It is unlikely that mouth taping alone would cause suffocation, but it does impair your ability to take full and deep breaths. Avoid using duct tape or any other type of household tape, and remove your tape immediately if you’re struggling to breathe at night."

Before trying mouth taping for the first time, consider speaking with your primary care physician if you believe you have a sleep disorder, are experiencing severely bad breath, or have a child who breathes mostly through their mouth. In these cases, it’s best to speak with a medical expert rather than attempt home remedies. [14] X Research source Sleep disorders require professional diagnosis and treatment. Opting for a home remedy like mouth taping before seeing a doctor could delay a much-needed treatment. Severe bad breath could be a symptom of underlying issues like cavities, sinus infections, or ulcers. Visiting your doctor to identify possible conditions is an important step to take before beginning mouth taping. If your child struggles with mouth breathing, this habit may stunt their growth and needs the attention of a doctor. Plus, mouth taping hasn’t been studied in children, so it should be avoided in this age group."

Sleeping on your back or stomach can worsen symptoms of sleep apnea and cause severe snoring, while sleeping on your side can reduce these symptoms. Try training yourself to sleep on your side by placing a wedge pillow behind your back to prevent you from lying flat on your back.
