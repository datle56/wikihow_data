      "content": "Move your thumb outward across the card, toward the far corner. Flick your thumb off the card as it moves. This motion should pivot the card around your index finger and send it flying and spinning. Make sure your thumb is moving along a curve. If you flick it straight, the card may flick the wrong direction or fail to flick."

      "content": "This should be one, fluid motion that looks totally effortless. It can take some time to figure out exactly how this motion works. Experiment with the following until you can get it every time: Your thumb and the grip of your fingers should apply moderate pressure. Adjust if the card keeps slipping, or buckles too far to move easily. Speed up the movement of your thumb for better results. Rotate your wrist as you flick for additional force."

      "title": "Snatch it out of the air with your opposite hand.",
      "content": "Snatch it out of the air with your opposite hand. Catching the card can actually be more difficult than flicking it, in terms of how much practice it takes. Once you can flick consistently in the same direction, try to catch it with your other hand. It may help to watch the card as it leaves your hand, and follow it with your eyes. [2] X Research source If you're not confident you can catch it, flick the card directly at a spectator instead when you perform. This won't derail the act in the same way dropping the card could."
