      "title": "Every character can speak and learn different languages in-game.",
      "content": "Every character can speak and learn different languages in-game. Numerous languages exist in the many worlds and settings of D&D 5e, some considered “standard” (more widely-spoken) and others considered “exotic” (and rarer). Languages tend to be primarily spoken by different regions or cultures; you may encounter creatures speaking different languages throughout a D&D campaign. [1] X Research source Although your own PC (player character) might know or learn multiple languages, there’s no mechanical benefit to knowing a particular language. The benefits of knowing languages in D&D are purely for roleplaying purposes; by speaking a certain language, your PC might be able to converse or read a text when other PCs can’t."

      "title": "Standard languages are most often used by other creatures in the world.",
      "content": "Standard languages are most often used by other creatures in the world. While they might seem a little less exciting than D&D 5e’s exotic languages, standard languages are nonetheless very handy—because, as your PCs go on adventures, the creatures they meet along the way in settlements will likely speak one (or more) of these languages. Standard languages include: [2] X Research source Common . This is the main language spoken by humans and uses the common alphabet. Elvish . This is spoken by elves and uses the Elvish alphabet. Halfling . This is spoken by halflings and uses the Common alphabet. Dwarvish . This is spoken by dwarves and uses the Dwarvish alphabet. Gnomish . This is spoken by gnomes and uses the Dwarvish alphabet. Giant . This is spoken by ogres and giants and uses the Dwarvish alphabet. Goblin . This is spoken by all goblinoids and uses the Dwarvish alphabet. Orc . This is spoken by orcs and uses the Dwarvish alphabet."

      "title": "Common is the closest thing to a universal language in D&D 5e.",
      "content": "Common is the closest thing to a universal language in D&D 5e. “Common” is a default language for most PCs, regardless of the racial bloodline or background you choose for them. While Common is the standard human language, it’s also usually spoken by members of other races unless the DM decides otherwise. In short, speaking Common means you can talk to nearly anyone!

      "title": "Languages can be used to form connections between characters.",
      "content": "Languages can be used to form connections between characters. If you discover that your PC shares a language with an NPC (non-player character) they encounter in their adventures, you might be able to use that to communicate, ask questions, conduct investigations, or even establish a closer bond with that NPC. [4] X Research source You can also overhear covert conversations spoken in that language or talk privately to an NPC in a language other than Common without being overheard. When it comes to standard languages like goblin or giant, you might end up using them in combat encounters (since goblins and giants are common enemies in D&D). For example, you might overhear giants plotting in their language and make a plan to take them down based on your eavesdropping or negotiate a truce with a pack of goblins in their language."

      "title": "Exotic languages are usually spoken by extraplanar races.",
      "content": "Exotic languages are usually spoken by extraplanar races. They’re more niche than standard languages, and often specific to certain planes, but by learning an exotic language, you’re also more likely to encounter a scenario where your PC is the only one who can communicate. For example, learning Sylvan can help you speak to fairies on a Feywild adventure. Exotic languages include: [5] X Research source Abyssal . This is the language of demons and uses the Infernal alphabet. Celestial . This is the language of angels and uses the Celestial alphabet. Draconic . This is the language of dragons and uses the Draconic alphabet. Infernal . This is the language of devils and uses the Infernal alphabet. Deep Speech . This is the language of aberrations (especially aboleths and cloakers). Primordial . This is the language of elementals and uses the Dwarvish alphabet. Sylvan . This is the language of fey creatures and uses the Elvish alphabet. Undercommon . This is the language of Underdark denizens (drow, duergar, and so on) and uses the Elvish alphabet. Technically, there are different elemental languages (Ignan, Aquan, Auran, and Terran), but they’re all considered dialects of Primordial—so if you understand one, you understand them all."

      "title": "Setting-specific languages are found in particular planes and worlds.",
      "content": "Setting-specific languages are found in particular planes and worlds. While there are several other languages in 5e, they’re not really “standard” or “exotic.” Rather, they’re specific to certain sourcebooks and the worlds or cultures depicted in them. In most cases, your PC won’t learn these languages unless they’re from a land that speaks them. Setting-specific languages include: [6] X Research source Leonin. Spoken by leonin using Common script (Theros). Kraul. Spoken by kraul of Ravnica (Ravnica). Loxodon. Spoken by loxodon using Elvish script (Ravnica). Merfolk. Spoken by merfolk using merfolk script (Ravnica). Sphinx. Spoken by sphinxes in Ravnica (Ravnica). Vedalken. Spoken by vedalken using Common script (Ravnica). Riedran. Spoken by citizens of Sarlona (Eberron). Abanasinia. Spoken by Abanasinians of Krynn using Common script (Dragonlance). Ergot. Spoken by the Ergoth people of Krynn (Dragonlance). Kharolian. Spoken by people from the Planes of Dust and Tarsis (Dragonlance). Kenderspeak. Spoken by the Kender of Kyrnn (Dragonlance). Khur. Spoken by the Khur of Kyrnn (Dragonlance). Nordmaarian. Spoken by the Nordmaar people of Kyrnn (Dragonlance). Solamnic. Spoken by the Solamnian people of Kyrnn (Dragonlance). Marquesian. Spoken by people from Marquet using Common script (Exandria, Critical Role). Naush. Spoken by Ki'Nau Islanders using Common script (Exandria, Critical Role). Zemnian. Spoken by the Dwendalian Empire using Zemnian script (Exandria, Critical Role). Hadozee. Spoken by the hadozee race (Spelljammer). Thri-keen. Spoken by the thri-keen race (Spelljammer). Quori. Spoken by kalashtar, quori, and Inspired; it uses Quori script (Eberron). Istarian. This is the language of ancient Istarians and uses Istarian script (Dragonlance). Nerakese. This is spoken by inhabitants of Neraska and uses Istarian script (Dragonlance)."

      "content": "Certain classes (druids, rogues, and rangers) grant languages. Druids know Druidic, while rogues know Thieves’ Cant. Both are secret languages only understandable to other druids and rogues, and they function like codes or cyphers. Rangers the Favored Enemy class feature, which lets them learn languages spoken by the foes they hunt. They can learn any standard or exotic languages, plus additional minor languages. [7] X Research source Minor languages that rangers can learn include: Aarakocran, Blink Dog, Bullywug, Giant Eagle (or Owl), Gith, Gnoll, Hook Horror, Grell, Modron, Sahuagin, Slaad, Troglodyte, Umber Hulk, Worg, Yeti, and Yikaria. Keep in mind that most rangers opt for a standard or exotic language; the only reason you might want a minor language is to roleplay a specific aspect of your PC’s personal quest."

      "title": "Pick languages based on the kind of character you want to play.",
      "content": "Pick languages based on the kind of character you want to play. When you create a new character, depending on your background and class choice, you might be prompted to choose a language (or multiple languages) for your character. This is mainly a matter of personal preference; although some languages are more common than others, there’s really no wrong choice! [8] X Research source Consider which creatures, races, or monsters you’re most likely to encounter frequently in-game. Does a particular language stand out to you? Keep in mind that the Player’s Handbook encourages players to ask the DM for permission before learning an exotic language. There’s rarely a reason for the DM to tell you no, but it’s still a good idea to talk beforehand; the DM might even be able to warn you if the language you pick really won’t come in handy at all. Generally, since they’re spoken by most people you’ll encounter in-game, standard languages are the most reliable picks."

      "title": "Subclasses and feats can help a PC learn additional languages.",
      "content": "Subclasses and feats can help a PC learn additional languages. If you want your PC to learn more languages over the course of the campaign, there are plenty of ways to do it. The easiest way is by taking feats (optional abilities available periodically when leveling up) like Linguist and Prodigy. [9] X Research source You can also take a subclass like Rune Knight (which makes PCs fluent in Giant) or Draconic Bloodline (which makes PCs fluent in Draconic). Alternatively, cast spells like Tongues or Comprehend Languages, which function as temporary translators. Have your PC learn a language the old-fashioned way: by studying. D&D rules state that PCs can use downtime to learn languages, so long as they have a tutor. It takes 10 weeks minus your PC’s Intelligence modifier to learn a new language by studying it in-game."
