There are too many different micro-components of animation to address in this article, but several common (and important) concepts can be found in online forums, courses, and guides, as well as in any animation or art resources found at your local library. Common concepts to study include the following: Color — Knowing which colors pair well and which combinations to avoid will help you create a more pleasant animation (or, if you're going for dissonant imagery, create a distressing animation). Composition — This refers to knowing how to fill the screen with your animation in an efficient, aesthetically pleasing manner. Perspective — Knowing how to demonstrate the dimensions of an image will deepen your animation. Anatomy — Proper understanding of anatomy can help you create structurally accurate animations. It can also help you figure out which anatomical rules you can break while maintaining a believable animation."

      "content": "Script your animation. First, write down everything that you want to happen. This doesn't just mean dialogue; you should include actions and facial expressions as well. You need to have a clear idea of exactly what's going to happen before you start."

      "title": "Make some storyboards",

      "title": "Draw some character sheets or make character models.",
      "content": "Draw some character sheets or make character models. What your characters will look like is also a crucial aspect of your animation film. You'll want to have a reference to look at as you draw your frames so that the character looks consistent and real from pose to pose. Draw your characters from every different angle and with a number of different expressions. You should also draw out what they'll be wearing, especially if what they're wearing changes between scenes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your animation sketch.",
      "content": "Make your animation sketch. This is a single drawing on a single piece of paper that shows all of the major stages of movement in a single frame. This will often result in a picture that looks like conjoined quintuplets, but it's designed to make sure that your key frames are correctly aligned and that your motions look natural."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try using squash and stretch.",
      "content": "Try using squash and stretch. Squash and stretch is when you exaggerate motions to help the human brain perceive them as real. A common example would be when you imagine a ball. It's much more interesting to see a ball squish down to the floor a little when it lands, instead of just seeing a normal sphere. This helps the viewer feel the motion that the ball is making."
    },
    {
      "title": "Master facial expressions.",
      "content": "Master facial expressions. Animation is at its best when the viewers are emotionally connecting with the characters. This is much easier if you get your characters making faces that convey real emotions, instead of largely static faces. Practice drawing emotions on faces. You should focus on the motions of changing emotions too, not just the poses of sad-angry-laughing and so on. Implementing subtle facial expressions—eyebrow movement, twitching of the corner of the mouth, and even eye (specifically pupil) movement—along with body language (e.g., standing up straight versus loosening up) will convey adequately a wide range of character emotions. For example, if a character transitions from surprised to angry, they might start with raised eyebrows, wide eyes, and an open mouth and then transition to having a frown, narrow eyes, and bared teeth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the key frames.",
      "content": "Draw the key frames. The key frames are the major stations of the movement that the character makes. For example, if you're animating a character turning from left to right, the key frames would show the character facing left, then the character facing the camera, and then the character facing right."

    {
      "title": "Check for flow.",

    },
    {
      "title": "Create the in-betweens.",
      "content": "Create the in-betweens. The in-betweens are all of the small movements between the key animations. Start by drawing the image that should go directly between two key frames, then make the image that goes between the key frame and the first in-between. Keep doing this until you have the appropriate number of frames to illustrate the movement (this will differ depending on what your purpose is with your animation). You'll want to check for flow again after doing this."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean up the drawings.",
      "content": "Clean up the drawings. Clean any sketch lines and stray marks that distract from the movement of the character. You may even choose to ink the frames of animation, depending on what you plan to do with your work."
