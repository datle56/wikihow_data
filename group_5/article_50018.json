Your guardian angels (or the higher power you believe in) are letting you know that they’re here to guide you through the obstacles in your way. Your intuition or “gut feeling” is your connection to their energy, so trust yourself when you make important decisions about your life goals and dreams. [1] X Research source Pay attention to your thoughts when you see 117. The angels may be highlighting an area or problem that needs your focus. For example, if you see 117 while you’re thinking about whether to accept a new job offer, it may be your guardian angels asking you to go with your gut decision rather than overthink it. 117 is considered one of the most powerful and spiritual angel numbers. It’s confirmation that the angels are by your side no matter what!"

      "content": "For singles If you’re seeking love, 117 is a reminder to trust your gut and stay open-minded when looking for a partner. Trust yourself if something feels “off” or like you don’t have a genuine connection with someone—this could be your angels telling you not to settle or fall back into bad dating habits. On the other hand, don’t hold yourself back if you feel true love and joy with someone—the angels want you to be happy! [3] X Research source Keep an open mind while you’re dating. Your perfect partner might be someone you normally don’t consider your “type,” or maybe you’ve already met them but haven’t thought about them romantically before. If you’re not actively looking for a relationship, enjoy the single life and travel, pursue your passions or hobbies, and work on yourself. Eventually, you’ll attract a partner who vibrates at your level (if and when you want to)."

      "content": "117 means you have the ability to reach your highest spiritual potential. Essentially, this angel number is a sign from the universe that you have the power to start fresh, improve your life circumstances, and reach spiritual enlightenment if you believe in yourself and the divine energy around you. [8] X Research source This message comes from the combined energies of the numbers 1, 11, 7, and 9. According to psychic medium Mari Cartagenova, “the number 1 represents new beginnings and new connections.” Its energy is doubled since it occurs twice. Master number 11 symbolizes spiritual enlightenment, or access to a new level of spiritual awareness and understanding. Mari Cartagenova also says that number 8 “is all about connecting to the spiritual magic that is the world, to possibility, and to new things…7 has magic connected to it.” When combined with number 1, you get “the magic of new beginnings.” 117 reduces to the root number 9 since 1+1+7=9. Number 9 symbolizes “endings, transformation, and starting over” according to Mari Cartagenova."
