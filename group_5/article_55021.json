      "title": "Boiling water",
      "content": "Boiling water Boil 2–3 US gal (7.6–11.4 L) of water on the stove, then carefully transport it out to the ant hill. Slowly, steadily, and carefully pour it into the main opening of the ant hill. This should cause the hill to cave in and kill any ants inside. [1] X Research source You may have better results if you boil 2-3 pots of water simultaneously, then pour them one after the other into the ant hill. The more water, the better! Check after a couple hours and over the next few days. If the ants are still alive, repeat the process or try something else."

      "title": "Flooding the hill",
      "content": "Flooding the hill Turn on your garden hose full blast and drench the ant hill and surrounding area for a good 3-5 minutes or more. Soak it until the ground is fully saturated and the water is ponding, and then keep going a bit longer. [2] X Research source Ant hills can be 3 ft (0.91 m) deep, so it takes a lot of water to flood the tunnels all the way to the bottom. Check back for ant activity 2 or 3 times per day over the following 3 days. If you don’t see any activity after 3 days, the ants are probably all dead. Otherwise, either repeat the flooding or move on to other measures. Carbonated water is also supposed to be extremely effective at destroying ant hills. The carbon dioxide displaces oxygen in the hill, causing the ants to suffocate."

      "title": "Boric acid",
      "content": "Boric acid Sprinkle powdered boric acid around and on the ant hill, or put several scoopfuls into 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water and pour it into the ant hill. Boric acid is toxic to ants if they consume it, so the hope here is that the workers will bring it back for the other ants—including the queen—to eat. [3] X Research source However, boric acid will also kill any grass in the immediate area, and it is also dangerous to use if pets or kids frequent the area. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Insecticide dust or liquid",
      "content": "Insecticide dust or liquid There are many types of chemical insecticides to choose from, including Deltamethrin , Bendiocarb , Bifenthrin , Diazinon , and Carbaryl . Choose your preferred dust or liquid and apply according to the package’s instructions. Rake the insecticide into the soil. When the ants inevitably rebuild the top of the hill, they’ll get coated in the poison and carry it deeper into the colony. In less than a week, there’s a good chance that all the ants will be dead. [5] X Research source Follow the reapplication instructions included with your chosen insecticide, if necessary."

      "title": "Bifen L/P granules",
      "content": "Bifen L/P granules Bifen L/P granules are a type of insecticide that attack an ant’s central nervous system when they ingest it. Spread the granules on top of the hill and in areas where the ants travel so they carry the insecticide back to their colony. [6] X Research source Some types of granules may require you to pour water on top of them. Check the package for specific instructions."

    {
      "title": "Bait traps",
      "content": "Bait traps Use ant bait traps if you don’t want to disturb the ant hill. Buy several enclosed ant bait traps marketed for outdoor use and place them around the perimeter of the ant hill. The worker ants will enter, take the poisoned food into the colony, and kill most, if not all, of the ants inside. [7] X Research source Enclosed bait traps make it harder for pets or kids to access the poison, but they aren’t completely foolproof. Supervise any pets or kids closely or, better yet, keep them out of the area. It will probably take less than a week for the ant colony to be poisoned and killed off. Buy these traps and other insecticides at home improvement stores."

      "title": "Vinegar",
      "content": "Vinegar Pour at least 1 US qt (0.95 L) of vinegar into the hill. The acidity of the vinegar may kill the ants that are soaked by it, if they don’t drown anyway. The more vinegar you use the better, so consider dumping 1 US gal (3.8 L) jugs of vinegar into the hill opening daily for 3 days. [8] X Research source You may have even more success if you pour several scoops of baking soda into the hole first. The volcano-like foaming action caused by the combination of vinegar and baking soda may push the mixture deeper into the ant hill’s tunnels. Note that vinegar can kill vegetation, so take care when applying it to your lawn."

      "content": "Soapy water If regular water doesn’t do the trick, mix in some soap. Any type of soap will work, though Borax is recommended. Slowly pour 2–3 US gal (7.6–11.4 L) of soapy water into the ant hill. The water should destroy the structure and the stickiness of the soap should make it difficult for the ants to escape. This also works with boiling water. [9] X Research source It’s also possible to kill ants with Borax by mixing 1 part Borax with 3 parts sugar and sprinkling it atop the ant hill and along ant trails."

      "title": "Diatomaceous earth",
      "content": "Diatomaceous earth Pour a fair amount of diatomaceous earth granules around and on top of the ant hill. Diatomaceous earth is essentially the crunched-up exoskeletons of a type of algae. The tiny, sharp granules are uncomfortable or even dangerous for ants to walk on, and if they eat any of it, it will cause fatal internal injuries. [10] X Research source Diatomaceous earth will irritate your skin and can cause quite a bit of discomfort if it gets into your eyes or breathing passages. Only apply it on a wind-free day, and wear eye and breathing protection when using it."

      "content": "Flattening the hill Flatten out the hill with a rake or shovel. For smaller hills, just use your foot to knock over and tamp down the ant hill. While this is a simple solution, it’s also likely a temporary one. The ants will likely reconstruct the hill after a few days or move to another spot in your yard. [11] X Research source Like an iceberg, the vast majority of an ant colony is beneath the surface, so you’ll be doing very little overall damage to their home this way. This method is probably best for when you’re trying to make your yard look a little better for a few hours, like for a garden party or family picnic. If you’re intent on destroying the hill with nothing more than manual power, keep flattening out the hill every time it reappears. If you’re lucky, the ants will eventually give in and relocate.

      "title": "Digging into the hill",
      "content": "Digging into the hill If you’re tired of superficial destruction, take your shovel and start excavating the ant colony. Keep digging until you don’t see any more tunnels or other evidence of ant activity. Then, fill the hole back in with the soil. After this amount of disruption and destruction, the ants may choose to move elsewhere. [13] X Research source You might also manage to kill the queen this way, in which case the colony will die off in disarray. Be prepared to dig deep—ants often tunnel down 3 ft (0.91 m), and the colony can be several feet/meters in diameter as well. So you’ll be digging up quite a bit of your yard!"

      "title": "Cornmeal or baking soda",
      "content": "Cornmeal or baking soda Sprinkle a coating of cornmeal or baking soda on the hill and over the surrounding area. The ants should eat it but be unable to digest it. Instead, it will soak up the moisture inside them and expand until it kills them. [14] X Research source There isn’t a lot of scientific evidence to support this method, but many people swear by one or the other. Cornmeal and baking soda are not harmful to your lawn or pets either, so it might be worth a shot. If it doesn’t work, just try a different method."

      "content": "Orange rind smoothie Mix the rinds of at least 3-4 oranges in a blender, adding a bit of juice as needed to create a smoothie-like texture. Pour the mixture on top of the hill and around its perimeter. Ants supposedly hate the scent of citrus, so the hope is that they’ll be upset by the smell and move somewhere else. [15] X Research source Repeat this method daily for at least 3 days. Support for this method is primarily anecdotal rather than scientific, so it may not work for everyone."

To prevent this , use caulk to seal any cracks or holes the ants could crawl through. This is especially important around doors and windows. [19] X Research source It may also help to create a barrier by placing substances ants dislike around window ledges, door thresholds, and baseboards. Try repelling them with cinnamon , cayenne pepper, ground chalk, or cornmeal. Or, spray the areas with a mix of equal parts white vinegar and water or water with a few drops of peppermint or citrus essential oils . These scents repel ants."

      "title": "What are ant hills?",
      "content": "What are ant hills? Ant hills, or ant mounds, are piles of dirt constructed by ants to protect the colony underground. They often appear after the queen has mated, and the hills expand as the ants grow. Ant hills typically form near food sources, so if you see one in your yard, it’s often a sign of an infestation.
