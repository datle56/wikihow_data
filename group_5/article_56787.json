      "content": "Sulfate-free shampoos may help your hair retain moisture and softness. Many shampoos contain sulfates, which are good cleaning agents that help remove dirt and grime. However, they can also dry your hair out and make it rougher because they strip natural oils away. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Besides sulfate-free shampoos, there are also other special shampoos designed for straightened or treated hair. For example, some shampoos contain additional vitamins or strengthening ingredients like keratin. You can also use a cleansing conditioner, which is more gentle and won't strip all of the natural oils from your hair.

Types of deep conditioning treatments you can make at home include hair masks and oils.
