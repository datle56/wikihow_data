      "content": "Determine your model type. There are many different types of modeling, some with very specific requirements in terms of physical appearance and skill level. While it’s true that the most common types of modeling do require tall, thin people, there are other types of modeling where the preferred body style is more flexible. Live modeling is one example where personality is more important than an exact body type or look. Live models represent companies at trade shows, shopping malls, and other venues to promote a particular product or brand. Since live modeling requires interacting with many people, it’s important that the model is outgoing and has a sunny disposition. Fashion modeling is the most common type of modeling that people know about. To be a successful fashion model requires a certain height. In the larger markets, such as New York, the minimum acceptable height is 5’10”, while in the smaller markets the minimum is 5’8”. Fashion models must also be quite thin. In terms of looks, a wider range is acceptable, from conventionally beautiful to striking. Commercial print modeling is a catch-all for models who appear in advertisements in magazines and newspapers. It can range from swimsuit modeling to portraying a specific role, such as businessperson, doctor, or representative of a particular demographic. Appearance requirements vary with the type of job. For instance, swimsuit models need to be curvy, yet show good muscle-tone, while representatives of a particular demographic simply need to be attractive examples of that demographic. Body part modeling showcases a particular body part, such hair, legs, or hands. If you have lustrous hair, graceful hands, or legs that go on forever, consider this modeling type."
