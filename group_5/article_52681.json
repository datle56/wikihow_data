The information you want contained in your barcode will need to be translated to a suitable barcode format, like an alphanumeric string, for it to be properly read by scanners. You should have a general format in mind for how you will structure all barcodes for your particular purpose. Many different kinds of information can be included in your barcode, but generally, this information pertains to identification, tracking, and inventory. Consistent formatting will help make the translated information easier to read and will make human processing of barcode information more efficient. \"Alphanumeric\" refers to a system that uses both letters and numbers.

To have the text you've converted to show up properly as a barcode, you'll need to input your barcode string into your Word document in the font for your symbology.
