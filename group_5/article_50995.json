    {
      "title": "Focus mostly on yourself.",
      "content": "Focus mostly on yourself. This is your moment to tell your potential matches about you, so keep things on topic. Go ahead and mention your interests, but try not to delve too deep. Keep it brief, but also let them know who you are. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest and authentic.",
      "content": "Be honest and authentic. There’s no point in pretending to be someone you’re not. When you land the date and meet in person, the game will be up, anyway. Instead, be honest about who you are and what you’re looking for. People are more attracted to authenticity. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Write a humorous bio to make them smile before they even meet you.",
      "content": "Write a humorous bio to make them smile before they even meet you. If you can get them laughing right off the bat, you’re a step above the rest. Sprinkle in some jokes or one-liners to lighten the mood. But don’t worry if you’re not exactly a comedian—avoid forcing a joke in your bio, your wit can come later in the messages. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let them know you’re looking for fun with a suggestive bio.",
      "content": "Let them know you’re looking for fun with a suggestive bio. If you’re here for a good time rather than a long time, make that known. You don’t have to say it outright in your bio, but use some tasteful, suggestive language that get your message across. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Two truths and a lie",
      "content": "Two truths and a lie It’s a classic icebreaker for a reason. Use your Bumble bio to play this game with other users. They won’t be able to resist swiping right just so they can guess which is the lie, which is the perfect way to strike up a conversation . [5] X Research source “Two truths and a lie: I have an olympic medal, I run hurdles, and my mile time still sucks.” “David Bowie is my uncle, I met George Clooney on a yacht, and I was once attacked by an eel.” “I’m allergic to peanuts, I love peanut butter, and I spend a lot of time in the ER.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Greater than/Less than",
      "content": "Greater than/Less than Is The Office better than Parks & Rec ? Is the book better than the movie? Let them know your priorities and preferences with a simple mathematical equation. Okay, so it’s not exactly math, but it is fun, clever, and a surefire way to get a conversation going. “Mountains > The beach” “Winter > Summer” “Oat milk > Soy milk”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Superlatives",
      "content": "Superlatives They’re not just for the yearbook—your most and least likelies are a great way to show off your personality on your Bumble profile, too. Are you the most likely to use the drive-thru window on foot? Or maybe you’re the least likely to skip a T-Swift song. Whatever it is, you hold the title, so go ahead and put it on your profile. “Most likely to jump into the lion exhibit at the zoo.” “Least likely to go to bed at a reasonable hour.” “Most likely to rob a Bath and Body Works.” “Least likely to snitch when you rob a Bath and Body Works.”"

    {
      "title": "Unpopular opinions",
      "content": "Unpopular opinions You’re trying to catch their attention, so swing big and hit ‘em with your most controversial opinion. Pineapple belongs on pizza. Peacock is the best streaming service. Crocs are cool, actually. They might swipe right just to slide into your DMs and tell you how wrong you are, but a match is a match. [6] X Research source “Unpopular opinion: George was the worst Beatle.” “Unpopular opinion: Tumblr is the best social media app.” “Unpopular opinion: I prefer Harry Styles’ One Direction era.”"

    {
      "title": "About me/About you",
      "content": "About me/About you Let them know your perfect relationship dynamic by introducing yourself, then introducing your ideal partner. Maybe you buy dinner and they buy dessert. Or, you’re the big spoon and they’re the little spoon. It’s a quick way to let other users know who you are and what you’re looking for. “About me: Tall, a little dumb, means well. About you: Short, super smart, up to no good.” “About me: Cooks a mean eggs benedict. About you: Eats a mean eggs benedict.” “About me: iPhone user who’s always losing my charging cable. About you: Also an iPhone user, always has an extra charging cable.”"

      "content": "Overrated/Underrated Set the record straight giving your honest take on popular topics. 5SOS is overrated. Megan Thee Stallion? Underrated. Whether they agree or disagree, they’ll be swiping right to let you know all about it. [7] X Research source “Overrated: Marvel movies. Underrated: Going to see a movie alone.” “Overrated: Brunch. Underrated: You and me at brunch.” “Underrated: Cats. Also underrated: Dogs. Definitely underrated: My pet iguana.”"

      "title": "By day/by night",
      "content": "By day/by night Fill them in on your alter ego. You may not be a superhero, but everyone’s got 2 sides (at least). Who are you at work? Who are you after you clock out? What’s your best side? What’s your more devious side? [8] X Research source “Attorney by day, disco enthusiast by night.” “Lifeguard by day, binge watcher by night.” “Asleep by day, bartender by night.”"

      "title": "Three simple facts about you",
      "content": "Three simple facts about you No need to write paragraphs or the next great memoir. Sometimes it’s better to tell them everything they need to know in a single sentence. Think of 3 simple things that encapsulate you, then fire ‘em off. Bios like these let people know that you know exactly what you’re about. “I’m into classical music, drink too much coffee, and love Halloween.” “I’m a virgo, have a PhD, and still can’t parallel park.” “I collect lamps, I collect futons, and you can be sure that my apartment is fully furnished.”"
    },

      "title": "Pros and cons",
      "content": "Pros and cons Tell them exactly what they’re getting into with a short list of pros and cons. Feel free to tout your best self in your pros, and take it a little easier and have more fun with the cons. [9] X Research source “Pros: Laid-back, down for anything, I’ll buy drinks. Cons: A little spacey, in bed by 9, lightweight.” “Pros: Dog owner, cat mom, hair stylist. Cons: There’s hair all over my apartment.” “Pros: Can cook. Cons: Can’t cook well.”"

      "content": "Useless talents Sure, banging out a symphony on the piano or drawing lifelike portraits are incredible, but let’s get down to the really fun stuff. Can you roll your tongue in the shape of a “W”? Can you use your own leg as a jump rope? Can you balance a grape between your collarbones? The people ought to know, and they’ll be so impressed they’re sure to swipe right. “Not to brag, but I can recite the alphabet backwards without even thinking about it.” “I know every word to ‘Fergalicious.’ Hold your applause.” “I can feel it in my joints any time someone’s about to swipe right. In fact, I feel it right now.”"

Include photos of yourself in a variety of contexts, to give them a more complete impression. Also, put your best photo first to reel them in right off the bat. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep it respectful.",
      "content": "Keep it respectful. First impressions are everything, and if you slip an off-color joke into your bio or your photos, people are more likely to swipe left. Present your best self and put your best foot forward. Pretend you’re already sitting down at a restaurant on that first date! [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Add links to your other social media. You can only tell someone so much in the limited space of a Bumble profile, so link out to things like your Spotify, Instagram, or Twitter to let other people get a more rounded impression of you. Giving them the opportunity to browse your music or the memories you’ve shared on Instagram also gives them more opportunity to feel a connection. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Have a friend review your profile. You’re presenting yourself to other people, and it can be hard to get an accurate impression of the image you're presenting all on your own. Hand your phone to a trusted friend and ask them to give you some feedback. Ask them if your profile is an accurate representation of yourself or if you might have left out anything they might include. Your friends sometimes know you better than you know yourself!"
