      "content": "Electrolysis removes any amount of hair from anywhere on your body. Make an appointment with a dermatologist who performs electrolysis. During your appointment, they'll insert a wire into your hair follicle to emit a painless shock. The shock will damage your hair follicle and cause the hair to fall out. You'll attend weekly or biweekly appointments for around a year to get rid of hair permanently. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ask your doctor ahead of time how many treatments you’ll need, as it varies from person to person. Most people undergo electrolysis treatment weekly or every other week until their hair is gone, which can take up to 18 months. Your appointments will usually last from as short as 15 minutes up to 1 hour. A single electrolysis appointment can range in cost from as low as $30 for a small area like your face or as high as $200 for a larger area like your legs. In total, you'll likely pay thousands of dollars over the course of a year to remove the hair permanently."
