      "content": "Learn the parts of speech. Every word in the English language can be categorized as a specific part of speech. The parts of speech do not define what a word is. Instead, they describe how to use that word. [1] X Research source A noun is a person, place, or thing. [2] X Research source Example: grandma, school, pencil A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun within a sentence. Example: he, she, they Articles are special terms that proceed a noun within a sentence. The three articles are: a, an, the An adjective modifies or describes a noun or pronoun. Example: red, tall A verb is a word that describes an action or state of being. Example: be, run, sleep An adverb modifies or describes a verb. Adverbs can also be used to modify adjectives. Example: happily, wonderfully A conjunction joins two parts of a sentence together. Example: and, but A preposition is used in combination with a noun or pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech, like a verb, noun, pronoun, or adjective. Example: up, down, of, from Interjections are words that express an emotional state. Example: wow, ouch, hey"

      "content": "Explore the rules governing each part of speech in greater depth. Most parts of speech have additional rules governing their usage. If you want to master English grammar, you will need to study these rules in detail. Make note of the following for your studies: [3] X Research source Nouns can be: singular or plural; proper or common; collective; count or non-count; abstract or concrete; gerunds Pronouns can be: personal, possessive, reflexive, intensive, reciprocal, indefinite, demonstrative, interrogative, or relative Adjectives can be used on their own, for the sake of making comparisons, or as superlatives. Adverbs are either relative adverbs or adverbs of frequency. Conjunctions are either coordinating or correlative. Verbs can be: action verbs or linking verbs; main verbs or auxiliary/helping verbs The articles \"a\" and \"an\" are indefinite, while the article \"the\" is definite."

      "content": "Know how to write numbers. Single-digit numbers (zero through nine) should be spelled out in word form, but double-digit numbers (10 and up) should be written in numerical form. [4] X Research source All numbers within a sentence should either be spelled out or written numerically. Do not mix and match. Correct example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought 2 apples. Incorrect example: I bought 14 apples but my sister only bought two apples. Never start a sentence with a number written in numerical form. Spell out simple fractions and use hyphens with them. Example: one-half A mixed fraction can be written numerically. Example: 5 1/2 Write decimals in numerical figures. Example: 0.92 Use commas when writing numbers with four or more digits. Example: 1,234,567 Write out the numerical figure when specifying the day of the month. Example: June 1"

      "content": "Learn how to structure a basic sentence. At minimum, every sentence consists of a subject and an action. [5] X Research source A sentence that lacks either one is a sentence fragment and is considered to be improper. The subject is usually a noun or pronoun, and the action is conveyed using a verb. Correct example: The dog ran . Note that the subject is indicated in italics and the action is indicated in bold print. Incorrect example: Yesterday afternoon. Expand your sentences into more complex forms after mastering this basic format."

      "content": "Maintain correct subject/verb agreement. Within a sentence, both the subject and verb must share the same singular/plural state. You cannot use the singular form of a verb with a plural subject; a plural subject must have a plural verb. [6] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Correct example: They are at school. Incorrect example: They is at school. When two singular subjects are connected with the word \"and\" ( he and his brother ), the subject becomes plural. When connected by \"or\" or \"nor\" ( he or his brother ), the subject is singular. Collective nouns, like \"family\" or \"team,\" are treated as singular nouns and require a singular verb."

      "content": "Form compound sentences. Compound sentences are the easiest sentence form to master after the basic sentence. Use a conjunction to join two related thoughts into one sentence rather than forming two separate sentences. [7] X Research source Instead of: The dog ran. He was fast. Use: The dog ran and he was fast. Instead of: We looked for the missing book. We could not find it. Use: We looked for the missing book but could not find it."

      "content": "Practice using conditional phrases. A conditional sentence describes a situation in which one part of the sentence is true only if the other part is true. They can also be referred to as \"if, then\" statements, but the word \"then\" will not always appear when the sentence is written. [8] X Research source Example: If you ask your mother, then she will take you to the store. Note, however, that it would also be correct to write: If you ask your mother, she will take you to the store. Both forms are still conditional."

      "content": "Understand how to use clauses. Use clauses to form complex sentences. Clauses are the \"building blocks\" that can be used to expand a sentence past its basic form. They can either be independent or dependent. [9] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source An independent clause has its own subject and verb. As a result, it could stand as its own sentence. Note that compound sentences, as mentioned previously, consist of independent clauses. Example: She felt sad, but her friends cheered her up. Both \"she felt sad\" and \"her friends cheered her up\" could stand as separate sentences. A dependent clause is one that could not stand as its own sentence. Example: While he agreed with his brother, the boy would not admit to it. The clause \"While he agreed with his brother\" would not make sense a separate sentence, so it is a dependent clause."

      "content": "Manage punctuation. There are multiple punctuation marks and various rules governing their usage. You should study these rules in detail, but first, you need a basic understanding of how each punctuation mark is used. [10] X Research source Periods (.) mark the end of a statement sentence. Ellipses (...) indicate that a portion of text has been removed from the passage. Commas (,) separate words or word groups when a pause is necessary but a period is inappropriate. Semicolons (;) should be used in complex sentences that lack a connecting conjunction. Colons (:) are used to introduce lists within a sentence. Question marks (?) are used at the end of a sentence when the sentence asks a question. Exclamation points (!) are used at the end of a statement sentence to indicate surprise or emphasis. Quotation marks (\") separate words spoken by another person from the rest of the text. Parentheses () enclose information that clarifies a preceding thought. Apostrophes (') separate contractions and show possession."

      "title": "Learn about paragraph structure.",
      "content": "Learn about paragraph structure. A basic paragraph consists of three to seven sentences. Each paragraph must have a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. [11] X Research source The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in the paragraph. It is the most general sentence and introduces the idea you plan to discuss throughout the rest of the paragraph. Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. The supporting sentences explain the idea presented in the topic sentence with greater detail. Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the \"word\" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the \"sentence\" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of \"sentence\" level grammar. Once a person starts writing larger piece, he or she must also learn about paragraph structure and organization. The concluding sentence summarizes the information presented in the paragraph. It is not always necessary, but you should still know how to write one. Example: English grammar is a complex topic that covers a range of information. At the \"word\" level, one must learn about parts of speech. At the \"sentence\" level, topics like sentence structure, subject/verb agreement, and clauses must be explored. The rules governing punctuation use are also a part of \"sentence\" level grammar.

While you could technically have a paragraph that uses nothing but basic sentences, a better and more grammatically pleasing paragraph will have a variety of simple and complex sentences. Correct example: I love my cat. He has soft, orange fur. On cold days, he likes to cuddle next to me for warmth. I think that my cat is the greatest cat ever, and I am really happy to have him.

The introductory paragraph must be a general paragraph that presents the main idea without providing detail. The supporting paragraphs must expand on this main idea with greater detail, and each paragraph should cover its own separate point. The concluding paragraph restates and summarizes the information presented in the essay and does not introduce any new information."

Grammar books are helpful, of course, but the principle of this step is a different one. Read books, magazines, or other materials written in English that you enjoy. The more often you read, the more familiar you will naturally become with the way that grammar is used in word, sentence, and paragraph levels. Learning the rules of English grammar is an important step, but you will be able to put those rules into practice better if you are actually used to seeing proper grammar. If you also want to practice your speaking abilities, read out loud to engage both your eyes and your ears!"

If you are no longer in school, consider taking a grammar class at a community college, community center, or library. You could also look for a class online. For non-native English speakers, look for classes specifically designed for students who are learning English as a secondary language.
