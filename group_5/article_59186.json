      "content": "Scrape off any excess hot sauce as soon as possible. Try using a spoon, butter knife, credit card, or even a paper towel to rub away as much of the hot sauce as you can. The stain will be easiest to treat if you get to it right away, but even if it dries before you notice it, start treating it as soon as you're able to. [1] X Research source The more hot sauce that's present, the more likely the stain will be to spread once you start trying to clean it, which is why scraping off the excess is important."

      "content": "Coat large, fresh stains with baking powder, then rinse with cool water. To absorb some of the oil from the stain, sprinkle a generous layer of baking powder over the entire surface of the stain. Leave it in place for at least 15 minutes, then turn the garment inside-out and rinse the back of the stain with cold running water. [2] X Research source While this isn't likely to take the stain out of the garment, it can make it easier to clean, since it helps remove some of the oil. You can also use cornstarch if you don't have any baking powder on hand. Rinsing the stain from the back will help flush the oil out of the fabric without spreading the stain."

      "content": "Rub liquid laundry detergent out of the stain and let it sit for 3-5 minutes. Pour a small amount of liquid laundry detergent onto the garment, then gently rub the detergent onto the surface of the stain. Wait for about 3-5 minutes, then turn the garment inside-out and rinse the spot under cold running water. When you're finished, launder the garment as usual. [3] X Research source Do not use bar soap or powder detergent. You'll likely have to scrub to get these to cover the spot, which could set the stain deeper into the fabric. This is especially useful for cleaning a stain that's dried, although it will work on fresh hot sauce stains, as well."

      "content": "Clean the spot with rubbing alcohol for a quick fix. If you want to lighten a hot sauce stain quickly, blot the area with rubbing alcohol and clean paper towels. Continue blotting until most of the stain is gone. Your garment should dry quickly once you're finished! [4] X Research source You can also use hand sanitizer or white vinegar if you don't have rubbing alcohol available. Just make sure the hand sanitizer is clear and fragrance-free so it won't stain your clothes."

      "title": "Wash the garment as usual once you lighten the stain.",
      "content": "Wash the garment as usual once you lighten the stain. No matter which stain removal method you use, once you get the majority of the hot sauce out of the garment, run the clothing through your washing machine on a cool cycle. Examine the garment closely once you finish washing it. If the hot sauce is completely gone, put the clothing in the dryer or hang it up to dry. If there's still a faint stain, continue treating the garment until it's gone. Washing the garment in cool water will prevent the stain from setting into the fabric if it isn't completely gone. If you prefer, you can hand wash the garment instead. Drying the clothing can set in the stain, which is why it's important to check before you put it in the dryer."

Then, wring out the cloth until it stops dripping. [7] X Research source In general, when you're cleaning carpet or upholstery, it's best to use as little water as possible to avoid spreading the stain or leaving water spots. Using a white cloth will ensure that you don't transfer any dye from the towel to the upholstery."

[8] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source To keep up with what side of the cloth you've already used, try folding it into quarters before you start. Work on the first side, then flip the cloth over and use the second side once that's dirty. Then, turn the last fold inside-out and you'll have 2 clean sections of the cloth to work with."

The abrasiveness of the salt scrub should help work the stain out of the surface.

Because this scrub is abrasive, avoid using it on any surface that would be easily scratched, like marble or lacquered surfaces."
