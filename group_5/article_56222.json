      "content": "Your hair retains more moisture when you sleep in braids. When you sleep with your hair down, the moisture from your hair can seep into your pillow during the night and you wake up with dry locks. Braiding your hair keeps moisture locked in so you wake up with healthy, shiny hair. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Overnight braids help you avoid the damage of heated styling tools. Curling or making waves in your hair with heated tools can really damage your hair over time. Since the braids hold your hair in the same position throughout the night, they’ll naturally curl your hair. Avoiding unnecessary heat styling means you can look forward to smoother, healthier hair in the long run. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Sleeping in braids promotes clear skin and prevents breakouts. If you don’t shower at the end of the day, your hair could have a lot of dirt and oils that built up over the day. When you sleep, your hair could get in your face and possibly cause blemishes. If you put your hair up in braids, it stays away from your face so it stays clean. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Braid your hair when it’s dry or damp.",
      "content": "Braid your hair when it’s dry or damp. When you tie back wet hair, it’s a lot easier to stretch and could lead to tension breakage. If you want to braid your hair before going to sleep, it's best to wait until it’s at least towel-dry to avoid any possible damage. [5] X Research source If you're pressed for time, braid wet hair gently and definitely make sure it's dry or damp by bedtime to avoid damage while you toss and turn."

      "title": "Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair before you braid.",
      "content": "Apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair before you braid. Use a leave-in conditioner to help keep your braids in place overnight. For an added bonus, leave-in conditioner will help keep your locks hydrated and healthy—especially if you struggle with dry hair. [6] X Research source Choose a leave-in conditioner that’ll suit your hair type. Ask your hairstylist for recommendations. In general, thicker hair can handle heavier products. If your hair is finer, opt for less leave-in conditioner. If leave-in conditioner hasn’t worked well for use, use an anti-frizz spray instead. It’ll offer the same benefits: less frizz, braids kept intact, and moisturized hair. But anti-frizz spray is much gentler on your locks. [7] X Research source"

Make sure you’ve brushed through any knots and applied leave-in conditioner before you start. Then, braid without tugging or ripping your hair.

      "content": "Secure each braid with a fabric-covered hair tie. When you use everyday hair ties or even rubber bands, your overnight braids will face frizz and even damage. Instead, buy hair ties that are gentle on your locks, like satin or silk scrunchies. [10] X Research source Fabric-covered hair ties make it more comfortable to sleep in braids, too. No more waking up to random hair yanks in the middle of the night!"

      "content": "Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase. The less friction your braids face during the night, the sleeker your hair will look in the morning. Using a silk or satin pillowcase helps you prevent frizz, flyaways, and damage. [11] X Research source Buy a silk or satin pillowcase from online shops, superstores, or beauty shops. Alternatively, you can wear a satin sleep bonnet or silk scarf to bed. As an added bonus, satin sleep bonnets and silk scarves can actually help your braids stay intact through the night."

      "content": "Find the braid that’s best for you. Different braids produce different curls—and different hair types create different looks, too. In general, to get loose curls, you want just a few braids around your head. If you’re looking for tight, crimped curls, go for tons of small braids all over your head. Also, make sure you braid on the tighter side. [12] X Research source For loose curls, create a single fishtail braid down the back of your head. Don’t pull tightly on the braid. Instead, let it sit loosely. When you wake up, tousle your hair with some hair spray, and you’ll have beachy waves. For crimped curls, create three rope twist braids down your neck. Wake up and apply some sea salt spray to add even more texture to your look. To create tight curls, create multiple french braids all around your crown. Braid them tightly against your scalp. Wake up, throw on some hair spray, and you’ll have flirty, tight coils. For box braids, a preventive braided style, book an appointment with your stylist. Not only is this look completely beautiful, but it’ll also help with length retention. Plus, box braids last up to six weeks! Keep in mind that different hair can experience totally different outcomes. Keep experimenting to find a style that you absolutely love."
