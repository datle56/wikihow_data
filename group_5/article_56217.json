The fiery, upbeat Sagittarius knows just how to make the logical air sign Aquarius smile, and their thirst for knowledge only increases their bond. When these two partner up, they’re sure to have a good time. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Both Sagittarius and Aquarius are open to trying new things. If there’s one thing this pairing will never have to deal with, it’s being bored in bed. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, meaning they are always open to new experiences and ideas. Plus, Sagittarius is known to be one of the most sexual signs, and Aquarians are not far behind. Neither are shy about telling the other person what they like, and both of them love experimenting with fun, new activities. Both signs are usually okay with having a friends with benefits situation, too. You might find this pair in a committed relationship, but you could also find them hooking up together (and having just as much fun)."

      "content": "Once this pair becomes friends, they’re BFFs for life. [2] X Research source Often described as “the life of the party,” these two know how to have fun. You could probably find these fast friends planning their next overseas trip or signing up for skydiving lessons. Since the two are so similar in so many ways, they tend to get along well, and they know when to give each other space. Aquarius tends to blend their romantic and platonic relationships, which can make the boundaries of their relationships a little bit blurry."

      "content": "Neither sign is outwardly emotional, which helps them understand each other. Although Sagittarius has a reputation for falling in love quickly, they tend to hide their emotions until they feel safe. Similarly, Aquarius is a fixed sign, meaning they’re a little more wary about change—which can make it hard for them to open up. If both signs give each other enough time, they’ll be able to open up about their feelings before too long. Aquarians tend to fall in love slower than Sagittariuses do. This has the potential to cause problems if Sagittarius expresses their feelings before the Aquarius is ready."

      "title": "Both signs value their privacy, which can make trust a slow process.",
      "content": "Both signs value their privacy, which can make trust a slow process. Sagittarius is a free spirit, and needs a ton of space to roam. Similarly, Aquarius likes to make their own decisions, and they won’t want to partner up with anyone clingy. Since each sign needs so much space from the other, trusting the other person might take a little while to achieve. Fortunately, since both signs value their space so much, they each understand why the other person needs so much privacy."

      "title": "These two signs will never run out of things to talk about.",
      "content": "These two signs will never run out of things to talk about. The way to an Aquarians heart is through their intellect. Aquarius’s ruling planet is Uranus, the planet of innovation and originality, so they always have their own unique spin on a topic. Fortunately, Sagittarius is ruled by the planet Jupiter, the planet of exploration and knowledge. Aquarius will appreciate Sagittarius’s ability to switch topics on the fly, and Sagittarius will love that Aquarius doesn’t judge them. [3] X Research source You might find this pairing staying up until sunrise discussing anything from aliens to the afterlife (and what you’ll never see is them talking about mundane things, like the weather)."

      "content": "This pairing has the potential to create a loving, healthy relationship. Since Sagittarius and Aquarius are so similar, their attraction tends to run deep, and they find themselves agreeing with each other more than fighting. Neither person will get bored with the other, and they’ll have tons of fun trying new things and having adventures together. If they can both give each other the space they need to be happy, they’re sure to stay in this relationship for a long time. You can think of their relationship as more of a slow burn rather than a quick fling."
