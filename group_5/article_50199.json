Most Macs, including all laptops, have a built-in microphone, but an external microphone typically affords better sound quality. Different Macs have different port configurations: Not all Macs have a line-in port, and some models of MacBook have a single audio port that can be used as both audio line-in and line-out. Check the sides and back of your Mac to determine what ports are available."
