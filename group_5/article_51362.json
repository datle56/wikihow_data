      "content": "Learn the standard covariance formula and its parts. The standard formula for calculating covariance is Σ ( x i − x avg ) ( y i − y avg ) / ( n − 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\Sigma (x_{i}-x_{\\text{avg}})(y_{i}-y_{\\text{avg}})/(n-1)} . To use this formula, you need to understand the meaning of the variables and symbols: [1] X Research source Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } - This symbol is the Greek letter “sigma.” In math functions it means to add up a series of whatever follows it. In this formula, the Σ sign means that you will calculate the values that follow in the numerator of the fraction, and add them all together, before dividing by the denominator. [2] X Research source x i {\\displaystyle x_{i}} - This variable is read as “x sub i.” The i subscript represents a counter. It means that you will perform the calculation for each value of x that you have in your data set. x a v g {\\displaystyle x_{avg}} - The “avg” indicates that x(avg) is the average value of all of your x data points. The average is sometimes also written as an x with a short horizontal line drawn over it. In that style, the variable is read as “x-bar,” but it still means the average of the data set. y i {\\displaystyle y_{i}} - This variable is read as “y sub i.” The i subscript represents a counter. It means that you will perform the calculation for each value of y that you have in your data set. y a v g {\\displaystyle y_{avg}} - The “avg” indicates that y(avg) is the average value of all of your y data points. The average is sometimes also written as a y with a short horizontal line drawn over it. In that style, the variable is read as “y-bar,” but it still means the average of the data set. n {\\displaystyle n} - This variable represents the number of items in your data set. Remember that for a covariance problem, a single “item” is comprised of both an x-value and a y-value. The value of n is the number of pairs of data points, not individual numbers."

Be careful to align the y-values with the corresponding x-values. In a covariance problem, the order of the data points and the pairings of x and y are important. ( x i − x avg ) {\\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\\text{avg}})} - Leave this column blank in the beginning. You will fill it with data after you calculate the average of the x-data points.

For each item in the x column, you need to find the difference between that number and the average value. For this sample problem, this means subtracting 4.89 from each x-data point. If the original data point is less than the average, then your result will be negative. If the original data point is greater than the average, then your result will be positive. Make sure that you keep track of the negative signs. [3] X Research source For example, the first data point in the x column is 1. The value to enter on the first line of the ( x i − x avg ) {\\displaystyle (x_{i}-x_{\\text{avg}})} column is 1-4.89, which is -3.89. Repeat the process for each data point. Therefore, the second line will be 3-4.89, which is -1.89. The third line will be 2-4.89, or -2.89. Continue the process for all the data points.

However, if you are going to be using covariance values routinely in interpreting data, you will want to find a faster and more automated way to get your results. You should notice by now that for our relatively small data set of only nine pairs of data, the calculations included finding two averages, performing eighteen individual subtractions, nine separate multiplications, one addition, and a final division. That is 31 relatively minor calculations in order to find one solution. Along the way, you risk dropping negative signs or copying your results incorrectly, thereby ruining the result."

In the example mentioned in the introduction, height and weight are being measured. You would expect that as individuals grow taller, their weight would also increase, leading to a positive covariance figure. As another example, suppose data is collected representing the number of hours someone practices golf and the score he or she may earn. In this case, you would expect a negative covariance, which means that as the number of practice hours increases, the golf score will decrease. (In golf, a lower score is better.) Consider the sample data set that was calculated above. The resulting covariance is -8.07. The negative sign here means that as the x-values increase, the y-values will tend to decrease. In fact, you can see that this is true by looking at a few of the values. For example, the x-values of 1 and 2 correspond to y-values of 7, 8 and 9. The x-values of 8 and 12 are paired respectively with y-values of 3 and 2."

That is, an increase in one value may or may not lead to an increase in the other. The two terms are almost randomly connected. For example, suppose you are comparing shoes sizes against SAT scores. Because there are so many factors that affect a student’s SAT scores, we would expect a covariance score of near 0. This would indicate almost no connection between the two values."

When you do that, you should see fairly easily that the points, although not in an exactly straight line, tend to form a cluster that approximates a diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right. This is the description of a negative covariance. Also, notice that the covariance value is -8.07. This is a fairly large number compared to the data points. The high number suggests that the covariance is fairly strong, which you can see by the linear appearance of the data points.
