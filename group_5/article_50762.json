      "content": "Pick a comfortable suit that fits well if you plan to swim. You certainly don’t have to swim at a pool party, but if you think you will, go with a suit that stays in place and fits well. Cute two-pieces, like tankinis, and stylish one-pieces are great options! How much skin you show is completely up to you and what you feel comfortable in. If this is a work-related pool party, a string bikini probably isn't a great choice. Go with something a bit more modest. For guys, the most fashionable and flattering look is a slightly fitted pair of trunks that falls between your mid-thigh and knee. [1] X Research source The key to feeling confident is wearing something that's authentically you. If you feel comfortable rocking a two-piece then go for it, but if you don't, that's okay, too.

      "content": "Go with a light, transparent fabric to show off your suit underneath. A white see-through caftan or a mesh cover up are stylish options that are both functional and fun. Keep in mind you don’t have to buy anything new! Kimonos and sarongs make stylish cover-ups, as well. [3] X Research source A long kimono or wrap can be open in the front if you're comfortable with that, while still providing a little coverage on the sides and backside.

      "content": "Stay cool in this outfit if you’re not planning on swimming. If you’re not wearing a swimsuit to the party but still want to show a little skin, a midriff baring crop top paired with high-waisted shorts looks elegant and timeless. Skip the denim and go with elastic-waisted shorts in a fun print, like bright flowers. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Denim shorts never go out of style and they’re easy to wear at the pool. Put on your swimsuit, slide on some denim shorts, and you’re off! You can skip a shirt altogether or go with a loose white T-shirt that allows your cute swimsuit to peek through a little. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick an outfit with a matching top and bottom for a polished look. Try a short-sleeve button-down top and tie it at the bottom to show off your mid-riff. Pretty prints and plaids can be fun for pool-side, so go with bottoms that match the print or color of your top for a luxe resort look. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Dresses are lightweight, breathable, and fashionable. Plus, if you’re hitting a restaurant after the pool, you won’t have to change your clothes! Choose something colorful or rock a bold print in a lightweight, natural fabric like cotton or linen. [8] X Research source A short, flirty summer dress with spaghetti straps is a classic option if you want to show some skin. Long, flowing dresses and skirts are also great choices! Go with loose, lightweight material so you’ll be comfortable. A maxi dress can highlight your bikini top if you’re wearing a suit. Try pairing it with sandal wedges to feel confident and stylish.

      "content": "These styles are both cute and practical for the pool. You don’t want to wear expensive footwear to a pool party since your shoes could definitely get wet! Go with a cute pair of flat, open-toed shoes, like sandals or flip flops, that complement your outfit and are easy to slip on and off. [10] X Research source Avoid high wedges and heels since those can look a little formal at the pool. [11] X Research source For guys, go with low top or slip-on sneakers, boat shoes, or casual loafers."

      "content": "Pick a bag that coordinates with your outfit or swimsuit. It’s so easy to throw everything you need into a casual tote and head to the pool, and you won’t have to worry about your belongings getting wet or damaged. Your tote doesn’t have to match your outfit perfectly, but pick something that complements your outfit’s style. [12] X Research source Straw totes are great for a carefree, boho vibe. A canvas tote in a bold print is another classic option. Look for a bag with hidden pockets to hide or protect items like tampons, valuables, and your phone."

      "content": "Stick with bangles, beaded necklaces, and simple stud earrings. Just because it’s pool party doesn’t mean you can’t wear jewelry! Beaded or woven necklaces and bracelets are great options that you can safely get wet. Stacked plastic bangles in a variety of colors can make a fun statement, too. [13] X Research source Avoid wearing your nicest and most valuable pieces since they could easily be damaged or lost by the pool."

It’s always a fashion plus if your sunglasses match your outfit or swimsuit! For example, go with a pair that matches your swimsuit's color or try bold, geometric frames that complement the suit's pattern. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Buns, topknots, and loose braids are cute, low maintenance styles. You’ll be outside all day, so go with a no-fuss hairstyle that can withstand the elements. Braids, buns, and ponytails are excellent choices that hold up to a day of sun, wind, and water. Plus, at the end of the day, you can take your hair down and rock loose, beachy waves for the evening.

      "content": "A light coverage foundation with SPF is perfect for the pool. Heavy, full coverage foundation and concealer will be uncomfortable and won’t hold up in the sun all long. Subtle, natural-looking makeup is the way to go! Blend a dab of rosy cream blush into the apples of your cheeks and add a coat of waterproof mascara for a natural look that lasts all day. [16] X Research source Bring along makeup wipes or blotting papers for cleanups during the day."
