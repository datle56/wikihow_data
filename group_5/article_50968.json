      "title": "Start a game with a smart character who lives in a country with a space program.",
      "content": "Start a game with a smart character who lives in a country with a space program. In order to become an astronaut, your character must live in one of the following countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States. If you end up getting a character who is lacking in smarts or lives in the wrong country and you don't want to re-roll, you can change this later by doing activities to increase your smarts or by emigrating to a new country later in life. For best results, it's better to start with a character that lives in the right country but has a lower smarts score. You don't need God Mode to become an astronaut, but you do need to purchase the \"Astronaut Job Pack\" for $4.99 or the \"Boss Mode\" perk for $14.99 in the BitLife Marketplace to unlock the astronaut career path.

You can increase your Space Academy performance by completing the following activities in the Space Academy tab under School : Fitness Training: You can select one of three training types (cardio, strength, and endurance). This training is the easiest to complete, but affects your overall performance the least. Flight Training: You must complete a mini-game where you pilot a space shuttle through an asteroid field. If you touch an asteroid, you fail and your Flight Training is severely impacted. If you'd rather not do the mini-game, you can tap Hack the system and watch an ad instead. Technical Training: You must answer a space-related question correctly. If you don't know the answer, you can Google them. Repeat these trainings until your Space Academy progress bar is full. If you end up flunking out of Space Academy, you can reapply and try again. However, if you focus on fully filling each individual training's progress bar, you should graduate with ease."

After correctly answering the question, you will become an astronaut at the cadet rank. Progress your career by completing one mission a year, maintaining your health and reputation, and getting promoted to higher clearance levels."
