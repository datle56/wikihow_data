While this is an easy method, it usually does incur high fees. Your credit card provider will have provided you with the specific fees for cash advances for your card, but one of the most common fee structures is 5% of the transaction or $10, whichever is more.

If you have a bank withdrawal slip on hand, you can fill it out and bring it with you, but if not, the bank will have one on hand, and the teller can help you fill it out. Your bank will likely require identification to withdraw cash and may need to look at an ID or driver's license if you don't have your debit card."

      "content": "Ask for cash back on a contactless debit payment. If you don't have your debit card on hand, but it's added to your mobile wallet, you could buy something at a store that offers cash back and accepts contactless payments. Many retail stores offer cash back on debit card purchases, which means you can charge an extra amount to your card to get the difference back in cash immediately. Note that there are limits on how much cash back you can get, but it varies based on the retailer. A lot of stores offer contactless payments now, but not all of them do. You can check if a retailer accepts contactless payments by looking in the Google Pay app (Android) or the Apple Maps app (iPhone). In the Google Pay app, you can tap Use Google Pay Nearby to see nearby stores that accept Google Pay . In the Apple Maps app, you can search for the retailer and check their details to see if they accept Apple Pay . You can also check if a store accepts contactless payments by looking for a contactless payment logo or sticker near the checkout or on the front door."

The best place to cash a check to yourself would be at your bank (or a branch of your bank), though some retail stores may cash them as well (such as Walmart, which has a money services department). If there are no branches of the bank you bank at nearby, you can try any bank, but not all banks will cash a check for people who don't use their bank. Some retail stores may charge a fee to cash a check, and these fees may vary by retailer. Check with the retailer cashing your check to see what fees they charge."

      "content": "Use your contactless payment method at a cardless ATM. Many banks or financial institutions have added contactless sensors to their ATMs, so you can use your mobile wallet to withdraw money. If your debit card is added to your mobile wallet, you can use a cardless ATM or ATM with a contactless sensor to withdraw cash. You can only use your contactless debit card at ATMs that are affiliated with your bank, or an ATM that has no bank affiliation. If you use an out-of-network ATM, your bank will still charge fees for a withdrawal, even if it's contactless."

      "content": "Consider a virtual debit card. If you don't have a physical debit card or tend to lose yours often, you may want to get a virtual debit card instead. These cards exist 100% online, unlike a digital debit card, which is the digital version of a physical debit card. Much like your mobile wallet, you can use your virtual debit card to get cash from a cardless ATM or as cash back from a debit purchase in a retail store. [2] X Research source You can get a virtual debit card immediately since you don't need to wait for the physical card to be made, and you can get them through a traditional bank, a neobank like Chime or Wise, or a service like PayPal. If you get a card from anywhere other than the bank you already use, you will need to perform an external transfer to move funds into your new virtual debit card."
