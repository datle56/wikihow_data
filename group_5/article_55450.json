      "content": "Tap lightly on your stucco to see if it has Styrofoam backing. Hot glue can melt Styrofoam backing. If the tap makes a muffled sound, your stucco likely has Styrofoam backing and you should avoid using hot glue. If it sounds loud, you're good to go! [1] X Research source If your stucco has Styrofoam backing and you still want to try using hot glue, purchase a glue that melts at a low temperature and use a glue gun with low-temperature settings. You should also avoid glues that have strong adhesive properties."

      "title": "Avoid using hot glue if your stucco is painted.",
      "content": "Avoid using hot glue if your stucco is painted. Hot glue is great for attaching your Christmas lights to stucco but will cause peeling on painted surfaces. Whenever possible, run your Christmas lights along unpainted areas for the best results. [2] X Research source If you can't find a location that's non-painted, hang some or all of your lights using plastic roof clips."

      "title": "Remove the light bulbs prior to installing your strings.",
      "content": "Remove the light bulbs prior to installing your strings. This will make the process of attaching the light string much easier. It also helps you avoid getting glue on the bulbs. Once the line is firmly in place, you can screw the bulbs back in quick and easy. [3] X Research source Gently unscrew the bulbs by turning them counterclockwise."

      "title": "Apply a small bead of glue",
      "content": "Apply a small bead of glue to the side of the first empty bulb socket. Be sure to do so to the side opposite from the socket's clip. Never apply glue to the base of the socket or you'll experience problems during removal and can cause the socket to detach from its cord. [4] X Research source Wait 2 minutes for the glue gun to heat up before applying glue. Lightly squeeze the glue gun's trigger to apply glue."

Remove it after 4 to 5 seconds or when the glue dries. [5] X Research source Gently press on the socket after gluing it to ensure that it's stuck firmly to the wall."

      "content": "Soften the glue with a heat gun to remove the light sockets. If you make a mistake and need to remove a light socket from the wall, heat the glue with a heat gun. Once it's soft, scrape it off gently. Just remember that this will likely leave some glue residue behind, so try your best to place each socket as accurately as possible the first time around. [7] X Research source Remove light sockets at the end of the season, or keep them up year-round to avoid the removal process. Purchase a heat gun from a home hardware store or online supplier."

Apply a small amount to a dry microfiber cloth and wipe down the surface of your stucco wall.

Make sure to press firmly against your light for 30 seconds to ensure a proper seal. [9] X Research source Be sure to purchase a product that can hold as much weight as possible for the best adhesion. For windy areas, double-sided tape holds up well compared to plastic roof clips."

Again, hold it firmly in place for 30 seconds to ensure a proper seal. [10] X Research source Continue attaching double-sided tape to your Christmas lights and pressing the lights to the wall. Work around your home in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction and be sure not to skip any lights along the way."

      "content": "Purchase plastic clips or hooks. Head to a home hardware store or visit an online supplier and purchase plastic light hooks or clips. If you want to connect your lights directly to the gutter edges, purchase simple hooks. If you want to clip your lights tighter—which is ideal for rope lights or icicle lights that don't have bulbs—purchase clip types. Clip types also attach over the edge of the gutter. [11] X Research source Make sure there are enough clips or hooks for the length of your lights."

For areas that don't have gutters, fasten it to the shingle or drip edge—just be careful not to lift the shingle and break its bond to the shingle below it.
