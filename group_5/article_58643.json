      "content": "Those in a private relationship don’t share all the relationship details. Privacy is key in private relationships. The world may know two people are together, but the couple keeps intimate details close to their chests. The ins and outs of the relationship aren’t shared on social media but are reserved for each other and close friends. Basically, what happens in a private relationship stays in the relationship. Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn, Tom Holland and Zendaya, and Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer have or had a private relationship, for example. [1] X Research source One of the leading pros of a private relationship is that there’s less pressure. Couples don’t need to worry about what other people think and can focus on themselves. Some view private relationships in a negative light, highlighting the most common con of secrecy. Their defense: if no one else is involved in the relationship, is it really a relationship?"

      "content": "You don’t have to worry about pleasing everyone. Not everyone will always agree with your life choices, and that’s okay! Private relationships are a great way to explore your romantic options without stressing about what your mom or grandma may think. Your opinion and expectations for yourself are all that matter. [5] X Research source Your relationship doesn’t have to be a secret—share it with others when you feel the time is right (just remember to keep those intimate details to yourself)."

      "content": "You can make choices without the influence of others. Sometimes you can feel pressured to make choices in a relationship. Maybe your mom doesn’t like your boyfriend’s long hair, or your friend thinks your girlfriend isn’t good enough for you. Minimize these pressures and the drama with a private relationship, as you'll only share what you want to share. Focus on what you want in the relationship and try to drown out any background noise. It’s your life, after all!"

      "content": "You can end things more easily. We know thinking about breaking up may sound counterintuitive, especially if you just started dating, but easier breakups are a perk of private relationships. Because the public doesn’t know the ins and outs of your relationship, breakup explanations can be vague. Maybe you’re “on a break” or weren’t the right fit for each other. If the time comes, you can agree on what can be said to protect yourselves emotionally. [6] X Research source Think of it this way: if no one knows the details of the relationship, there’s no need to bug you for details about the breakup."

      "title": "Keep your relationship off social media.",
      "content": "Keep your relationship off social media. The number one rule of a private relationship: don’t post about it online. An occasional photo or comment is acceptable, but religiously sharing intimate details and photos is a red flag. It’s okay to say you’re with someone, but it’s a big no-no to post about every moment you have together. [7] X Research source Do you post about your partner on social media a lot? If so, you’re most likely not in a private relationship. Ask your partner about posting a picture or update about them first. This way, you’ll both know what you’re sharing with the world."

      "title": "Talk to your partner about what you want to share with others.",
      "content": "Talk to your partner about what you want to share with others. Privacy is what makes a private relationship private. Before you share intimate details with friends, family members, or followers, have a conversation with your partner. Be open and honest with each other about what you want to keep between the two of you. This way, you’ll both be on the same page. For instance, financial struggles, family secrets, sex life details, and disagreements may be off the table when it comes to sharing."

Connect emotionally and set clear boundaries with one another. What can you do for each other as a couple to strengthen the relationship? Here are some examples of healthy boundaries: [8] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

      "title": "Secret relationships are hidden from the world, while private relationships aren’t.",
      "content": "Secret relationships are hidden from the world, while private relationships aren’t. The 2 terms may sound similar, but they’re actually quite different. In a secret relationship, nobody is aware the relationship exists. In a private relationship, the relationship may be well known, but the intimate details of it are hidden. [9] X Research source Think of it this way: someone in a private relationship may say, “That’s my girlfriend/boyfriend” in public, while someone in a secret relationship won’t. Secret relationships involve consistent lying (often causing harm to both parties), whereas private relationships withhold specific details from the public eye. Private relationships can quickly turn into secret relationships and vice versa. A secret relationship usually develops because at least one member is engaging in infidelity. Signs of a secret relationship may include being possessive of one’s phone or making up phony excuses to be out of the house for long hours. Reader Poll: We asked 367 wikiHow readers and 65% of them said that they’ll suspect a person of being unfaithful if they’re frequently checking their phone or being secretive about communication .
