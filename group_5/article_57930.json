      "content": "If your application is chosen, you’ll have an interview and/or home visit. If Queer Eye ’s casting producer likes your email or video submission, they’ll invite you to a phone interview. If they are still interested in you or your nominee after that interview, they’ll visit your nominee’s home to meet them in person and learn more about their story. [2] X Research source The production team will film the home visit to see how everyone interacts on camera, and then they’ll send the footage to the network for final approval. After this process is complete, you should hear back from the Queer Eye team about whether or not you and your nominee will appear on the show."

      "content": "Netflix looks for heroes who have a relatable story to share. Netflix tends to cast individuals who have an inspiring or heartwarming story to tell—if your nominee has a story like that, share it in your initial application. The Queer Eye casting directors also look for “heroes” who the audience can relate to and root for, so someone who’s very kind, lovable, and easy to be around is a great candidate. [3] X Research source To demonstrate that your nominee has these qualities, talk about their personality and impact in your application. Stress how they make other people feel and how they put the needs of others above their own—which is why they deserve this special moment for themselves. Queer Eye also likes to highlight different parts of the city they’re filming in and represent people from different neighborhoods. You may want to add more information about where your nominee grew up and any community connections that they have."

However, the casting process is likely ongoing—meaning you can still apply or nominate someone even if your city isn’t scheduled for an upcoming season.
