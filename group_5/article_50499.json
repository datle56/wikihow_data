      "content": "Do a spot test first to see how your skin reacts. If you think your skin is sensitive, dab a little witch hazel on 1 side of your jaw line. Wait 5 to 10 minutes to see if your skin reacts. Witch hazel usually works best for oily skin because witch hazel is an astringent. If your skin reacts, you may notice red, irritated skin or a rash develop. Avoid using witch hazel if you have a reaction to the spot test. Since research is needed to determine if witch hazel is safe to use while pregnant, you should avoid using it if you are pregnant."
