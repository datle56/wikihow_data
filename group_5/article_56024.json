      "content": "Install the trim so that it buts up against the tops and sides of the doors, and surrounds each window frame. Nail it at 12 inch (30.48cm), increments. When installing the trim at the windows, start at the bottom, then move to the sides and install the top portion last. This will help control water flow and prevent leakage. Each sheet of siding has a nail strip at the top. Attach the siding to the wall with a nail in each section of the nail strip. Siding is intended to hang from the nails, not to be nailed flat."
