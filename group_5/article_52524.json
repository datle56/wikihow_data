      "title": "Remove the gearbox from the gun.",
      "content": "Remove the gearbox from the gun. Every gun is different, but you should be able to get to the internals by popping out pins and screws that keep the body halves together. Make sure you keep the screws. Once the body is separated, you should see a large metal piece that would have some wires running into it. This piece is the gearbox. There may be some screws holding the gearbox down, if so you can remove them. Remove the gearbox from the gun by lifting the gearbox and the motor (a cube like structure likely located in the pistol grip). Set them aside and move the body out of the way."

Make sure you keep the buffer-tube/spring-guide. The bevel gear. This is the gear the will be closest to you. The piston system. The other two gears. The trigger and trigger spring. You will need to keep these and the trigger screws for later on. The trigger contacts and wiring. Anything else left in the gearbox."
