[9] X Research source If you have long hair, consider getting a trim before you head back to school. It will help your hair grow faster, and your haircut will look fresh and stylish on the first day of school. If you have short hair, use some water to tamp down any bedhead before you go to school."

Secure that side with a hair tie, then do the other side! [11] X Research source French braiding can be tricky at first, but it gets easier as you do it more.
