      "title": "P0430 indicates your catalytic converter is underperforming.",
      "content": "P0430 indicates your catalytic converter is underperforming. The catalytic converter is responsible for neutralizing any noxious or dangerous fumes created by your engine. The converter is designed to absorb at least 95% of the fumes the engine generates. If an oxygen sensor detects your converter has fallen below that 95% threshold, the P0430 error will appear. It’ll read, “Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 2).” [1] X Research source You’ll get the P0430 error regardless of whether your converter is operating at 80% efficiency or 5% efficiency. In other words, this could be a huge issue with the converter, a smaller problem, or something in between. As an aside, P0430 errors are recorded by the sensors connected to engine bank #2. In V6 and V8 engines, there are two banks—one for each column of sensors. So, if the oxygen sensor itself ends up being at fault, it’s the #2 bank oxygen sensor. P0420 is the same thing as P0430, except the error is in bank #1, not bank #2."

      "title": "Exhaust leak",
      "content": "Exhaust leak The exhaust system refers to all of the pipes and valves that run from your engine to the exhaust pipe. If there’s a gap or opening in any exhaust pipe or valve, you’ve got an exhaust leak and noxious fumes are escaping your vehicle. [2] X Research source Potential additional symptoms: Your gas mileage is worse than it normally is, you hear odd noises coming from your vehicle as air escapes the exhaust system, or your gas pedal vibrates or rumbles."

      "title": "Failed A/F heater oxygen sensor",
      "content": "Failed A/F heater oxygen sensor The A/F (air/fuel) heater oxygen sensor (also known as the A/F ratio sensor or just “oxygen sensor”) measures the air-fuel ratio in the exhaust system (the “heater” part refers to the fact that the sensor has a heating element). If this sensor fails or comes loose, it will send bad data to your vehicle’s central computer. As a result, your vehicle will think the catalytic converter isn’t working correctly. [3] X Research source Just FYI, your vehicle has dozens of oxygen sensors throughout the vehicle. The A/F heater sensor is the essential sensor for the P0430 code, though. Each engine bank has its own A/F heater oxygen sensor. For P0430, you’re only concerned with the sensor for bank #2. Potential additional symptoms: Your check engine light comes on, you get poor engine performance, you have black smoke coming from your vehicle, or you smell something burning in your engine bay."

      "title": "Bad catalytic converter",
      "content": "Bad catalytic converter The catalytic converter could simply be clogged, damaged, or failing. The converter contains a ceramic grid full of raw minerals that absorb and capture toxic fumes. Converters can become clogged or lose their efficacy over time, so it’s possible that the catalytic converter itself is to blame. Check to make sure your catalytic converter is actually there. Converters are expensive because they’re filled with pricey rare earth minerals, so they’re a common target for thieves. Potential additional symptoms: You smell rotten eggs when your car is running, the check engine light is on, it feels like your vehicle is producing more heat than normal, and your car idles rough."

      "title": "Engine issues",
      "content": "Engine issues It could be that your exhaust system is working perfectly fine but your engine is simply malfunctioning and generating more toxic fumes than it’s supposed to. If your catalytic converter is being overrun by the engine’s byproducts, your vehicle’s central computer may think the catalytic converter is to blame—not the engine. A bad spark plug is often the culprit here. If a spark plug isn’t firing, it’s not heating the fuel in the combustion chamber where it’s located. This can cause unburnt fuel to flood your emissions system. Potential additional symptoms: You’ll likely get a check engine light. Then, you may notice engine knocking, rough idling, trouble accelerating, or poor gas mileage."

      "title": "Normally, you won’t notice any symptoms anything is wrong.",
      "content": "Normally, you won’t notice any symptoms anything is wrong. Since the P0430 error code appears any time the emissions system falls below the 95% efficacy threshold, and you likely won’t get serious symptoms when the emissions system is only barely below that threshold, it’s common for there to be no additional symptoms. You’ll likely only notice something is wrong if the catalytic converter has failed or is on the verge of failing. [4] X Research source If the exhaust system is on the verge of failing, you’ll probably notice poor engine performance, bad gas mileage, rotten egg smells, or dashboard warning lights."

      "title": "Replace any cracked or rusted exhaust lines.",
      "content": "Replace any cracked or rusted exhaust lines. If you are a gearhead, get under the vehicle and follow the pipes back from the catalytic converter to the engine bay with a flashlight. Look for visible damage or rust. If you locate any tears or openings, raise your car in jacks and disassemble your exhaust system. Start at the catalytic converter, then unfasten the gaskets and pipes until you reach the damage. Replace the damaged component and reassemble everything. [5] X Research source If you aren’t a gearhead, just go to a mechanic. This is a relatively complex task for a first-timer. Expect to spend $150-500 if you hire a pro to do this for you."

      "title": "Check the oxygen sensor in bank 2 to see if it’s disconnected.",
      "content": "Check the oxygen sensor in bank 2 to see if it’s disconnected. It’s actually pretty rare that the A/F heater oxygen sensor fails (it’s designed to withstand engine heat, so it’s a very hardy sensor). However, it can come loose. [6] X Research source With a cold car, pop your hood and look on the driver’s side of the engine. Locate your exhaust manifold and look for a cable (usually near the bottom of the engine bay). Inspect this cable’s connection and reinsert it if it’s loose. [7] X Research source If this cable isn’t loose, it’s possible that something is wrong with your oxygen sensor’s calibration. This is also relatively rare, though. It’s more likely that the sensors aren’t to blame. If you do need a new sensor, have a licensed mechanic wire it and hook it up. It may cost $350-600 depending on the complexity of your engine bay."

      "title": "Replace your catalytic converter if it’s bad.",
      "content": "Replace your catalytic converter if it’s bad. If the catalytic converter is clogged, damaged, failing, or stolen, you need a new one. Since converters contain all kinds of potentially dangerous minerals, leave this up to a pro. See a mechanic to have the converter installed. [8] X Research source Unfortunately, catalytic converters can be kind of expensive. You may need to pay anywhere from $1,000-2,500 for a new converter."

      "title": "No, it’s not safe for your car or the environment.",
      "content": "No, it’s not safe for your car or the environment. You may not do very much harm if your catalytic converter is only operating slightly below that 95% threshold, but it’s not worth rolling the dice. Driving with an inefficient emissions system can do serious damage to your car’s engine which could lead to even more expensive repairs. Beyond that, it’s simply bad for your health and bad for the environment to emit your vehicle’s noxious fumes into the air. [9] X Research source It’s often not legal to drive without a functioning emissions system, too. If your car is emitting toxic fumes, you may get a ticket or have your car impounded."
