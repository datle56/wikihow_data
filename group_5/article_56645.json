      "content": "Choose a large litter box. A common cause of cats engaging in inappropriate elimination is that the litter box is too small for the cat. [2] X Research source This is particularly important if your cat is still growing; a litter box that's on the snug side now may be far too small for his liking in a few months. [3] X Research source When choosing a size for your cat's litter box, it's generally best to err on the side of caution and get a bigger litter box. Your cat will feel like he has more room, and he will be less likely to think it's too full too quickly. If your cat is small or elderly, choose a box with low sides so that he will be able to enter and exit the litter box without difficulty.

      "content": "Decide on covered or uncovered. Covered and uncovered litter boxes both have their advantages and disadvantages. Some cats have a preference, while others don't. You may want to try both and see type of box your cat prefers. The biggest advantage to a covered litter box is privacy, which some cats value. Having a cover may also help deter a dog from eating out of the litter box, if that is a risk in your home. Covered litter boxes do tend to trap odors inside the chamber, which can make a dirty litter box more even more unappealing to your cat. If your cat is very large, he may have a hard time turning around inside the box or digging in the litter. Experts may also recommend uncovered boxes for multi-cat households. Cats may feel nervous about being ambushed coming out of the litter box when they canâ€™t see out beyond the exit route.

      "content": "Find a good location. Cats have a natural instinct to bury their wastes, but if the litter box is inaccessible, your cat may look for other locations to relieve himself. Choosing the right spot for your cat may take a little trial and error, but in general there are some common points to consider when choosing a location. Make it accessible and convenient. Your cat won't want to go searching on a long trek when he needs to relieve himself, so make it easy for him to get to the litter box from most places within your home. [9] X Research source Do not set up a litter box near where you give your cat his food and water. Cats view their feeding area as a sort of home within the home, and their natural instinct is to urinate and defecate away from that space. Setting up a litter box near your cat's food and water bowls can make him anxious and increase the likelihood that he will have out of box eliminations. [10] X Research source Give your cat some peace and quiet. Most cats want a quiet, undisturbed place to eliminate wastes. If you place your cat's litter box in a noisy, high-traffic area (like a laundry room or in the family room), there's a good chance your cat won't want to relieve himself in the litter box due to its location. Give him a quiet, low-traffic area that's still accessible and easy to find. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the right litter . Cats generally prefer clumping litter, as it's more comfortable to walk on and makes it easier for your cat to bury his wastes. It will also make it easier for you to scoop and clean your cat's waste out of the litter box if you use clumping litter. Some cats prefer unscented litter. The Humane Society cautions against using litter with perfume or deodorizer added to it, as this may irritate your cat or trigger an allergic reaction.

But failing to use enough litter could make your cat feel as though he can't bury his waste, causing him to eliminate outside the box. A litter box with insufficient litter can also create odor problems, and could make cleaning a bit more work-intensive. [13] X Research source Some experts recommend filling the litter box with about two inches (5.08 cm) of litter.

If you're raising a kitten or a cat that is still learning to use the litter box, you may want to leave a very small amount of liquid or solid wastes for the first few weeks as a reminder to your cat of where he should eliminate. [17] X Research source Once your cat has sufficiently learned where to eliminate, however, you should keep a clean litter box. In fact, a dirty litter box is one of the most common causes of cats eliminating outside the box. Scoop out solid and clumped-liquid wastes on a daily basis. Some experts recommend scooping twice daily to keep the litter box as clean as possible. [18] X Research source Do a full wash of the litter box once every week. Use warm water and a gentle soap; never use harsh chemicals, as these may leave residual chemicals or smells that might harm your cat or deter him from using the box.

That doesn't mean actually using the litter box yourself; rather, you'll have to carry him to the litter box when he's about to eliminate, and teach him how to dig in the litter. [24] X Research source Use a finger to scrape some litter aside until he learns by example. If your cat eliminates in the box but hasn't learned to bury it, use your finger to scoop a little litter on top of his waste. It will take time, but eventually he'll understand that you expect him to learn these behaviors. [25] X Research source When showing your cat how to dig and bury his waste, it's important that you use your own finger.

One of the early signs of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), as well as kidney and bladder stones, is blood in the urine and frequent or prolonged efforts at urinating. Other symptoms to watch for include crying out while urinating and excessive licking/cleaning of the genitals. If your cat is experiencing any of these symptoms, it's important that you take him to a vet as soon as possible. Leaving these conditions untreated may lead to a blocked urethra, which can be fatal. In addition to the general examination, your vet will most likely run a urinalysis, and may also run a urine culture and order x-rays to determine the cause and location of your cat's problem. Your vet will most likely prescribe some type of medicinal treatment for kidney stones. If the vet determines that your cat has bladder stones, he will most likely require surgery to either remove the stones or break them apart inside the bladder to facilitate their passage. If your cat has suffered from urinary tract problems or bladder/kidney stones, he may not be getting enough water. Always ensure that your cat has access to fresh water (changed daily). Your vet may also recommend that you give your cat wet (canned) food at least 50% of the time."

The most common symptoms of IBD include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and lethargic tendencies. Some cats with IBD also experience bloody stool. Symptoms can vary depending on what part of the gastrointestinal tract is affected. If your cat suffers from any of these symptoms, you should take him in to see a vet as soon as possible. Your vet will most likely run blood work and fecal examinations to determine if the symptoms are caused by IBD. In addition, your vet may also need to use a radiograph and/or ultrasound to determine the location of your cat's affliction. To treat IBD, your vet may prescribe your cat corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and immune system response to the IBD. Depending on the severity of your cat's IBD, your vet may also recommend a course of antibiotics. Your vet may recommend dietary changes to better accommodate your cat's IBD. Common dietary requirements for cats with IBD include hypoallergenic cat food, as well as foods that are high in fiber and low in fat."
