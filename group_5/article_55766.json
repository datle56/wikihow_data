      "content": "This will give you a little time to get to know each other. If you’ve just made an exciting new match, it can be tempting to try to arrange a meeting right away. However, most dating experts recommend taking a little time to chat and establish trust before you jump right in. Spend a few days getting a feel for their personality and interests and building some chemistry before you take the next step. [1] X Research source To get a sense of what your potential date is like, try to have at least a couple of meaningful conversations that go beyond just small talk. For example, you might talk about things like your career and family goals, your core beliefs and values, or hobbies that are important to you."

      "content": "The spark might fizzle if you drag it out too long. While it’s a good idea to get to know your match a bit before meeting them, don’t overdo it. If possible, schedule a meeting with them within the next 1-2 weeks after you start talking. Even if you can’t actually meet that soon, at least have the conversation within that timeframe and try to set a definite plan to meet up when you can. [2] X Research source For instance, you might agree to meet up in a few weeks. Set a specific time and date. Say something like, “Let’s grab coffee at 1:30 on the 20th.” Avoid making vague plans, like, “Let’s meet up next month!” Another good reason to avoid chatting over text for too long before meeting is that it can start to skew your expectations of the other person. You can only get to know someone so well without actually speaking to them face-to-face. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "This is a good way to establish trust before meeting. While you don’t have to have a video chat with your match before you meet, it’s a good idea. Not only will it give you a better sense of whether you have real chemistry with them, but it will also help you spot any possible red flags you might have missed over text. [4] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source If your match refuses to video chat with you before meeting in person, be careful. This can be a sign that they’re not who they claim to be. Bumble offers built-in video chat and voice call features to make it easier to connect with your matches. Once you’ve made a match and started a conversation, look for video camera and phone icons to appear in the top right corner of the screen. Press the video icon to start a video chat, or the phone icon if you’d rather do a voice call. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "There are no set rules about how soon to meet. While dating experts recommend meeting sooner rather than later, every situation is different. If you’d rather take more time getting to know the person, that’s also okay. [6] X Research source Keep your individual circumstances in mind as well. For instance, you might both have very busy schedules, or you may need to delay getting together due to COVID safety concerns. If life gets in the way, don’t sweat it—just try to schedule something for whenever you can. Just be aware that your match might move on if you keep delaying a meet-up indefinitely, so try to be clear about your intentions if you’re interested, but not ready just yet."

      "content": "Your match may not be ready to meet up, even if you are. If they’re not feeling it yet, be patient and don’t try to push them into anything they aren’t comfortable with. If you’re still really interested, give them a little more time to get to know you before bringing it up again. [7] X Research source It’s also totally okay to move on if you don’t want to keep waiting. Say something like, “Hey, it’s been great chatting with you, but I don’t feel like things are really going anywhere with us. Best of luck finding the right person for you!”"

      "content": "Before you meet up, consider whether you feel safe. If someone you match with on Bumble is giving you a sketchy vibe, trust your instincts. Be very careful—or don’t meet up with them at all—if you notice any major warning signs. For example, be cautious of Bumble users who: [8] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source Ask for money (which is also against Bumble’s rules). [9] X Research source Suddenly disappear from the app, then reappear shortly after that with a new profile. Give only vague or evasive answers to your questions. Pressure you to do things you’re not comfortable with, such as giving them your phone number or meeting in person before you’re ready. Send sexual or overly romantic messages before you’ve had a chance to get to know each other. Ask for your home or work address, often with the excuse that they want to send you flowers or a gift. Make threats or insult you if you don’t do what they want."
