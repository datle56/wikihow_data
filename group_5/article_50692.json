      "content": "Cut down on laundry and panty lines at the same time! If your workout gear is thicker, forgo the underwear all together to workout care-free. Try using a pantie liner in your work out pants or leggings - there are some designed for use during sports or work outs. [1] X Research source Going commando can leave you susceptible to camel toe, especially if you’re wearing tight leggings. Try walking around in your home before you head out to make sure everything stays in place. Try to wear workout gear that gives you a lot of coverage if you’re going to work out without underwear. Sheer bottoms can lead to a fashion disaster at the gym if you aren’t careful."

      "content": "A g-string uses way less fabric than a traditional thong. Buy a G-string (it’s a triangle of fabric connected by two strings) and wear it under your workout gear to avoid any panty lines at all.

[5] X Research source Synthetic materials, like nylon and Spandex, will be more seamless than cotton. Go for a nude-colored pair if you’re worried about them showing through your workout gear, or match them to your workout gear if you're wearing black or white unattended workout leggings or pants. This is a great choice for leggings that are a little too see-through for your liking, since they provide a bit of extra coverage."
