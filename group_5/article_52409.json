Some VoIP phones offer an Ethernet pass-through option. This allows you to connect another device, such as a computer, to your phone so that you only need to use one port on your router to connect two devices. If you wish to use this option, connect your computer's Ethernet cable to the port on the base station that says \"PC\" or something similar. Connect the Ethernet cable that came with your phone to the port that says \"SW\", \"switch\", \"Internet\" or something similar. [1] X Research source"
