      "content": "A Scorpio guy is unlikely to come over to you first. The two of you can steal glances at each other across a crowded room for hours, but he expects you to come to him. As an outgoing Libra, you shouldn't have any problem with this—just be your fun, friendly self. He's not shy, but he is introverted. At a party or event, he's content to sit in the background and observe everyone else. With his \"bad boy\" reputation, a Scorpio can be a bit intimidating. Don't worry, though—although he is intense, deep down he's emotional and super sensitive."

      "content": "The intelligent Scorpion is an engaging conversationalist. Since Libra women are known for having the gift of gab, the two of you will thrive.

[1] X Research source If you have any interest in the occult or paranormal phenomenon, you might bring it up—Scorpio guys tend to gravitate toward these topics.

      "title": "A Scorpio likes to learn about people slowly.",
      "content": "A Scorpio likes to learn about people slowly. Since, as a Libra, you tend to be an open book, this might be a bit of a challenge for you. Just think of it as a way to capture his interest—tell him something general about yourself, then let him tease out the details. For example, if he asks about your favorite bands, you might list one or two rather than telling him every band you like. Let the others come up organically in conversation. Staying calm is another way to add a little air of mystery. He'll wonder what you're thinking and feeling if you don't wear your emotions on your sleeve. Although a little mystery at first is a good thing, be careful about keeping secrets from a Scorpio. He's slow to trust and can easily get suspicious if he feels like you're hiding something from him."

      "content": "Scorpio guys love games of strategy and you both enjoy taking risks. The drama and suspense of going head-to-head in a game of Hold 'Em have the potential to heat things up for both of you. He'll love the opportunity to carry out secret plots and you'll be thrilled with the playful banter and the chance to charm him out of his chips. Keep in mind that Scorpios can be very competitive. That's not to say that you should let him win, but don't be surprised if he's a sore loser."

      "content": "Both of you love spoiling yourself with beautiful things. Libra ladies tend to view shopping as a sort of bonding experience. Since you both enjoy shopping, use the opportunity to learn more about each other. Scorpios don't tend to broadcast what they like and don't like, so it also gives you some insight into his taste and what draws his eye. Scorpio guys also tend to have a pretty keen fashion sense, so if you need to find an outfit for a special occasion, take him along as your stylist. Don't be surprised if he's better at dressing you than you are!"

      "content": "A Scorpio is a born leader who feels more comfortable being in control. Libra ladies aren't typically the take-charge type, so this shouldn't be too big of a deal for you. If you put him in the driver's seat, he'll make sure you both have a great time and he'll be more relaxed. Scorpios are pretty introverted, so don't be surprised if he plans more private dates. He'd rather cuddle on the couch and watch a movie than go out to a busy dance club. If you're feeling more social—Libras do tend to be pretty extroverted—just let him know that you'd like to go out. He'll find a venue where he'll be comfortable and you have the chance to mingle."

Together, you can see all sides of a problem and work quickly to find a solution. [2] X Research source For example, you might decide to build a piece of furniture or work on a jigsaw puzzle.

With your focus on harmony and balance, you'll be sure to find the right niche working together."

      "content": "Scorpio guys can be stubborn and intense at times. Because you have a lot of differences, you might end up butting heads from time to time. Fortunately, Libra ladies are known for their ability to find fair solutions to problems. Focus on your desire for balance and everything will work out well. For example, if you want to go out to a party and he wants to stay in, you might suggest that the two of you can go to the party for an hour and then come home for some alone time together. As intense as he is, a Scorpio typically tends to avoid conflict. The problem is that he does this by pushing down his feelings, which can make an outburst seem bigger than it really is."

      "content": "A Scorpio guy is cautious and not likely to rush into anything. Scorpions are also pretty slow to trust, which means he's not going to want to get serious very fast. As a Libra, you tend to be pretty cautious yourself, so this shouldn't be too hard for you to deal with. Just try to have patience if he wants to draw things out longer than you'd prefer. Scorpio guys are really emotional, but they tend to keep their emotions close to their chest and might not let you in right away. This can be frustrating for you since Libras tend to be pretty open. If you're gentle and don't push him, he'll come around. He just needs to know that he can feel safe with you."

[3] X Research source Since the typical Libra lady is on the hunt for her soulmate, you can definitely understand this drive. All that's left is for you to prove to him how hopelessly devoted you are to him. He'll come to trust you and never want to leave your side. Trust is extremely important if you have your eyes on a long-term romance. Scorpions tend to be pretty possessive, but he'll mellow out if he feels comfortable with you and knows he can trust you."
