      "content": "Listen to the way the call ends. If the call ends after one ring (or, in some cases, half of a ring) and you are diverted to voicemail , you are either blocked or your contact's phone is dead. [2] X Research source If the phone immediately hangs up or beeps rapidly, then either the line is busy or the contact blocked you through their carrier. If the phone gives the error \"Your call could not be completed as dialed\", they could have changed their number or blocked you through your carrier. Of course, if the contact answers your call , you haven't been blocked."

      "title": "Call your contact again to confirm.",
      "content": "Call your contact again to confirm. Sometimes a call will divert to voicemail even if the line is clear and your phone unblocked; calling again will confirm the call's ending. If your call still ends after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is definitively dead or blocking your calls."

      "content": "Call your contact back with a masked number. You can do this by typing \"*67\" before their phone number. While you can't feasibly expect anyone to pick up a call from a restricted number, calling in this way will verify the contact's phone status: [3] X Research source If the call goes through like usual--e.g., five or more rings--then your contact has blocked your number. If the call still stops after a ring or less and diverts to voicemail, your contact's phone is dead."

      "title": "Ask a friend to call your contact's number.",
      "content": "Ask a friend to call your contact's number. If you've determined that you're blocked but would like verbal confirmation, you can ask a friend to call your contact and talk to them about the situation . Keep in mind that, as tempting as this may be, doing so might harm your friend's relationship with the contact who blocked you. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Understand the potential consequences.",
      "content": "Understand the potential consequences. If you were blocked in error, then the person probably won't be unhappy to hear from you. But it could be considered harassment for you to attempt to work around a block that somebody enacted to put distance between you and them. Be wary of the legality of disregarding a block in your region before proceeding."

      "title": "Mask your phone number.",
      "content": "Mask your phone number. You can do this by typing \"*67\" before the phone number you're trying to call; this will result in your call showing up as an unidentified number. [5] X Research source Most people won't pick up if they see a \"Restricted\" or \"Unknown\" number calling them; this is because telemarketers often use this tactic to reach numbers on the do-not-call list."

      "content": "Attempt to get in touch via social media. If you absolutely have to get into contact with someone who has blocked you, you can email them or message them from various social media accounts. Again, consider your urgency here: if you're simply upset because they blocked you, it's best to leave the situation alone until both you and your contact have cooled off a bit."
