      "content": "Lovers typically know you more intimately than friends. A friend is simply someone you enjoy sharing time and mutual affection with, but being in a romantic relationship often involves more commitment from both people. A lover usually knows more about you than a friend, and is more invested in your life. They also tend to make sacrifices to be with you or support you. Also, lovers are often physically intimate, doing things like kissing, having sex, or other physical things that friends don’t. [1] X Research source When you’re just friends, you might call your relationship “ platonic ” instead of “romantic.” That said, there are tons of exceptions. Sometimes, for example, a friend might know you better than any lover ever could."

      "content": "Sometimes, the two aren’t very different at all. Ultimately, these are just labels we’ve made to describe a relationship, but labels are always shifting and changing. Your friends are sometimes your lovers, and your lovers are often your friends. There’s nothing a lover does that a friend doesn’t (depending on your relationship), so it’s hard to find a definition that separates the two. Still, it can be useful to tell if someone is either a friend or lover. Knowing this can help you decide on what direction you want the relationship to go."

It’s the easiest way to find out, and leaves no room for confusion. Don’t be afraid to roll out the “What are we?” line. Either you’ll get a direct answer, or you’ll discover that the other person isn’t sure either, which is an opportunity to talk it out and clarify things."

[3] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 2 April 2021. Do they use words that connote affection and emotion? Do they call you their boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner? Do they call hanging out with you a “date?” If they use the same language you’d use to describe a romantic partner, then it’s probably a romance. Also listen to the tone of their voice. If it becomes gentle, husky, or smooth, they may be acting romantic. If it’s more casual or joking, you may be just friends. Saying, “I love you,” isn’t necessarily evidence one way or another. Friends and family also say this to each other. But if the context is right—you’re on a date, holding hands, etc.—it could be romantic."

      "content": "Ask yourself if they’re always talking about romantic subjects. It’s not just the words you use together, but what you talk about, too. Romantic partners often talk about making a future together, or whether or not they want children. [4] X Research source You might also talk about sharing finances, the nature of love, or what a healthy romance looks like. These all suggest that you’re lovers, not friends. On the other hand, if your conversations stay casual, or have nothing to do with things like romance, sex, or long-term relationships, it might be a just-friends situation. If they often talk to you about their other romantic relationships, they might see you as more of a trusted friend, rather than lover material."

      "content": "Look for flirtatious or intense eye contact. Almost everyone makes eye contact, but not all eye contact is the same. A good friend probably looks you in the eye with an easygoing smile. A lover, though, might flirt by batting their eyelashes at you, leaning forward, or smiling coyly while they make eye contact . Be aware that this is very individual to the person's personality type. Some people just make intense eye contact, and it doesn’t mean much. Someone who’s really into you might also be shy about eye contact, and blush or act bashful during a conversation."

Friends often high five, hug, or pat each other on the back, while lovers do things like hold hands or give lingering touches on places like the thigh or the arm. And a kiss on the lips, of course, suggests romance. Friends often give short, tight hugs. Lovers often give longer, more gentle hugs. A lover might also flirt by running their hand through your hair, caressing your face, or even by playing footsie. Lovers are usually more comfortable being in each others’ personal space, and for longer periods of time, while friends are usually a little more aware of personal space. Ultimately, touches between friends are often much more casual, while touches from a lover are more tender and intentional."

Someone who’s into you will likely have open body language, while someone who’s keeping it platonic will sometimes have more closed body language. Here are examples and cues to look for: [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Open body language: Their feet point toward you and not away, their body faces you or leans toward you, there’s not much space between you, they make strong eye contact, and they don’t cross their arms. Closed body language: Their feet point away from you, they tilt their body away, there’s lots of space between you, they make shifting eye contact, they keep their hands down, and they fold their arms."

[8] X Research source Casual friends talk regularly, and good friends talk all the time. Lovers, though, tend to communicate the most, telling each other about their day and spilling each and every thought. How often do you think about this person? Can you ignore them or do you have to text back ASAP? Are they the first person you go to with big news, and do they do the same with you?"

But also observe their behavior while they’re with you: For example, if they tease all their other friends but act very respectful toward you, you may be a lover. The opposite is also true—they might tease you a lot, but not their other friends. They might offer to pay for your meal, but nobody else’s. Or, they might make excuses to get you alone, apart from the others."

Don’t fall for the trap of assuming sex means you’re in the lover role—you could still be friends with benefits, or a fling, rather than lovers. [10] X Research source However, sexuality is a component of most relationships that move from friend to lover, so consider the following: If you have casual sex but stay away from deep or emotional topics, you’re probably just a friend with benefits. If sex is accompanied by dates, deep conversations, or other romantic gestures, it could be more. A friend is someone with whom we have fun and can share our deepest secrets with if we're really close with them; they are someone we go to the movies with or watch a sports game together. A lover is often just the same, only with an added sexual layer to the relationship, and an overall greater intensity."

If it’s just a casual friendship, you probably won’t rely on them for things like deep emotional support. If it’s romance, though, they’re more likely to drop everything and come running when you need them. If they’re not into you, they might flake on plans or treat your time together more casually."

If you tried to make a venn diagram of things lovers do versus things friends do, there’d probably be a whole lot of overlap. Not every relationship needs a strict label, and sometimes the best thing to do is enjoy it and see what happens. [12] X Research source Sometimes it may happen that a good friend becomes a lover and can become a very good life partner also. Lovers can also turn back into just friends. It might be more helpful to ask yourself why the distinction even matters. While society has categories for varying levels of emotional and physical intimacy, they are just that: categories. Those categories can easily change or not apply to everyone."
