      "content": "Ceres symbolizes fertility, feminine energy, and how you nurture yourself. [1] X Research source Your Ceres placement describes how you care for and protect yourself physically (through things like food and activities) and spiritually (through your relationships or family). It has strong connections to motherhood and caregiving, and those with strong Ceres placements are attentive and loving. The asteroid is named after the Roman goddess Ceres who oversaw agriculture, the harvest, and motherly relationships. Ceres’ energy is simple and understated compared to that of the planets. Caregiving, teaching, cooking, gardening, farming, and the environment are all associated with Ceres. There is debate about which zodiac sign Ceres rules. Many astrologers agree it co-rules Taurus and the Second House , while others argue that it co-rules Virgo or Cancer. [2] X Research source Glyph: A sickle placed over a cross. Symbol: A sheaf of wheat or a torch."

For example, having Ceres in a practical, sensual earth sign might mean you show care and affection through food, physical comfort, pragmatic help with something."

      "content": "Your Ceres house shows what area of life your nurturing nature appears in. The house is especially important when it comes to understanding your relationship with your parents and how you prefer to be a parent yourself. Your Ceres house speaks to how you can be loving, strong, and helpful to yourself or those you care about: [4] X Research source 1st house : Your caregiving instincts are a core part of your identity. You’re grounded and others often come to you for help (just remember to help yourself, too). 2nd house : You may need a caregiver to feel safe and comfortable, and you care for others by making them feel at ease. You may value financial stability and an abundant home. 3rd house: You crave nurturing on an intellectual or mental level. Communicating and being heard are how you feel replenished, and you offer comfort to others in the same way. 4th house : You feel most secure at home in the company of your family or loved ones and may have a strong relationship with your parents.

      "content": "Note the house and zodiac sign placement of your Ceres. The house that Ceres appears in reveals which aspect of your life the asteroid’s nurturing qualities might appear. The zodiac sign indicates how you nurture and protect both yourself and your loved ones. For example: Say your Ceres is in Gemini in the fifth house (the house of self-expression and pleasure). Your self-nurturing may manifest through Gemini’s talkative, communicative nature, especially in creative or fun areas of your life that allow you to express yourself."

      "title": "Look for favorable aspects to your Sun, Moon, or Ascendant signs.",
      "content": "Look for favorable aspects to your Sun, Moon, or Ascendant signs. In astrology, aspects are the angles the planets form with each other that influence how their energies interact. [5] X Research source If Ceres is at a favorable angle to your Sun, Moon, or Ascendant (Rising) sign—your 3 most prominent placements—then its influence is more noticeable in your life. Favorable aspects include: A conjunction: This is when Ceres is in the same sign as another planet. For example, having both Ceres and the Moon in Taurus. A sextile: This is when 2 planets are about 60 degrees apart and in compatible elements, like fire and air or earth and water (for example, Ceres in Gemini and the Sun in Leo). A trine: This is a very lucky angle (about 120 degrees) that puts 2 planets in signs of the same element (like Ceres in Capricorn and your Ascendant in Taurus). Having Ceres outside these favorable angles doesn’t mean you’re not caring or nurturing. It just means those traits may not be as dominant or obvious. Remember that Ceres is only one celestial body out of many in your chart. Other planet and asteroid placements can impact your nurturing qualities, too."

      "content": "The tale of Ceres and her daughter Proserpina explains the changing seasons. As goddess of the harvest and agriculture, Ceres was responsible for making the earth fruitful for crops. When her daughter, Proserpina, was abducted by Pluto (Hades) and taken to the Underworld, Ceres neglected the harvest and a famine ensued. [6] X Research source Jupiter (Zeus) intervened and demanded that Pluto release Proserpina. However, since she had eaten a pomegranate seed in the Underworld, Proserpina could not be totally free. Proserpina had to spend a third of each year in the Underworld, causing Ceres to be sad and the land to go barren. The rest of the year, she could live on earth and Ceres would be glad, making the land fertile again. Ceres and Proserpina are the Roman equivalents of the Greek goddesses Demeter and Persephone."

      "content": "Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Though astrologers call it an asteroid, it’s so large that scientists have labeled it a dwarf planet, like Pluto (although Pluto still has 14 times Ceres’ mass). Ceres was the first object to be discovered in the asteroid belt, first seen by astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi in 1801. [7] X Research source Ceres is the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It makes up about 25% of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Ceres also became the first dwarf planet to ever be explored by spacecraft. It was visited and photographed by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft in 2015. Unlike planets, dwarf planets are not quite massive enough to clear away other bodies in their orbit around the sun or form a perfectly spherical shape. Dwarf planets are bigger and more spherical than asteroids."
