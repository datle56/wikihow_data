      "content": "Go to the island with a race track and a dragon in the middle. If it is not there, then the event still did not start. Usually at the side of your screen, there will be an announcement for the heroic race coming soon. There will be a button which says More Info. Tap/click on it to find out more information about the heroic race, such as what the new heroic dragon will be, the prizes you'll get for each lap, etc. You will be grouped with seven other people. If you're lucky, they won't put much effort into the race, leaving you to win, even if you don't get far in the laps. But you still must reach the required lap or you will not get the heroic. Usually there will be two possible heroic dragons you can get in a race - one that has already had a race of its own before, and a new one. To get the already existing heroic dragon, reach lap 12. Laps 7, 9, and 12 will give you a puzzle piece to summon this heroic dragonâ€”you'll need three of them, so do not discard them and be careful so that you don't accidentally do so. If you get first place by the end of the race and reach lap 12, you'll get both heroic dragons. If you reach lap 15 or just win the race, you'll get the new heroic dragon. You don't have to reach lap 12 to win the race (however, you won't get the already existing heroic dragon). You also don't have to win to get this new heroic dragon - just reach lap 15 even if people still are ahead of you (the missions will get harder however as you go on with each node/lap). However, you can also win the race and get the heroic dragon if you're e.g. just at lap 3, while everyone is at lap 1."

      "title": "Get past each node by following the missions given to you.",
      "content": "Get past each node by following the missions given to you. Each node will have a certain number of missions that you'll need to complete to get specific items to complete each mission. There may be a set number of these items that you'll need to retrieve. Here are some missions you may be given for each node: If it shows you a wooden claw, it means you have to get it from winning league battles a certain number of times. It is the best to have a strong team of powerful dragons (epic, legendary, or heroic dragons you already have are good choices for a strong team). Get the number of wooden claws the mission tells you to get in order to complete it (you only get one claw per league battle that is won ). The max amount of claws the mission may tell you to collect is 6. If it shows you a blue flower, it means you have to hatch eggs to get it. Using basic dragons like terra dragons won't work - dragons that take at least 2 or 3 hours will work though, so try to get dragons like those to hatch so that you can collect the flowers as soon as possible. It also won't take long to breed dragons like these (e.g. the metal dragon). You can also just buy simple dragons that will still get you these flowers, like the metal dragon (avoid buying dragons using gems - you may need gems in the end to pass the other players). If you have multiple spaces in the hatchery, this will be easier since then you can hatch more dragons at the same time. The max amount of blue flowers the mission may tell you to collect is 5. If it shows you a pink flower, it means you have to breed dragons to get it. Again, try to breed dragons that won't take long for them to finish breeding. For example, breed two metal dragons to get another metal dragon. It won't take as long as dragons who take 47 hours to finish breeding. The max amount of pink flowers the mission may tell you to collect is 5. If it shows you a dark magenta and green blossom, it means you have to collect food. Grow food that won't take long to finish growing on all your food farms. They have to grow for at least a few hours to work though. At the same time, you'll get more food for your dragons, which applies to another mission you'll have to complete later. Make sure you have the max amount of food farms to get as many of these blossoms as possible (one blossom per food farm - also, there is a chance it will give you a blossom from a farm or that it won't, which is why you need a lot of food farms). The max amount of blossoms the mission may tell you to collect is 14. If it shows you a coin, it means you have to collect gold. This is the easiest item to collect. You should have a lot of habitats (with a lot of space for gold and high level dragons) and a lot of dragons. To get more gold, fill your habitats with the max amount of dragons and upgrade as many habitats as you can to large or extra large (to fit 5 dragons). You can't get coins from collecting small amounts of gold. At least 10,000 gold is needed, but there is a small chance of getting a coin from this amount. You won't need to spend gems to finish this mission. Usually you will get a coin when you have large amounts of gold in a habitat (30,000+). The max amount of coins the mission may tell you to collect is 24. If it shows you a blue beetle, it means you have to feed dragons. There is an easy way to complete this mission - you'll need to hatch a lot of dragons doing the race. Keep those dragons young and when you get a mission like this, feed them till they're level 8 so that you don't have to spend so much food. Then move on to the next young dragon. Also, the younger the dragon that your feeding is, the more often you'll get those blue beetles. Don't feed dragons level 8 or over - there will be a lower chance of getting a blue beetle and you'll be wasting more food. The max amount of beetles the mission may tell you to collect is 16."

      "content": "Do the daily spin. Each day of the race, you'll get a chance to spin the wheel and get something that can help you with the race. Some examples of prizes you can get from the daily spin are: Finishing a certain number of laps (the lowest chance of getting) Finishing a certain number of nodes Finishing a certain number of missions Adding a certain amount of items to a mission that is asking for those items (the highest chance of getting) Avoid using gems for the daily spin. It costs too much and you can use those gems to actually help you win the race without the daily spin (which doesn't usually help much). This will help you a long way. You must be above lap five to qualify. Each lap gives you an reward."

      "title": "Use gems if you need to.",
      "content": "Use gems if you need to. You may need gems to get to lap 15 at the last moment of the race, to get past other players, or to finish difficult missions. However, don't waste your money using gems if you're already at lap 15 or if you're already very far ahead of all the other players. Don't waste so much money on gems to try to win either - it won't be pleasant doing this if you end up losing too. You may buy small amounts of gems if you need them for up to $10, but only if you need them. Also, doing all the missions in the race will earn you gems for your piggy bank. After you save up a lot of gems, buy the piggy bank - it will cost far less than buying gems from the store. When using gems, keep in mind how you can spend the least amount as possible every time you want to spend it on something to help you in the race. This way, you can save as many gems as possible for the rest of the race. For example, if you have a mission which tells you to hatch an egg and you need to hatch 5 eggs, that's going to take a while. However, you can buy dragon eggs (which cost gold ) from the shop that will earn you these flowers and also won't take too long to hatch. The cost of speeding up the hatching of the egg may be less than the cost of just automatically gathering one flower from the mission menu. Also, every time you do automatically gather an item, the cost for gathering the next one increases, and this repeats. So it is better to hatch the eggs with gems and gather the flowers rather than buy the flowers with gems to complete the mission right away. Also, avoid completing a whole node with gems - it costs way too much and there are ways you can get around that (as explained above) to use less gems and get past the node. Sometimes you can use less gems than it requires to complete a node to finish a whole lap or two. Collect as many of the items normally and then spend gems if you need to so that you save gems and get ahead in the race faster."
