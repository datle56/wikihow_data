If you’re having trouble drinking your cocoa powder with just water, try adding a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up. Then, add a pinch of salt to bring out the natural chocolatey flavors.

Just be warned that because of the alkalization process used to create Dutch cocoa, it might taste a little like baking soda. [9] X Research source"
