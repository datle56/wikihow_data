Your race in Blox Fruits is assigned randomly when you first begin the game, with a 12.5% chance to get Shark right off the bat. If you still need to get V1 of the Shark race, you can buy a race reroll (or as many rerolls as you need to become a Shark). Buy them from: [1] X Research source Tort, an NPC at the Café The in-game shop for 90 Robux Special event NPCs at Event Shops"

      "content": "Complete the Colosseum quest from Bartilo. Find Bartilo in the Second Sea’s Café and accept his quest, which is actually a string of assignments. He’ll first ask you to defeat 50 Swan Pirates in the Kingdom of Rose, then defeat Jeremy, a boss enemy on the tallest mountain to the right of the Kingdom of Rose. Lastly, you’ll have to rescue gladiators from under the Kingdom of Rose’s Colosseum. [2] X Research source To rescue the gladiators, you must solve a puzzle under the Colosseum—but luckily, the solution is on a table in Don Swan’s mansion. The following characters best resemble the puzzle’s code: Y, ∞, C, S, M, F, N, B. Simply press each symbol on the wall under the Colosseum to complete the puzzle. Remember that you must be level 850 or higher to do this quest, which unlocks the ability to speak to a key NPC, the Alchemist, who can upgrade you to Shark V2."

They’ll have a quest for you: to find a red, blue, and yellow flower for them so they can unlock your potential (which means upgrading you to V2). However, you must finish the quest before leaving the server to save your progress. [3] X Research source Yellow flower. To find the yellow flower, travel to the Second Sea and kill any NPCs in the area until a flower spawns. Red flower. Red flowers only bloom during the daytime. Search around during the day, and check different locations if you can’t find one at first. Blue flower. Blue flowers only bloom at night and won’t spawn while the Darkbeard raid boss is spawned. Make sure you wait until night to look for this flower!"

Gather the money (if you haven’t already) and pay the Alchemist; once you do, they’ll upgrade your Race to Shark V2.

Travel to his mansion and get the key to his room by giving Trevor (an NPC near the pool) a physical fruit worth $1,000,000 or more. Then, use the key to enter Don Swan’s room so you can face and defeat him. [5] X Research source It’s also important to note that you must be at least level 1,000 to upgrade to Shark V3, so spend some time leveling up if you haven’t gotten that far already."

Speak to Arowe, and he’ll ask you to kill a naturally-spawned Sea Beast (not a summoned Sea Beast) to qualify for the Shark V3 upgrade. [6] X Research source If you don’t meet all the requirements for V3 (upgrading to V2, reaching level 1,000, and killing Don Swan), Arowe will say, “Come back when you’re prepared enough.” If you don’t have $2,000,000 (which is also needed), Arowe will say, “You’re still lacking $2,000,000.”"

Because of your Shark form, you won’t take any damage in the water, so you can freely attack the Sea Beast with everything in your arsenal. You can usually buy a boat from a location with sea access, especially a dock. Boat prices vary based on the type, but it doesn’t matter what kind of boat you take to find the Sea Beast."

After you pay Arowe, he’ll give you the Shark V3 upgrade—congratulations!

This ability lasts for 4.5 seconds and has a 30-second cooldown time. Upgrading to Shark V3 will also change your appearance, giving you two extra fins on your arms. [9] X Research source Shark V1. V1 of the Shark race decreases the damage you take in water and increases your speed while in the water. It also gives you a blue shark fin on your back. Shark V2. V2 of the Shark race makes you fully immune to taking damage from water and gives you a speed boost both in and out of the water."

    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros Water immunity is a significant benefit of the Shark form since it can often substitute for a boat (although you won’t be immune to water damage with Shark V1 yet). Thus, Sea Events can be much easier with the Shark race, especially if you don’t have fruits that enable you to walk on water (like Magma V2). [10] X Research source Shark V3 is super helpful for surviving combos and powerful attacks, which also makes it useful for PvP (especially players who may be new to PvP)."

      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons Fruits like Ice V1 and V2, Magma V2, Buddha V2 (transformed), Dough V2, and Kitsune can help you walk on water, meaning you might not need the Shark race’s abilities (although the Shark’s abilities can still protect you from being pulled underwater, while the fruits can’t). [11] X Research source If you have high energy or mobility, you might also be able to cross oceans faster with air dashing and using the mobility skill than you could while swimming. Despite these potential drawbacks, the Shark race still has some nice benefits overall!"
