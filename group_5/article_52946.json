[2] X Research source It’s unclear when “cutie” got tacked onto the front of the word, but it makes sense that it happened, since the words rhyme. (It’s also unclear when “patootie” started being used to refer to someone’s tuchas, and that one makes less sense to us, but oh well.) The term “cutie patootie” gained more traction due to The Rosie O’Donnell Show in the 1990s because O’Donnell used it so frequently."
