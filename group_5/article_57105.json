      "content": "Buy fresh herring during the traditional months of May and June. You don't want the rotted fish to sit around too long, but you want to be sure there is plenty of time for it to ferment during the traditional surstromming feasting time of late August and early September. Make sure to also have a bucket for reserved brine."

      "content": "Brine the herring for a day. Leave the salt concentration a bit on the light side. It should measure about 23 degrees with your salinometer. After all, surstromming was created specifically because the locals didn't have enough salt to preserve fish in the normal way."

      "content": "Decapitate and clean the herring. Fish heads and guts aren't part of the classic recipe and would ruin the distinctive taste of surstromming. Leave them out for the local cats, if you wish."

      "content": "Leave it out in the sun for 24 hours to begin the fermentation process. This crucial step jump-starts the process and gets that rot underway. Stir it every 3 hours to achieve an even putrefaction throughout the mixture."
