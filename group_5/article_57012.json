      "title": "A different set of handles or hinges can quickly modernize your kitchen.",
      "content": "A different set of handles or hinges can quickly modernize your kitchen. Measure all of the knobs and handles that are already on your cabinets so you can get ones that are the same size and have the same screw pattern. Try using black cabinet handles since they’ll look really sleek and modern when you pair them with the oak’s natural wood grain. For an even more modern look, install concealed hinges so they aren’t visible from the fronts of your cabinets."

      "title": "Trim pieces on your cabinets add a modern touch on a budget.",
      "content": "Trim pieces on your cabinets add a modern touch on a budget. Rather than having your cabinets end suddenly on the floor or ceiling, cut a trim piece for them. Use a straight piece of trim on top of upper cabinets to give them a really clean, defined edge. Try smaller pieces of trim or decorative wooden feet near the corners on lower cabinets by the floor. [1] X Research source Try to use flat, smooth pieces of trim for the most modernized look, but even crown molding pieces can add a hint of class to your kitchen."

      "title": "Glass doors make your cabinets more visually interesting.",
      "content": "Glass doors make your cabinets more visually interesting. Choose a cabinet or two that you want as focal points in your kitchen, and take off the doors. Cut out the middle of the door so you can add a glass pane. Then, just reinstall the doors back on your cabinets. Fill your cabinets with nice dishware that you want on display in your kitchen. Try to keep unsightly items, like colorful food packaging or unorganized stacks of dishes, out of sight since it could make your space look a little cluttered and messy. Using glass in your doors helps break up your cabinets visually and can help get rid of some wood grain patterns that look a little dated."

      "title": "Open shelves add some empty wall space between your cabinets.",
      "content": "Open shelves add some empty wall space between your cabinets. Take down a small section of your wall cabinets to expose the wall behind it. Even just breaking up the visual space between your cabinets gives your kitchen a modern look. To get back some of the storage that you just took down, install a few shelves that have long, clean lines to make your space even more modern. [2] X Research source Aim to get some shelves that have solid matte colors, like white or black, so they look sleek and don’t conflict with your cabinetry’s wood grain."

      "title": "A clean kitchen will make your cabinets look more sleek and modern.",
      "content": "A clean kitchen will make your cabinets look more sleek and modern. Take a little time out of your day to declutter your countertops and surfaces in your kitchen. Only leave out all the items that you regularly use, or set up some simple decor, like fruit bowls or plants. In an instant, your kitchen will look more modern even if you have some older oak cabinets. [3] X Research source Use this opportunity to clean your cabinets as well. There’s a chance they’re dirty and cleaning them may help revive their natural color."

      "title": "A new faucet is a great way to update your kitchen on a budget.",
      "content": "A new faucet is a great way to update your kitchen on a budget. Look for an updated faucet for your kitchen that matches your appliances and cabinet hardware. Try putting in a stainless steel faucet for a bold, shiny look, or use a black faucet to keep your sink looking sleek. Install the new faucet when you find one that fits your style. [4] X Research source Industrial sink faucets with a long flexible head are great for modern kitchens. The type of faucet you choose also depends on the layout of the existing one. If your existing faucet only uses 1 hole, look for an all-in-one faucet unit. If you have 3 holes, you can get separate handles from your faucet. New faucets can add to the overall look of a modern kitchen without making pricey or time-consuming changes to your cabinets."

      "content": "A simple tile pattern helps connect your cabinets to your countertops. Use either traditional tiles or try using peel-and-stick tiles to make a temporary backsplash. Choose tiles that match or accent the colors of your counters for a clean appearance. Measure the space between your wall cabinets and your countertop, and lay out a simple geometric pattern to follow. Install your backsplash with adhesives to change the look of your space. [5] X Research source For example, try installing a subway tile backsplash with black grout to really bring your kitchen to the modern age. Try to avoid tiles that have busy patterns or designs since they may clash with the wood grain on your cabinets."

      "content": "A new light can brighten up your kitchen for a clean, modern look. Old lights might make your room look a little dark and dated, so start looking for new lighting options. Choose lights that clearly illuminate the main work areas of your kitchen to ensure they’re bright enough. Try to find something that has a clean metal finish, or go out of the box and get a fixture made with a material not in your kitchen. [6] X Research source For instance, a woven basket light can really play off the color and texture of your oak cabinets."

      "content": "A matching set of new appliances breaks up the look of your cabinetry. If you have older appliances, they might stand out and make your cabinets look more dated. If you’re able to, try to get some new appliances that all have similar finishes, such as matte black or stainless steel. Once you install your appliances, they’ll help your space look more updated. [7] X Research source Look for panel-ready appliances that can have cabinet panels installed on the door to blend in with the rest of your cabinetry. These may be a good choice if you have painted oak cabinets already so the natural wood grain doesn’t overwhelm the space."

      "title": "A fresh countertop can complement the look of your oak cabinets.",
      "content": "A fresh countertop can complement the look of your oak cabinets. Look for a natural stone or matte finish countertop that fits with the color of your cabinets. Choose a simple pattern or solid color for a really clean appearance, or go with a marble finish to create a bold accent with the natural wood grain of your cabinets. Replace your countertops once you find a style that fits well in your space. [8] X Research source New countertops can be pretty pricey, especially if you have a lot of counter space or an island in your kitchen."

      "title": "A light, neutral wall color contrasts the oak so your space feels more open.",
      "content": "A light, neutral wall color contrasts the oak so your space feels more open. Try out a white, off-white, or lighter neutral tone in your kitchen to help break up the visual monotony of your space. Test out a few swatches of paint to see what colors work well with your cabinets and countertops. When you find a color you like, paint the walls with a few thin coats. [9] X Research source If your oak cabinets are already painted a lighter color, then try using a bold, dark color on one of your walls as an accent. Don’t be afraid to try out a non-traditional neutral color. A pale green or a warm light yellow can really make your space feel homey."

      "title": "A new coat of paint helps hide dated wood grain and designs.",
      "content": "A new coat of paint helps hide dated wood grain and designs. Choose a matte paint color that has a white or neutral tone, like gray or beige, for the most versatile look. Before you paint your cabinets , take all the doors and hardware off, and clean the cabinets. Apply your paint in a few thin, even coats and let them dry completely before reinstalling them. [10] X Research source Try painting your cabinets a dark muted color if your kitchen gets a lot of natural light. A dark color scheme gives your kitchen a moody vibe. [11] X Research source If you want to add an accent wall to your kitchen, paint a section of cabinets around an appliance. This works really well if you have ovens built into the wall."
