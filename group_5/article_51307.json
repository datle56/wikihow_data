Duty-free stores can typically be found at any location that caters to or serves international travelers. Common locations for duty-free stores include international airports, towns and cities along an international border, cruise ships, ports, and on board certain international flights.

      "content": "Determine if it's worth buying duty free. Some of the discounts you get at a duty-free store make it well worth your time and effort to make a purchase. However, other items may not be sold at a very good rate. For many items, you may be able to get a better deal by simply looking for those products on sale at a regular retailer. [2] X Research source The duty-free rate also depends on the country whose products you are attempting to import. For example, in the U.S., certain items imported from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the Ukraine are subject to a 100% rate of duty. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Customs and Border Protection Federal law enforcement agency responsible for monitoring U.S. borders, facilitating international trade, and upholding customs laws Go to source Alcohol and tobacco are generally the best discounts you'll find at a duty-free store. Cameras and electronic products are usually not a very good deal. Retail items like cosmetics, clothing, and perfume can be hit or miss in terms of their value. If an item wouldn't normally be on sale at a regular retailer, you may get a deal, but otherwise it might be cheaper to look for these items on sale at a regular retail outlet. Candy and other confections are usually worth purchasing duty free if they are imported. However, regular candy that you can purchase at a supermarket is usually not a very good deal, and may actually be sold at an inflated price if you're buying at an airport duty-free store."

Your items may be delivered to you as you board a plane or as you drive or walk across an international border."

If you are visiting an eligible IP or CBI country, you will be able to ship certain products back to your home if you live in the U.S. In order to do so, you'll need to fill out a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles form for each package you wish to send. You'll also need to complete a separate declarations form, CBP Form 6059B, which lists any items you purchased that you are bringing back with you. Some retailers offer these forms in store; if not, you can download and print them from the CBP website. Be aware that all mailed packages must be claimed within 30 days of arriving in the U.S. Anything unclaimed after 30 days will be returned to the sender.

Let him/her know you will send a copy of the Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles form, also known as CPB (Customs and Border Protection) Form 255. Fill out a separate CBP Form 255 for each individual package/container you'll be sending back to the U.S., which will then have to be attached to the package before shipment. Pay any Customs duty and taxes you may owe upon returning to the U.S. A CBP officer will also verify your list and validate your form(s). Send the yellow copy of CBP Form 255 to the vendor who is holding your purchase. Keep the other copy you're given by CBP for your own records. Once your package clears Customs, the U.S. Postal Service will be delivered to your home (if you are shipping it through the USPS). If you're using a transportation service, you will be notified when your package arrives, and you'll be able to claim it at their office."

In the United States, for example, you must leave the country for at least 48 hours if you wish to take full advantage of U.S. duty-free stores. However, you may be able to purchase some quantities of duty-free goods if you're traveling for less than that time span. U.S. citizens may purchase a reduced quantity of duty-free goods if they've spent less than 48 hours in Canada, for example, and Canadian citizens may purchase a limited quantity of duty-free goods after any length of time in the United States.

U.S. citizens who spend more than 48 hours in Canada may bring back up to $800 in goods per person, and will not have to pay taxes or duties on up to one liter (33.8 fluid ounces) of alcohol, one carton of 200 cigarettes, and 100 cigars."

For example, if you're a U.S. citizen crossing from Canada back into the U.S., you'll need to pay the U.S. Customs office in U.S. currency. You can write a personal check for the exact amount of your Customs duty, provided you have a bank account within that country. For example, a U.S. citizen may make a personal check payment to the U.S. Customs office if he/she has a U.S.-based bank account. If making a payment by check, you will need to provide an authorized photo ID (typically either a passport or U.S. driver's license). You may also make a Customs payment by money order or traveler's check if the total you owe is below a certain amount. At the U.S. border, for example, that amount is set at $50."
