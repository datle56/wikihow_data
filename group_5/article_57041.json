      "content": "Dissolve the yeast. Pour the lukewarm water into a medium sized mixing bowl or the bowl of a standing mixer. Add in the yeast to the water and let the yeast dissolve for about 10 minutes. [1] X Research source You should see that the mixture becomes bubbly and that the yeast granules dissolve into the water. If you don’t want to prepare your own dough, buy pre-prepared dough at the grocery store."

      "title": "Add flour and salt.",
      "content": "Add flour and salt. Pour in the 2 cups (473.17 ml) of all purpose flour and the 1 ½ (7.39 ml) teaspoons of salt into the bowl of yeast and water. Use a spatula or spoon to stir the ingredients vigorously until they make a shaggy dough. The dough doesn’t have to be completely homogenous, as you will knead it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Knead the dough for 5-8 minutes.",
      "content": "Knead the dough for 5-8 minutes. Knead the dough, either by hand on a counter or table or by using the low setting on a standing mixer. To knead by hand, place the dough on the counter and begin to stretch and squeeze it, folding it over on itself and stretching it again. Keep kneading for about 5-8 minutes until the dough is smooth and expands back out when you poke it. [3] X Research source If the dough is incredibly sticky, add a small amount of flour and rework it. Avoid adding too much flour, as this will make the dough have a thicker, heavier consistency."

    {
      "title": "Let the dough rise for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Let the dough rise for 1 hour. Once you have kneaded the dough into a smooth ball, pour cooking oil on a paper towel and use it to lightly oil the interior of a large bowl. Place the dough ball inside the bowl, cover the bowl with a cloth, and let the dough rise for 1-1 ½ hours until it is twice its size. [4] X Research source If you are in a rush, you can skip the process of letting the dough rise and move on to preparing the pizza. Be aware that the crust of the pizza will be very thin and crisp as opposed to fluffy. If you are preparing the dough in advance for the next day, let the dough rise for 30 minutes, then place it in the fridge in a covered bowl until you are ready to use it."

      "title": "Slice the pizza toppings.",
      "content": "Slice the pizza toppings. While the dough is rising, you can begin to prepare the pizza toppings. Slice your favorite toppings, whether it be veggies like mushrooms or green bell peppers or meat like cooked sausage or ham. Slice about 1-2 cups (240- 480 ml) in total of the pizza toppings and put them aside. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll the dough into a circle. Take the dough out of the bowl and divide the dough into two equal sized balls. Pour a small amount of flour onto a clean counter or cutting board, then use your hands to spread out the flour into a thin, even layer. Place one ball of dough on the counter and roll it using a rolling pin to create a circle with a diameter that is slightly smaller than the pan you will be using to cook the pizzas. Repeat with the other dough ball. [6] X Research source Once you’ve rolled the dough, use your hands to encourage the dough into a circle shape if need be."

Add a teaspoon or so (about 4.92 ml) of cooking oil and swirl so that the cooking oil coats the bottom of the pan. You can also use two equal sized pans if you want to cook both pizzas at the same time. [7] X Research source Other than a skillet, you can also make stovetop pizza using a tawa, a thin metal pan common throughout parts of Asia."

Once the pan has heated, carefully drop one pizza dough circle into the pan and cook for about 1 minute until you see bubbles forming on the dough and the edges getting slightly golden. [8] X Research source If the bubbles are large, you can deflate them by poking them with a spatula. You also can keep them if you wish; they will turn crispy when fully cooked."

Then spread half the pizza sauce over the dough except for the outer two inches (5 cm) or so, as this will be the crust. Sprinkle on half the cheese and add half the pizza toppings.

Next to the grill, set up a table that can hold all of your toppings and the two pizza doughs, as well as tongs, a pastry brush, a spatula, a large spoon and an oven mitt. [13] X Research source Choose direct as opposed to indirect heat if that is a setting on your grill. The hotness of the grill will give you crispier pizza with a deliciously charred crust that tastes almost like wood fired pizza."
