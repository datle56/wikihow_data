      "content": "Use a tissue to get rid of clumps before you apply mascara. Grab a clean, dry piece of bathroom or facial tissue and swipe your mascara brush over it once or twice after you pull it out of the tube. This gets rid of the blobs of excess makeup that cause those annoying clumps. [1] X Research source When you’re done using the wand, wipe it again—especially if you don’t store it inside the tube of mascara. You can also buy a simple tool called a Clump Cleaner to break up and remove clumps on your brush. This tool is a small piece of plastic with holes of different sizes. Choose the hole that matches the size of your brush and pull the bristles through it to wipe off excess mascara."

      "content": "Most mascara wands are made of alcohol-safe nylon. Spray rubbing alcohol directly onto the brush, or pour some into a jar and dip the bristles in. Wrap a clean paper towel around the brush and rub and twist it to wipe away any makeup residue. [2] X Research source Make sure you know what your brush is made of before you try this, since alcohol can damage brushes made with natural bristles. You may be able to find the material listed on the packaging, if you still have it. Some makeup pros recommend doing this before every application of mascara. However, most dermatologists recommend washing or disinfecting your brushes every 7-10 days.

      "content": "This method is gentler on delicate materials like boar hair. Run some water over the bristles of the brush, then squeeze a little shampoo into your hand. Rub the spoolie around in your hand until it’s lathered up, then rinse it clean under running water. [4] X Research source You can also buy a specially formulated makeup brush cleaner or shampoo, but these can be a little pricey. A basic baby shampoo or gentle clarifying shampoo usually works just fine. [5] X Research source Steer clear of using plain soaps, since these can dry out the delicate bristles of your brush.

      "content": "Try this method to get your brush spotless. If wiping and rinsing your mascara brush just isn’t getting all the gunk out, you might need to soak it for a few minutes. Boil some water to disinfect it, then wait a couple minutes so it’s not still boiling hot. Let the brush soak in the hot water for about 5 minutes. [7] X Research source When you’re done, rinse the brush under cool, running water to wash away any residue that’s still sticking to the bristles. If you want, you can spritz on a little rubbing alcohol to disinfect the brush after you soak and rinse it. Skip this step if the brush has natural bristles, however."

      "title": "Let the brush dry completely before using it again.",
      "content": "Let the brush dry completely before using it again. Spread out a towel on a flat surface and set the brush on it. If possible, let the bristle end hang over the edge so air can circulate around the bristles. Don’t put the brush upright in a container to dry, since this can cause water to pool around the bristles. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You may need to leave the wand out overnight for it to dry completely. Help the drying process along by gently patting your wand dry with a clean towel after you wash or rinse it to soak up excess water. You can also gently shake the wand to get excess water out. If you don’t keep your brush in the mascara tube, put it away in a clean makeup brush organizer when you’re done. Don’t let it touch brushes that haven’t been cleaned."

      "content": "This is the most reliable way to keep your mascara clean. If you’re really worried about eye infections, your best bet is to avoid using the same brush more than once. Consider buying disposable mascara brushes that you can dip once and then throw away or recycle. [9] X Research source Look for these brushes online or in your local pharmacy or beauty supply store. You can still wash the disposable brushes and use them for other purposes. For instance, you can use a mascara wand to groom your eyebrows, touch up your hair dye, or clean delicate items like a computer keyboard or a piece of jewelry. Some wildlife rescue organizations even welcome donations of used mascara wands, which they can use to groom rescued animals! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Toss your spoolie sooner if it’s shedding bristles. Even with regular cleaning, your mascara brush won’t last forever. Get a new one after a couple of months to reduce the risk of infections—or loose bristles getting into your eyes. [11] X Research source The same goes for your mascara. Throw it out and replace it every 3 months, since harmful bacteria can quickly build up in the tube. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source If you get an eye infection, throw away all your eye makeup and brushes right away. Don’t use eye makeup at all until the infection clears up, and only use new products once your doctor lets you know it’s okay."
