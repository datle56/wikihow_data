      "content": "Pickup lines work differently across the gender spectrum. While 40% of women are more likely to respond to messages about food (\"What's your favorite cake: Chocolate, Funfetti, or red velvet?\"), men are 98% more likely to respond to assertive, invitational messages (\"Are you free this week to meet up?\"). Check out their profile to see what they like and what sort of pickup line you should use. While there aren't studies on how pickup lines work for non-binary genders, Hinge does allow you to choose a gender other than male or female in the app. [1] X Research source Men have short attention spans, according to Hinge researchers. [2] X Research source You have about 6 hours to message a male match on Hinge before he loses interest and his likeliness to respond drops by 25%. On the other hand, women tend to be more patient, so her likeliness to respond drops only 5% if you message her after 6 hours."

      "content": "Cater your Hinge pickup lines to the user's age. Hinge recommends using certain types of pickup lines for each age group, based on their likelihood to respond to the pickup line vs another type. [3] X Research source If your match is 18-23 years old, Hinge suggests using novelty pickup lines, like: Is that shirt you're wearing made of girlfriend/boyfriend material? Tell me your go-to stress reliever and I'll guess your personality: Drinks, movies, or Tylenol? My mom always taught me not to talk to strangers, but here I am making an exception for you. I have to say, you're making the other people on Hinge look bad. You can delete Hinge now. I'm here. For 24-28, Hinge suggests using lifestyle pickup lines, like: Summer's around the corner, making any big plans? How would you describe your musical taste? Do you like to travel? You can I could be the perfect adventure. Are you a morning person? I'd love to share an early morning coffee with you someday. What is your guilty pleasure? If you want to chat with someone aged 29-34, try using a personal pickup line, like: Would you rather have 10 million dollars now and be 20 years older or go back in time 10 years with all the knowledge you have now? Your taste in music is great! Who are your top 5 songs right now? What was the best part of your day? Your travel photos are incredible. Where do you want to go next? Is that your dog? What a cutie! How did you two find each other? For those aged 35+, Hinge suggests trying to include age-specific pop culture references, like: Bears, beats, or Battlestar Galactica?

My spidey sense isn't the only thing that's tingling. You can be Little Red Riding Hood and I’ll be The Big Bad Wolf. Do you remember Y2K? Because matching with you feels like the best way to start the new millennium."

      "content": "Someone in Montana won't respond to the same pickup lines used in Georgia. Different geographical locations have different interests, so play on those. For example, Hinge researchers found that people who live in Los Angeles respond more to pickup lines involving celebrities, like: You remind me of Jason Derulo because every time we meet, I want to sing your name! Is your dad Liam Neeson? Because I'm Taken with you. Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again like Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch ? You've got that Rihanna style that drives me wild. Which Justin is better—Justin Timberlake or Justin Bieber? Meanwhile, the best pickup lines in New York should invoke escaping reality, like: Which would you rather have: An adult treehouse, or the ability to talk to animals? Do you have a TARDIS? Because I'd love to travel through time and space with you. Matching with you must be a glitch in the matrix because you're too perfect to be real. You've got everything I've been looking for, and trust me, I've been looking for a long time. Do you have a map? Because I'm lost in your eyes, and I'm ready to explore uncharted territories with you. People in Chicago love talking about being a 90s kid, so they are more likely to respond to pickup lines that refer to the 90s, like: If we were in an 80s teen movie, you'd be the star, and I'd be your love interest. How you doin'? Your eyes are brighter than a Lisa Frank trapper keeper. [5] X Research source Are you a Tamagotchi? I just can't stop thinking about taking care of you. What decade do you love most and why is it the 90s?"

      "title": "Pickup lines relating to food are a great option.",
      "content": "Pickup lines relating to food are a great option. Can't think of anything for their gender, age, and location? These lines work best on women, though they're likely to yield responses for all genders. Try using food in your pickup line to make it a little more creative: Refer to a recipe (if she's noted an interest in cooking or her profile features a pic of her cooking). Is a hotdog a taco or a sandwich? If you were a fruit, you'd be a fineapple. The barista may forget your name, but I never will. What's your preferred late night snack? We should meet up for coffee sometime. I like you a latte. (Probably best used for men, who respond more to assertive and invitational messages). You must be really spicy because you're making my heart burn. (Probably best used for women, who responded more to food messages) [7] X Research source"
