      "content": "Distilled water has fewer impurities that cause cloudiness. While tap or bottled water works fine, distilled water doesn’t have any additives that cloud up the ice as it freezes. Fill a pot with distilled water and bring it to a rolling boil. Let the water cool down for 5 minutes before bringing it to a boil a second time. [1] X Research source Give the water a chance to cool down until it’s warm before you use it to make your ice."

      "content": "Sphere molds are the cheapest option for making ice globes. Sphere molds are made from silicone, and the 2 halves push together to make a sphere. However, sphere molds usually freeze cloudy since they don’t have as much insulation, so you have to set it on top an insulated thermos filled with water in your freezer. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tray molds slow freezing down to make sure ice balls or cubes are clear.",
      "content": "Tray molds slow freezing down to make sure ice balls or cubes are clear. Tray molds come with a silicone tray and an insulated cooler box. The tray slides into the insulated cooler to help slow down freezing, which makes it easier to make clear ice globes. [3] X Research source If you want clear ice cubes, just get a mold with a square-shaped tray instead."

      "content": "Pouring water up to the fill lines ensures the ice has room to expand. If you’re filling a sphere mold, pour the water into the hole on top until it’s completely full. If you’re freezing clear ice balls in a tray mold, pour the water into the insulated cooler up to the fill line and slide the tray into the opening. [4] X Research source Ice ball molds may work differently depending on the brand, so always double-check the instructions that came with yours."

      "title": "Water needs time to freeze slowly to prevent cloudy ice.",
      "content": "Water needs time to freeze slowly to prevent cloudy ice. Stick your ice ball mold in the freezer and leave it alone for a minimum of 24 hours. The water will freeze starting from the top down to the bottom of the mold, pushing out gas bubbles that could leave a cloudy appearance inside the ice spheres. [5] X Research source Set a sphere mold on top of a short thermos with a diameter just smaller than the mold. Fill the thermos up with water and put the sphere mold on top so the hole is submerged in the water. Open your freezer gently while you’re making clear ice balls since sudden sharp movements can cause bubbles to form in the ice."

      "title": "The ice balls will be easy to push out of the mold once they're frozen.",
      "content": "The ice balls will be easy to push out of the mold once they're frozen. Gently take a sphere mold off of the thermos or a tray mold out from the insulated cooler. Separate the halves of the mold carefully so you don’t damage or crack the ice balls. Then, push on the outside of the mold so the ice ball comes loose. [6] X Research source If you have trouble pulling the mold out or apart, try running some cold water over it to help loosen the ice. If there’s ice sticking to the bottom of the mold, just knock it off the excess with a wooden spoon. Be careful not to hit too hard so you don’t crack the ice balls."

      "content": "Ice might absorb odors from your fridge and freezer if you leave it out. If you’re not putting your ice ball in a drink right away, toss it into a resealable plastic bag and put it back in your freezer. Since food odors could come through your fridge into your freezer, the bag will keep your ice fresh so it doesn’t change the flavor of your drink. [7] X Research source"
