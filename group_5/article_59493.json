    {
      "title": "It has everything to say about him and nothing about you.",
      "content": "It has everything to say about him and nothing about you. Whether he gave you a weak excuse or he just hasn’t stayed in touch—that’s on him. Remember that you can never control someone’s actions. Refuse to blame yourself—it’s the best way to keep a positive attitude and protect your feelings. [1] X Research source He may also just be busy and have a packed schedule—that comes down to his lifestyle. Being MIA or inconsiderate might just be a pattern of his. He might not understand his habits are confusing, but that’s not your fault."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decompress so you won’t chat when you're stressed.",
      "content": "Decompress so you won’t chat when you're stressed . If you reach out immediately because you think he blew you off, the situation can escalate really quickly. Instead, treat yourself to whatever makes you happy, like some good comfort food or a fun activity. You’ll put yourself in a good head space and handle any talk gracefully. [2] X Research source Try sleeping on it for 2-3 days—consistently getting 8 hours of rest is important, anyway. Exercise will help get your body moving, your eyes off your phone, and your mind off of him. Focus on your passions and you might realize you’d prefer to work on yourself."

    {
      "title": "He’s likely to avoid a ton of messages.",
      "content": "He’s likely to avoid a ton of messages. It’s tempting to send off some cute or funny texts to see if he’ll take the bait. Still, if isn’t responding to one text, he isn’t likely to reply to another. Stay silent for a bit and show that you’re too confident to fight for his attention. [3] X Research source If he only ever sent one-liners before, more texts from you just show you’ll put in all the effort. If he never initiates convos, it’s a big sign he’s not willing to put in work for any connection. There’s a chance he’ll notice less texts from you and wonder if he should try a little harder."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’ll get the truth ASAP.",
      "content": "You’ll get the truth ASAP. A direct approach is all you need to get all the right intel. Send a simple, laidback message without expectations. Check in about where his head’s at and if he wants to pursue anything with you by using a comment like: [4] X Research source “Haven’t heard from you in a while. Do you still want to hang out?” “Hey, are you feeling any chemistry here?” “Are you still interested in dating?” Reader Poll: We asked 710 wikiHow readers how they would react if a guy started hiding his phone, and only 11% said they would give the benefit of the doubt and assume he’s busy. [Take Poll] So, while that may not be a great strategy according to our readers, try being direct."

    {
      "title": "Save yourself time and don’t look for hidden clues.",
      "content": "Save yourself time and don’t look for hidden clues. If 2-3 days go by and he doesn’t respond, take his silence as your cue that he’s not interested. On the other hand, if he explains that he’s been busy, overwhelmed, or preoccupied, give him the benefit of the doubt. It’s just easier on you if you don’t pick his message apart or rehash the past. [5] X Research source If he’s “ghosted” you because you asked a question, you’re better off without him. If he calmly explains he doesn’t feel chemistry, take it as a sign of honesty and respect. If he did get caught up in personal matters, you can decide if his lifestyle is compatible with yours later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remain calm and logical so you’ll have the upper hand.",
      "content": "Remain calm and logical so you’ll have the upper hand. If he left you on “read” or just fell out of contact, then you don’t have to say anything. When his reply checks out with you, thank him for following up. In situations where he provides an explanation that doesn’t really make sense or just laughs everything off, keep it simple with comments like: [6] X Research source “Okay, got it!” “I understand.” “Thank you for letting me know.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’ll know exactly how you expect to be treated.",
      "content": "He’ll know exactly how you expect to be treated. Whether you decide he’s not right for you or you want to give him another chance, outline your limits. Say why you aren’t a great match if you think he’s let you down. If you still want to explore your connection, tell him what you need to make it sustainable for you. If you’re not feeling it anymore, be specific and say something like, “I need someone who’s more available.” If you do want to give it another shot, you can set a limit like, “I need you to give me a heads up if you’re swamped with work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If he won’t accept your terms, just move on.",
      "content": "If he won’t accept your terms, just move on . If he tries to talk you out of what you want or gets really defensive, don’t engage with him. Politely explain that it’s best for you to part ways or delete his phone number. You’ll save yourself a lot of energy. If you haven’t heard back from him and want to vent, call up a friend instead. The conversation will be a lot more productive."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus your energy on people you trust 100%.",
      "content": "Focus your energy on people you trust 100%. It can be really draining after you’ve dealt with a guy that didn’t treat you right. Recharge by reaching out to anyone who will lift you up. Your inner circle will remind you you’re cherished and loved. [7] X Research source If your buddies focus on giving you fun distractions, try not to mention the guy who blew you off at all. Just melt into the moment and appreciate the good company."

    {
      "title": "Don’t fall down a rabbit hole—you don’t want your mind stuck on him.",
      "content": "Don’t fall down a rabbit hole—you don’t want your mind stuck on him. Resist even one quick peek. If you stay strong and don’t scroll through all his platforms, you’ll be able to forget him a lot more easily. If it helps you fight the temptation, you can just block him. Try catching up on your friends’ posts and see what they’re all up to. Follow new accounts or interesting influencers for new content to focus on."
    },
    {
      "title": "He doesn’t define you—only you do.",
      "content": "He doesn’t define you—only you do. After falling out of touch with a guy you like, it’s understandable to feel a little insecure. Focus on all the amazing personality traits you have. No matter how he treated you, remember that you’re still an incredible individual who has so much to offer the world. [8] X Research source Separate his rejection, which is an unrelated situation, from who you are as a person. By disappearing, he lets you pursue a more rewarding love life. Repeat a mantra , or uplifting phrase. Say something like, “I’m really caring, and I deserve kindness in return.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "You won’t have to worry about being blown off again!",
      "content": "You won’t have to worry about being blown off again! Use your run-in with this guy as a lesson—think about all the signs he left for you. That way, you can watch out for them in the future. Maybe he left you on “read” for weeks or canceled on a ton of dates. Look for potential partners who act completely differently from him and who value you instead. You’ll be glad for that refreshing change. [9] X Research source Check in with yourself and schedule dates when you feel emotionally ready. Pay attention to the way a guy follows up with you before the first date—for example, if he regularly texts about where and when you’ll meet, it’s a good sign that he’s reliable."
