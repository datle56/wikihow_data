Contrary to popular belief, being on your phone isn’t likely to deter attackers since it actually signals that you’re distracted and easy to attack. Likewise, avoid walking with headphones because you won’t be able to pay as close of attention to noises around you.

      "content": "Avoid walking past groups of people at night. If you spot groups of people standing on the street or see someone staring at you, try to choose a different path. If you can’t take a different path home, cross the street or remain alert of whether those people are trying to approach you.

[6] X Research source As you assess a potentially dangerous situation, practice the OODA Loop, a system of decision-making developed by military strategists. In the OODA loop, you continually observe, orient, decide, and act. [7] X Research source Observe your surroundings by listening and watching people around you. Orient yourself by comparing what you see to what you would normally expect from a safe situation. Decide whether the people you see pose a threat to you. Do they seem angry? Are they yelling or staring at you intently? Act by running away or calling for help."

      "title": "Avoid walking past bushes, doorways, or alleys.",
      "content": "Avoid walking past bushes, doorways, or alleys. Walking on the sidewalk close to the curb allows you to avoid places where people might be hiding and waiting to ambush you. As you walk around building corners, take wide turns so you have more time to assess who is on the other side. If you can’t stay close to the curb, just make sure to avoid alleys, vacant lots, and wooded areas. [10] X Research source If you’re not able to stay on the sidewalk, walk against the flow of car traffic. That way, it’ll be harder for you to be pulled into a car by a thief or kidnapper."

      "content": "Don’t ask for directions, and don’t pull out a GPS or map. Attackers and muggers are more likely to prey on you if you seem unsure or lost. To act like you know the neighborhood and have a route home, take turns and cross the street without hesitating. Once you've reached a busy store, restaurant, or a well-lit place, you can ask for directions or use your phone to figure out where you are. On the other hand, if you know your route well and are concerned you’re being followed, pick a zig-zagging or less-intuitive path to get where you want to go. You’ll get the opportunity to lose the person following you and verify that you’re being stalked. [11] X Research source"

If you feel threatened in any way, walk right past the person and don’t break your stride. When you stop, you give a potential muggers or attacker the chance to distract you. [12] X Research source Potential attackers might ask for the time or for directions. Once you look down to check your watch or phone, you put yourself into a vulnerable position by taking your eyes off the potential mugger."
