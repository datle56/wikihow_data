      "title": "Choose a quality bra.",
      "content": "Choose a quality bra. Remember the importance of good quality undergarments for the foundation of any sexy outfit. Find a bra that features comfort in the cups, band, and straps. Look for wide straps to support a larger chest. The center front of the bra should lie flat across your breastbone, the band should lie parallel all the way around your chest without riding up, and there should be no spillover from the cups or gap between breast and cup. [1] X Research source Consider your outfit for an evening or other occasion when you want to dress to impress. A strapless top or dress will need a strapless bra, a plunging neckline will need a plunge cut bra, a low back or cutout style will need a low-back or backless bra, etc. Consider a bra that’s built into a longer control-top undergarment if you want to offer more support for your entire midsection when wearing a form-fitting sexy outfit."

      "title": "Choose tops that skim the body.",
      "content": "Choose tops that skim the body. Look for tops that fit closely but skim the body without actually hugging the skin for the best long, sexy lines for your torso. Try a plunging neckline to accentuate your chest, or a low back to show off some more subtle skin. Well-fitting, body-skimming fit will keep bared skin from looking overexposed or uncomfortably revealing. Try an off-the-shoulder top or dress for an easy way to bare some skin and show off your shoulders and neck. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for structured busts.",
      "content": "Look for structured busts. Try tops and dresses that have structure or built-in padding and support for the chest to lend support as well as flatter a fuller chest. Look for structure in the bust particularly when the garment is difficult to wear with a bra and can replace one. Pay attention to the neckline shape as well. Choose a V shape or sweetheart neckline to elongate the body and show off cleavage, or opt for less cleavage but a beautiful frame for your neck and collarbones with a square neckline."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go sleeveless or try sheer sleeves.",
      "content": "Go sleeveless or try sheer sleeves. Wear tops and dresses without sleeves, or opt for sleeves that are sheer as a way to both add some sex appeal and still be a little more covered up if you’d like to be. Look for sleeves with lace detail, cutouts, or sheer sections for extra sexiness on the arms. Opt for sleeves in a kimono or dolman style, or another similar style that floats away from the arm for an elegant and flattering look. Avoid regular t-shirt length short sleeves, which visually cut the arms off at their widest point. Opt for three-quarter length, sleeveless, or a shorter sleeve that lands at a diagonal angle on your arm."

    {
      "title": "Go for cinched waistlines.",
      "content": "Go for cinched waistlines. Look for tops, skirts, and dresses that nip in at the waist to accentuate your naturally sexy hourglass shape. The cinched or narrower section of a garment should hit at your natural waist, which is the smallest part of your midsection, between your ribcage and belly button. [3] X Research source Try peplum or wrap style shirts and dresses, which show off the narrowest part of your midsection while flaring away from the stomach below. A wrap dress makes for an attractive everyday look, while peplums easily create a sexy evening look; both can be dressed up or down. Try skirts, shorts, and pants that are intended to be high-waisted, hitting anywhere from the bellybutton up to the natural waist, which accentuates the waist but also creates some support for the lower abdomen if you want it."

    {
      "title": "Look for curvy fit or stretch denim to flatter the waist.",
      "content": "Look for curvy fit or stretch denim to flatter the waist. Buy pants and jeans that accommodate a larger waist and hip section by looking out for curvy fits, or material with enough stretch to create both comfort and a sexy body-hugging look for the waist, hips, and backside. Make sure that the waist on any pair of pants fits comfortably when standing and sitting. Remember that the waist can stretch with wear, but should fit when just washed as well. Try jeggings or other popular pant styles that feature an elastic waistband for optimal comfort and extra curve-hugging. A wide stretch waistband fits more comfortably than a smaller one that may dig into the waist or lower stomach. Opt for a mid-rise or high-rise fit to slim the lower abdomen for a sleek look.

      "title": "Try solid colors or smaller patterns.",
      "content": "Try solid colors or smaller patterns. Opt for solid colors in dark or jewel tones for a sleek evening look that flatters your waist and hips. Keep patterns subtle and smaller in scale for a chic and sexy style. In general, lighter colors will visually highlight and darker colors will reduce, so choose color for your top to draw attention to your midsection, or dark neutrals to downplay it. Try patterns with geometric shapes that point downward, like vertical stripes or chevrons, for an elongating effect for the middle of the body. You can still use more horizontal or larger patterns for any areas you want to accentuate."

    {
      "title": "Favor thick fabric and use embellishment strategically.",
      "content": "Favor thick fabric and use embellishment strategically. Wear tops made with fabric thick enough that it won’t cling to your body where you don’t want it to. Make sure ruffles, beading, or other embellishments that can be sexy are placed on areas you want to highlight rather than downplay. Embellishments that add volume to a garment should hit only at areas of your body you want to accentuate or widen. However, features like a belt or ruching can help narrow an area like the waist if you want to define that sexy hourglass shape. [5] X Research source If you choose thinner fabric for garments around your midsection, look for items that drape, fold, or gather to avoid uncomfortable or unflattering clinging. Wear a tank top or control undergarment underneath a top that is too thin to provide a smooth base."

      "title": "Choose bootcut or slim cut pants.",
      "content": "Choose bootcut or slim cut pants. Go for jeans or pants in a straight cut for universally flattering length, whether you opt for a sexy form-fitting skinny style or a bootcut that floats straight away from the legs to the floor. Choose a dark wash on jeans when you want to slim any area of your legs or hips. Alternatively, you may want to add lighter wash or bright color to accentuate the legs and lend balance to a larger torso. Avoid fading and whiskering on denim, or too many embellishments on pockets and seams, in areas you do not want to widen."

    {
      "title": "Choose skirt hemlines at or above the knee.",
      "content": "Choose skirt hemlines at or above the knee. Find skirts and dresses that fall just above the knee for the most universally flattering look for the legs. Also try out a high-low hemline, which is shorter in the front and longer in the back, to get some more coverage while still showing off your legs for an alluring look. Look out for skirts and dresses that feature pleating or lines that fall vertically from the waist to make the lower body look longer."

    {
      "title": "Wear tights to lengthen the legs.",
      "content": "Wear tights to lengthen the legs. Try tights as a way to show off your legs while not actually showing bare skin if it makes you uncomfortable to do so, as well as provide sexy length to the leg. Choose tights in a similar hue as your skirt, dress, or shoes to help create the illusion of extra length in the legs. Try out tights with classic sex appeal like fishnets, lace, or thigh-highs. Choose control-top hosiery for additional support for your midsection if you wish."

    {
      "title": "Try a slit in a skirt or dress.",
      "content": "Try a slit in a skirt or dress. Go for a slit detail up one side or leg of a long skirt or dress, which helps elongate the leg while providing a sultry detail to an otherwise more covered look. If you’re not ready to bare skin with a slit, try looking for vertical seams on the front of pants or skirts, which has a similar flattering effect. Wear heels to further lengthen the leg you show off with a slit."

      "title": "Try heels to amp up the sexiness.",
      "content": "Try heels to amp up the sexiness. Accentuate the length and beautiful muscles of your legs by choosing a sexy heel that matches your outfit or accessories. Opt for a pump with a pointed toe for an elongating shape; even a flat with this toe will achieve this effect. Nude color (approximately matching your skin tone) on heels will visually create even more leg length when worn with bare legs or nude hosiery."
