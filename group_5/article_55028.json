      "content": "Speak to your navigator to complete industrial-type missions. Depending on the difficulty of the mission, a Salvaged Frigate Module may drop (7-20% chance). So if you're a beginning player, a frigate module may not drop on your first mission, but you can complete up to 5 a day. [1] X Research source Industrial-type missions have the highest drop percentage."

      "content": "Go to a pirate system, shoot the cargo pods of freighters, and pick up your loot. This has the lowest chance of dropping a Salvaged Frigate Module but is perhaps the most popular and easiest method for most players. In a tier 3 economy system or pirate system, there are lots of freighters for you to shoot and loot. The drop rate is 1%, so the first freighter you shoot will most likely not have a Salvaged Frigate Module, but the next one might!"

      "title": "Find a crashed freighter and loot Storage Units.",
      "content": "Find a crashed freighter and loot Storage Units. Find any crashed freighters by using a Signal Scanner, talk to aliens in space stations, or use your Analysis Visor. [2] X Research source Finding crashed freighters is a rarer source of Salvaged Frigate Modules with a drop rate of 7.5%."

      "content": "Go to the Space Anomaly and get to The Nexus. You can browse the board for any that award a Salvage Frigate Module and complete those. [3] X Research source Completing missions in The Nexus has a 4% chance of giving a Salvaged Frigate Module."

      "title": "Go to any space station and check out the mission board.",
      "content": "Go to any space station and check out the mission board. These are not the same missions that are posted in The Nexus. [4] X Research source Missions on space stations vary depending on your standing with specific beings. So the Salvaged Frigate Module has a 2-4% chance of being rewarded."

      "title": "Find a derelict freighter and loot the storage units you find.",
      "content": "Find a derelict freighter and loot the storage units you find. Derelict freighters have enemies that you need to beat in order to progress through the area. They are difficult to impossible to solo (depending on your level and setup), so grouping up with other players is advisable. Drop rates are pretty low for each individual container, but you'll be looting so many containers that your chances go up! This has a success rate of 2.5%."
