These recommendations on this page are from a mix of sourcesâ€”your phone contacts, people you've talked to in group chats, and people who've added you (who you haven't added back). [1] X Research source Although not everyone in your recommendations has added you, you can probably figure it out from here. If they aren't in your contacts, and you haven't chatted in a group chat, you're probably on their Friends list! To turn Recommended Friends on or off, tap the menu at the bottom-right corner, and then tap the \"Recommended Friends\" switch."
