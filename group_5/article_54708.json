      "content": "GamePigeon will stop working if you've exceeded your Screen Time limits. If you have Screen Time set up on your phone, you might be limited on how much you can use certain apps. If you have App Limits set for messaging or gaming apps, it can interfere with GamePigeon. If you set up Screen Time limits on your own phone, you can disable them by going to Screen Time, entering your Screen Time passcode, and turning off Screen Time. If a parent or guardian controls the Screen Time settings on your phone, you will have to ask them to turn off Screen Time so you can keep using GamePigeon. You can also try these hacks to get around Screen Time limitations."
