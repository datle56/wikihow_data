      "title": "Soak your Chia Pet in water for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Soak your Chia Pet in water for 24 hours. Take the terracotta pot out of its packaging and put it into a bucket or pot filled with water. Make sure the Chia Pet is completely submerged. This moistens the entire pet and helps the seeds stick to it better. [1] X Research source The official Chia Pet instructions say to soak the terracotta for 30 minutes, but a longer soak allows the material to saturate completely."

      "content": "Mix 2 tsp (8.4 g) of chia seeds with ¼ cup (58 mL) of water. While the pet is soaking, combine the provided chia seeds with water in another container to soften them and “wake them up.” The seeds will start growing once they get wet. Two teaspoons of seeds are enough for one pet (Chia Pet kits often contain enough seeds for several pets). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir the seed mixture with a spoon after 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Stir the seed mixture with a spoon after 15 minutes. This will help the seeds soak more evenly and make sure each seed is thoroughly moistened. You don't need to stir the seeds again after this. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the seeds soak for up to 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the seeds soak for up to 24 hours. During this time, the seeds will form a gel-like coating that will help them stick to the chia pet (and make them more digestible if you plan to eat them later on). Depending on your seeds, the gel may form after just a few hours or it could take up to a full day. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drain the Chia Pet and place it in the tray provided.",
      "content": "Drain the Chia Pet and place it in the tray provided. After the soaking time is over, take the Chia Pet out of the water and make sure it’s totally empty. Then, place it on the drip tray that came with your pet. The drip tray will catch any extra water and protect your desk or windowsill from getting stained. If you don't have a drip tray, use a plastic dish or lid that is a little bit larger than your pet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the seeds evenly over the grooves in your Chia Pet.",
      "content": "Spread the seeds evenly over the grooves in your Chia Pet. Make sure that the seeds are somewhat sparse and spread out. Use your fingers, a small knife, or even a spatula to spread the seeds as evenly as possible (try not to let them clump in any one area). If there’s a hole in the top of your pet, take care to avoid it. This is where you will be pouring the water. Wait 2 days to fill your pet with water after you apply the seeds. Filling it right away may cause the seeds to slide off before they sprout. You may not end up using all of the seeds you soaked. That’s OK! If your seeds aren't sticking to the Chia Pet, double check that your pet is empty of water and spread the seeds over it again."

    {
      "title": "Place a plastic bag over your pet for the first 3-4 days if the air's dry.",
      "content": "Place a plastic bag over your pet for the first 3-4 days if the air's dry. The plastic bag will help create a mini-greenhouse for your Chia pet. Keep the bag from touching the actual pet, though, or the seeds won't sprout. Take the bag off after 3 to 4 days when most of the seeds have sprouted. The air might be dry in arid or desert climates, or during winter in more moderate climates. If you’re having trouble getting the bag to stay up, put a long stick inside the watering hole of your pet, then place the bag on top of that. The stick will prop the bag up like a tent."

      "title": "Place the Chia Pet in a sunny spot and wait for the seeds to sprout.",
      "content": "Place the Chia Pet in a sunny spot and wait for the seeds to sprout. Choose your favorite windowsill, shelf, or table that receives some direct sunlight throughout the day. Some gardeners recommend waiting until the seedlings have already sprouted before moving the pet into a sunny spot. You’ll probably see the seeds begin to sprout after 3-5 days. [5] X Research source Ambient room lighting will usually work for a Chia Pet if you don’t have a great spot with direct sun available."

    {
      "title": "Water your Chia Pet for the first time after 2 days have passed.",
      "content": "Water your Chia Pet for the first time after 2 days have passed. By this time, the gel-coated seeds will have stuck securely to the pet. Fill the Chia Pet all the way through the fill hole located near the top of the pet. You may need a funnel or small watering can to avoid accidentally spilling water on your seeds and dislodging them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the water level every day and refill the pet when it drops.",
      "content": "Check the water level every day and refill the pet when it drops. Most Chia Pets will have a hole at the top for you to pour fresh water through. Use something with a narrow spout for refills, such as a water bottle or mini-watering can. Be careful not to drip on the pet—if you get any water on the actual seeds, they may slide off. [6] X Research source If you’re keeping your Chia Pet in direct sunlight, you’ll probably have to water it more frequently than if it were sitting in ambient room lighting."

    {
      "title": "Pour out excess water from the drip tray every day.",
      "content": "Pour out excess water from the drip tray every day. As you water your Chia Pet, you may notice some water gathering in the tray. Pour this water out as soon as possible or it will become stagnant (and potentially splash all over your table or floor, too). [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Turn the pet 180 degrees once a week if it's next to a window.",
      "content": "Turn the pet 180 degrees once a week if it's next to a window. This will help the seeds grow more evenly. Plants tend to grow towards the sun—if only one side of your pet is facing the sun, that side will be bushy and full while the other will be sparse and thin. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Restart your Chia Pet if you spot mold or mildew.",
      "content": "Restart your Chia Pet if you spot mold or mildew. Some white fuzz is normal when chia seeds first sprout. This fuzz is simply the root hairs, and they’ll disappear after the first week (mist the seeds daily to reduce the fuzzy appearance). If you notice white fuzz lingering after the first week, it means your Chia Pet is probably molding. Scrape off the seeds and start your Chia Pet over. [9] X Research source After you scrape the seeds off, soak the pet for 30 minutes in a solution of 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water. Rinse the pet well with fresh water, then plant your chia seeds again like before. Mold may form if the seeds are over-saturated with water. Make sure there’s no water inside the pet during the first 2 days, and skip the “greenhouse” bag if your climate is humid."

      "title": "Pull the sprouts off when they become unruly and overgrown.",
      "content": "Pull the sprouts off when they become unruly and overgrown. Simply pull them off and wash the Chia pet well using fresh water and a scrubbing brush. At this point, reuse the pet and plant more chia seeds if you would like. A well-cared for Chia Pet usually lasts between 2 weeks and a month. [10] X Research source Don't wait until the sprouts turn brown to pull them off. They will be harder to remove. Use chia seeds again or try substituting suitable seeds like alfalfa, basil, marjoram, thyme, or Timothy grass. [11] X Research source"
