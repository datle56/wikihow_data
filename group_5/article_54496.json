      "title": "Add ¼ cup (60 ml) of clear glue if the slime is made with liquid starch.",
      "content": "Add ¼ cup (60 ml) of clear glue if the slime is made with liquid starch . Measure out the clear glue, and place it directly into the bowl of slime. Use a spoon to mix it into the slime thoroughly, and once it starts to hold together, take the slime out and knead it. After 2-3 minutes, the slime should no longer be runny. [1] X Research source If ¼ cup (60 ml) of clear glue isn’t enough to thicken the slime, add another ¼ cup (60 ml) of clear glue and stir the mixture again. It should change to a thicker consistency. If you have the time, leave the slime in a sealed bag overnight once you have added the clear glue. This will help it to gel together."

      "title": "Use baking soda to thicken slime that is made with saline solution.",
      "content": "Use baking soda to thicken slime that is made with saline solution. Add an extra ¼ tsp (1 g) of baking soda to the slime if you have made it with clear glue. If you have used white glue, add an extra ½ tsp (2 g) of baking soda. Use a spoon to mix the extra baking soda into the slime and then knead it for 2-3 minutes. Add more baking soda if the slime is still too watery. [2] X Research source Baking soda is a necessary ingredient for making slime with saline solution, as it helps to thicken the mixture. Be careful not to add too much baking soda at once, as this can make the slime hard."

      "title": "Include more cornstarch to thicken cornstarch and glue slime.",
      "content": "Include more cornstarch to thicken cornstarch and glue slime. Use around 1 tsp (6.2 g) of extra cornstarch, and stir it into the slime. Cornstarch and glue slime can take a while to combine properly, so keep mixing for up to 5 minutes. [4] X Research source If it doesn't thicken, continue adding small amounts of cornstarch to the slime and then mixing it in. However, be careful not to add too much cornstarch at once, otherwise, the slime can turn hard."

      "title": "Add 1 small handful of shaving cream if you are thickening fluffy slime.",
      "content": "Add 1 small handful of shaving cream if you are thickening fluffy slime. If you have kneaded the slime and it is still runny or thin, add extra shaving cream. Simply add the extra shaving cream to the center of the slime, and knead it in. [5] X Research source Keep adding shaving cream until the slime reaches your preferred consistency."

      "content": "Use ¼ tbsp (0.43 g) of borax if you need to thicken Borax slime. Get the extra Borax, and place it into the bowl with the slime. Use a spoon to thoroughly stir it into the slime. Keep adding ¼ tbsp (0.43 g) of borax at a time until there is no excess liquid left' [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour out any excess liquid from the container.",
      "content": "Pour out any excess liquid from the container. Place the slime back into the bowl or container, and gently tilt it over the sink. Pour out as much excess liquid as possible. Drain the water slowly, and wait until there is no more excess liquid. [7] X Research source Hold the slime back with your hand, or press a plate over the bowl or container as you are draining it to prevent the slime from falling out. Leave a tiny gap so that the liquid can get through. You can remove the excess liquid from any type of slime, and this should help to make it slightly less watery. It’s a good idea to remove the excess liquid before you begin trying to thicken the slime."

      "content": "Knead the slime for approximately 5 minutes if it contains glue. Place the slime on a clean work surface. See if it becomes less watery as you knead it. Also try working the slime in your hands to remove some excess moisture. [8] X Research source Many types of slime, such as Borax, liquid starch, and saline solution, all contain either clear or white glue. These types of slime change in consistency as you knead them, and normally become less runny and thicker as you knead."

Keep the slime in the freezer for approximately 5-10 minutes, or until it has thickened sufficiently.
