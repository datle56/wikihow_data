      "content": "Reflect on the dangers of the first night. The two main worries of the first night were Nightmare Bonnie on the left and Nightmare Chica on the right. They may have sounded eerily similar to the untrained ear, but hopefully you noticed that there are indeed differences in the sounds they make. Knowing this will make you a more efficient player and, in turn, hopefully keep you alive longer. Try to focus on their respective sounds on this night. It is still not crucial to know exactly which is which, but this might very well be your only really good opportunity to try and relax and focus, instead of fearing for your life the whole time."

      "content": "Learn the new dangers of the second night. Monsters begin to creep at 12AM now as each night brings a new challenge to the bedroom. The difficulty ramps up with the addition of Foxy now stalking you, and you will soon realize the closets role in the game. Foxy, just like a fox, is quick and smart. Foxy will actively avoid being seen by you, briskly running from side to side, which is also very disorienting while listening for Bonnie and Chica. Foxy enters the room from either side door behind your back, and you will catch a glimpse of the closet opening and closing very briefly. Foxy has four stages: The initial jumpscare and head out of the closet, head retracted back into the closet, standing up with only the hook hand in view, and the sweet, innocent plushie phase."

      "title": "Keep Foxy in a harmless state.",
      "content": "Keep Foxy in a harmless state. Keeping Foxy outside of the room is ideal. Foxy can be heard as quick footsteps running from side to side, which will change if you follow the animatronic. If you take too long dealing with Chica or Bonnie, Foxy will run to the other side of the room and slip into the closet behind your back. You’ll know this happens when you return to the main area of the bedroom and see a quick animation of the closet door opening and closing slightly. Check the closet, and there will be a nonthreatening jumpscare. Keeping the flashlight on, close the closet door for a few seconds then open it. Foxy will only change states while the door is closed, so keep repeating this process until Foxy is in the plushie phase. Actively listen for Bonnie, Chica, and the Little Freddy’s on the bed while dealing with Foxy. Foxy’s plushie and hook phases are both considered safe, with either phase afterwards being danger zones, which puts your life at risk of an attack."

      "title": "Manage all four angles of attack.",
      "content": "Manage all four angles of attack. Foxy is not a major threat this night, which leaves you the opportunity to develop other skills. Little Freddy's screams can be heard, and the lights will begin to flicker if they build up on the bed for too long. It is always safe to assume there is at least one on the bed, so make a quick check after everything you do. If Foxy has entered into the room, run to the closet and return the animatronic to a safe phase, then quickly run back to the bed afterwards. Actively keep Bonnie and Chica away if they are heard. There is no need to keep checking for them when you know what sounds they make, which could waste precious time and lead to an attack. If either of them are heard walking down the hallway, take action to ward them off and return to the center of the room immediately afterwards. 6AM won’t come around so quickly on this night."
