      "content": "Focus on softer styles and looks to match your age. You may start to develop smile lines or wrinkles around your eyes, and your skin tone may become more uneven as you get older. To even out your skin tone and draw attention to your best features, like your eyes and lips, rather than your wrinkles, try making a few of these changes: [3] X Research source Wear lip gloss rather than lipstick. Lipstick can make your lips look more dried out and can settle into the cracks, making you look more aged. A gloss will make your lips look more supple. Use navy blue eyeliner rather than black or brown. As you age, the whites of your eyes get less white. Using navy blue eyeliner can help make the whites of your eyes look even whiter. Try out some neutral eyeshadows, like bronze, copper, and cocoa. Bright colors can draw attention to the wrinkles around your eyes, whereas neutral tones will make your skin look more even. Apply liquid foundation rather than powder. Powder can make your skin look drier and more cakey. A liquid foundation will provide your skin with a smooth, even look. If possible, look for a foundation that includes sunscreen for even more skin protection."
