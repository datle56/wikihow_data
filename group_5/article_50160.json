      "content": "Upright: The Ace of Pentacles symbolizes opportunity and new beginnings. You may not know it yet, but you’re on the path to achieving your goals and making your dreams a reality! Some kind of seed has been planted for your future—a practical offer, gift, opportunity, connection, or a need to focus on material matters that can help you succeed and build the comfortable, stable, fulfilling life you seek. [1] X Research source What to do: Think of grounded, actionable ways to manifest your desires into reality. What concrete, practical steps can you take right now to move forward? For example, maybe you’ve always wanted to open your own small business. Pulling the Ace of Pentacles could be a sign to put your plans in motion and draft a business plan, look at shop locations, or connect with other entrepreneurs with experience."

      "content": "Reversed: The Ace of Pentacles means poor planning, hesitancy, or greed. Consider this card a warning; you may have strayed from the path toward your goals because of rushed or flawed planning, poor financial management, or obsession with material gain. It’s also possible that a genuine opportunity is in front of you, but you’re too cautious or uncertain to seize it. [2] X Research source What to do: Recognize that money or material gain may be important, but they aren’t everything. What is it you truly want? Is it pure wealth, or the stability and comfort that success can bring? Research new opportunities that are presented to you before accepting, but don’t let fear or financial greed keep you from exploring the fruitful options life has to offer. For example, maybe you’re planning to move to a new town rather quickly and haphazardly. The reversed Ace of Pentacles could be a sign to slow down and reconsider your planning or options."

      "title": "Reversed",
      "content": "Reversed An upside-down Ace of Pentacles could mean that you’re missing out on opportunities for romance, possibly due to your own insecurities or wariness about the intentions of others. For singles, this could mean you’re approaching relationships the wrong way, like rushing in too fast or holding yourself back out of fear. For couples, you may feel like new uncertainty is creeping into your relationship, possibly from a lack of communication or financial strain. [4] X Research source What to do if you’re single: Take your time getting to know potential lovers so you can build a strong foundation. The universe wants you to find love, so approach new people thoughtfully and enter a relationship when you feel truly ready. What to do if you’re partnered: Set aside time to check in with your partner and discuss both of your needs and intentions. Communication leads to more stability and potential for growth, but sometimes, you might need help opening that door. If you’re looking for spiritual guidance in your relationship, we recommend Keen .

You may soon get a chance to rise up and prove yourself at your current job through a promotion, new leadership opportunity, or exciting project. Or, if your current job is draining or unfulfilling, your new dream job could be just around the corner. Be patient, though; big career moves and benefits rarely happen overnight. [5] X Research source What to do: Be proactive about new opportunities in your current position. There might be new trainings, skills, or projects available to you that could put you on a path of long-term development and success. If it’s time to move on, look for a fulfilling job that you’re passionate about and can commit to. Be measured and intentional with your search, and don’t jump ship too fast. Keep in mind that while career advances often come with a financial boost, this isn't guaranteed. Continue spending wisely and saving where you can regardless of what comes next."

[6] X Research source What to do: Be extra cautious when you’re making new business arrangements to make sure the other party has good intentions. Continue to be proactive and sharp-eyed at work so you don’t forget details or deadlines that could lead to a promotion or other reward."

[9] X Research source It happens to everyone sometimes; life gets busy, stress builds up, and things like work or family can take priority over your own health. However, neglecting your health problems (including your mental health and stress) can have negative long-term health consequences that can impact your success and quality of life. What to do: Reflect on your daily routines and look for places to make improvements (for example, swapping your Friday-night takeout with a home-cooked meal or scheduling time for a few short workouts a week). Reduce your stress levels through meditation, journaling, going for walks, or practicing a creative hobby like painting or playing an instrument."

      "content": "Reversed On the flip side, a reversed Ace of Pentacles card can mean you’re missing or ignoring chances to grow spiritually, perhaps because you’re distracted by material gains. While money and belongings are important, you can appreciate what you already have more fully if you shift your perspective to give equal weight to your spiritual and emotional needs. What to do: Reflect on what may be holding you back from feeling grounded or at peace with yourself. Are you working too much? Too focused on money? A good place to start is establishing a healthy work-life balance . Try drawing firmer boundaries around your working hours and schedule more time to do what you love, like spending time with your friends and family or pursuing your hobbies. If you’re feeling drained or uninspired, a personalized reading from a supportive Keen Advisor can help.

      "content": "Upright, the Ace of Pentacles means “yes.” If you’re asking a “yes or no” question or doing a one-card pull, this card is a green light to pursue your goal. The upright Ace of Pentacles is all about success, opportunity, and abundance, so it’s a positive omen for you! [10] X Research source When reversed, though, the Ace of Pentacles can mean “no.” There may be a flaw in your plans or some hesitancy about going forward, meaning you should take some time to reconsider your options."

      "title": "For questions about timing, your outcome may occur in 1 to 11 days.",
      "content": "For questions about timing, your outcome may occur in 1 to 11 days. However, remember that the suit of Pentacles—linked to the steady element of earth—is all about slow, consistent progress and growth. So, rather than expecting a sudden success or achievement in that timeframe, be on the lookout for opportunities that put your plans in motion. For example, if you’re asking the deck about meeting a significant other, chances are you won’t fall into a relationship within 11 days. But, you might just meet a potentially compatible person at that time; nurture that connection and over time, you may find your relationship! Other time frames associated with the Ace of Pentacles include the zodiac seasons of the earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn) or specific dates of a month (the 1st, 10th, 19th, and 28th). It’s easy to get frustrated when change feels slow. That’s why we like working with Keen so much. Their personable Advisors can help you see and appreciate the progress you’re making and give you guidance on what to do next. Visit Keen to learn more and remember, you’ve got this!"

      "content": "The Ace of Pentacles depicts a hand descending from the sky, holding a gold coin with a pentagram. The coin (a pentacle) is associated with the element of earth and symbolizes wealth and the material world. Beneath the coin is a lush garden representing growth, abundance, and prosperity. A mountain in the background is symbolic of the effort it takes to achieve your goals, while the flowing creek indicates emotional ambition and forward momentum. [11] X Research source This imagery is found in the standard Rider-Waite Tarot deck. Cards from other decks may show similar or different images. In Tarot, the Suit of Pentacles belongs to the Minor Arcana (cards representing aspects of our daily lives). It symbolizes stability, security, wealth, and everything to do with the material world.
