    {
      "title": "Choose alternatives for Miya.",
      "content": "Choose alternatives for Miya. Miya is not a meta hero, but she can be considered in some cases. Nevertheless, select Beatrix, Clint, or Karrie to equal her Reap specialty, or choose Hanabi, Layla, or Natan for her Damage specialty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Note her Passive (Moon Blessing).",
      "content": "Note her Passive (Moon Blessing). When Miya uses her basic attack, her attack speed increases by 5% and stacks up to 5 times (up to 25%). Once she reaches five stacks, she enhances her basic attack, as a clone of Miya is summoned to copy her basic attack with an extra physical attack. [1] X Research source You can notice this passive below her HP/Mana bar - making usage of her passive a cinch!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use her first skill (Moon Arrow).",
      "content": "Use her first skill (Moon Arrow). Her basic attack is immediately enhanced, allowing Miya to shoot three arrows at enemies. For the primary target, Miya gives 60 (plus all of her physical attack stats) physical attack, and 30% physical damage to any remaining targets. [2] X Research source This can be used to either push lanes quickly or to fastly finish enemies during team fights! This skill should be upgraded first when starting the game as it enhances her basic attack (and it clears lanes quickly)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take her second skill (Arrow of Eclipse) into account.",
      "content": "Take her second skill (Arrow of Eclipse) into account. Miya will launch an empowered arrow attack in a designated area, immobilizing enemies and dealing up to 240 physical damage to enemies in the area. The skill splits the arrows into eight minor arrows, dealing physical damage and slowing enemies. [3] X Research source Although this skill doesn't improve her basic attack, she can use this skill to initiate an attack on an enemy. The immobilization should quickly get you to use your attacks to shine brightly!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Gank well with her ult (Hidden Moonlight).",
      "content": "Gank well with her ult (Hidden Moonlight). Miya debuffs herself and conceals herself and increases her movement speed by 65% (by max level) for two seconds. Once she uses her skills (or after two seconds), she gains full stacks of Moon Blessing as well. [4] X Research source Use her ult to start a team fight, and couple it with her other skills. This will take enemies by surprise and others can initiate attacking while you use your arrows!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Select her equipment.",
      "content": "Select her equipment. With Miya's battle focused on her basic attacks, it's important to increase her attack speed. Buy Swift Boots to start, then either buy Windtalk, Haasâ€™s Claws and Demon Hunter Sword to grow to her attack speed. To quickly kill enemies, add Berserkers Fury to increase her critical damage, Endless Battle to gain lifesteal to stave during team fights, and Blade of Despair to finish enemies once and for all. As an alternative, add Wind of Nature to protect yourself from physical attacks. [5] X Research source For her battle spell, choose Flicker to dash away during situations, Inspire to enhance her attack speed, or Purify to cure herself during team fights."

    {
      "title": "Decide on her emblem.",
      "content": "Decide on her emblem. This seems obvious, but you can either choose the Assassin or the Marksman emblem. For the Marksman emblem, upgrade Fatal (for her critical damage) and Swift (to up her attack speed), and select Weakness Finder to slow enemies down while attacking. If you want the Assassin emblem, choose Agility (to increase her movement speed), Invasion (to max her Physical Penetration), and Killing Spree to increase her HP after every kill. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Know a combo for Miya.",
      "content": "Know a combo for Miya. The main combo for Miya is Hidden Moonlight - Arrow of Eclipse - Moon Arrow (Moon Blessing). Use Hidden Moonlight to quickly get near an enemy, then use Arrow of Eclipse to immobilize enemies, and use your basic attack while pairing it with Moon Arrow to kill enemies. This is best suited when soloing against a low-HP hero (Marksman/Mages), or during a team fight (when you want to initiate)."
