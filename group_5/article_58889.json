      "content": "Watch your dog as it moves around and see if it ‘bunny hops’. Dogs that have painful hips take shortened steps and tend to hold their rear legs farther forward under their bellies. This can lead to ‘bunny hopping’, which means your dog is holding its back legs together and hopping rather than running in long strides like normal. Watch your dog to see if it: Swivels its hips a lot when it walks Holds its back legs together so that when it walks its back legs hop in a bunny-like fashion Limps or has other abnormal movements Tips over easily Has a change in character, such as unusual grumpiness, which may be a sign of pain"

      "content": "See if your dog has a hard time getting up or lying down. Pain caused by hip dysplasia can get worse the longer your dog remains in a resting position. This is particularly true in the morning after your dog has slept all night. [1] X Research source Adams, W. M., Dueland, R. T., Meinen, J., O'Brien, R. T., Giuliano, E., &amp; Nordheim, E. V.

Because of this, you might notice that your dog: Hesitates to lie down if it is standing up Has a harder time getting up if it is lying down Seems stiffer in the morning or when the weather is cold"

[2] X Research source Fries, C. L., &amp; Remedios, A. M. (1995). The pathogenesis and diagnosis of canine hip dysplasia: a review. The Canadian Veterinary Journal, 36(8), 494. All dogs slow down as they get older, but a decrease in activity should not occur until your dog is an advanced age. If your dog is not ill or overweight, it should maintain roughly the same activity levels from when it turns 1 to well into its mature years. Look for: A lack of interest in going on runs or doing other physical activities with you Lying down rather than running around in the backyard Getting tired more easily when playing fetch Preferring to sit rather than stand and walk when on the leash"

      "content": "Listen for an audible clicking sound when your dog moves. The term ‘creaking bones’ can be applied to a dog with hip dysplasia. You might notice a clicking sound when your dog moves. This is its bones clicking and loosening up. Listen for this noise when your dog: Gets up after lying down for a while Walks Runs"

      "content": "Check to see if your dog is willing to climb up stairs. You might notice that your dog suddenly has a harder time, or is hesitant to climb, stairs that it has never had a hard time navigating in the past. This is because hip dysplasia makes it harder for your dog to climb up stairs or walk up slopes, as your dog’s back legs are stiff and it can’t control them as well as it used to."

To pass the time, they tend to lick and groom themselves more often than normal. If you notice that your dog is spending more time grooming itself, check it for rashes or hair loss, as both of these things can be caused by excessive grooming.

This condition is called atrophy. Feel along your dog’s back legs for things like: [3] X Research source Adams, W. M., Dueland, R. T., Meinen, J., O'Brien, R. T., Giuliano, E., &amp; Nordheim, E. V.

In particular, you may notice that your puppy has a harder time moving around than other puppies. It may: Take shorter steps or have less of a stride Hold its back legs together and use its front legs more so that it can hop with its back legs, much like a bunny"

      "content": "Look to see if your puppy has a hard time getting up after playing. While playing might be fine for your puppy, you should still keep an eye on it to see how it handles resting after play. A pup that has hip dysplasia will be more inclined to lie down for longer, and may act like it doesn’t want to get up after it has rested. This is because its hips become stiff when resting after activity. [4] X Research source Ginja, M. M. D., Silvestre, A. M., Gonzalo-Orden, J. M., &amp; Ferreira, A. J. A. (2010).

      "title": "See if your pup or young dog is hesitant to jump up on things.",
      "content": "See if your pup or young dog is hesitant to jump up on things. If your pup has hip dysplasia, it will most likely avoid jumping up on couches, your lap, etc. This is because its back legs are not as strong as its front legs, and it could hurt to exert enough force on its back legs to jump up onto things. Pat the couch next to you. If your puppy looks like it wants to jump up but doesn’t, or tries to and then whines in pain, it may have hip dysplasia."

This might lead to your dog developing an unsteady walk that could be described as: Wobbling Weaving Tipping over a lot"

      "content": "Look at how your puppy stands and see if it puts more weight on its front legs. Puppies and young dogs with hip dysplasia tend to stand with their rear legs slightly forward, so that their front legs can support more of their weight. This can lead to their forearms being much more developed than their hind legs. [5] X Research source Ginja, M. M. D., Silvestre, A. M., Gonzalo-Orden, J. M., &amp; Ferreira, A. J. A. (2010). Diagnosis, genetic control and preventive management of canine hip dysplasia: a review. The Veterinary Journal, 184(3), 269-276. When your puppy is standing: Check to see if its hind legs are pressed slightly forward. Feel its forearms, which may be muscular, compared to its hind legs, which might feel bony."

Ask your vet for a recommended feeding guide that you can follow. Most dog foods have a recommended feeding amount, and following it is sufficient. Your dog can become obese when: The recommended daily feed allowance is exceeded. When your dog consumes high energy snacks but doesn’t get enough exercise."

In particular, swimming is a gentle exercise that can keep your dog fit and pain-free. Break your dog’s exercise up into short exercises each day. [6] X Research source For example, going on two short 10-minutes walks, and then letting your dog swimming for 10 or 20 minutes, is better than taking your dog for a long 30 minute walk."

Total Hip Replacement is recommended for dogs with degenerative arthritis or chronic hip dysplasia."
