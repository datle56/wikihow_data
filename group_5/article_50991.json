      "title": "The BeReal notification is random each day.",
      "content": "The BeReal notification is random each day. Even the BeReal team cannot predict when the notification will arrive, as it is truly randomized each day. BeReal gives you two minutes from when the notification is sent to be considered on time, which grants you a bonus BeReal that you can post later in the day. Even if you miss the initial notification, you can still post your BeReal at any time after the notification has been sent."

      "title": "The timing of the BeReal notification is specific to each time zone.",
      "content": "The timing of the BeReal notification is specific to each time zone. Everyone in your time zone receives the notification at the same time. [1] X Research source BeReal only recognizes four simplified time zones: Americas Europe West Asia East Asia"

      "title": "Make sure your time zone is accurate.",
      "content": "Make sure your time zone is accurate. If you see your friends posting their BeReals but you have not received your notification, it may be because you have the wrong time zone set on the app. This can happen when you download the app in one time zone, then move to another. You will not receive any notification on the day that you update your time zone. To change your time zone: Tap your profile icon in the top-right corner. Tap the ⋮ option to enter the settings. Select Time Zone and tap the appropriate option. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ensure you have notifications enabled.",
      "content": "Ensure you have notifications enabled. Although notifications should be enabled for BeReal by default, it is possible you disabled notifications when you first installed the app. iOS: Settings > BeReal > Notifications and toggle “Allow Notifications” to the on position. Android: Settings > Apps > BeReal > Notifications and toggle “All BeReal notifications” on atop the page."

    {
      "title": "Ensure you do not have Do Not Disturb turned on.",
      "content": "Ensure you do not have Do Not Disturb turned on. Do Not Disturb (or Focus on iPhone and iPad) will block all non-essential notifications, preventing you from seeing the BeReal notification. Ensure you are not in Do Not Disturb to guarantee that you will get the notification from BeReal."

      "title": "Android users can clear the app's cache.",
      "content": "Android users can clear the app's cache. If you continue to experience issues with the BeReal notification, try clearing the app's cache . Only Android allows users to do so, but iOS users can try uninstalling and reinstalling the app instead. Navigate to Settings > Apps > BeReal > Storage & cache > Clear cache."

      "title": "Open the BeReal notification via your notifications panel.",
      "content": "Open the BeReal notification via your notifications panel. It may sound obvious, but the only way to get rid of the BeReal notification is to open the app through it. Some users have noticed that swiping it away only allows it to return soon after. You may also be tempted to open the app after seeing the notification, but a bug may keep the notification in place even if you have already posted that day's BeReal. Open the app directly through the notification to guarantee it disappears."
