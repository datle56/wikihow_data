      "content": "Only a few laptops have an HDMI-IN port. Check your laptop's manual or look online to see if your model has an HDMI-IN or OUT port. Most laptops have an OUT port so the images on your laptop can project on another screen."

      "content": "It's incredibly slow and runs the chance of damaging your laptop. HDMI was never meant to provide power to your laptop, so there are a few risks involved. The power from an HDMI port carries 5v while most laptop chargers provide is usually 18-20v, so it's considerably underpowered. If you connect to the wrong port (like two laptops that both have HDMI-OUT ports), you can short-circuit those laptops. HDMI ports do not provide the same safety features that your charging cable has. This means that there's no protection when your laptop battery is full of charge (which is a problem when an HDMI offers slow charging, so you plug it in and walk away). Know that you only charge via HDMI temporarily. Sustaining the low-power charge can damage your laptop."

Only use this method if you're sure that you have an HDMI-IN port as using an HDMI-OUT port may cause damage to both devices."

      "content": "Plug the HDMI end of the cable into the HDMI-OUT port of the device. Common items that have HDMI-OUT ports include TVs, laptops, DVD players, and Blu-ray players. This method requires the use of an extra tool since many modern laptops have USB-C ports instead of HDMI-IN ports. If you don't have an HDMI-IN port on your laptop, this adapter is required. You can purchase an HDMI-IN to USB-C Adapter from any electronics retailer. Make sure it's an HDMI-IN to USB-C adapter since HDMI-OUT adapters are much more common."
