      "content": "Spelunker Potions can be crafted with common ingredients. You'll need one Bottled Water, one Blinkroot, one Moonglow, and one Gold Ore or Platinum Ore. You can craft Spelunker Potions at a Placed Bottle or an Alchemy Table. [1] X Research source Bottled Water can be obtained from any sink or water source if you have an empty bottle. Blinkroot is an Herb that grows in Dirt or Mud. It's usually found in the Underground layer and can be harvested easily without any weapons or tools. Moonglow is an herb that grows on Jungle Grass (both surface Jungle and Underground Jungle). You can find this Herb more easily at night as this is when the plant blooms. Gold Ore and Platinum Ore both spawn in the Underground and Cavern Layers. They are counterparts, and you may find either Gold or Platinum."
