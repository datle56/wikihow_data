If you’ve got “bags” under your eyes and the color of the skin is slightly different than the rest of your face, you’ve likely got a common condition known as periorbital hyperpigmentation. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This sounds scary, but it’s perfectly harmless. It’s also exceptionally common across the globe. [2] X Research source Unfortunately, it’s hereditary and you may not be able to totally get rid of it. There are still plenty of things you can do to minimize the puffiness, though!

      "content": "Puffy eyes can be a natural part of getting older. Another common cause for puffy eyes is your age. The skin under your eyes is naturally much thinner than the rest of the skin on your face. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source As you get older, the fat under that thinner skin moves around easily, and you end up with tiny gaps under your eyes. Fluid can accumulate in those gaps, which makes it seem like your eyes are puffy.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Diets that are high in salt can also cause puffy eyes since excess sodium can make your body retain more fluids, and fluids have an easy time accumulating under your eyes. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If this is the case, dealing with your puffy eyes may be as simple as treating your allergies or avoiding salty food. In some cases, there may be an underlying condition triggering the bags around your eyes. There are a handful of thyroid problems can cause this, for example. If you have any other symptoms popping up alongside your puffy eyes, go see a doctor just to be on the safe side. It’s unlikely you’re sick, but it’s best to be sure.

      "content": "Counterintuitively, extra sleep may make the problem worse. Gravity pulls the loose skin under your eyes downward during the day, so when you lie down to sleep, there’s extra slack in that part of your face. This gives the fluids in your face an unfortunately convenient place to accumulate. The longer you’re lying down, the more time this fluid has to build up under your eyes.

[14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The fluids accumulate in this space partly because of the shape of your skull. If you picture your head when you’re lying down, your eye sockets kind of form these little valleys in your head. As a result, all of that fluid slowly trickles down to the area under your eyes."

Instead of lying perfectly flat with your head on a small pillow, stack a few pillows on top of one another so that you sleep with your upper body at a raised angle.

[18] X Research source In addition, since alcohol causes you to urinate more often, it can leave you dehydrated after a long night of drinking. [19] X Research source As a result, drinking more water during the day and cutting back on alcohol before bed may make your eyes less puffy over time. Cutting down on the amount of fluid you consume in the hour or two before bed may help as well. Don’t avoid drinking water if you’re thirsty or anything like that, but just be conscious of how much fluid you’re consuming.

In theory, caffeine will reduce the puffiness under your eyes. However, there’s no scientific evidence that the caffeine has much of an impact, and it’s likely that cold tea bags simply work because they’re cold. Still, they will work if you want to use some tea bags instead of cucumbers or a cold compress!
