      "title": "Raise your Sneak skill.",
      "content": "Raise your Sneak skill. If nobody witnesses you killing a non-aggressive NPC, it won't lower your reputation and will have no consequence for your gameplay other than Karma loss. For a better chance of being undetected, try raising your sneak skill to at least 50. Unlike in games like Skyrim, practicing sneaking does not increase your character's Sneak skill. Only skill books, magazines and levelling up can do so. You can also increase your characters Agility, either through perks or implants at the New Vegas Medical Clinic."

      "title": "Acquire a pair of Spiked Knuckles.",
      "content": "Acquire a pair of Spiked Knuckles. If you're going to kill this NPC in a populated area, you're going to need to do it quickly and quietly - which means a gun won't do. Knives are quiet, but not particularly powerful, and melee weapons are too big. Brass Knuckles will also do the trick, if your Unarmed skill is raised a bit (30 or 40 should do)."

      "content": "Wear some light clothing. Bulky armor is easily noticeable, so wear something tight. Leather armor works fine."
