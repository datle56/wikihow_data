It’s a great way to build anticipation and tell her that you’re taking this seriously. You could also text her: [6] X Research source “Just looking at restaurants.

When a girl texts you “wyd” out of the blue in the middle of the night, she might have more sexual intentions than romantic ones. If you aren’t into hookup culture or you’re just not that into her, you can ignore her message until the morning. If you don’t want to respond at all, that’s okay, too. [11] X Research source A “wyd” text is slightly lazy, and it doesn’t show a ton of effort on her part. If you think she’s just texting you out of obligation, you don’t have to respond if you don’t want to. You might also want to ignore a late night “wyd” if you know she’s been drinking."
