      "title": "Choose a bottle you like.",
      "content": "Choose a bottle you like. Pick a bottle with an eye-catching shape or a funky color. For the purposes of making a bong, a bottle with a wide, contoured based and a narrow neck will work best. Make sure the bottle is empty and clean before you begin drilling. [1] X Research source Tequila and specialty liquor bottles tend to have shapes that make them ideal for converting them into bongs. Look for especially unique bottles to use if you think you might put your bong on display, or if you plan to make a bong for someone as a gift."

      "title": "Acquire a set of glass drill bits.",
      "content": "Acquire a set of glass drill bits. Pick up a set of glass drill bits from your local hardware store. These can also be found at most superstores like Walmart and Target. A small set of 3 or 4 bits will do just fine; you're just looking to work up to a 1/2\" bit to drill the right size hole for the bowl stem later on. [2] X Research source Drill bits come in sets that include as few as 3 bits or as many as 15. A smaller set will of course be cheaper and should be all you'll need for this project, provided that the set includes a 1/2\" bit, as this will accommodate most bong stems."

      "title": "Place a piece of duct tape where you want to drill the hole.",
      "content": "Place a piece of duct tape where you want to drill the hole. Take a small strip of duct tape and stick it where you plan to drill the hole for your stem (somewhere in the upper third of the bottle near the middle of the base will probably work best). The tape will provide traction to hold your bit in place as you drill. Masking tape or painter's tape may also fulfill this function."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drill the hole.",
      "content": "Drill the hole. Drilling slowly, start with the smallest bit and work your way up to a 1/2\" bit for the optimum hole size for the stem. Starting with a smaller bit and moving up gradually will prevent the glass from cracking or breaking from the force of the drill. [3] X Research source Applying too much pressure while drilling can shatter the bottle. Go slow, and make sure you're drilling smoothly and evenly. Electric drills are dangerous tools. Care should be taken when drilling to avoid injury."

    {
      "title": "Get a glass bong stem.",
      "content": "Get a glass bong stem. Purchase a glass stem or set of stems to fit the hole you drilled. Check to see if you have a tobacco or \"head\" shop in your area, as stems are typically sold there, or buy one online and have it delivered. A bong stem sometimes includes a bowl; if not, you'll need to snag one of these too. As the hole you drilled was 1/2\" in diameter, you should look for a stem with roughly the same width, and it should be long enough to reach to the midpoint of the bottle so that the bottom of the stem is partially submerged once you fill the bottle with water. Bong stems come in various diameters and lengths. You may have to do some checking to find the right fit for the bottle you're using. If you're unsure about the size, it might be smart to buy a couple different stems and see what works best. An average glass bong stem runs between $5 and $10, depending on where you look. If you do have to buy the bowl and stem separately, make sure the bowl is the appropriate size for the stem (the measurements should be displayed prominently on the package) and attach the two by sliding the bowl onto the thicker end of the stem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fit the stem and bowl into the drilled hole.",
      "content": "Fit the stem and bowl into the drilled hole. Double-check that the hole is the proper size to accommodate the stem before you remove the tape. If the hole is too small, you can move up one bit size and carefully re-drill to touch it up. The stem should insert all the way into the hole up to the bottom of the bowl. If the hole you've drilled is too large, you can constrict it a little when you seal it by fitting it with a rubber ring, or by using a slightly wider stem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal around the hole.",
      "content": "Seal around the hole. Use a coat of clear silicone to seal the area around the drilled hole. Sealing the hole will cover its rough edges and improve the bong's suction. Alternatively, a rubber ring can be purchased at any smoke shop to allow removal of the steam to facilitate cleaning. [4] X Research source Silicone sealant is flexible, non-toxic and forms a tight seal. A 2-ounce tube of liquid silicone sealant can be purchased for under $10 most places and is easy to apply."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow the sealant to cure overnight.",
      "content": "Allow the sealant to cure overnight. Give the silicone time to set up before filling or using the bong. Liquid silicone sealant usually takes between 4-6 hours to dry completely. Once the silicone dries, the hole will be water-tight when the stem is inserted to prevent spillage and keep smoke from escaping through the edges of the hole."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean the bottle again.",
      "content": "Clean the bottle again. It's likely that glass dust or other residue might have gotten into the bottle during the drilling process. Rinse the new bong out thoroughly, including around the sealed drill hole, to make it safe to use. Glass dust is especially hazardous to breathe or ingest, and it only takes a few moments to clean your new bong. Don't skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Customize your bong.",
      "content": "Customize your bong. If you want, you can now add some pizzazz to your bong. Apply stickers or decals, etch your name into the glass or draw on the bottle with paint pens. Personalizing your homemade bong will make it stand out even more, which is a great touch if you choose to display it or give it as a gift."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the bong for use.",
      "content": "Prepare the bong for use. Fill your new bong up with water past the bottom of the stem. Drawing in the smoke through the water turns the smoke you inhale to a smooth vapor and allows for a less harsh smoking experience. Place your favorite smoking product in the bowl and you're ready to go!"
