Use your flat iron to achieve pin-straight hair or sleek hair: If you want pin-straight hair, divide your tresses into small sections. Your sections should be about .5 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. For thicker or coarse hair, you'll need to use smaller sections. Begin with the bottom layers and glide the flat iron over each small section a few times before moving on the next section. If you desire sleek hair, divide your locks into large sections. Move the tightly clamped flat iron slowly down the length of your hair. This allows the heat to penetrate your hair while minimizing your locks' contact with direct heat. Repeat on each section of hair. Brush--don't comb--through your hair! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Thin your hair. Have your stylist use thinning shears to reduce the volume of your unruly hair or do it yourself at home. Before you start the process, make sure your hair is dry. Divide your hair into fistful-sized sections. Grab one section of hair and close the thinning shears halfway down the length of your hair shaft. Open the shears slightly and move them down the length of your hair. Stop half an inch above the ends of your hair. Once you have thinned a section, comb through your hair a few times to determine if you have achieved your ideal thickness. Repeat as needed before moving on to the next section. If you want to thin your hair at home, you can purchase a pair of thinning shears either online or at a local beauty store. Thinning shears allow you to safely thin out your hair. Do not start the thinning process too close to your roots! You may over thin your hair. Instead, begin lower on the shaft and work up towards the roots if needed. Try to thin all the sections evenly. Comb through the sections to assess your progress. Even out any sections that are too thick. [12] X Research source"
