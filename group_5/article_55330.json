      "content": "Funny messages Get your girl laughing first thing in the morning! Ask silly questions, throw in a silly movie/meme reference, or use emojis to give your message a silly vibe: “Good morning, starshine… the earth says hello! You’re going to achieve great things today… unless you’re still asleep.” “Good morning, baby… don’t fall asleep after reading this text! T minus 15 hours until we can get back to bed.” “Top o’ the morning, govna! You know what they say—the best part of waking up… is getting to sleep in 16 hours.” “What do lobsters drink in the morning? Claw-fee! How do skeletons like their eggs? Terri-fried!

      "content": "Friendly messages Maybe your girlfriend is more relaxed. She doesn't want flirty or romantic messages first thing in the morning, she just wants to know you're thinking of her. Try one of these casual messages instead: “Morning! What was the name of the coffee shop you mentioned the other day? I'd love to check it out with you sometime.” “Good morning! I hope your day is full of smiles. Though, I gotta be honest... I still can’t get over what you said yesterday. How is Shrek better than Shrek 2?!” “Just remembered the time we almost broke the copier at your first job😂 I hope you don’t get into too much trouble today!”"

      "title": "Reflect on her personality to craft a message that's perfect for her.",
      "content": "Reflect on her personality to craft a message that's perfect for her. Does your girlfriend cry easily? Does she adore compliments? Is she a full-on romantic, or is she more laid back? Think about your partner’s interests and attachment style, then tailor your message to make her feel even more moved. Use these tips if you want to do more than just a standard copy-and-paste message: Compliment her outfit if she’s into fashion: “You looked really good in that dress last night. How is it possible for you to look so gorgeous in everything you wear? You always manage to take my breath away.” Include an energizing song if she’s all about music: Try “ENERGY” by Beyoncé with the message, \"Thought you could use a little pick-me-up this morning... I know I could use the extra boost! What kinds of songs have you been jamming out to recently? I'd love to get my hands on your playlist.\" Include a date suggestion if quality time is her love language: “What’s on your schedule today? I want to take you out to lunch if you’re free! There's this coffee shop near my place that I think you'll really dig.” Surprise her with breakfast if food's the way to her heart: “There may or may not be donuts waiting for you in the kitchen. Don't take the cruller, though! If that tasty treat is missing when I come back, there will be war.” Send her a daily horoscope if she’s into astrology: “Starting today, Libras are going to experience a period of inner transformation… Can you feel it? I may need your help figuring out my horoscope, though. I'm totally lost!”"

      "content": "Incorporate thoughtful details to personalize your message. To create a unique message that makes your partner smile, look back on your favorite memories with her. Try to add small snippets of previous conversations to show that you care about her, or get creative and find a way to surprise her. Not sure what to do? Here are a few personalization tips to help you get started: Mention something she said earlier in conversation: “I was thinking about what you said about the moon yesterday, because I thought it was so beautiful. Every time I look at the moon now, I never fail to think of you.” Send a candid photo of her that she didn’t know you took: “This photo makes me smile, because you look more beautiful studying than most people do on their best day. I could honestly stare at this picture of you all day...” Spell out exactly what you love about her: “I had a friend ask about my new girlfriend yesterday. Wanna guess what I told them? I said she’s nuts about soccer, she’s got gorgeous brown eyes, and she’s the strongest person I’ve ever met.” Mention concrete details about her life to show that you know her: \"Sometimes I just think about how lucky I am that your family moved from Reno to Boston. Imagine if we'd never met? I thank my lucky stars every day that you fell into my life.\""
