Brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Walk around as if you’re going backwards through time. Talk to yourself in a different language. Whatever you can do to mix it up, do it! [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Doing this forms new pathways and connections in your brain. Quite often we take for granted how easy life is, especially once we get the basics down. When you mix it up, your brain has to relearn the skill, challenging it all the more."

      "title": "Sleep when your brain actually wants it.",
      "content": "Sleep when your brain actually wants it. Some people are in their prime thinking zone at 9 in the morning. Some at 9 at night. Even others at 2 AM or whenever they’ve finished their third cup of coffee. Since everyone is different, sleep when your brain wants it. Do you do your best work at night? Then sleep late. You’re not being lazy, you’re being wise! [8] X Research source Aim to get a solid 7-9 hours of sleep a night, too. When you're tired, your brain can't function at 100%. It cuts down what it thinks it can, sort of putting you in hibernation mode, and only does what it absolutely has to to keep you alive and breathing. Consistent inadequate sleep also prevents your brain from developing to its full potential, and can lead to various mental and physical illnesses down the line."

      "content": "Do word puzzles and problem-solving games. To stave off dementia and to keep your brain churning away at high speeds, make sure to do puzzles and games regularly – which means (in this day and age) more time on the Internet and your phone!

      "title": "Take the tests over and over.",
      "content": "Take the tests over and over. Just like that chemistry test you had to take four times in high school to pass, IQ tests aren’t all that different. They have the same basic structure and types of questions over and over. Therefore, the more you take it, the better you’ll do. The tests you can take for free online aren't like the actual tests you might take through a career center or a psychiatrist. If you want your real IQ, you'll have to take the real thing. There is generally a fee, so always try your hardest."

      "content": "Get new experiences. When you do the same thing day in and day out, the brain sort of goes on autopilot. It stops taking in stimuli, comfortable in its surroundings. When you have new experiences though, the brain wakes up and takes it all in, revving up for a change. So instead of popping in that DVD tonight, find a museum, a show, or a new place to check out to keep your mental clock ticking wildly. Even just visiting a new place or trying a new food is a good experience. You're widening your knowledge, making yourself better informed for future decisions. However, the more different they are, the better. Consider it an excuse for an exotic vacation!"

[11] X Research source Learning another language is a great way to get the brain working on new pathways.
