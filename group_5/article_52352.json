      "content": "Manipulative people are comfortable when they know what to expect. Some egoistic people work hard to learn how to get certain reactions (mostly praise) out of you because their self-worth is defined by what others think. When you do or say something unpredictable, they completely unravel because their primary defense mechanism—knowing how to play you—is gone. [2] X Research source Throw them off their game by: Changing how you react to their grandiose claims (if you typically push back, try randomly agreeing with them to confuse them). Taking a new leadership position over them if you’re coworkers or classmates. Suddenly showing them little or no reaction to their behavior."

      "title": "People with big egos often expect others to do things for them.",
      "content": "People with big egos often expect others to do things for them. An inflated sense of their own importance may make them feel entitled to special treatment from everyone. Start saying “no” to their requests—they won’t know how to react to the rejection at first and will be shocked to have to manage on their own. [3] X Research source They may try to persuade you to regain control of you. Stay firm and stick to your boundaries —backpedaling is an invitation for them to keep poking. Over time, they may learn to respect your boundaries. Switching up when you say “yes” and when you say “no” is a good way to make yourself unpredictable and keep them on their toes. Reader Poll: We asked 264 wikiHow readers for their most effective way to protect themselves from love bombing, and 55% of them said, recognizing and setting healthy boundaries. [Take Poll] Narcissists often turn on the charm to get what they want. Setting firm boundaries shuts that love bombing down."

      "title": "They may want you to blow up so they can villainize you.",
      "content": "They may want you to blow up so they can villainize you. If they can’t get your attention, they might try to elicit a negative emotional response from you and paint themselves as a victim. They’ll point to your outburst as evidence that you’re mean or volatile. Confuse them by keeping your cool—put on a neutral face, speak calmly, and stick to the facts. Don’t mention anything about how you feel or bring up past emotional experiences with them. [4] X Research source Disarm them by: Non-judgmentally commenting on what’s happening, like “There isn’t a reason to be upset right now” or “Your behavior seems aggressive.” Giving them simple “yes” or “no” answers to their questions and trying not to directly agree or disagree with them. Using your body language to show them you’re relaxed and unbothered: keep your muscles relaxed and your arms uncrossed."

      "title": "It’s exactly what it sounds like: be as useless and boring as a gray rock.",
      "content": "It’s exactly what it sounds like: be as useless and boring as a gray rock. Manipulative or self-absorbed people may only want others around to use them or to entertain themselves. If you don’t have anything to offer them, they’ll get puzzled and leave you alone. To use the gray rock method , don't show any physical expression, respond in as few words as possible, and be as boring and unhelpful as you can be. [5] X Research source This is a great, subtle tactic to use when you’re stuck with this person and can’t remove yourself from the situation. They’ll likely poke and prod to get some kind of rise out of you. Eventually, they’ll either drop their manipulative act and interact with you in a polite and maybe even genuine way—or they’ll leave you alone to seek attention from someone else."

      "title": "Manipulative people often gather info about you to control you later.",
      "content": "Manipulative people often gather info about you to control you later. They’ll find ways to twist your secrets, past experiences, or insecurities to their own advantage. The solution? Be an enigma to them and offer no personal information about yourself. The less they have on you, the more confused they’ll be by you. [6] X Research source It’s hard to withhold information if you live with a narcissistic family member or partner. Try to only share what’s necessary. Keep conversations brief and avoid personal topics like your childhood or love life. Always speak carefully when you answer their questions about you. It’s hard for manipulative people to misquote silence. When in doubt, just stop talking to them."

      "title": "A manipulative person is strongest when they're in the room talking at you.",
      "content": "A manipulative person is strongest when they're in the room talking at you. Their game is mostly verbal, so confuse them by simply not playing along. Look for ways mid-chat to leave them hanging—use the restroom, fake a phone call, or find an excuse to end the conversation. They’ll doubt their manipulative abilities if they can’t hold you in a conversation. [7] X Research source Disengaging is a self-care tactic too. Talking with a self-absorbed or toxic person can often feel frustrating, depleting, and like you’re hitting your head against a wall. If they start to yell or get verbally abusive, leave the room or hang up the phone to reinforce that you will not let them talk that way to you."

      "title": "Self-important people get confused when people don’t want to talk to them.",
      "content": "Self-important people get confused when people don’t want to talk to them. They’re the ones that are used to discarding people, so when it happens in reverse, they feel confused, defeated, and maybe even panicked. Don’t answer their calls, texts, or DM’s, or interact with them at all if you can help it. [8] X Research source The more desperate they are for attention, the uglier their attempts to reach you will be. Going “no contact” is a tool many controlling people use to passive-aggressively manipulate others. They’ll be thrown off by a taste of their own medicine."

      "title": "It's rare for someone to call out a toxic person for their behavior.",
      "content": "It's rare for someone to call out a toxic person for their behavior. They’re used to everyone believing them or just going along with it. Be blunt and tell them, “You’ll say anything to seem right.” They’ll flail and lie again to save face, so just call them out again (“See? You just did it again!”). [9] X Research source This tactic is even more effective if you do it while other people are around to witness it."

      "title": "Manipulative people often lie to protect their image or control others.",
      "content": "Manipulative people often lie to protect their image or control others. A simple clarifying question directed back at them will give them pause. They’ll often do a total 180 and change opinions, ideas, or stories when they realize you’re not falling for their faulty logic. [10] X Research source Ask them things like: “Can you explain that timeline again? It sounds like you were in 2 places at the same time…” “Did you mean to take all the credit for a team project, or was that an accident?” “Are you asking me to help you with the yardwork, or just to do it all for you?”"

      "title": "Egoists falter when validation is pulled out from under them.",
      "content": "Egoists falter when validation is pulled out from under them. People with massive egos are usually self-absorbed because their self-esteem is secretly really low. They cling to validation and may feel threatened or confused when someone else receives recognition. So combat their need to be the center of attention by putting someone else in the spotlight. They’ll be confused when they see others getting validation that they think belongs to them. [11] X Research source Try: Clarifying who they have to share credit with for projects or group assignments. Prompting someone to share an interesting story at a party."

      "title": "People with huge egos are often bewildered when somebody beats them.",
      "content": "People with huge egos are often bewildered when somebody beats them. It just doesn’t fit with their constructed fantasy. They discourage competition by making others feel less important, capable, valuable, skilled, or special. Put them in their place by not holding back in competition with them. Perform at your best, whether you're playing a board game or recreational sport. Take a leadership role at school, at work, or in the community."
