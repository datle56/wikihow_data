      "content": "Tank tops with thin straps tend to move around a lot. To stop that from happening, grab 2 bobby pins and slide one underneath your shirt at the base of your bra (where the strap meets the cup). Angle it downward so it’s less obvious, then put another bobby pin at the very back of your strap. Try to center this one in the area that the strap meets the clasps to hold your straps secure all day. [1] X Research source If you need to, you can add a third bobby pin on top of your shoulder to keep the straps from moving around. However, this bobby pin will be more noticeable than the other 2, so it’s not great for lighter-colored tank tops. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Classic bras are hard to wear under racerback tanks. If you have this dilemma, reach behind your back and pinch your straps together with one hand. Slide a bobby pin over both the straps, connecting them together. Add a second bobby pin to create an X formation and hold your straps in place all day.

      "content": "Keep your shoulders free with this bra strap hack. Slide your bra straps down off your shoulder so they’re hidden underneath your shirt. Use a bobby pin to hook the bra strap to the shirt, angling the pin downward so it’s less noticeable. Do this on either side to keep your straps out of the way.

Slide a few bobby pins on either side of your bra to tuck the straps in. If your bra is convertible, unhook the straps in the front and wrap them around the band before using bobby pins to keep them in place. [5] X Research source"
