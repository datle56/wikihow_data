To do so, each mass must be multiplied by the mole ratio per their respective atomic weights. [4] X Research source In simpler terms, you will need to divide each mass by the atomic weight of that element. Also note that the atomic weights used in this calculation should include at least four significant figures. Example: For a compound with 29.3 g Na, 41.1 g S, and 29.6 g O: 29.3 g Na * (1 mol S / 22.99 g Na) = 1.274 mol Na 41.1 g S * (1 mol S / 32.06 g S) = 1.282 mol S 29.6 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 1.850 mol O"

You will need a stochiometric comparison between the elements in your compound, which essentially means that you need to calculate how much of an element you have in relation to the other elements present in your compound. To do this, divide each number of moles by the smallest number of moles present. [5] X Research source Example: The smallest number of moles present in the compound is 1.274 moles (the number of moles for Na, sodium). 1.274 mol Na / 1.274 mol = 1.000 Na 1.282 mol S / 1.274 mol = 1.006 S 1.850 mol O / 1.274 mol = 1.452 O"

For small values that are within a tenth value away from a whole number, this does not present a problem. Once you have an excess value exceeding this amount, however, you should multiply the ratio values as needed to bring that value up to a whole number. [6] X Research source If one element has a value near 0.5, multiply each element by 2. Similarly, if one element has a value near 0.25, multiply each element by 4. Example: Since the amount of oxygen (O) present is close to 1.5, you will need to multiply each value by “2” to bring the ratio of oxygen closer to a whole number. 1.000 Na * 2 = 2.000 Na 1.006 S * 2 = 2.012 S 1.452 O * 2 = 2.904 O"

Do so by dividing the mass in grams for each element by the elements' respective atomic weights. [9] X Research source From a more technical perspective, you are actually multiplying the mass in grams by the mole ratio per atomic weight. Note that the atomic weight should be rounded to four significant places to maintain a certain degree of accuracy in your calculations. Example: When there are 8.5 g Fe and 3.8 g O: 8.5 g Fe * (1 mol Fe / 55.85 g Fe) = 0.152 mol Fe 3.8 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 0.238 mol O"

If the excess is within one-tenth, you can simply round it off. For excess values that exceed this, however, you will need to multiply each value by a number that can bring the ratio value nearer to a whole number. For instance, if one element has an excess near 0.25, multiply each element amount by 4. If an element has an excess near 0.5, multiply each element amount by 2. Example: Since the ratio amount of oxygen equals 1.566, you will need to multiply both ratio amounts by 2. 1.000 Fe * 2 = 2.000 Fe 1.566 O * 2 = 3.132 O"
