Those who hinder the group's operation can become excluded. Sometimes people are excluded because they are difficult to deal with. Other times, people are excluded simply for being different, and people naturally fear what they don't understand. The group has to learn to see this difference positively. People who are a danger to the group. Societies ostracize people who are aggressive, threaten the group's core values, who are untrustworthy, etc., as a way to protect the group. People who do not offer specific benefits to the group. Sometimes, a group feels that it already has enough members, so adding more will not add anything new to benefit the group.
