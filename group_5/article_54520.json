      "title": "Smooth any rough edges around the hole with 180-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Smooth any rough edges around the hole with 180-grit sandpaper. If you accidentally broke your desk, the hole may have more jagged edges and won’t accept the wood filler as well. Rub around the edge of the hole with a folded piece of sandpaper to get rid of any sharp or pointed edges. Keep sanding the edges down until they have a smooth finish. [1] X Research source If you have trouble removing the rough edges with sandpaper, try chipping them off with a chisel. While you may need to use more wood filler, your patch will look less noticeable and blend in more."

      "title": "Tape around the hole with masking tape.",
      "content": "Tape around the hole with masking tape. Rip off pieces of masking tape and place them as close to the hole’s edges as you can. Use small pieces of tape so you can work around and curves easier without any waste. Just be careful that the tape doesn’t fold over the edge, or else you won’t be able to peel it off once the filler dries. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Mix the wood filler and hardener with a putty knife.",
      "content": "Mix the wood filler and hardener with a putty knife. Buy a package of 2-part wood filler that comes with a bottle of hardener. Follow the mixing directions on the wood filler’s package so you know how much of each product you need to mix. Put the wood filler onto a paper plate or into a disposable cup before adding your hardener. Stir them both together until they’re thoroughly combined and have a uniform color. [3] X Research source You can buy wood filler from your local hardware store. Opt for one that’s stainable so you can apply finish to it later on."

      "title": "Press the wood filler into the hole using your knife.",
      "content": "Press the wood filler into the hole using your knife. Scoop up some of your wood filler onto your putty knife and press it into the hole in your desk. Try to push the wood filler as far in as you can so it fills in the space completely. Keep adding wood filler until it’s level with the wood around it. Hold the putty knife at a 45-degree angle and pull it across the hole one more time to smooth it out and remove excess. [4] X Research source It’s okay to leave about 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.32–0.64 cm) of the wood filler above level since it will sink deeper into the wood as it sets."

    {
      "title": "Let the wood filler dry for about 15–30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the wood filler dry for about 15–30 minutes. Leave the wood filler alone for about 15 minutes before checking on it again. Tap on the wood filler to see if it feels tacky, and allow it to dry for another 5–10 minutes if it does. Otherwise, you can continue working on your patch. [5] X Research source Your wood filler may take longer to dry depending on the depth and size of the hole, so always check it before moving on."

    {
      "title": "Sand the wood filler down with your sandpaper.",
      "content": "Sand the wood filler down with your sandpaper. Take your 180-grit sandpaper and run it over the wood filler. Apply a moderate amount of pressure to smooth out any raised edges. Keep sanding down the patch until it’s perfectly level with the wood around it. [6] X Research source Use a scrap wooden block to apply more pressure while sanding if you have a difficult time smoothing out the filler."

    {
      "title": "Stain or paint the wood filler to match the rest of your desk.",
      "content": "Stain or paint the wood filler to match the rest of your desk. Choose a paint or stain that’s the same color as your desk so the patch doesn’t look out of place. If you’re staining the filler, apply it with a paintbrush before wiping off any excess with a shop cloth. If you’re painting , apply a layer of primer and let it dry first. Then use a paintbrush to paint the wood filler in the direction of the grain. [7] X Research source You may also leave the patch unfinished if you want to give your desk a unique look or accent. You can either match the wood filler patch to your desk color or refinish your desk completely to update its look!"

      "title": "Tape off the bottom of the hole if it goes through the wood.",
      "content": "Tape off the bottom of the hole if it goes through the wood. Check the other side of the wood to see if the hole broke through. If it did, rip off pieces of masking tape and stretch them across the hole. Overlap each piece of tape by at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) so the epoxy doesn’t leak out. Press the tape tightly against your desk so it doesn’t come undone while you make repairs. [8] X Research source If the hole is on the edge of your desk, place your tape along the sides so it’s perpendicular to the surface with the hole."

      "title": "Mix your epoxy and the hardener in a disposable container.",
      "content": "Mix your epoxy and the hardener in a disposable container. Your package of epoxy will come in 2 separate containers of base and hardener. Use an old plastic food container or a paper plate since it can be difficult to remove epoxy once it’s dry. Scoop out the epoxy base with a putty knife and put it in your container. Follow the mixing directions so you know how much hardener to add. Stir the epoxy mixture until it has a uniform color. [9] X Research source You can buy 2-part epoxy from your local hardware store. Epoxy is stronger than wood filler, and it works best on solid wood, MDF, and particleboard."

      "content": "Fill the hole in your desk with the epoxy. Scoop the epoxy with your putty knife and push it into the hole as far down as you can. Shape the epoxy while it’s malleable so it fills in the entire hole and keep pressing it down to pack it in. Smooth out the epoxy with the edge of your putty knife to make it level with the wood so it’s easier to sand and work with later on. [10] X Research source If you had to tape the bottom of the hole, check that the pieces haven’t come loose to ensure the epoxy doesn’t drip or fall out."

      "content": "Prime and paint the epoxy so it blends in with your desk. Epoxy doesn’t accept stain, so you’ll have to use acrylic paint if you want it to match the color of your desk. Apply a thin layer of acrylic primer to the epoxy. Allow the primer to dry for about 1 day before painting over it with the matching color. Feather the paint out onto the wood surrounding your patch to help it blend in and look less noticeable. [13] X Research source"

Put the nozzle into the hole around the edge of the hole and press down on the button. Move the nozzle around so you don’t apply too much foam in one place. Pull the nozzle out once the hole looks half full since the foam will continue to expand. As the foam expands to the edge of the hole, press it in firmly with a putty knife. [15] X Research source You can buy a can of expandable foam from your local hardware store."

Leave the foam alone for at least 12 hours so it has a chance to harden completely. Test the foam with your finger, and allow it to dry longer if it still feels tacky. Try checking it again in 30 minutes to see if it’s hardened. [16] X Research source"

Push the blade of the knife through the foam with gentle back-and-forth movements to cut through the foam. Throw the excess piece of foam away with your regular trash so the top of the foam looks level with the wood. [17] X Research source If you have trouble using a putty knife, you can also use a utility knife to cut through the foam."
