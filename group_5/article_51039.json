      "title": "Dampen a dried stain with a wet cloth or paper towel.",
      "content": "Dampen a dried stain with a wet cloth or paper towel. Make sure to dampen the paper only where there's a stain. Dab slightly so the stain is damp, but avoid transferring too much water. If the paper becomes drenched, it may become weak and tear. [1] X Research source If this is a new stain that is still wet, you’ll need to dry it as much as you can until it is just damp by blotting it with a dry cloth or paper towel."

      "title": "Pour a few drops of chlorine bleach and water in two separate bowls.",
      "content": "Pour a few drops of chlorine bleach and water in two separate bowls. The separate bowls will ensure you can dilute the bleach before using it. While you can use any bleach, chlorine bleach is tough enough to restore whiteness, and even works for coffee stains! [2] X Research source Only pour a few drops and wear gloves to protect your hands. Undiluted bleach can burn the skin. Avoid leaning over and inhaling the bleach, which could be dangerous."

      "title": "Dip a cotton swab in the water and bleach.",
      "content": "Dip a cotton swab in the water and bleach. Dip the swab first in the water bowl, then in the bleach bowl. After you dampen your cotton swab with bleach, gently tap it against the side of the bowl so the swab isn't dripping wet. [3] X Research source Using too much bleach can also turn the paper yellow. For stains larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm), use a paper towel instead of a cotton swab."

    {
      "title": "Dab the cotton swab on the stain.",
      "content": "Dab the cotton swab on the stain. Use light strokes to cover the entire stain with the bleach and water mixture. However, avoid pushing down too forcefully, since you might accidentally tear the paper. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold a dry piece of paper towel and blot the stain.",
      "content": "Fold a dry piece of paper towel and blot the stain. The paper towel should be folded in order to absorb enough of the bleach mixture off of the paper. Gently but firmly press down to transfer the excess bleach off of the paper. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the paper air dry for an hour.",
      "content": "Let the paper air dry for an hour. Be careful not to touch or move the paper too much, because the moisture can cause the paper to break apart easily. Just set it down on top of a table or on the floor in a well-ventilated area. Wait until the paper is fully dry before using it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put your paper on a clean paper towel.",
      "content": "Put your paper on a clean paper towel. Make sure the paper towel is fully underneath the paper. If you're working on a nice table, especially one made of wood, place several paper towels to protect the table's finish. [7] X Research source You can also set a plastic bag beneath the paper towel to further protect your surface."

      "title": "Dip a cotton swab in acetone or peroxide.",
      "content": "Dip a cotton swab in acetone or peroxide. After you dip the cotton swab, gently tap it to remove any excess water. Don't worry about quantity; you should only need a bit of acetone. [8] X Research source For stains larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm), use a paper towel instead of a cotton swab. Make sure you have good ventilation and stay away from any flames or sparks. Many nail polish removers are made with acetone, which may be a good household solution. If you use 100% acetone, dilute it with water. To do this, mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of acetone with 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of water in a bowl. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the paper dry for an hour.",
      "content": "Let the paper dry for an hour. Leave the paper where it is and only move it once it's completely dry. Moving the paper or attempting to write on it before it's dry may cause it to tear."

      "content": "Prepare an acetone wash in a glass casserole pan. Fill your casserole pan with acetone up to 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) deep. It should be enough acetone at the bottom of the pan to fully submerge the portion of the paper with ink. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on a pair of rubber gloves or prepare a set of metal tongs.",
      "content": "Put on a pair of rubber gloves or prepare a set of metal tongs. You'll have to hold the paper underneath the acetone wash, but doing so will harm your fingers. Either purchase a pair of rubber gloves or look for metal tongs that won't damage your paper."

      "title": "Hold the ink-stained paper under the acetone for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Hold the ink-stained paper under the acetone for 3 minutes. You only need to submerge the portion of the paper that has the ink stain, though you can submerge the entire paper if it's covered in ink. Hold it there for at least 3 minutes. Then, gently remove the paper and watch the ink disappear. [12] X Research source Be careful when handling the wet paper. It can easily tear."

      "title": "Place the washed paper on a bed of paper towels.",
      "content": "Place the washed paper on a bed of paper towels. Make sure the paper towels are thick enough that the acetone won't seep through and ruin the surface beneath them. When in doubt, you can also lay down a plastic bag to catch any acetone that seeps through."

      "title": "Let the paper completely air dry.",
      "content": "Let the paper completely air dry. Depending on the size of your paper, it may take several hours to dry. Leave it in a well-ventilated location with little to no wind, and let it dry for as long as necessary. [13] X Research source Do not write on the paper while it is still drying. The ink will smudge."
