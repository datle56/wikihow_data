      "content": "Lay your sweatshirt out on a flat surface. Place the sweatshirt on a hard, flat surface like a table or hardwood floor. Smooth out the sweatshirt with your hands so that there are no lumps or bumps in the fabric. Make sure that the area is clean so that your sweatshirt won't get dirty when you lay it out."

      "title": "Draw a line across the area you want to cut off.",
      "content": "Draw a line across the area you want to cut off. Use a piece of chalk or a fabric marker and a ruler to draw a line across the area of the sweatshirt you want to cut. You can cut the sweatshirt as high or as low as you want it to be. You can hold the sweatshirt up to your body to identify where you want the new bottom of it to be. Then, make a few marks across the sweatshirt to indicate where you want to cut it. Use your ruler to connect the marks into a line after you lay it down again. Trying the sweatshirt on and marking it while you are wearing it is the best option if you want a very specific length."

      "content": "Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut across the sweatshirt. Double check to ensure that the sweatshirt is smooth. Then, start cutting along the line you have drawn onto the front of the sweatshirt. Cut through both layers of fabric at once going all the way across the sweatshirt. Cut slowly and be careful not to bunch up the fabric as you go. This will result in uneven or jagged edges."

      "content": "Cut a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) slit in the neckline where the layers overlap. Locate the center of the neckline on the front of the sweatshirt. Look for the area of the neckline where the 2 layers of fabric overlap. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) slit in the fabric right between the 2 layers of fabric. [2] X Research source Do not cut any more than this to start! You can always cut more, but you cannot put the fabric back."

      "title": "Try on the sweatshirt to see how it fits.",
      "content": "Try on the sweatshirt to see how it fits. After you have cut the slit, put the sweatshirt on and see if this has improved the fit to your liking. If you want the sweatshirt to be looser around the neck, then take it off and cut further down from the first slit you made. [3] X Research source Only cut 0.5 in (1.3 cm) at a time and try on the sweatshirt after each cut. This will help to ensure that you do not end up cutting more than you want."

      "content": "Pull the fabric apart for a more deconstructed look. If you want to add some frayed edges or make the sweatshirt look a bit distressed, then you can also pull the fabric apart with your hands. This will tear the opening apart going downwards from the slit you made. [4] X Research source Tug gently to avoid ripping a big slit down the front of your sweatshirt."

Cut right around the outside of the sweatshirt’s neckband. Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged or uneven edges. [5] X Research source Try on the sweatshirt after you finish cutting and cut off another 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of fabric going all the way around the neckline if desired."

      "content": "Cut an upside-down triangle going down from the neckline for a V-neck . Identify where you want the V to end and mark the sweatshirt at this point. Then, identify where you want each side of the V to start and mark the sweatshirt’s neckline to indicate where you will begin cutting. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut a straight line going down from the neckline mark to the bottom of the V, then repeat for the other side. You can make the V as deep or as shallow as you like. Try on the sweatshirt first to see where you would like the V to begin and end. Another option is to fold the sweatshirt so that the 2 sides of the front of the neckline are aligned, lay the sweatshirt on its side, and cut a diagonal line through both layers of fabric going from the lowest point of the V to the top of the neckline. [6] X Research source You could also use a V-neck t-shirt or sweater that you like as a guide. Measure how far down the V goes from the neckline and then use the same measurements to mark your sweatshirt before you cut it."

      "content": "Draw and cut a U-shape around the neckline for a scoopneck. If you prefer a scoop neck look, then cut a U shape going under the front of the sweatshirt’s neckline. Mark the neckline on either side of the front of the neckline to indicate where you want the scoopneck to start. Then, mark the point below the neckline to indicate where the lowest point of the scoopneck will be. Draw a U shape using these points and then cut along the line. Another option is to fold the neckline so that the shoulder seams are lined up and then cut a J-shape going through both layers of fabric. This will create a scoopneck when you open up the neckline again. [7] X Research source Make sure to use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to make the cut. Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges along the neckline."

Position the cut along a sleeve, the back of the sweatshirt or in the front of the sweatshirt depending on the look you are going for. [9] X Research source Don’t cut any more than 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) to start or you may end up with a slit that is too large. Keep in mind that you can always cut more, but you can’t add the fabric back in."
