      "content": "Using a pair of needle-nose pliers, squeeze the spring clamp fastening the outlet hose to loosen it and move it up. This will enable the hose to be jiggled free of the valve. Have a sponge, rag or towel ready as leftover water can run out of this hose."

      "content": "Using a vise-grip plier, tighten the fitting before it is placed back inside of the dishwasher. If you don't have vise-grip plier the fitting will have to be threaded manually onto the inlet valve as much as possible. Once it is on a solid surface, it can be fully tightened."

      "title": "Place the spring clamp back onto the outlet hose and reattach the hose to the inlet valve.",
      "content": "Place the spring clamp back onto the outlet hose and reattach the hose to the inlet valve. Use a jiggling motion to get the hose back onto the valve to ensure that it is seated as firmly as possible. Using the needle-nose pliers, squeeze the spring clamp once again and wiggle it back down the outlet hose. This keeps the outlet hose properly sealed and prevents any leakage."

      "content": "Reattach the new valve to the side of the machine with the two quarter-inch screws that were used to mount the old inlet valve. Reattach the valve's water supply hose and carefully connect the electrical harness to the inlet valve solenoid. Make sure the inlet valve fitting is good and tight at this time."

      "content": "Turn on the electricity and the water supply to the dishwasher and start it up. Watch closely for any leaks from the outlet hose or the inlet valve itself. If there are no apparent leaks, reinstall the front panels onto the dishwasher by reversing the process in the first step of these instructions. Take special care to insert the screws into their proper holes."
