      "title": "Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water.",
      "content": "Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water. Chop, smash, or blend the fruit to release their flavor, and add about a handful of fruit per can of sparkling water, or 3 handfuls for a liter. Once the fruit is added to the water, leave it in the fridge for a few hours or overnight to let the flavors infuse the drink. [1] X Research source Try flavorful fruits like strawberries, lemon, pineapple, and raspberries, or even try vegetables like cucumbers or ginger and fresh herbs like basil or rosemary. Make sure to chop or muddle the herbs, too, before they go into the sparkling water. [2] X Research source Add fruit zest if you want an extra citrus zing! The sparkling water can be from a can or made at home using a water carbonation machine."

      "title": "Mix your sparkling water with juice.",
      "content": "Mix your sparkling water with juice. Use a ratio of 1 part juice to 1 part sparkling water. [3] X Research source Use your favorite juice, or make a mixture of two, like cranberry and pineapple or limeade and mango. Add more or less juice according to your own taste! Juice can be high in sugar and calories, so use a juice to sparkling water ratio of 1:3 for a healthier option."

      "title": "Use flavorful syrups to add to your sparkling water.",
      "content": "Use flavorful syrups to add to your sparkling water. Add the syrups to your sparkling water according to their instructions. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that syrups are more concentrated than juice, so a little goes a long way. Buy flavorings that are imitations of sodas or sparkling water flavors you like, available in many grocery stores and also sold by companies that sell carbonation machines. Use pre-made syrups and extracts to explore flavors you wouldn’t be able to make on your own, like coconut extract, pumpkin pie flavoring syrup, or vanilla extract. Make your own syrups using recipes that tell you how to combine, blend, and strain ingredients you like."
