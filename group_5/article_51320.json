      "content": "Scroll down the list of items and select a suitable horse deed. Typically, the more expensive a horse deed is, the faster and more robust the horse is. Horse speed is ranked by a star system, where more stars means the horse is faster and fewer means the horse is slower. These are the prices and star ranks of each horse breed that is available to buy: Three-star horses such as the Kentucky Saddler, American Standardbred, and Hungarian Half-bred can be purchased for $1500, or for $750 if you have high honor. These are the fastest horses in the game. Two-star horses such as the Highland Chestnut, Painted Quarter Horse, Painted Standardbred, Quarter Horse, Standard Bred Pinto, Tersk, Tobiano Pinto, and Welsh Mountain can be bought for $500. Other two-star horses like the Turkmen, Ardennais, and Cleveland Bay can be bought for $500, or for $250 with high honor. Dutch Warmblood can be bought for $500, or for $250 if you have low honor, at Thieves' Landing. These horses have moderate speed. One-star horses such as the Jaded Tersk, Lusitano Nag, and Infested Ardennais can be bought for $100. These horses have slow speed."
