      "content": "Contrast a large mirror with small pieces of art. Playing around with size is a great way to liven up your walls, and really adds an extra dimension to your living space. Arrange your round mirror in the center of the wall, so it can be the focal point. Then, hang up small paintings, prints, and portraits around the mirror. [1] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. [2] X Research source Pick out differently-sized paintings to add some extra contrast to your mirror. For instance, you might hang up 3 tiny paintings, 2 medium-sized paintings, and 3 medium-large paintings. You can also create a cool gallery with large paintings and prints."

      "content": "Add some tasteful decor on the furniture near your mirror. Search for any tables, nightstands, benches, or other flat, sturdy pieces of furniture near your mirror. Decorate the surface of this furniture with throw pillows, books, photos, or any other personal touches—these will be a great complement to your mirror, as well as the rest of the room! [3] X Research source For instance, prop up a few pillows on a bench beneath your round mirror. You might jazz up your nightstands and tabletops with glass bottles, or add a vintage typewriter for decoration. [4] X Research source Set out themed decor on your furniture for a really seamless look. For example, you might set out ornamental boxes and knick-knacks that are all the same shade of red."

      "content": "Rearrange some of your furniture so the wall doesn’t feel so bare. On their own, mirrors can only do so much—something as simple as a desk, table, or dresser can make a big difference! Move a piece of furniture so it’s directly beneath your round mirror. This will help balance out your mirror, and will really tie the room together [5] X Research source For instance, you might pull up a tasteful dresser beneath your round mirror. [6] X Research source You might shift your sofa so it’s directly underneath the mirror."

      "content": "Place a houseplant beneath or next to your mirror as an extra touch. If it’s a large houseplant, set it on the floor directly beneath your mirror. If it’s a smaller plant, you have a little more wiggle room—you might display a single plant on the furniture near your mirror, or set out several small plants on floating shelves surrounding your mirror. [7] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. [8] X Research source Don’t be afraid to mix and match your plants! For instance, you might set out 2 succulents beneath your mirror, or you might pair a succulent with a long, viney plant. The choice is yours! If you’re feeling colorful, display a flower vase instead of a regular houseplant. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Center your mirror between 2 lights. Place 2 identical table or wall lamps to the left and right of the mirror, which really brighten up the space. You can also center your mirror between 2 previously-installed light fixtures, like the lamps near a bathroom vanity. [10] X Research source For instance, you might place 2 black-and-white table lamps on both sides of the mirror for a sleek, minimalist look. If you don’t have 2 table lamps available, that’s okay! A single, tasteful lamp can still add a lot to your mirror."

      "content": "Set 2 mirrors along opposite sides of the wall to make a mirror-image effect. Place your round mirror on the far right side of the wall. Then, hang up another round mirror along the far left side. Take a step back and check that both mirrors are in line with one another—this design splits up your space in a unique, dynamic way. [11] X Research source You can add a piece of furniture or decor between your 2 mirrors if you’d like to fill up the space a bit more. For instance, you might center a table between the mirrors, or hang up a painting."

      "content": "Hang up round mirrors in clusters of 3 and 4. Find some open space on your wall where you can fit multiple mirrors. Arrange them in a triangular shape, or align the mirrors so they form a square. Play around with different setups until you’re satisfied with your mini mirror gallery. [12] X Expert Source Karen Parziale Home Stager & Interior Designer Expert Interview. 30 June 2021. [13] X Research source You can also play around with size! For instance, you might hang up 3 small, round mirrors along the edge of a larger round mirror."

      "content": "Check around your home for knick-knacks that you can repurpose into a fun frame. Anything’s fair game—old wire, PVC pipe, and fabric strips can all be used to reframe your mirror in a fun, festive way. [14] X Research source For instance, you might surround your mirror with yarn tassels, or glue scraps of old denim around the rim. You can cut a PVC pipe into small circles and glue them around the rim of your mirror. If your mirror already has a fancy frame, repaint it in a new color. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Hot glue colorful plastic spoons along the edge. Squeeze a dot of hot glue along the back of the spoon’s base, and press it along the edge of the mirror with the handle pointing inward. Add another dot of glue beneath the handle so the spoon stays in place. Repeat this process until the entire frame is covered with colorful spoons. Then, glue a second layer of spoons on top of the base layer to create a more dynamic look. [16] X Research source This works best with simple mirrors with a thin or nonexistent frame. For reference, a small, 18 in (46 cm) mirror will need 105 spoons. You can also clip clothespins around your mirror as a decorative touch instead of using spoons. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Let your mirror be the star of the show on your wall. If your mirror has an especially decorative frame, arrange it along the center of the wall and see how it looks. Some mirrors are stylish enough on their own, and don’t need any extra decor! [18] X Research source For instance, if your mirror has a bold, decorative frame, you can center it in the wall as a solo accent."
