Your strategy will sell your USP. [2] X Research source .

      "content": "Maintain an annual plan (at least). Don't anticipate that your plan will go off without a hitch. Most marketing specialists recommend that a business revisits its marketing plan at least once every year. This will help you review what's been accomplished, assess how things may continue to progress based on current information, and determine whether any changes need to be made to your marketing plan. Be objective with your annual reviews. If something isn't working or if someone isn't performing up to your company's standards, you may need to discuss why things aren't working or why an employee isn't meeting his tasks. Or, you may need to rethink your company's entire marketing plan if things are really going off the track. This is where it may be helpful and worth the cost to hire an independent consultant. A consultant can review your plan and assess its success or failure, and may be able to help you restructure your plan as needed."

Begin by looking at your company's mission and goals (if your company doesn't have one, then, this has to be clarified before you start), and determine if your company's current marketing plan is helping to meet those goals or not. For example, you may own a snow plowing and winter maintenance business, and may have set a goal to grow your overall revenues by 10% by adding more contracts. Do you have a marketing plan that outlines how you will attract those additional contracts? If so, is it working?"

You want to know the age, gender, location, and even income of your customers. You also want to know the psychology of your customers. If you run a snow removal company, for example, and your customers are large businesses, what are the things they value most from a snow removal service? Think of their intent when they would most likely be searching for what you offer. Which sites, apps, podcasts would they most frequently visit? The more detailed you can be here, the better!

[16] X Research source Keep surveys/questionnaires short and simple. Your customers may have input, but they won't want to spend a lot of time and effort giving you that input. Aim for a survey that would fit on an index card or a half sheet of paper, but if you must go longer, make sure your survey comes in under two pages long at the absolute maximum. [17] X Research source Consider a short-answer format instead of a simple multiple-choice survey. You can certainly incorporate a few multiple-choice questions if you like, but provide open-ended questions, asking specifics like, \"What do you like best about our product/service? What do you like least? What would you like to see us improve on?\" You may also want to ask a question like, \"Would you recommend our products/services to friends or colleagues? Why/why not?\" That will help you gauge your existing customers' level of satisfaction while also gathering information on what your strengths and weaknesses are. Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. You want to make the experience as easy and hassle-free for customers as possible.

You can ask many of the same questions that you would in a written survey, asking customers what they see as your greatest strengths and weaknesses, and whether or not your customers would recommend your business to others. [19] X Research source The downside to a phone interview, aside from potentially disrupting or annoying the people being called, is that you won't have the customer's responses in front of you like you would with a written survey. If you plan on conducting a survey, you'll need to have a fast writer/typer to transcribe your customers' responses over the phone.

[20] X Research source Much like the phone interview, a personal interview will still require you to make some written account of what your customers said and what feedback they offered.
