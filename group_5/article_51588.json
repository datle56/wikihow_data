      "content": "Choose perennial tulips if you want them to come back. Both the type of tulip and the way you care for it determine whether you’ll have an annual or perennial plant. Annuals only last 1 year and need to be replanted each fall. Perennials will come back year after year and spread through your yard or garden. Here are the varieties that are the most likely to come back with the least amount of effort from you: [1] X Research source \"Olympic Flame\" Tulip \"Peppermint Stick\" Tulip \"Negrita\" Triumph Tulip \"Spring Green\" Viridiflora Tulip"

[3] X Trustworthy Source Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach program dedicated to educating and engaging communities Go to source The warmer your climate, the later you plant them. Get the bulbs in the ground or pots when the soil temperature is below 60°F (15°C). The tulips will develop strong roots over the winter, allowing them to bloom beautifully in spring. Choose large, strong bulbs that are free from mold. [4] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Professional Gardener Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. You can keep tulip bulbs in your refrigerator (or some other cool, dry location) for about 2 months before planting season if you buy them in summer. However, do not store them next to apples, as they give off ethylene, destroying the bulb. Most bulbs need 12-14 weeks of a \"cold period\" to bring about beautiful bulbs come spring. Do not buy bulbs after December 1st unless they've been \"pre-cooled.\""

[13] X Research source If you often have rodents or animals in your garden, erect a cage or fence around the bulbs. Or, put thorny leaves or gravel in with the soil to deter pests. Adding mulch is the only thing you need to do to overwinter tulips—they’re hardy enough to survive during the cold months. If you're planting perennials, feed them every year to start them going again. Use organic material, compost, or a balanced time-release bulb food every fall to start the process."

Cover them loosely with soil so they’re about 4 inches (10 cm) deep and then water thoroughly. [14] X Research source Place your potted tulips somewhere with a temperature between 35 to 48 °F (2 to 9 °C) for about 12 weeks, like a basement, cellar, or even your refrigerator. Bring your pots out of the cold after 3 months and place them in cool, but sunny, windows. They’ll bloom after 3-4 weeks. This process is known as forcing blooms, and potted tulips will only flower once. Once the foliage is wilted and yellow, dig up the bulb and discard it."

If there has been an excess of rain in your area, drain out any extra water from the area if you can. Or, add some shredded bark or sand to the area around your tulips to help keep them dry. If you notice that the area you planted your tulips in collects water, you'll likely be better off moving the plant to a drier area.
