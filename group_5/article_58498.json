      "content": "Mop the floor to remove stuck-on grime. Pass a damp mop over the entire marble floor using figure-eight motions to clean up any dirt that you weren’t able to sweep up. Rinse the mop in a bucket of clean water and wring it out when it becomes dirty or dries up as you work. [2] X Expert Source Guy Peters House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 12 July 2021.

      "content": "Apply a homemade poultice to stains to treat them before polishing. Mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 4 parts water and enough baking soda to make it into a thick paste. Cover any stains completely with the paste, then cover the paste with plastic wrap and tape the edges down. Let it sit for 24-48 hours until it is completely dry, then remove it and wipe the area clean with a damp cloth and dry it off with a clean towel. [3] X Research source The poultice paste will suck out stains from the porous marble. If the stain is still visible after the treatment, repeat the process with another application of poultice."

      "content": "Mix a tiny bit of mild liquid dish detergent into a bucket of water. Use an environmentally-friendly liquid dish detergent and a bucket of clean water. Squeeze 3-4 drops of the detergent into the bucket and agitate it until it starts to foam up. [4] X Research source A solution of mild soap and water is all you need to polish marble floors by hand. Marble is very porous and delicate, so harsh chemical cleaners can damage it and dull its finish."

      "content": "Soak a sponge in the bucket of soapy water and wring out the excess water. Dip a clean sponge into the bucket to saturate it completely. Lift it out and wring it out over the bucket until it is just damp and not dripping with soapy water. [5] X Research source A regular yellow sponge is all you need to apply the solution to the marble floor. You just need to use the soft spongy part, so it doesn’t matter whether it has a green abrasive side or not."

      "content": "Sponge the floor using small circular motions. Work in small sections and apply light pressure as you move the sponge in small circular or arcing motions.

      "content": "Wipe up spills immediately to prevent damage and permanent staining. Many types of liquids can leave permanent stains on marble floors. Act quickly whenever you spill something on the floor to wipe it up with a nonabrasive sponge or soft cloth. [11] X Research source Even plain water can dull the surface of the floor if you leave it sitting. Acidic liquids like vinegar, citrus, or wine will especially damage marble if you don’t wipe them up right away. Avoid using all-purpose cleaners and homemade acidic cleaning solutions, such as those that contain lemon juice or vinegar. These types of cleaners will damage the finish of the marble and leave it looking dull. It’s OK to use a commercial cleaner that is specifically made for cleaning marble surfaces."

This will penetrate the pores of the marble to seal them and protect the floor from spills and stains. [15] X Research source You can check if it is time to reseal the floor by pouring a spoonful of water onto an inconspicuous spot of the surface. If the water gets absorbed and darkens the stone in 1 minute or less, there is no sealer left on the marble and you need to apply a new coat."
