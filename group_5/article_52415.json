As long as your iPhone is on the same wireless network as your AirPlay 2-enabled smart TV or streaming device, it'll be super easy to mirror everything on your screen to your TV. [1] X Research source This method is great when you want to stream video from your iPhone on your TV. You may also use it when you want to browse the web on a larger screen, give a presentation, or just show off your desktop background. Just keep in mind that everything you do on your iPhone while mirroring will also display on your TV—don't open anything private! Your TV or streaming device must be AirPlay 2-compatible. If you have an Apple TV, you're in great shape. If not, many modern LG, Samsung, Vizio, and Sony models support AirPlay."

As long as your AirPlay 2-enabled TV or streaming device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your iPhone (and, of course, it's turned on), it will appear in the list of devices.

For example, if you're using the YouTube app on your iPhone and want to see it on a bigger screen, open the YouTube app—you'll see everything you do on your iPhone on the TV screen. The sound will also come through the TV (or your connected speakers, if compatible) instead of your iPhone. If you're watching a movie or show, use the iPhone to pause, skip, and browse."

Your TV or streaming device must be AirPlay 2-compatible. If you have an Apple TV, you're in great shape. If not, many modern LG, Samsung, Vizio, and Sony models support AirPlay.

      "content": "Locate the AirPlay icon in the app. This icon looks like a rectangle with a black triangle at its bottom edge. Depending on the app (and this is common with many video streaming apps), you'll need to start and pause the video to see the AirPlay icon. If you're using the Photos app, as well as some other Apple-specific apps, you'll need to tap the Share icon first—this is the square with an up-pointing arrow. If you don't see the rectangle with a small black triangle (which is the case in YouTube), you'll use the rectangle with three curved lines at its bottom-left corner instead. If the app does not support AirPlay 2, you won't find such an icon in the app. Don't worry, though—you can still mirror your screen to the TV for similar results."

If you're using YouTube or another app that didn't have a specific AirPlay icon, select AirPlay & Bluetooth devices to scan."
