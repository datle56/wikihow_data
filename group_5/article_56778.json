You may not have noticed, but your emoji keyboard is stacked with mailboxes, letter trays, and even an old-timey postal horn. Check out some of these rarely used (but definitely worthy!) emojis for your next mail-related text or email: 📮 (postbox): a red, pubic mailbox like those in Japan or the UK (some platforms may use a blue one, like in the US). [2] X Research source 📤 (outbox tray): an empty tray with an up arrow representing outgoing mail or email. 📥 (inbox tray): an empty tray with a down arrow representing incoming mail or email. 📨 (incoming envelope): an envelope getting dropped into an inbox tray that signifies an email address or sending and receiving mail more generally. [3] X Research source 📬 (open mailbox with raised flag): a curbside, open mailbox with an envelope inside and its flag up, indicating mail has just been delivered or that there is new mail to be picked up for delivery. 📭 (open mailbox with lowered flag): an empty curbside mailbox with the flag down indicating that outgoing mail has been picked up. 📫 (closed mailbox with raised flag): a curbside mailbox with the door closed and the flag up indicating incoming mail that has been delivered. 📪 (closed mailbox with lowered flag): a curbside mailbox with the door closed and the flag down indicating that there’s no incoming mail (or that outgoing mail has been picked up). 📯 (postal horn): an 18–19th century brass horn used to make important announcements or to clear the way for mail coaches. This is more recognizable in Europe than the US. [4] X Research source"

The exact process is slightly different depending on which platform you’re using, but here are the steps for some of the most popular email platforms: Outlook: Press “Windows + Period” (or “Control + Command + Space” on Mac) to bring up the emoji panel and click the one you want to insert. [6] X Research source Or, click “Insert” and then “Online Pictures” to search for emojis and other images, then click “Insert” when you see the one you want to include. Gmail: Click the “insert emoji” icon (it looks like a smiley face) in the options bar at the bottom of a new message to pull up the emoji panel. Click the one you want to insert. Apple Mail: Click “Edit” in the upper left corner of the screen, then “Emojis & Symbols.” Select “Emoji” to bring up the emoji panel, then drag and drop your emoji into the body of your message. When in doubt, Google your emoji and copy and paste it into your email. This is usually the best way to add emojis to the subject line since that’s outside the body of your message."

If your workplace is pretty informal, you have a good relationship with your colleagues, and you send lots of quick and casual messages, emojis are fine to use. In fact, they can help add a personal touch to work communication, highlight important info, and make your message seem more honest or relatable. [7] X Research source Emojis are especially acceptable in lighthearted announcements or personal news that you’re sharing with your peers."

      "content": "Use emojis sparingly (or just avoid them) in formal or serious work settings. If you’re emailing your boss or a “higher-up,” a client, or someone you don’t have an established rapport with, steer clear of emojis most of the time (the exception might be if you’re working with a brand or partner where emojis are important to their marketing or company culture). Overusing emojis in formal settings might make you seem less competent to some, plus emojis aren’t universally understood and may lead to confusion. [8] X Research source Emojis are definitely in poor taste if you’re delivering bad news or an unwelcome request."
