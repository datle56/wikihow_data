      "title": "This Scorpion lady wants to be the center of your attention.",
      "content": "This Scorpion lady wants to be the center of your attention. Keep things flirty, fun, and focused on her so she knows you're interested. She has a strong jealous streak and will be deeply hurt if she thinks you have eyes for any other woman, so put on your blinders while you get to know her and resist the temptation to play the field. Blatant flirting or showing off for another woman—AKA betraying your Scoprio’s confidence—is a deal breaker for her. Aquarians are naturally detached and helpful people, which might get mistaken as flirting by your Scorpio woman. Reassure her frequently that she's the only one you're in to."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman loves a determined man who uses his natural talents.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman loves a determined man who uses his natural talents. She’s ambitious, driven, and wants her partner to be as well. Fill her in on your biggest achievements, your goals at work, and anything else you’re successful at or passionate about. When she sees you both have a similar work ethic, she’ll fantasize about what you could achieve together. Highlight your accomplishments without bragging, like: “I just got a promotion last month. It’s been fun taking on a leadership role.” “In college, I was the NCWA wrestling champ.” “I’m working on getting my nonprofit off the ground. We’re applying for NFP status next week!” Scorpios are aggressive people that want to go get what they want. They’ll do whatever it takes to fulfill their desires. If you can hook her interest, that means she’ll go out of her way to be with you!"

      "title": "Scorpio and Aquarius are both adventurous in their own ways.",
      "content": "Scorpio and Aquarius are both adventurous in their own ways. Your fun and explorative nature combines well with her love of intrigue and mystery. Take her on a date somewhere she’s never been or plan an activity neither of you have done before. You may need to persuade her into thinking it will be worth it, but she’ll love anything where she can learn something new. Try an unconventional first date idea like going to a flea market, taking an art or cooking class, or bouncing around a trampoline park. She loves all things mysterious or spooky. Try a ghost tour, a niche museum, or taking a walk through a cemetery (some of them are really nice!). A bar or restaurant with a unique or secretive atmosphere will appeal to her too. Try a speak-easy or going to a club where you need a password to get in."

      "content": "Scorpios love to be in control, and they’re good at it too. She’s decisive with her words and actions and is naturally a great leader. [1] X Research source As a go-with-the-flow Aquarius, let her be in charge sometimes and follow her rules. Whether she’s planning a date or making a grocery list, she’ll tackle any task and make sure it’s enjoyable for both of you. Give her the option to take charge with phrases like: “What do you think we should do this weekend?” “You pick the movie tonight.” “Hey, what should I wear to Jen’s party next week?” Her love of being in charge applies to the bedroom too. If your relationship has gotten physical, try role playing and exploring different power dynamics to spice things up."

      "content": "A Scorpio woman loves a puzzling, mysterious man. If you’re too open at first, she might get bored because she feels like she figured you out too fast. Leave your full life story at home and drop personal details and stories sparingly. She’ll be super attracted to you if she thinks there’s a deep, hidden man to explore under the surface. Say things like: “I’ll tell you about my most embarrassing moment…next time.” “Long story short, I’m terrified of raccoons. I’ll explain later.” “My wildest night out? That’s a story for another time.” Don’t share much (or any) information about your past dating experiences at first. A Scorpio woman is suspicious and if you bad mouth an ex, she’ll think you’ll do the same to her too. Scorpios sense and see people very clearly and it makes them a little quixotic. Be real and genuine about who you are, even if you’re trying to be a little mysterious."

      "content": "She’ll be fascinated by your outside-the-box point of view. Anything unconventional grabs her attention, so highlight the quirks that make you unique. [2] X Research source Flaunt your wide variety of unusual knowledge and insight. You’re not one to walk the beaten path, and her curiosity about you will hold her attraction for a long time. She'll be intrigued by anything uncommon you enjoy, like a really niche favorite author or a love of fostering local wildlife. Tell her about anything rebellious you’ve done or protests you’ve gone to. She’s got a rebel streak herself and finds someone who doesn’t fit the mold attractive. She likes control but appreciates a strong personality that can challenge her. Be confident and unintimidated to show her you have a strong sense of self."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman wants someone as blunt and brutally honest as her.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman wants someone as blunt and brutally honest as her. She’ll walk away after any whiff of a lie or betrayal, so stay open and truthful at all times. Aquarians are generally honest people but sometimes bend the truth to spare someone’s feelings. Resist that urge and be 100% honest, no matter what. If there’s something you can’t or don’t want to tell her, just say you’re not ready to fill her in. She’ll respect your honesty and you can open up to her at your pace. She’ll always prefer to be in the know and hash out an issue than to find out later you’ve been withholding something from her. Scorpio is a very tense sign. She won’t relax around you until you’ve shown you’re accountable, upfront, and trustworthy."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman likes a man who can understand her inner needs.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman likes a man who can understand her inner needs. She keeps things close to the chest and is attracted to someone who gets the ebb and flow of her deep emotions (and as a water sign, there is a lot of ebb and flow). Give her space to work through her feelings and try to empathize with her: “Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?” “I’m here for you if you need anything!” “I’m sorry you’re going through it. Let me know when you’re up to hanging out.” Don’t tease her or try to ease her out of a slump with humor. She’ll interpret it as uncaring or a betrayal. Air signs are more emotionally detached than water signs. Even if you don’t understand why she’s upset or emotional, continue to support her and be patient."

      "title": "Scorpios are secretive and need lots of alone time to decompress.",
      "content": "Scorpios are secretive and need lots of alone time to decompress. They get uncomfortable when they feel like someone is prying into their personal lives or their time, so avoid interrogating her. If she does open up to you, never tell anyone about her innermost feelings (she’ll take your secrets to the grave and expects the same from you). Respecting a Scorpio woman’s obsessive need for privacy and control is very attractive to her. As an Aquarius, you need space as well. Stay somewhat aloof so she thinks about and misses you while you’re apart."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman isn’t one to jump into a relationship.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman isn’t one to jump into a relationship. She’s suspicious about new people, and if you come on too strong or seem provocative, she’ll walk away without another thought. Leave space for her curiosity and desire to grow—grand gestures and impulsive romantic moments will only amplify her distrust. Stay flirtatious while she susses you out. Sensual looks and touches, combined with your air sign wit, are very alluring to her. Slowly build trust with her through gestures of devotion—listening to her, trying new things together, respecting her privacy—than cutesy or sentimental acts."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman prefers an ongoing relationship over a fling.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman prefers an ongoing relationship over a fling. She has an intense all-or-nothing personality that doesn’t take half-measures. If you want to pursue a Scorpio woman, make it clear to her you’re open to a long-term relationship. You don’t have to commit on the spot, but she needs to know it’s a possibility. Tell her something like: “I’m open to an LTR with the right person.” “I’m looking for a woman to settle down with.” “I’d like to find someone who gets me and who wants to stick around for a while.” Aquarians blend love and friendships, so there may not be a clear line where one ends and the other begins. Think hard about your feelings toward your Scorpio woman before pursuing her seriously."
