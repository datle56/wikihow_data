If you see a nine-letter word in the puzzle, call a T first to make sure it's the second last letter in the word to know it could be CHOCOLATE. If a four-letter word starts with a C, the word could be CAKE, unless the word could be CANE as in a CANDY CANE, which could be considered for the holiday tapings."

Landing on Free Play gives you the chance to call a less common consonant that might reveal one of the more obscure words. You can always buy a vowel, so don't waste your precious Free Play on a vowel. After you call a consonant, you can still buy the vowel whether or not the consonant was in the puzzle."
