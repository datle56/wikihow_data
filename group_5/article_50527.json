Scorpio can be tolerant of Aries’ need for freedom, but is also more demanding when it comes to attention and control (something Aries does not like at all). One small lie can wreck the fragile trust between these two. If either sign has doubts about whether they’re the best or only lover the other has ever had, there’s a good chance their relationship will be over. To salvage any trust, Scorpio needs to learn to loosen the reins, and Aries needs to get more comfortable with accountability. On the plus side, Aries are so direct that they can almost disarm Scorpio’s paranoia. If a Scorpio does get jealous (as they tend to do), an Aries will want no part of it.

They represent the ultimate clash of fire and water—when the balance is off, one will destroy or bring out the worst in the other.
