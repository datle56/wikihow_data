To turn your Citiz or Essenza Mini model off immediately, press both the Lungo and Espresso buttons simultaneously and wait for the LEDs to go dark. Alternatively, wait until the auto shut-off engages—the default setting is 9 minutes, although you can set it for 30 minutes by following the procedure listed in the user guide. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Once you reset the machine to its default settings, the auto shut-off will engage after 9 minutes of disuse, even if you previously set it for 30 minutes. The Espresso button has a picture of a small coffee cup on it; the Lungo has a bigger coffee cup."

      "content": "Press and hold the Lungo button for 5 seconds. After confirming that the machine is off, push down on the Lungo button located on the top of the Citiz or Essenza Mini. Count off 5 seconds while continuing to hold down the button. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Both the Citiz and Essenza Mini have only 2 buttons: Espresso, which brews a 40 ml (1.4 fl oz) cup under default operation, and Lungo, which makes a 110 ml (3.7 fl oz) cup as its default."

      "title": "Watch for the LEDs to blink fast 3 times, then more slowly.",
      "content": "Watch for the LEDs to blink fast 3 times, then more slowly. The 3 fast blinks indicate that the machine has been reset to its defaults for brew size and shut-off time. The slow blinking that follows shows that the machine is warming up for operation. Your Citiz or Essenza Mini is ready to brew once the LEDs illuminate steadily. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source If you don’t want to use the machine right now, turn it back off by pressing both buttons at the same time. If you want to change the default brew size and auto shut-off settings in the future, follow the instructions in the user guide."

      "content": "Press the Lungo and Espresso buttons to turn the machine off. If none of the LEDs on the machine are lit up, that means the Lattissima One is already off and you can skip this step. Otherwise, hold down both the Lungo button (with the big coffee cup picture on it) and Espresso button (with the small coffee cup picture) on the top of the machine for 2 seconds. Let go once all the LEDs go out. [8] X Research source"

Grab onto the jug and pull straight outward to remove it. Set it aside for the time being.

      "content": "Turn on the machine by pressing any of its 3 buttons. Any of the 3 buttons on the top of the machine—Lungo, Espresso, or Milk—will do the job. The LEDs in all the buttons will begin to blink, indicating that the Latissima One is on and warming up for brewing. [10] X Research source The LEDs will blink for about 25 seconds while the machine warms up, then light up steadily when it’s ready to brew. You don’t have to wait for the machine to warm up fully before proceeding, however."

Then, press it one last time and watch for all 3 buttons to blink 3 times. [12] X Research source These 3 last blinks indicate that the Lattissima One has been reset to its factory settings. This primarily impacts the amount of coffee dispensed—40 ml (1.4 fl oz) for Espresso, 110 ml (3.7 fl oz) for Lungo, and 40 ml (1.4 fl oz) of coffee when using the Milk button—and the auto shut-off time—9 minutes."

[16] X Research source Under factory settings, the dispensing sizes are as follows: Alto, 414 ml (14.0 fl oz); Coffee, 230 ml (7.8 fl oz); Espresso, 40 ml (1.4 fl oz).
