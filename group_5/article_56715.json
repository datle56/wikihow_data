      "content": "“Looking forward to speaking to you” shows your interest in continuing the conversation. “Looking forward to speaking to you” is a phrase commonly used in professional communication before networking events, interviews, meetings, and more. Saying or sending this phrase shows whoever you’re talking to that you’re looking forward to hearing what they have to say, such as ideas, business strategies, or simply the chance to reconnect on industry-related topics. [1] X Research source For example, if you were invited to interview for a job position, you might close an email to the hiring manager, like, “Thank you so much for the opportunity to interview for this position. Looking forward to speaking to you about my qualifications.” Or, “Thanks for following up about our meeting for next week. Looking forward to speaking to you.” If someone recently said or sent “Looking forward to speaking to you,” good news! Your conversation has likely been going well, and they’re excited about speaking with you in the future."

      "content": "“With you” denotes a sense of having a shared conversation. While both “with” and “to” are technically both grammatically correct, people in the U.S. tend to use “with you” more than “to you” because it’s perceived as being friendlier. People in the U.K. tend to use “to” more than “with” for this phrase."

    {
      "title": "“To you” implies that you’re talking at someone.",
      "content": "“To you” implies that you’re talking at someone. There's nothing wrong with saying \"to,\" but technically it indicates you'll be doing all the talking (whereas “with” implies that you and the other person are conversing equally). [2] X Research source Bosses or other professional figures might employ “to” rather than “with” to sound more authoritative."

    {
      "title": "\"Looking forward to speaking with you\" is correct and more common.",
      "content": "\"Looking forward to speaking with you\" is correct and more common. “Looking forward to speaking with you” is the condensed version of “I look forward to speaking with you.\" Though both phrases are formal, \"Looking forward to speaking with you” is a bit less stiff because the “I” has been dropped, though either version is appropriate for professional or personal use. [3] X Research source Think of “Looking forward to speaking with you” like “Looking forward to (the act of) speaking with you.” Removing the “I” from a full sentence to make a phrase more casual is called a “situational ellipsis.” “To look forward to” is a phrasal verb or a combination of words strung together to replace a verb. Some examples include “to look for” or “to set aside,” which are idiomatic phrases with an alliteration of their literal meaning. I look forward to speaking with you” or “I am looking forward to speaking with you” are also grammatically correct. The only difference is that “I am looking” is perceived to be more formal than “I’m looking forward.” \"Looking forward to speak with you” or “Looking forward speaking to you” are examples of incorrect versions of “Looking forward to speaking with you,” as you are looking forward to an event, and “speaking” is a gerund that should be treated like a noun."

    {
      "title": "“Looking forward to hearing from you”",
      "content": "“Looking forward to hearing from you” “Hearing” makes this phrase more casual. [4] X Research source Where “speaking” may come off as somewhat stuffy, “hearing” tends to have more free-flowing connotations. For example: “Hello Jan, thank you for your message. I’ve got you scheduled and am looking forward to hearing from you.” “Hi Andy, thank you for confirming our meeting. Looking forward to hearing from you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Excited to speak with you”",
      "content": "“Excited to speak with you” This shows your enthusiasm for your upcoming conversation. Keep in mind that this synonym should only be used in positive, more casual situations, like a professional coffee date, rather than an important meeting. For example: “Hi Rosemary, I enjoyed meeting you at last week’s networking event and am so glad we connected. Excited to speak with you soon.” “Dear Dale, your seminar on Botany was fascinating. Excited to speak with you soon over coffee.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Looking forward to meeting with you”",
      "content": "“Looking forward to meeting with you” If you’re meeting this person for the first time, this phrase is perfect. [5] X Research source Plus, it shows your interest in their character. For example: “Hi Ally, I’ve heard such great things about you. Looking forward to meeting with you.” “Thanks for reaching out, Nick. I think this will be a great opportunity to collaborate. Looking forward to meeting with you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Looking forward to our conversation”",
      "content": "“Looking forward to our conversation” This shows you’re looking forward to hearing their thoughts. [6] X Research source In addition, it makes clear that you expect your chat to be a collaboration, not a one-sided conversation. For example: “Hi James, thanks for your thoughts on our new guidelines. Looking forward to our conversation.” “Very insightful, Dianna. This will be very interesting to go over with you. Looking forward to our conversation.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "\"Can’t wait for our chat”",
      "content": "\"Can’t wait for our chat” This is best used between friends or close colleagues. “Chat” is often seen as being very casual, making this a friendly phase that expresses excitement for the conversation to come. For example: “Hey Laura, it was so great seeing you yesterday at the company party. So glad we got to reconnect. Can’t wait for our chat. “Dave, you would not believe what happened at the office today. Can’t wait for our chat.”"
