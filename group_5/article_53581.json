      "content": "Spread towels on the ground around the dishwasher to catch spills. If the standing water is pretty deep, it'll be faster to scoop it out with a cup and then soak the last of it up with towels. If you have a wet/dry vac, you can use that instead and get the job done a little faster. [2] X Research source If you'd like, spread towels on the floor around the dishwasher to catch splashes or spills."

      "content": "The circular filter is in the bottom center of the dishwasher. The filter may be covered with fine mash. Every filter is a little different, but the removal process is basically the same—lift it straight up out of the dishwasher. Then, scrub the filter thoroughly with hot, soapy water and put it back in place. [3] X Expert Source Gevorg Grigorian Appliance Repair Expert Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. The drain (also known as the sump) is the hole beneath the filter in the bottom of the dishwasher. Put on a pair of gloves and clean out the drain with your fingers. Remove solid chunks of food and any other debris inside it. If you’re having trouble identifying the dishwasher parts, check online for your model number and download the user manual."

      "content": "A drain hose blockage can cause standing water in your dishwasher. Disconnect the hose and scrub the inside with a long, flexible brush to clear away any clogs. Reconnect the hose when you’re done. [8] X Research source If the drain hose or connection points look damaged, you may need to replace the drain hose altogether. Be sure to put the drain hose back in place when you’re done! Otherwise, water will go all over the place when you turn the dishwasher on. Also, make sure you install a high loop in the drain hose under the sink to ensure proper draining of the dishwasher. If you aren't comfortable with this, call a professional plumber or appliance technician to install this for you."

      "content": "Test out the dishwasher to see if you’ve fixed the issue. Once you’ve troubleshooted everything, run a new wash cycle without any dishes inside. Pick the shortest cycle so you won't have to wait long. Then, open the dishwasher and check for standing water. [9] X Research source If your dishwasher is pretty dirty after having standing water in it, pour 3 cups (710 ml) of white vinegar in the bottom before you run the dishwasher using the hottest cycle. [10] X Research source A very small amount of water in the bottom of a dishwasher is normal. If the water is still deep and won’t drain, a faulty drain valve may be to blame. Working on the drain valve is best left to a professional, so call a plumber for assistance. [11] X Research source"
