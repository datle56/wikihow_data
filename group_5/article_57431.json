      "content": "Place ½ cup (113g) of unsalted butter into a mixing bowl, along with 1 cup (200g) of white sugar. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until they form a consistent mixture. Then, crack and mix in 2 eggs separately, giving each one time to incorporate into the batter. Once the eggs are mixed in, pour in 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of vanilla extract. [2] X Research source Don't worry about over-mixing—it's really hard to do when you're creaming your ingredients together."

      "content": "Grab a second mixing bowl and pour in 1½ (188g) cups of all-purpose flour, along with 1¾ tsp (8.4 g) of baking powder. Once the ingredients are incorporated, pour them into the bowl that has your mixture of butter, eggs, vanilla, and sugar. Turn on your stand or hand mixer to stir all of the ingredients together.

      "content": "Slide the pan into the oven and let it bake. At the 30-minute mark, check the cake to see if it looks cooked all the way through—ideally, the cake’s texture will spring back to its original position after you press on it with your finger. Alternatively, quickly slide a toothpick into the center of the cake to make sure no batter is sticking to it. [6] X Research source If you have an instant-read thermometer , scan the cake to see if it’s 210 °F (99 °C). Avoid opening the oven door while the cake is in the middle of baking. Wait to open the door and test the cake for doneness until it's at or near the end of the baking time."

      "content": "Set the cake on a flat, heat-resistant surface or wire cooling rack. For the next hour (or however long it takes the cake to cool down), let the cake cool off completely—at that point, you’re ready to slice into and enjoy your delicious confection. If you plan on frosting your cake, be sure to do so after the cake has completely cooled (otherwise, your frosting will melt and run all over)."
