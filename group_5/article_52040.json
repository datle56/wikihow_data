      "content": "Rinse excess food off your dishes. Hold the dishes under a running faucet or dip them in a basin of water. If necessary, use a sponge or scrubber to remove large bits of stuck-on food. Even if there's very little food residue left on them, you should still get them wet so that the baking soda has something to stick to."

      "title": "Fill a shaker with baking soda.",
      "content": "Fill a shaker with baking soda. Find an old parmesan cheese shaker or salt shaker and fill it with a generous amount of baking soda. Or make your own shaker by using a hammer and a nail to punch small holes into the lid of an empty jar. You can also opt to just use the box the baking soda came in, but be careful that you don't dump too much through the opening as you shake it. Label your new shaker to identify it as baking soda so that no one else thinks it's cheese, salt, or any other food."

      "title": "Sprinkle baking soda onto your wet dishes.",
      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda onto your wet dishes. Shake enough onto the dishes so that when it combines with the water, it creates a paste. You may need to play with the amounts. If it seems too watery, add more baking soda. And if it seems too dry, add small amounts of water either with your fingers or with a teaspoon until you get the right consistency.

      "title": "Rub the paste around on the dishes.",
      "content": "Rub the paste around on the dishes. Using either your fingers or a sponge, rub the paste around in small circles on the surface of the dish. Pay special attention to areas with stuck-on food. You may need to allow the baking soda paste to sit on stubborn food spots for a few minutes while it soaks in."

      "title": "Rinse the dishes.",
      "content": "Rinse the dishes. Wash the baking soda off either with running water or by dipping them into a clean basin of water. If the paste has begun to dry, you may need to use a sponge to rub it all off."

      "title": "Sterilize dishes that came into contact with raw meat.",
      "content": "Sterilize dishes that came into contact with raw meat. While the baking soda is able to get most dishes clean, it won't protect against bacterial hazards like raw meat. So be sure to sterilize the dishes that had raw meat on them before you use them again. Either wait until you have access to dish soap again or soak them in boiling water for 5-10 minutes."

      "content": "Heat some water in another pot over the fire. If it's from a natural source, allow the water to come to a boil first in case it's contaminated. Allow boiling water to cool before you attempt to wash the dishes, however, since it could splash on you and injure you."

      "content": "Scrub off excess food from the dishes. While you're waiting for the water to heat, use a sponge, a rag, or even a sturdy stick to remove large bits of food from the dishes. Don't worry about any grease left on the dishes since this will actually combine with the ashes to form a basic soap."

      "content": "Pour hot water into the pot with the ashes. Add the water slowly and gradually since you only want to add enough to create a paste. Stir it thoroughly with a stick and let it sit for a few minutes. While it's sitting, the hot water is dissolving potassium salts from the ashes to make a strong alkali solution. The alkali water will react with the fatty acids in the grease on your dishes to make soap."

      "content": "Rinse the dishes, the pot, and your hands in clean water. Do not rinse anything near a water source like a river or stream since you'll contaminate it with the ashes. Instead, find a spot away from any bodies of water and rinse everything with the leftover boiled water, or boil more water and allow it to cool enough to handle."
