      "content": "Try performing a scalp massage to help increase blood circulation. Research shows that performing scalp massages on a regular basis may lead to increased hair thickness. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source First, press your fingertips to your scalp, applying light to medium pressure. Move your hands in small circles in one section of your scalp for a few seconds, then move on to another section. Repeat until you’ve massaged your whole head (about 6 minutes). Perform 1-2 scalp massages on yourself each day. [3] X Research source You may want to consider applying a small amount of diluted essential oil to your scalp before your massage. Studies show that peppermint oil and rosemary oil in particular can be helpful for promoting hair growth. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In fact, research has shown that rosemary oil can be as effective at promoting hair regrowth as the medication minoxidil (also known as Rogaine).

      "content": "A brush with stiff, natural bristles can really stimulate your blood vessels. It essentially massages your scalp the same way your fingers would, which can result in more hair growth. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have long or tangled hair, start brushing near the ends and work your way up toward the roots. If you have short hair, work from the center of your scalp toward the ends. Apply light pressure to get the most effective results."

      "content": "Try pouring cold water over your scalp for 1–2 minutes in the shower. There isn’t definitive scientific evidence for this, but many people believe that cold temperature can stimulate blood flow to your scalp and hair follicles, leading to more hair growth. This belief likely comes from the fact that cold temperatures constrict your blood vessels, and then when your body warms up, blood rushes back to those areas as the vessels reopen. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Turn the shower to the coldest temperature you can handle and let it run over your scalp for at least 1–2 minutes at a time. Rub your scalp with your fingertips while you’re rinsing it in the shower to help promote better circulation. If you can’t handle a full cold shower, keep the water hot while you wash your body and turn it cold only when you wash or rinse off your head. You could also try doing a contrast shower, where you alternate between 10-second intervals of warm and cool water."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Institutes of Health U.S. government agency for biomedical and public health research Go to source Start applying a single dose in the center of your scalp and work it toward the sides. Wash your hands immediately after applying the minoxidil, and avoid washing your scalp for 4 hours after application. Let the treatment dry completely, which takes about 2–4 hours.

      "content": "This is called the inversion method. Though there isn’t definitive scientific evidence to support its effectiveness, many people believe that tilting your head upside down promotes hair growth by promoting blood circulation to your scalp. This belief likely comes from the fact that inversion (hanging upside down) increases blood to flow to your head. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To try it, plant your hands on the floor and slowly lower your upper body until your head is upside-down. Continue holding yourself in this position for about 1–2 minutes so blood rushes to your head. Repeat this process once daily. Sit up immediately if you start feeling dizzy or experiencing neck pain. If you can afford it, try using an inversion table that you can lay on and tilt your entire body upside-down. If you have high blood pressure, glaucoma, eye disease, heart disease, a history of strokes, inner ear problems, or are pregnant, consult your doctor before trying out this method, as it does come with some risks.
