      "content": "Snap the vent cover out so you can get down into the air duct. The vent cover isn't molded to the dash in most older cars—if you use a little leverage, you can just pop them out. You can usually tell at a glance if this is going to be possible. A flat-head screwdriver works to get in between the vent cover and the dash. You usually won't hurt anything by doing this, but if you give it a little nudge and it doesn't seem to move, consult your car's manual to see if there's some trick to taking them out. If the vent cover is molded to the dash, this could limit your options somewhat since you won't have open access to the duct. Just open the vents as much as you can."

      "content": "Tie a magnet to a piece of fishing line or strong string. Make sure it's secure, then slide the magnet into the duct. When you see or hear the magnet latch onto the object, start to slowly pull it up. [1] X Research source Be careful not to bang against the sides of the duct as you come up—you might break the magnetic hold. The stronger the magnet you use, the less your chances of this happening. For a little more stability, try a magnetic pickup tool —they're designed to solve just these sorts of problems. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "If the duct is straight, grab the object with forceps and pull it out.",
      "content": "If the duct is straight, grab the object with forceps and pull it out. Use long hemostat forceps to reach in and grab the object. Go slowly and take care not to push the object further down the duct in the process. Some forceps have a locking mechanism for more security. If you're good with chopsticks, you might be able to use them to grab the object the same way you would use hemostat forceps. If you weren't able to get the vent covers off, you might need to twist your forceps or adjust the grip to pull your object through the slats. You could also switch to tweezers to get the job done. Just remember—it fell down in there, so it'll come back through!"

      "title": "A vacuum has enough force to pick up a lightweight object.",
      "content": "A vacuum has enough force to pick up a lightweight object. A household vacuum with hose attachments might also work, although a Shop-Vac tends to have more suction. Empty the vacuum out before you start so it'll be easier for you to reclaim the object from the vacuum. Then, aim the hose down the vent. For a Shop-Vac, use a filter with a general household filtration level. [3] X Research source If you've taken the vent covers off and you have a small enough hose or attachment, send it straight down the duct. It'll be more likely to suck up the object if there's less distance between the object and the end of the hose."

      "title": "A flexible pickup tool can reach the object if your ducts aren't straight.",
      "content": "A flexible pickup tool can reach the object if your ducts aren't straight. Buy a flexible pickup tool , similar to the snake tool you might use to unclog a drain. You'll probably want to go with the simplest model, although you can get fancy versions that have lights and even cameras attached to them. [4] X Research source If you can't see the object, you'll probably have to do a little blind poking around with your tool until you're able to grab the object and pull it out. It can take some patience, but it's worth it if you're able to retrieve the object on your own."

      "title": "Use your pickup tool like a broom to sweep the object out.",
      "content": "Use your pickup tool like a broom to sweep the object out. This only works if you removed the vent covers to gain open access to the duct. Attach something like an expired credit card firmly to your pickup tool and slip it down the duct. Try to keep it lifted until you've passed the object so you don't push the object further down. [5] X Research source Set the edge of your credit card or other sweeper firmly on the bottom of the duct and pull it up slowly. You might have to stop and reset it a few times to get the object close enough that you can grab it."

      "title": "If the object has fallen all the way down, the filter might've caught it.",
      "content": "If the object has fallen all the way down, the filter might've caught it. Check your car's manual to locate the cabin air filter. It's typically either under the dash or behind your glove box, although some are in the engine compartment. Once you access the filter, it should slide right out. If your object has traveled all the way through your vents, you'll find it resting on the filter. There's no real way to know for sure if the object has fallen this far without pulling out the filter. Fortunately, they're typically pretty simple to remove. Look at the condition of the air filter while you're at it. If it looks pretty dirty, you might want to go ahead and replace it. Your local auto parts store can help you find the right filter for your vehicle's make, model, and year."

      "content": "A mechanic can take apart the dash to access the full vent system. When you first talk to the mechanic, be clear about the problem you have. Let them know which vent you dropped the object through as well as anything you've already done yourself to try to retrieve it. [6] X Research source Find out what the mechanic thinks they'll need to do to get to your object and how long it will take. Ask for an estimate before they start work—that object might not be worth it!"
