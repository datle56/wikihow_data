CO detectors have batteries even if they are mounted on the wall, so they can continue to work if there's a power outage.

[2] X Research source First, check to make sure the batteries in your CO detector are new and properly placed in the battery casing. If the batteries are okay, consider the following to determine if the beeping is due to environmental factors: The area around your CO detector is often humid or steamy and may even form condensation. There's an air conditioner, heater, fan, or breezy open window near your detector. The room is consistently under 40 째F (4 째C) or over 100 째F (38 째C). If any of these are true, your CO detector may be in a bad spot. Try moving it to a different location. The manual that comes with your carbon monoxide detector will suggest the best spots to put your detector."

If you aren't sure why your CO alarm is beeping, it's always safest to evacuate and call for help, even in the case of a false alarm. Try fixing the root cause of the beep before resetting it. Use this step above to determine what the cause of the beeping is (i.e., a dead battery, a dying unit, etc.). If fixing the root cause doesn't stop the beeping or the beeping isn't caused by something you can figure out (but it's not an emergency), you can continue resetting the device."
