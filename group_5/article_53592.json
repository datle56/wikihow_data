      "content": "Draw a downward curving line for the upper eyelid. Make the length of the line as wide as you want the eye to be. Make the line thick near the middle, and then have it get gradually thinner the closer it gets to the ends. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Sketch a horizontal line that curves up at the ends for the lower eyelid.",
      "content": "Sketch a horizontal line that curves up at the ends for the lower eyelid. Place this line underneath the upper eyelid so there’s a gap between them that’s about ⅔ the length of the upper eyelid. Make this line about ½ the length of the upper eyelid, and center it underneath the upper eyelid. [2] X Research source Female anime eyes are usually rounder and wider than male anime eyes. The further apart you place the upper and lower eyelids, the wider the eye will be."

      "content": "Draw a partial oval coming down off of the upper eyelid for the iris. Center the oval underneath the upper eyelid, and draw it so the top ⅕ of the oval is missing since that part of the iris is blocked by the eyelid. Leave a gap between the bottom of the oval and the lower eyelid that’s about ¼ the length of the lower eyelid. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add 2 circles inside of the iris to show light reflecting off of the eye.",
      "content": "Add 2 circles inside of the iris to show light reflecting off of the eye. Place the circles on opposite sides of the iris, and make one of them twice as big as the other one. Make the biggest circle about ⅕ the size of the iris. The exact placement of the circles will depend on where the light is shining in your drawing. [4] X Research source If you want the light source to be on the left in your drawing, draw the big circle on the left side of the iris and the small circle on the right. If the light is on the right, swap the circles. For lighting that’s above the eye, draw the big circle at the top of the iris and the small circle at the bottom. Do the opposite for lighting that’s below the eye."

Don’t draw the parts that overlap with the circles you drew for the glare. Those parts of the pupil will be covered. After you draw the pupil, shade it in with your pencil so it’s as dark as you can get it. [5] X Research source"

Make the tail about ⅕ the length of the upper eyelid. Then, draw another tail that’s the same length directly to the left of the first one. Repeat one more time so you have 3 tails in total. [6] X Research source Thick, distinct eyelashes are one of the defining characteristics of female anime eyes."

For lighting that’s above the eye, draw the big circle at the top of the iris and the small circle at the bottom. Swap the circles if the light is underneath the eye."

Instead of curving the ends of the lower eyelids up like you would for a blank expression, curve them down. This will give the eyes a sad look, almost like your character is about to cry.

Draw the upper eyelids higher and the lower eyelids lower than normal so there are gaps between both the tops and bottoms of the pupils and the eyelids. This will make it look like your anime character is opening their eyes wide in shock. [15] X Research source The wider you make the eyes, the more surprised your character will look. Drawing the eyebrow high can also help the character look shocked/scared/surprised."

Starting at the outer corners of the eyes, draw the upper eyelids like you normally would, but draw a steep downward slope once you get to the inner half of each eyelid. It will look like your character is furrowing their eyebrows because they're angry. [16] X Research source The steeper you make the slope, the angrier your anime character will look."

To draw the eyes closed, just draw the upper eyelids like you normally would—a downward curving line for female anime eyes or a horizontal line with a slight curve for male anime eyes. Don’t draw the iris, pupil, or lower eyelid. Drawing the eyes like this will make it look like your character is closing their eyes and smiling because they’re joyful. [17] X Research source"
