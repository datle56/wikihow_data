      "content": "Power cycle your dock and TV. Power cycling can help refresh electronics when they stop working correctly (kind of like rebooting your PC when things aren't working right).

      "title": "Open the back of your dock and clean out the ports.",
      "content": "Open the back of your dock and clean out the ports. If your ports are dirty, the cables won't be able to make a proper connection with the port, and your dock won't work as expected. Use a flashlight to check to see if your ports need to be cleaned, and if so, clean them out with compressed air. Take this time to also check your ports for damage. If your dock's ports are visibly damaged, this is likely the culprit for your dock not working, and you'll either need to get your dock fixed or replaced."

      "title": "Try plugging your dock into a different HDMI port on your TV or monitor.",
      "content": "Try plugging your dock into a different HDMI port on your TV or monitor.

      "content": "Try using your dock on a different TV or monitor. If no other troubleshooting steps are working and you have another TV or monitor, you can try moving your dock over to that display. If your dock still does not work after this, you will likely need to get a replacement."

      "title": "Try a different dock if you have one available.",
      "content": "Try a different dock if you have one available. If you have another Nintendo Switch dock, try using it. You could also ask a friend with a Switch if you could borrow their dock to test if the issue is with your dock or something else. If a second dock works but your original dock does not, you will likely have to replace your dock."
