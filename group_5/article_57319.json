      "content": "Write down at least 5 things every time you make a list. A list of 5 gratitudes per session is a pretty doable goal. If you’re having a tough time, start with 3 things instead. You can number your list, create bullet points, or simply write down 5 sentences or statements. There’s no wrong way to do this!

      "title": "Aim to be as specific as possible.",
      "content": "Aim to be as specific as possible. Being specific forces you to examine the world around you closely and gives you the chance to be grateful for a wide variety of things. As you’re thinking of things for your list, try to zero in on specifics. [4] X Research source For example, “I’m grateful that my friend brought me soup earlier when I was feeling under the weather,” is better than “I’m grateful for my friend.” Instead of \"I'm grateful for nice weather,\" go with \"I’m grateful for the way the wind sounds when it blows leaves across my lawn,\" or \"I’m grateful for the warm sun on my shoulders when I’m walking outside.\" \"I'm grateful for my cat's soft fur and deep purr whenever I pet her,\" is better than \"I'm grateful for my kitty.\""

      "content": "Include plenty of detail. Focusing on the smaller details can make your lists feel even more impactful. Don’t be afraid to elaborate with as many details as you’d like. There’s no word limit for your gratitude, and you might find that the little details bring you the most joy. [5] X Research source For example, you might write things like: “I'm grateful for the cool, sweet iced tea that I enjoyed with my friends today.” ”I’m grateful for the salty smell of the sea that wafts through my open window every morning.” ”I’m grateful for the juicy, home-grown tomatoes that I sliced up for my turkey sandwich today.” \"I’m grateful for the scent of the pine trees and damp earth when I walk in the park.”"

      "content": "Focus on experiences and people instead of objects. There’s nothing wrong with being grateful for things that you own and you can certainly write them down sometimes. Keep in mind, though, that gratitude lists tend to have more impact if you focus on your experiences and the people in your life.

If you prefer to end your night on a thankful note, try doing it right before bed. Studies show that writing a gratitude list 3 times per week has more impact than doing daily lists, so aim for that to start.
