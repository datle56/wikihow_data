These apples are available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but Syrupy Apples can only be purchased if you have the Teal Mask DLC. You can trade these apples to your friends in other game versions by attaching them to a Pokémon as a held item, and then trading the Pokémon to your friend. This is a great alternative to evolving the Applin yourself, as it allows your friend to choose their own Applin to evolve."
