      "content": "Unplug the appliance and allow it to cool down completely. Cleaning expert Ryan Santos says it’s “important to make sure the air fryer is unplugged and completely cool before starting to clean.” Wait for about 30 minutes to allow the components to cool down before you start washing them out. [1] X Research source If you can’t wait for the Airfryer to cool down completely, wear heat-resistant gloves before handling the hot appliance."

      "content": "Discard the grease from the bottom of the pan. Grab the handle on the pan and slide it out horizontally from the body of the appliance. Lift out the frying basket and set it aside. If the bottom of the pan is lined with grease, carefully pour it into a lidded disposable container, such as a glass jar or plastic tub. Seal up the container and discard it. [2] X Research source To detach the basket from the pan, slide the transparent lid on the top of the handle up. Press the button under the lid and lift the handle up to lift the basket out of the pan. [3] X Research source Use a plastic utensil to scoop out solid fats. Avoid using a metal tool as it might scratch the nonstick coating on the pan. Avoid pouring the grease down your sink. Fats, oil, and grease can clog up your pipes, preventing your water from flowing smoothly. [4] X Research source"

With the basket nested inside the sudsy pan, leave both pieces to soak for about 10 minutes. [5] X Research source If your pan and basket aren’t too greasy or stained, skip this step."

Use hot, soapy water and a sponge or soft-bristled brush to scrub both sides of the pan and the mesh on the basket. [6] X Research source Rinse off the suds from the pan and basket. Try to avoid using a stiff-bristled brush or steel wool, which can scratch up the nonstick coating. [7] X Research source On most air fryers, tougher grease stains can be removed using a powerful liquid degreaser . Check the manual to see if this product is recommended for your machine.

      "content": "Put the pan and basket in the dishwasher instead for a quicker clean. Tip out the grease and give each piece a quick rinse and scrub to get rid of as much food residue and grease as possible. Set the pan with the rubber plug and basket face-down into your dishwasher and run a normal cycle with mild dishwasher detergent. [9] X Research source While hand-washing is the recommended cleaning method, the pan and basket in a Philips Airfryer are dishwasher-safe. The heating element and body of the air fryer are not. Keep in mind that the appliance itself isn’t dishwasher-safe; you’ll need to remove the pan and basket to wash them."

Once they’re dry, place the basket back into the pan and slide the pan into the body of the appliance. [10] X Research source Use a paper towel or soft cloth to blot away any excess water, if necessary."

To easily reach the heating element, which sits above the pan and basket, flip the whole appliance upside-down. Set the flat top part of the appliance down onto a flat work surface.

With the appliance turned upside-down, scrub the surface of the coil to release the greasy residue. Rinse off your sponge or brush as needed, and continue to wipe down the rest of the inner chamber. [13] X Research source Use a small flexible cleaning brush (like a straw cleaning brush ) or toothbrush to reach the area behind the heating element. [14] X Research source Allow the inner chamber to air-dry completely before sliding the pan back into the appliance. Discard the sponge after you use it because it will collect a lot of grease. [15] X Research source Every 3 months or whenever you notice white smoke coming out of the air vent at the back, clean the heating element and the inside of your air fryer. [16] X Research source"

For tougher stains, you can mix dish soap and water to gently scrub the area.” Wipe down all of the outside surfaces, including the handle and buttons. Dry the surface with a cloth, making sure no moisture remains on the control panel. [18] X Research source If necessary, spray a small amount of degreasing solution onto your cloth and use this to rub away any stubborn spots."
