Use this method to reset your Tinder account if you use Facebook to log in. You can do these steps on either an iPhone or Android. The safest and best way to reset your Tinder account is to wait 3 months or 92 days after deleting your account and making a new one. If you do this too quickly (within 24 hours) or too often, Tinder will flag your account as spam or a bot and might shadowban your account temporarily or completely ban you. In order for a complete reset to work, you'll need new information, like a new email account, a new Google Play Store account or Apple ID, a new phone number, and a new IP address."
