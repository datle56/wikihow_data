If a friend or someone you're crushing on is making you laugh, you probably want to return the favor. To send a funny response of your own, try a meme. It'll save you from having to think of your own witty response, and it'll likely make them smile. [3] X Research source Find hilarious memes on Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, and other sites online. Look for memes that relate to your friend's unique interests and sense of humor. You might even try something that relates to the joke your friend told. Let's say your friend is joking about your sign in astrology. Send over a funny astrology meme about their sign in return."

If they respond, keep sending cat pictures. Then, let them know they've got the wrong number. Tell them that they've got the wrong number, but respond to their message anyway.
