      "content": "Initiate your case. Before you can ask a court to change or terminate a parent's custody rights, you need to file your case with the court clerk. Start your case by doing one of the following: Contact the Department of Child Protective Services (CPS) in your state. Your state's CPS office is tasked with protecting the wellbeing of children. Depending on the policies of the office, your local CPS office may be able to investigate and file your case for you. File for divorce. If you are married to the child's other parent, custody of the child will be a key issue in the dissolution proceedings. In your petition for dissolution, explain the custody arrangement you want and why the other parent should be awarded little or no custody. File a petition for custody. You can file a petition to establish custody if you are the child's father and were never married to the child's mother. If you are already divorced from the other parent and you want to change the current custody arrangement, you can petition to modify the custody order. Call or visit the court clerk and ask what forms you need to submit to make your request. Use the space provided on the forms to explain what arrangement you would like and why the other parent's custody rights should be reduced. File a guardianship petition. If you are not one of the child's parents, you can still file to become the child's legal guardian. Ask the court clerk what forms you need to submit to make your request. Use the space provided on the forms to explain why the child should be removed from his or parents and placed in your care."

The clerk will notify you by mail once a date has been set for the hearing. To file for custody or guardianship, you need to file in the county where the child lives. If you cannot afford the filing fee, ask the court clerk how to apply for a fee waiver. You will need to give detailed information about your household finances, and the judge will consider whether or not you meet the criteria to have your fees waived."

Otherwise, do one of the following: Ask the court clerk if the clerk's office will serve the parent; Hire the sheriff's office or a professional process server; or Have a friend or relative over 18 years old and not involved in the case to deliver the documents to the parent."

The judge will then ask you why you have requested that the parent's custody of the child be terminated or modified. The parent will be able to argue that custody should not be taken from him or her, and that it would not be in the best interests of the child to do so. Both sides will have the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence to support his or her position."

This can include documents and photographs (both originals and copies), videos, and audio files. Burn any video or audio files to a CD in advance. Have your physical evidence organized in a binder in chronological order so that you can quickly refer to each item during the proceedings. If any of your evidence was given to you by a witness, ask the witness about that evidence during his or her testimony. You will need to argue not only that the parent is unfit, but that placing the child in your care would be in the child's best interests. To show that you can give the child a safe and stable home, include a copy of your lease or mortgage with your evidence to show that you are financially responsible."

If you are self-represented, simply explain each incident to the judge and answer any questions he or she has for you. After you testify, ask the judge to allow you to present your witnesses. The child may be allowed to testify at the hearing. Each state has its own rules about whether and when a child's testimony is admissible in court. In Ohio, for example, children over 10 are generally allowed to testify, while children under 10 must be interviewed by the court and found to be able to understand questions and tell the truth. [3] X Research source After each witness gives testimony, the other side will be allowed to cross-examine the witness. When you are cross-examined, give short and truthful answers, and do not be afraid to admit it when you do not know the answer to a question. [4] X Research source"
