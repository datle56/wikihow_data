It would not be fair to you or your puppy to bring him home when you are not truly ready for, or committed to, caring for him. Asking yourself a few questions—and answering them honestly—will help you determine if you are ready to take on the responsibility of buying a puppy. Do I have the time groom, train, and exercise my puppy? Puppies are very time-intensive—although some breeds are more laid back than others, you will need to devote a lot of time to properly caring for your puppy. If you have a busy schedule or are out of town a lot, you may need to reconsider if you will be able to make time to take care of a puppy. Am I financially able to cover the costs of caring for a puppy? There’s no getting around the fact that puppies are expensive. Think about if you are ready to pay for all of the necessities (food, collar, toys, bedding, etc.) plus regular and unexpected veterinary visits. Is anyone at my house allergic to dogs?

Research breeds with characteristics (e.g., small dog, calm temperament, etc.) that make them a good fit for your life situation. The AKC has a matching quiz that can help you choose a breed. Dogs come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. Choosing the wrong breed can result in heartbreak for all if you realize that he is not a good fit for your home. A few examples of important factors to keep in mind include your living situation (apartment vs home) and work schedule (regular work hours vs constant travel). Consider the energy level of the breed. For example, if you don't enjoy being outdoors much, getting a Siberian husky probably isn't the best idea. Huskies love to jump and run, and they need hours of daily exercise. It may be better to choose a puppy who will grow up to be a dog that likes napping and hanging out with you at home, such as a Cavalier King Charles. If you rent, your apartment may have breed and weight restrictions for dogs. In addition, a large dog who needs a lot of exercise, such as a Golden Retriever, may feel a bit stifled in an apartment. If your apartment complex allows larger dogs, you will need to make sure that you have easy access to a large fenced-in area or dog park where you dog will be able run and exercise. Talking to a reputable breeder could help you narrow down which breed would be an ideal fit for your life situation. Other than doing Internet searches of dog breeds, consider purchasing a book on dog breeds. Keep in mind that you do not have to pick a specific breed. A mutt will do just fine!"

Animal shelters and rescue groups often conduct behavioral tests (also known as temperament tests) to determine if a puppy is a good candidate for adoption.
