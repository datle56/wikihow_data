      "content": "Get your Magikarp to level 20 to evolve it into Gyarados. As soon as Magikarp gets enough experience and reaches Level 20, it will try to evolve. Magikarp turns into the powerful Water/Flying-type Gyarados with a strong Attack stat. [1] X Research source At level 20, Gyarados learns the Dark-type move Bite, which has a chance to make your opponent flinch during battle. [2] X Research source If you don’t already have a Magikarp, they’re one of the most common Water types in the game. Search for them by fishing in bodies of water or searching near lakes and rivers for them on the map."

      "title": "Press B to cancel the evolution and keep training your Magikarp.",
      "content": "Press B to cancel the evolution and keep training your Magikarp. Magikarp eventually learns Flail if you keep leveling it up. This move does a lot of damage when your Pokémon is injured, and Gyarados isn’t able to learn it after it evolves. [3] X Research source If you want learn the attack, press B during the evolution animation to stop it from happening. Each time your Magikarp levels up, it will try to evolve again, so keep canceling it until you’ve trained your Pokémon to the level you want. [4] X Research source In Pokémon Sword, Shield, Scarlet, and Violet, Magikarp needs to reach level 25 to learn Flail. In Generation VII and earlier games, Magikarp learns Flail at level 30. If you found a shiny Magikarp, consider keeping it as a trophy for its unique gold color. Of course, you could evolve it into a shiny red Gyarados if you’d rather have that. Alternatively, try raising a Magikarp to Level 100 for a fun challenge."

      "content": "Send Magikarp into a battle and then immediately switch it out. Set Magikarp as the first Pokémon in your party so it’s sent out first in a battle. On your first turn, switch to more powerful Pokémon. As long as your Magikarp is in for the first round of battle, they will get a share of the experience points and start leveling up. [5] X Research source This is a great idea when you have a Magikarp that only knows Splash. Since Splash doesn’t do any damage, switching out your Pokémon is the best option. Once Magikarp learns Tackle at level 15, start using it in battle against some weak Pokémon."

Share item in your bag. While the Exp. Share is held or turned on, your Magikarp receives a portion of the experience gained from battles, even if you don’t use them to attack. As long as you keep Magikarp in your party, it’ll be ready to evolve in no time. [6] X Research source In Generation I, get the Exp. Share from Oak’s aide on Route 15. In Generation II, give Mr. Pokémon on Route 30 a Red Scale in exchange for an Exp. Share. In Gen III, deliver the Letter to Mr. Stone at the Devon Corporation to get the item. For Gen IV games, visit Dawn or Lucas’ father on Route 206 after seeing 35 Pokémon. In Gen V, get the Exp. Share from the Battle Company in Castelia City or from the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman in Icirrus City. For Gen VI, go to Alexa in Santalune City after defeating Viola. In Gen VII, get the Exp. Share on Route 1 from Professor Kukui. In Gen VIII & IX, you automatically get the Exp. Share."

Your Magikarp gains 1 experience per step you take in the game, so keep running around and occasionally checking in on your Magikarp to see when it reaches level 20. Even though your Magikarp won’t evolve in the Day Care Center, it will immediately try to after the first time you use it in battle.
