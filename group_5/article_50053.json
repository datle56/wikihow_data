      "title": "If you’re crushing on someone: find ways to make yourself more visible.",
      "content": "If you’re crushing on someone: find ways to make yourself more visible. If you've been crushing on them from afar, they probably have no idea you have feelings for them. Maybe you haven’t even met yet! The 3 of Pentacles urges you to take a more proactive approach if you want a relationship with them. Putting yourself out there can be a little nerve-wracking, but it'll pay off in a big way. What to do: Find natural ways and reasons to be around them. Let them get to know you and develop a rapport before approaching them romantically. When they see you shining in your element, they'll fall hard."

      "title": "If you’re in a long-term relationship: you aren't functioning as a team.",
      "content": "If you’re in a long-term relationship: you aren't functioning as a team. Maybe one (or both) of you hasn’t been putting in much effort lately—life gets busy, work is distracting, responsibilities demand attention...we get it! Whatever the reason, you’re feeling disconnected from your partner, and you don’t like it one bit. Remember that a relationship is an ongoing project between two people—it requires time, effort, and maintenance to flourish. What to do: Set up a date night once a week (or month) and focus only on each other during that time. Be curious and ask each other questions. Even if you feel like you know everything about them already, humans are always changing and growing—give your partner a chance and you'll find that they can still surprise and delight you."

      "content": "If you’re in a new relationship: poor communication is hindering you. Maybe you’ve both been busy lately, or perhaps there’s some hesitancy on one side to truly open up and be vulnerable. Or maybe you're starting to repeat all-too-familiar patterns from failed past relationships. Remember—you've learned these lessons already! It’s not too late to redirect and forge a real bond, but it takes communication, self-awareness, and vulnerability on both sides to get there. What to do: Try having a conversation about your thoughts, feelings, and emotions rather than sticking to the surface level stuff—notice how your partner responds. Do they warm to the subject? Are they forthcoming? Some folks can be shy at first, but it’s not a great sign if they don’t reciprocate at all."

      "title": "If you’re single: a lack of self-development is blocking your potential.",
      "content": "If you’re single: a lack of self-development is blocking your potential. You’re locked into your comfortable old routine, going to the same places and interacting with the same people. Everyone shifts to autopilot occasionally and that’s okay—but if you want to meet or connect with someone, it's time to get exit your comfort zone. The 3 of Pentacles urges you to take advantage of opportunities to work with a group, play with a team, or mix with a new social circle. What to do: Some serious self-care is in order! Give yourself permission to be the center of your own attention. Try creative outlets like journaling, drawing, or painting to explore your inner world in an intentional way. Change up your routine and get to know the new faces around you."

It’s normal to feel shy or hesitant when you like someone, but the 3 of Pentacles' message is to make yourself more visible to this person. They may have no clue you’ve caught feelings for them, or if you’re never met them, they may not even know who you are. It takes guts to make the first move, but you're a strong person. Take a deep breath—you can do this! What to do: Start small—just make eye contact and give them a friendly smile. Change your routine so that you walk by them or work closer to them. Sign up for a team or project that they’re a part of. Basically, get on their radar! After that, just be your awesome self."
