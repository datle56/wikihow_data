      "content": "Cut off the fronds, not the stem. The fronds are thin, feathery strands attached to the stem, similar to a dill plant. Snip off these fronds in 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) pieces, leaving the rest of the plant intact. [3] X Research source Experts don’t specifically recommend refrigerating your fennel fronds. Instead, just cut off as much as you need. [4] X Research source These fronds add an elegant touch to your salads. Some chefs even like to add fennel fronds to their cooking water when they prepare rice and beans. [5] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Since there’s no official freezer recommendation for this plant, play it safe and freeze your fennel for 4-6 months. [11] X Research source Herb fennel is pretty similar to dill, and the freezer recommendation for dill is 4-6 months. Some people like to freeze their herbs in oil-filled ice cube trays. However, this freezing method doesn’t work well with soft, frond-like herbs. [12] X Research source"

Bake the stalks for 3 hours; then, switch off the oven and let the fennel dry out overnight. Once the stalks are dry, slip them into a sealed plastic bag. [13] X Research source If you have a little more time on your hands, tie your fennel stalks in bunches and leave them to air-dry in a dry, cool area for about 1-2 weeks."
