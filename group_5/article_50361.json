      "content": "Open up your toilet seat and look for metal hinges that sit on vertical pegs. Metal peg-style hinges are 1 of the 2 main types of hinge assemblies that soft-close toilet seats may use. Look for metal pegs coming up from round plates attached to the back of the toilet bowl, which the hinges on the toilet seat slide onto. If you don’t see this type of hinge assembly, your soft-close seat probably has a plastic clip-on type of hinge assembly."

      "title": "Lift the toilet seat straight up off the hinges from the upright position.",
      "content": "Lift the toilet seat straight up off the hinges from the upright position. Leave the soft-close seat in the fully open position. Hold the seat at the top and bottom or at both sides and carefully pull it straight up off the metal pegs. If your toilet seat doesn’t lift straight off, try tilting it forward just a few degrees and see if you can lift it off from that position. If you can’t slide the seat off the pegs, try pressing in the hinges with your thumbs and lifting it off. Different soft-close seats with peg-style hinge assemblies may have different locking mechanisms."

      "content": "Pull out the cylindrical dampers on both sides of the back of the seat. Grab the dampers between your fingers. Pull the cylinders all the way out of the holes they sit in. [1] X Research source These dampers are what actually control the speed at which the seat closes."

      "title": "Rotate the dampers towards the back of the seat to make it close more slowly.",
      "content": "Rotate the dampers towards the back of the seat to make it close more slowly. Spin each hinge damper towards the back of the seat, ensuring that you align the shape of the dampers with the shape of the holes that they slide into. This will slow down the seat’s hinges so they close it more softly and quietly. [2] X Research source Not all soft-close toilet seat hinges are adjustable. If there are notches on the dampers that make it so you can only take them in and out in 1 position, they are not adjustable. If your hinges are adjustable, they may be hexagonal or have multiple notches that allow you to put them in at different positions. They might also be labeled with “slow/fast” and directional arrows. Depending on the specific soft-close toilet seat you have, there might be 2-3 different positions you can set the dampers in to control the speed of the seat."

[3] X Research source If the soft-close dampers have multiple positions you can set them to for different speeds, double-check that you are putting them in at the same position on both sides of the seat. Otherwise, the seat and lid might close at different speeds."

Plastic clip-on hinge assemblies are the second main type of hinge assemblies that soft-close toilet seats can have. Look for rectangular plastic pieces that come off the back of the toilet seat, which cover the bolts in the toilet bowl that the seat’s hinges clip onto. If you don’t see a plastic hinge assembly, your soft-close seat probably has metal peg-style hinges."

Flip up the plastic hinge covers at the back of the seat, then grasp the seat from the back and pull it straight forward off the toilet. [5] X Research source If you are unable to slide off the toilet seat, you might have to unscrew the bolts from underneath on the back side of the toilet bowl to remove it. Soft-close toilet seats with clip-on hinge assemblies can have slightly different attachment methods, depending on the specific make and model."

[7] X Research source There might be a plastic cover on the underside of the hinge assembly that you have to pop off to see the cylindrical hinge dampers. If so, just pry it off with your fingers and set it aside. You might also be able to lift the whole hinge assembly out of the toilet seat to work on it more easily."

Look at any notches or markings on the dampers and look at the shape of the holes in the hinge assembly to determine how far to turn the hinges to reinsert them at a new position. [8] X Research source If there are only 1 set of notches on the dampers or their shape makes it so that they can only be inserted into the hinge assembly in 1 position, they are not adjustable. Adjustable hinges are sometimes hexagonal or have different notches so you can insert them at different positions. They could also have directional arrows and be labeled with “slow/fast.” There might be 2-3 different positions you can set the dampers in to set the soft-close seat to different speeds, depending on the make and model of the seat."

Do the same with the damper on the other side of the seat. [9] X Research source Make sure you’re putting both the dampers in the same position on their respective sides of the hinge assembly, or the seat and lid could close at different speeds. If you removed the hinge assembly from the seat or popped a cover off the hinge assembly, replace these at this time as well."
