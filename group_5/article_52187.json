      "content": "Inspect the pumpkin for any rotten parts. You should do this before purchasing a pumpkin in the store, and again when you get home. You want to buy a pumpkin that is the same color and texture throughout. Darker, mushier portions of the pumpkin indicate rotting. [1] X Research source If you notice some parts of the pumpkin have rotted after bringing it home, cut these parts off with a knife before cooking the pumpkin."

      "content": "Scrub the outside of the pumpkin with a vegetable brush. If you don't have a vegetable brush, a rough, clean cloth should work. This will help loosen up any dirt and debris, allowing you to easily rinse off any contaminants. You do not need to use water here. You will rinse the pumpkin off later. [2] X Research source Pumpkins can be very big, so this takes some patience. Make sure to scrub down the entire surface of the pumpkin. Make sure not to scrub too hard. You don't want to end up scraping off the skin of the pumpkin."

      "content": "Remove the seeds. A serrated spoon, such as a grapefruit spoon, works great to remove pumpkin seeds. You can also use an ice cream scoop. Scrape the spoon along the inside of each half of the pumpkin. Remove all the seeds from inside. [5] X Research source Once you have removed the seeds, your pumpkin is ready to cook. When carving a pumpkin, you need to make sure the inside walls are very smooth. This is not necessary when cleaning out a pumpkin to cook. Do not worry too much if the sides are uneven or a little mushy. Just make sure to get out all the seeds."

      "title": "Carve a hole out of the pumpkin.",
      "content": "Carve a hole out of the pumpkin. It's actually easier, and safer, to carve a hole at the bottom of the pumpkin to start, but carving the top is the traditional method. Using the bottom way, you can smooth out the bottom of the pumpkin's inside where you will later set down your candle. This reduces the risk of the candle toppling over, which could cause a fire. Turn the pumpkin sideways and use a knife to trace a large hole at the bottom of the pumpkin. Your opening should be big enough that you can easily reach inside the pumpkin. Take a small knife and gently cut around the hole, and then use your knife to pry out the bottom. Take your knife and use it to level out the bottom of the pumpkin. Cut off the excess seeds and strings from the bottom of the pumpkin, striving to cut a neat line. You're trying to create a level surface on which you will place a candle."

      "content": "Dig the seeds out with a spoon or your hands. You can now reach into the pumpkin and dig out the seeds. A spoon, particularly a serrated spoon, works best here. If you're using a pumpkin carving kit, you may have received a serrated spoon with the kit. You can also use an ice cream scoop. Some people prefer to use their fingers to dig out the seeds. Dig out all the seeds using your hands or a spoon. Make sure there are no seeds left in the pumpkin when you're done. If you're saving the seeds to roast later, make sure to set them in a safe place."

      "title": "Smooth the inside wall.",
      "content": "Smooth the inside wall. Use a clay modeling tool, which typically comes with a pumpkin carving kit, to smooth out the inner walls. You can also buy a clay modeling tool at a craft store if you don't have one. Run the tool along the walls of the pumpkin, removing strings and making the walls smoother overall. After the walls are smoothed out, there will be a lot of strings and goo stuck on the side of the pumpkin. Remove these with a spoon."

      "content": "Put the bottom back in place and cut out a hole in the top. Once you've cleaned out the pumpkin, place the bottom back in place. You should be able to simply press it back into place using your hands. You can then cut another, similar sized hole on the top, near the stem. Your pumpkin is now ready to carve for Halloween."

If your cut does not stop bleeding, or if you notice signs like numbness, see a doctor right away. You may need stitches or other medical treatments."
