      "content": "Do exercises to strengthen your non-dominant hand and fingers . Your non-dominant hand is most likely a lot less strong than your dominant hand, which makes it harder at first to become ambidextrous. Lift some light weights with your non-dominant hand every other day, with a focus on keeping a tight grip to work your hands rather than your arms. Use heavier weights as you go to continue strengthening your hand. [1] X Research source Lifting weights is one of the best ways to strengthen your hand, but you can also use a grip exerciser . You may also benefit from juggling or simply tossing a ball up into the air with your non-dominant hand to improve hand-eye coordination . Giffin explains that the best way to become truly ambidextrous is by “doing exercises and activities focusing on coordination and function.”"

      "content": "Use your non-dominant hand to move your computer mouse. Switching your mouse hand helps you increase the dexterity of your non-dominant hand. Simply move your ordinary mouse over to the opposite side of the computer and use it as you normally would from here on out. [2] X Research source You can also opt to invest in an “ambidextrous” mouse , but it’s much simpler to just use an ordinary mouse."

      "content": "Start performing small daily tasks with your non-dominant hand. Use your non-dominant hand to do things like brush your teeth, open doors, put on accessories, or clean up around the house. Do this as consistently as you can to make using your non-dominant hand feel less awkward. [3] X Research source Try to do as much as you can with your non-dominant hand, such as applying soap and shampoo when you bathe. You may not realize it, but you probably do most of these small tasks with your dominant hand. Make sure to brush your teeth correctly when using your non-dominant hand. If you’re not comfortable brushing with this hand, you may inadvertently underbrush. If you play an instrument, try playing with your non-dominant hand instead of your dominant hand."

      "content": "Eat and cook with your non-dominant hand after a few days. Use your non-dominant hand to move pots and pans, stir food, and serve meals. Hold your silverware with your non-dominant hand and use it to move the food to your mouth. You may have to do this slowly at first to avoid dropping the food, but it will get easier with time! [4] X Research source It’s best to spend a few days getting used to performing small tasks with your non-dominant hand first, since cooking with boiling water or other heated materials can be a bit more dangerous."

      "title": "Tie your dominant hand behind your back for more of a challenge.",
      "content": "Tie your dominant hand behind your back for more of a challenge. This method forces you to exclusively use your non-dominant hand to do everything. This is a great way to make your mind and body quickly adapt to using this hand, but you may want to do it after a few days of practice first. The easiest way to do this would be tie your dominant wrist with rope, then tie the other end of that rope to the belt loop on the back of your pants. This may be difficult to do yourself, so you ask someone to help you."

      "title": "Hold a pen with your non-dominant hand as you would with your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Hold a pen with your non-dominant hand as you would with your dominant hand. Write with your good hand in the mirror to see how it would look writing with your other hand . This gives you a clear visual cue to the method and helps your brain picture the same action for your non-dominant hand. Then, practice holding the pen or pencil with your non-dominant hand so that it feels more comfortable. [5] X Research source Avoid “clawing” your hand. It may be tempting to grasp the pen as tightly as possible, causing your hand to ball up like a claw, but this stops you from writing effectively and can end up hurting your hand. Giffin recommends using a high-quality pen or pencil so you don’t have to press hard on the paper."

      "title": "Start by tracing the alphabet with your non-dominant hand.",
      "content": "Start by tracing the alphabet with your non-dominant hand. Start with lowercase letters, and once the feeling becomes natural, switch to uppercase. This helps “introduce” your other hand to the movements involved in writing. Aim to produce straight lines and clean curves, but don’t worry if you make a lot of mistakes at first. Perform this practice routine for at least 10 minutes a day until you feel comfortable making clean movements. Your hand may strain at the beginning—just take a break and try again later. The tension will eventually go away. Be sure to trace out the alphabet using your non-dominant hand in lowercase, uppercase, and cursive letters (if you know cursive). Giffin advises to “make sure that the paper you’re writing on is secured.” This way, you won’t have to worry about the paper sliding out from under you."

      "title": "Move on to writing letters without tracing and drawing simple shapes.",
      "content": "Move on to writing letters without tracing and drawing simple shapes. Ensure that your paper is secure (taped to the table, for instance) and start drawing butterflies, vases, symmetrical objects, letters, shapes, and whatnot. Although you may think your writing is awful at first, write a couple of lines every day from the start. You can only get better with practice! It may be helpful to buy a handwriting book with exercises you can follow. Using your non-dominant hand to color in a coloring book can also be helpful. As you do this, pay attention to which letters you struggle with the most and spend some extra time practicing them."

      "content": "Practice writing your name and full sentences. Your name is likely the writing movement you’re most familiar with, so it’s a good set of letters to practice on. Try writing out a 3- to 5-sentence paragraph every day to get more comfortable with writing at length with your non-dominant hand. [6] X Research source Don’t keep writing the same paragraph over and over. Write a different one every day so your non-dominant hand doesn’t get used to one paragraph only."

      "content": "Be sure to practice writing every day to improve your skills. Practice these techniques daily for at least a month to build the habit . Soon, you’ll be writing much more comfortably with your non-dominant hand! [7] X Research source Try keeping a daily journal that you write in exclusively with your non-dominant hand."
