      "content": "Scrape off any old caulk from the gap, if necessary. If there’s any old or cracked caulk along the gap, take a utility knife or a putty knife and run the edge along it to scrape it off. Be careful not to strip or chip the paint on the walls. Continue scraping until all of the old caulk is removed.

      "content": "Vacuum any dust and dirt from the inside of the gap. Use the hose extension on a vacuum cleaner and insert the tip into the gap. Vacuum all along the gap to suck up any dust, dirt, debris, and pieces of caulk that may be there. Dirt and other contaminants can affect how well you seal the gap, so work the hose attachment around the area to remove as much as you can. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a vacuum or a hose attachment, use a damp cloth to scrub dirt and debris out of the gap."

      "content": "Scrub the gap with rubbing alcohol to sanitize it. Fill a bowl with rubbing alcohol, dip a clean sponge or cloth into it, and wring out the excess. Scrub the top and bottom of the gap to kill germs, remove any loose debris, dirt, and stains, and sanitize the area so mold doesn’t form when you seal it. [5] X Research source If you don’t have rubbing alcohol or your floor is wood, marble, painted, or granite, mix 1 US gal (3.8 L) water and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) bleach as an alternative cleaning solution. Rubbing alcohol can irritate your eyes and sinuses if you breathe in the fumes directly. Consider wearing a mask and goggles and work in a well-ventilated area."

      "content": "Let the area around the gap dry completely. Run a clean, dry cloth over the area and wait a few hours for it to air dry. To speed up the drying process, aim a blow dryer set on low heat to dry the wall and floor near the gap. Touch the area with your finger to make sure it’s completely dry so moisture doesn’t get trapped in the caulk. [6] X Research source Moisture can cause bacteria and mold to develop in the wall."

      "content": "Use silicone caulk to waterproof kitchens and bathrooms. If you’re fixing a gap between a tile floor and wall, such as in a shower or a bathroom, go with a silicone caulk so you can create an airtight, waterproof seal. Fricke recommends buying “silicone caulk that's 100% silicone, fast cure, [and] water ready in 30 minutes.” [7] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. If the gap is larger than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) , insert a few pieces of wood, a strip of foam insulation , or spray insulation into the gap. [8] X Research source Silicone caulk is generally clear in color. The waterproof seal will help prevent moisture from getting into your walls, which can lead to rot and mold. Fricke says that silicone caulk cures through crystallization as it's exposed to oxygen. [9] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020."

      "content": "Choose latex caulk for gaps in non-humid areas of the house. If you’re fixing a gap between a floor and a painted wall that isn’t exposed to a lot of humidity, such as a bedroom or living room wall, use a latex caulk . Latex dries quickly and expands slightly to fill cracks. Choose a color that closely resembles the paint of your wall so the gap isn’t noticeable. [10] X Research source Latex caulk will create a tight seal but isn’t as waterproof as silicone. Fricke says that latex caulks cure through an evaporation process.

Then, rest the nozzle end into position at the front of the gun. Push the metal rod back into place so it’s pressing against the back of the caulk tube to hold it securely.

      "content": "Cut the caulk tube to make an opening the size of your gap. Insert the sealed nozzle into the gap until it can’t go any further to find the width that the nozzle opening needs to be to fill it. Take a pair of scissors or a utility knife and cut the nozzle at a 45-degree angle where it made contact with both the wall and floor so it’s the size of the gap. [14] X Research source Cutting the nozzle at an angle helps you guide the caulk into the gap as it flows out of the tube."

Keep the nozzle held upright and remove the nail or rod from the nozzle. [15] X Research source You could also use a long pin or piece of wire to penetrate the internal seal. Some caulk guns have a metal rod you can use to pierce the internal seal of the caulk tube."

Stick the tip of the nozzle into the gap so it’s flush and even with it. [16] X Research source Instead of trying to use a caulking tool to make a straight line, Fricke says to outline the gap along with wall with masking tape instead. [17] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. If the gap is larger than 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) , measure the length of your walls and cut baseboards or quarter rounds to size. Nail them over the cracks under each wall. If you’re able to insert the tip of the nozzle more than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) deep, then cut the nozzle again so the opening is wider."

A caulking tool is made of plastic or metal with straight corners and edges used to smooth the caulk to form an even layer. Run a caulking tool (or your finger covered in a damp rag) over the caulk to remove any excess and form the caulk into a smooth and even layer. [20] X Research source A smooth layer of caulk will create a tighter and better seal. You can find caulking tools at home improvement stores, hardware stores, and online."

      "content": "Allow the caulk to dry for 24 hours. Leave the gap undisturbed for a full day so the caulk can dry and set to form a tight seal. If you fix a gap in a bathroom or shower, avoid using the shower for a full day so the moisture won’t damage the caulk. Lightly touch the caulk with your fingers after 24 hours to make sure it’s dry. [21] X Research source According to Fricke, you can speed up the drying process by turning a fan on or using a blow dryer set on low heat. If you use heat, “that's actually going to make it take longer to cure.” [22] X Expert Source Art Fricke Home Renovation & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 August 2020. If the caulk still isn’t dry, wait another 12 hours."

Sloped floors are a sign that the building’s foundation is settling and the structure is uneven. [23] X Research source If your floors are uneven, contact a licensed building inspector to check the foundation and offer potential solutions. Other signs of uneven foundation settling include cracked walls or windows, visible cracks in the foundation, or windows and doors that don’t open or close easily. [24] X Research source Look online for building inspectors in your area. The inspector may tell you that you need to hire a contractor to repair your foundation.

      "content": "Check the floor joists in your crawl space for moisture damage or rot. Locate the building’s crawlspace and look to see if there are wooden floor joists beneath the walls of the structure. If there are, look for cracks, splinters, and signs that the wood is damaged or rotting. [25] X Research source Contact a building inspector to view the joists if you believe that they are damaged. Damaged floor joists can cause the floor to move, which can create a gap between the floor and the wall above it. Look online for a building inspector you can hire to check your floor joists if you find signs of damage."

Termites can eat through the support structures of your home, causing the house to settle and create gaps between the floors and walls. Look for small holes, mud tubes, or rattling or rustling sounds in your walls. [26] X Research source Contact a licensed exterminator as soon as possible to take care of the problem. Other signs of termites include discolored or drooping drywall, peeling paint, buckling floorboards, and crumbling or damaged wood.
