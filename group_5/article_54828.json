[3] X Research source If you use fertilizer, you can get 7 to 8 Green Beans per Bean Starter, depending on the type of fertilizer used: Speed-Gro and Deluxe Speed-Gro will yield 7 beans per starter, and Hyper Speed-Gro will yield 8. If you have the Agriculturist profession and use no fertilizer, each Bean Starter will yield 7 beans each in one season. If you use fertilizer and have the Agriculturist profession, Speed-Gro will still yield 7 beans per starter and Hyper Speed-Gro will still yield 8 beans per starter, but Deluxe Speed-Gro will increase from 7 beans per starter to 8 beans per starter."
