      "content": "Keep the stitch marks covered and clean during the day. Though you may think allowing your stitches to breathe by keeping them uncovered will help to speed up healing, doing this can delay healing by as much as 50 percent. Moisture and wetness can prevent a scab from forming and lead to prolonged healing or an infection. Use a dry, sterile bandage to cover the stitch marks as they heal. [1] X Research source Your doctor may give you an antibiotic ointment or advise you to use an over the counter ointment like Neosporin. This will help to prevent infection and encourage your stitch marks to heal fast. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Use a fresh bandage every time you apply the ointment to the marks. You can switch to plain petroleum jelly after a week of using the ointment to encourage new skin to grow over the stitch marks."

      "content": "Use silicone pads to help the marks heal properly. Apply constant pressure to the stitch marks by using silicone sheet pads, such as Curad Scar Therapy Cosmetic Pads, ReJuveness Pure Silicone Sheets, and Syprex scar sheets. This can help the marks to heal and flatten any scarring.

      "title": "Do not apply vitamin E or hydrogen peroxide to the marks.",
      "content": "Do not apply vitamin E or hydrogen peroxide to the marks. Despite common belief, vitamin E has been shown by studies to prevent wounds from healing, rather than encourage healing. Some people may also develop an allergic reaction to vitamin E. Put medicated ointment or antibiotic cream on the stitch marks instead of vitamin E gel. [4] X Research source Though applying hydrogen peroxide to open cuts or marks can help sanitize the area, hydrogen peroxide has been known to destroy new skin cell growth and slow down your body’s healing process."

      "content": "Protect the stitch marks from the sun by using sunscreen. The sun’s ultraviolet light can have a damaging effect on your stitch marks and slow down the healing process. Lather up your skin, including your stitch marks, with sunscreen every morning before you go outside. [5] X Research source Use a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30."

      "content": "Massage the area once the stitch marks have healed. Massaging your healed stitch marks will help to break down any bands of collagen that have attached to the underlying tissue. [6] X Research source You should gently massage the area with lotion in a circular motion for 15 to 30 seconds several times a day."

      "content": "Get your stitches removed within a week.

If possible, have your doctor remove the external stitches after one week to prevent any permanent scarring."

      "title": "Talk to your doctor about laser treatments.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor about laser treatments. For a more serious professional option, consider using targeted laser treatment to remove the stitch marks or stitch scarring. Using laser treatment on fresh scars, within six to eight weeks of the injury, can lead to a more effective treatment and removal of the scar. There are two types of laser treatments: [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Pulsed dye lasers: This is a non-ablative laser treatment that uses an intense, targeted burst of light. The heat is then absorbed by the blood vessels in your skin and can help to improve the texture and thickness of scars. It can also reduce any redness around the scar. Fractional ablative lasers: This treatment pokes small holes into the scar. This stimulates collagen production and can remodel the scar to appear less noticeable. This type of laser treatment is recommended for shallow scars. Most laser treatments will require multiple treatment sessions and can cost between $300 to $600 per a session."

If you experience any of these symptoms, as well as fever and increased pain around the stitch marks, you should go see your doctor. The stitch marks may be infected or you may have had an allergic reaction to the antibacterial cream. [8] X Research source Your doctor will need to examine and treat the stitch marks to prevent further infection or complications."
