This essentially resizes the picture. Click the \"Fill\" button at right center to make the picture fill the entire area bounded by the cropping handles while retaining the proportion of its height to its width. Areas of the picture that fall outside this area will be cropped. Click the \"Clear Crop\" button at the lower right to cancel the effects of the other 2 buttons. Any cropping you gave the picture with the \"Fill\" button will be removed, and any space around the picture created as a result of using the \"Fit\" button will also be removed.
