      "content": "Overcommitment is when you have too many obligations at once. When you’re overcommitted, you’ve taken on too many tasks—there’s too much on your plate. Because of this, you likely feel overwhelmed, anxious, or worried. Taking on a lot of overlapping commitments and duties can put a lot of pressure on you professionally and emotionally, which can lead to forgetfulness and irritability. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Overcommitment can happen in any field or with any lifestyle. For instance, you might overcommit at work by agreeing to complete multiple projects by the same deadline, or you may overcommit in your personal life by planning to hang out with friends back to back. It can be tricky breaking out of an overcommitment cycle. You made a commitment and want to honor your agreement—we get it! However, being overly committed to multiple projects or people can put you down a slippery slope of disappointment and cost you to lose more than you gain.

      "content": "You ignore your own needs. Overcommitment may cause you to forget to eat, sleep, bathe, and exercise. The basic things in your daily routine suddenly become obsolete. Perhaps you give up 2 hours of sleep to work overtime or skip your usual meal prep because picking up fast food gives you more time to meet your commitments. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "You have no free time. When you’re overcommitted, free time seems like a pipe dream. You don’t have time to relax when you have so many obligations on your plate. Having no time to unwind only adds to stress and could eventually lead to burnout. [5] X Research source"

Your usually punctual personality and work efficiency suffer because of this, causing you to miss deadlines, appointments, or check-ins with friends.

You do the extra work and put in a lot of effort to complete everything on your to-do list, but it still feels like you're swamped by the end of the day. Basically, the harder you push yourself, the worse you feel."

      "content": "The fear of missing out. Everyone gets FOMO (the fear of missing out) every once in a while, but having too much of this fear could lead to overcommitment. For instance, fearing that you’ll miss a career opportunity if you don’t take on another task at work is a toxic thinking pattern. While you may miss out on one thing by doing something else, you gain life experience from everything you do—don’t regret your choices.

      "content": "Underestimating the time needed to complete tasks. Sometimes, it can be difficult to estimate how much time is needed for specific tasks. You may commit to more than one thing because you think it’ll only take a set amount of time, only to find out later that you were wrong. Overestimating your ability to multitask under time constraints can play a big part in overcommitment. [8] X Research source"

Is it something you can accomplish without stretching yourself too thin? [10] X Research source Ask yourself these questions to help decide whether or not a commitment is worth your energy and time: Does it align with my personal or professional goals? Is this genuinely important to me, someone else, or a goal I support? Would agreeing to this cause me stress or worry? Can I still prioritize my wants and needs while making this commitment? Do I have the time to take this on? Would I be happy doing this?"

Don’t hesitate to reach out to your boss, coworker, or loved one if you need an extra hand with a commitment or two. Sometimes, having even the smallest thing taken off your plate can make the biggest difference. [14] X Research source Don’t apologize for asking for help , even if it’s with a close friend or loved one. Instead, be straightforward with something like, “Hey, can you help me clean the house tomorrow? I won’t get home until late and want to make sure the place is in tip-top shape when mom comes.” At work, try reaching out for assistance by saying something like, “Hey Jeremy! I hope you’re doing well. Have you by chance worked on the new spreadsheet?

If a new obligation comes around that's a higher priority than others, do your best to rearrange your schedule to make completing it more manageable. Do your best to balance your time and commitments so you’ll stress less. [17] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source For instance, say you receive an email from your boss asking you to complete an assignment for tomorrow morning's meeting by the end of the day. So, you swap the time to work on a task due at the end of the week with the high-priority task. This way, you can spend time on each with plenty of time to spare. As another example, say you’re a freelancer who creates graphic designs for various companies. Assess your schedule every month to see what your workload looks like. If you have gaps in your schedule, you likely have time to take on a new client or project. If your schedule is swamped, it may be time to hold commissions until your active projects are complete."
