      "content": "Clasped hands is a hand gesture involving someone folding their hands together. This common gesture, also known as “hand clasping,” is often used in prayer or when exuding a specific emotion, such as nervousness or confidence. Think of it as holding hands with yourself. The fingers can be interlaced or not, but one thumb typically folds over the other."

      "title": "If their fingers are interlaced, the person may be anxious.",
      "content": "If their fingers are interlaced, the person may be anxious. Holding hands with someone else is often seen as a soothing and comforting form of physical contact, and holding hands with yourself is no different. If someone is clasping their hands together with their fingers interlaced, it may be because they’re trying to self-soothe. This could be because they’re anxious, nervous, or upset. [1] X Research source Body Language Cues: They’re fidgeting—leg tapping or bouncing. Their hands are likely clenched in their lap or in front of them. Their head may be low or hunched over their hands. Keep in Mind: For many religions, interlacing the fingers while clasping the hands is a sign of prayer and submission to a higher power. Example Situations: You may see someone clasping their hands in this manner in a doctor’s waiting room, during a job interview, or before a stressful situation or conversation."

      "title": "If their fingers aren’t interlaced, the person is likely confident.",
      "content": "If their fingers aren’t interlaced, the person is likely confident. A person clasping their hands with their fingers on either side of their palms (as if mid-clap) typically exudes confidence and pride. This position is usually used when displaying power or leadership. Body Language Cues: They stand tall with their shoulders back. Their arms were likely hanging by their sides before clasping their hands together. Their legs are uncrossed, showing they’re open for conversation or debate. Keep in Mind: Some may clasp their hands this way behind their backs or in front of their chest. The position of the clasp doesn’t change the overall meaning, as the body is still left open and stoic as a sign of openness. [2] X Research source Example Situations: You might see this hand position as someone gives a speech, teaches a class, or relays rules and regulations."

      "title": "If the hands are clasped and wringing together, the person may be distressed.",
      "content": "If the hands are clasped and wringing together, the person may be distressed. Hand wringing is the act of repeatedly twisting or rubbing the hands together, often in a clasped position. This motion is a tell-tale sign of distress, anxiety, or nervousness. Psychologists believe the behavior soothes the individual, helping them organize and process their thoughts and feelings. [3] X Research source Body Language Cues: Their shoulders are slumped, their head hangs low, and their overall posture is slouched or relaxed. Keep in Mind: Hand wringing can also indicate other things. For instance, someone may do this while warming their hands in cold temperatures, which can also be distressing to the mind and body. Hand wringing is also a symptom of Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder, and common in those with autism and OCD. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Example Situations: You may see someone making this hand gesture before a big test, during a job interview, or when watching a horror movie."

      "title": "If the hands are clasped near the face, the person is likely thinking.",
      "content": "If the hands are clasped near the face, the person is likely thinking. Movement around or near the throat hides the throat, and this is typically a sign of distress. Similarly, clasping the hands in front of the face shields the eyes and mouth, signaling the highest level of stress or discomfort. These hand gestures are most commonly used when thinking in or about stressful situations. [5] X Research source Body Language Cues: They’re leaning toward their hands with their brows furrowed and eyes closed. They may rub their fingers over the back of their hands. Keep in Mind: This position can also be an act of prayer, especially if the eyes are closed or the individual is kneeling. Example Situations: Someone may clasp their hands under their chin while thinking to self-soothe. You may also see someone clasping their hands in front of their face during an argument or while crying."

      "title": "If the hands are clasped in front of the groin, the person might be insecure.",
      "content": "If the hands are clasped in front of the groin, the person might be insecure. When someone holds their hands below their belt, it’s likely a sign that they’re feeling socially awkward. The closed-off nature of their body language indicates that they’re protecting themselves from potential judgment. [6] X Research source Body Language Cues: Their arms are straight, they may shift their weight from foot to foot, and they avoid eye contact. Keep in Mind: This position can also give off a sense of innocence or shyness. In other words, someone may clasp their hands in front of their groin because they don’t know what to do with their hands. Example Situations: You may see this hand position at a party or social gathering."

      "title": "If the hands are clasped on a desk, they’re showing dominance.",
      "content": "If the hands are clasped on a desk, they’re showing dominance. More often than not, if someone is seated behind a desk and has their hands clasped on top of it, they’re exuding confidence. This stance is a power position, showing that they’re in charge of a situation. They might be thinking or in conversation. Either way, the individual demands a presence. [7] X Research source Body Language Cues: They’re sitting tall with their shoulders back. Their feet are firmly planted on the ground, and their torso is turned toward who they’re talking to on the other side of the desk. The hands are clasped loosely. Keep in Mind: Someone may clasp their hands on top of a desk to relax as well. Children often do this in classrooms, especially if they’re prone to fidgeting. Example Situations: You might see this version of clasped hands when speaking with a boss, principal, or other high official leader."

      "content": "If the hands are clasped above the head, the person feels victorious. Also known as a self-clasping handshake, this gesture is made by grasping one hand with the other and holding it at or above the head. The self-clasping handshake is a sign of victory, typically done after a momentous occasion or win. [8] X Research source Body Language Cues: They’re smiling and looking overall joyous. Keep in Mind: This is a common gesture in the United States and may have different cultural contexts in other countries. Example Situations: You may see a politician doing a self-clasping handshake after winning an election or a football player making the gesture after scoring a touchdown."

[10] X Research source Spiritually, hand clasping is used in yoga and meditation to connect with the mind, body, and spirit."

      "content": "Hand clasping may originate from the Ancient Sumerians. The exact origin of this hand gesture is unknown; however, historians strongly believe that the Ancient Sumerians helped increase the popularity of hand clasping. Sumerian art displays characters clasping or clenching their hands together with other body language suggesting confidence or fear. [11] X Research source Because of this, it can be inferred that the gesture was common even back in BCE. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "The thumb you place on top when clasping your hands is all hereditary.",
      "content": "The thumb you place on top when clasping your hands is all hereditary. Believe it or not, which thumb feels the most comfortable on top is written in your genetics. After lots of myth-busting, scientists concluded that this preference has a genetic component, but it doesn’t influence a person’s character or personality. [14] X Research source The original myth inferred that hand clasping is controlled by one gene with two alleles (with the left allele being dominant). If you put your right thumb over your left, you have a phenotype R. If you put your left over your right, you’re phenotype L. Want to test it out? Close your eyes, and without thinking, clasp your hands together. Open your eyes and see what your instinct is! Try doing this with friends and swapping which thumb is on top to feel the difference in sensations."

      "content": "Pay attention to facial expressions. People can make subtle, subconscious changes to their facial features if they’re happy, sad, or somewhere in between. In many cases, you can convey what you’re feeling without even saying a word! So, if someone has their hands clasped, keep an eye on their face and notice if they’re smiling, lifting their brows, or frowning. [15] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

[16] X Research source When someone’s scared, they may draw their brows together, lower their eyes, and stretch their lips. When someone’s angry, they may lower their brows, lower their lips, jut out their jaw, and flare their nostrils. When someone’s happy, they may lift the corners of their mouth and squint their eyes. When someone’s sad, they may lower the corners of their mouth, furrow their brows, and pout their lips."

      "content": "Keep an eye on eye contact. Eye contact can play a big part in nonverbal communication and body language. For many, whether or not they look someone in the eye can be telling of their mood. For instance, someone upset or angry might not be able to maintain eye contact for long periods of time, while someone calm and happy can. [17] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Let’s say someone is clasping and wringing their hands. If they also have a hard time looking you in the eye, it may be because they’re upset or nervous.

      "content": "Be aware of context clues. Sometimes, the easiest way to read someone’s body language is to look at their surroundings. What is the person wearing? What are they doing? Where are they? What’s the current situation? By asking yourself these questions, you can gather a better understanding of why they may be in a specific position. [19] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For instance, say you see a friend sitting outside the principal’s office with their hands clasped under their chin. Their knuckles are bruised. They’re rocking back and forth, muttering apologies. In this case, they’re probably nervous as they’ve likely been called to the principal’s office because they’ve gotten into a fight."

      "content": "Look out for inconsistencies. People can fake their body language. There are many sources out there educating people on how to read body language (including this article). Because of this, someone could easily master altering their body language to appear confident or assert dominance. But they won’t be able to keep this up forever. Pay attention to inconsistencies in their stance, movements, and behavior. If someone’s telling the truth, you won’t question why they're acting a certain way.
