    {
      "title": "We all know this is what most guys want to hear.",
      "content": "We all know this is what most guys want to hear. Go ahead and just say it—it’s impossible to over praise him, especially if he’s already in the mood. He’ll feel good when he knows his member is big enough to satisfy you, even if you’re fudging the truth just a little bit. You can also pretend to be taken aback by the size and playfully “wonder” out loud if it will fit. [1] X Research source Also try: “Wow, it’s so big!” “Here comes the giant.” “It feels massive once it’s inside” (for situations where it’s not quite big enough to gush over). “Wow, I don’t know if it will fit…”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Length isn’t everything.",
      "content": "Length isn’t everything. For a lot of people, girth is more satisfying and important than how long it is anyway. Don’t neglect the other dimensions of your guy’s manhood. Let him know how much the thickness impresses you. Give him compliments like: “Wow, it’s so heavy.” “That is dense.” “I love how thick it feels.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let your guy know his shape is great too.",
      "content": "Let your guy know his shape is great too. Whether it’s straight as an arrow or has a pleasant bend, tell him that it feels like it was custom-made to fit inside you. “We fit together” also has a romantic emotional vibe to it, so save this for a sensual moment or for your pillow talk. [2] X Research source Say things like: “It feels like it was made just for me.” “It gets me going in all the right spots.” “No one else’s ever felt this right.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "This is a hot compliment regardless of size or shape.",
      "content": "This is a hot compliment regardless of size or shape. If he’s self-conscious about his size or distracted because he’s wondering what you think, whip this one out to put him at ease. Hearing these words will make him even harder and more eager to please. Other ways to phrase might be: “It feels so warm.” “I love it when you get hard for me.” “It’s hot watching you get hard.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t underestimate the power of just telling him you like it!",
      "content": "Don’t underestimate the power of just telling him you like it! A lot of guys have the perception that women think penises are gross or weird. Reassure him that you actually enjoy it and he’ll feel proud that you like what he’s got down there (and eager to use it). [3] X Research source Some other options: “It’s a work of art!” “That is one magnificent penis.” “Whip it out, I just want to look at it.” You can even give his member a hot nickname. There’s no such thing as taking it too far in this particular arena."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let him know his expertise (and equipment) are appreciated.",
      "content": "Let him know his expertise (and equipment) are appreciated. Even the most self-confident guys want to hear that they showed you a great time. Compliment his performance—it’s implied that his manhood is the captain of the team. [4] X Research source Tell him things like: “I’m gonna be thinking about that for weeks.” “No one’s ever gonna beat that.” “That was 100% what I needed today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Appeal to his competitive side and tell him no man can top him.",
      "content": "Appeal to his competitive side and tell him no man can top him. Again, it’s understood his penis is the star of the show, but you can get more specific here. Try things like “No one else felt that good inside me” or “I’ve never felt that before” to put him (and his appendage) on a pedestal. You can also try: “That’s the most satisfying girth I’ve ever felt.” “No one’s ever given it to me like that.” “Your technique with that thing is unbeatable.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let him know that you need him, and his appendage, immediately.",
      "content": "Let him know that you need him, and his appendage, immediately. This is some great dirty talk and it communicates the lust you feel for him. Tell him you can’t wait for it any longer and he won’t be able to contain himself! Whisper it in his ear for an irresistible touch. Try: “I can’t wait to feel you inside me.” “I knew this would feel great!” “If I can’t feel you right now, I’ll go crazy.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let him know you can’t get enough of it!",
      "content": "Let him know you can’t get enough of it! He’ll be proud that he satisfied you the first time, and your initiation will rev him up because he knows you want more. Try looking at, stroking, or grabbing his privates while you ask to show you’re ready right now. Try “Hard again already?” with a coy smile. This one is a great confidence booster for older men or guys who’ve had performance issues in the past. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell your guy what the thought of his manhood does to you.",
      "content": "Tell your guy what the thought of his manhood does to you. Get detailed—tell him which parts of you are stimulated, what you want him to do with it, and how long you’ve been fantasizing about it. He’ll be so satisfied knowing he’s got something you want. Say things like: “I can’t focus, I’ve been thinking about it all day.” “Just thinking about it makes my whole body tingle.” “My heart beats so fast whenever I see it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull this one out during your pillow talk to make him feel special.",
      "content": "Pull this one out during your pillow talk to make him feel special. It will soothe any insecurity he has about his size or performance and strengthen the bond of trust between you two (and it’s a nice way to stroke his competitive ego). Say things like: “I want yours forever.” “If this is the only one I get for the rest of my life, I’d die happy.” “Yours is the only one I need.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reassure him his member is a turn on by asking this.",
      "content": "Reassure him his member is a turn on by asking this. Lots of people think women don’t enjoy performing oral or that they think it’s a chore. Show him you enjoy it to let him know you’re comfortable with his entire body, especially his manhood. Say things like: “I want you in my mouth.” “I could do this all day.” “I love doing this.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Show him what you think of his manhood with an excited expression.",
      "content": "Show him what you think of his manhood with an excited expression. A sexy smile, a flirty gasp, or gently biting your lip when he pulls it out communicates all he needs to know about how you feel (and is electric for him). This is a good move when you don’t know what to say or if you’re seeing a guy’s penis for the first time."
