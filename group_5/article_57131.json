It's easiest to do this with a sterilized funnel if you're using a test tube or vials. [1] X Research source Keep one empty jar or dish aside for use later in the culturing process."

      "content": "Place the jars or dishes in the bottom of the large stock pot. Make sure it has a lid! This is where having vessels with a flat bottom comes in handy. If you're using tubes with a rounded base, you'll need to rack them to stand them up."

      "content": "Add 2 to 3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) of water to the dish. Or enough so that the water comes halfway up the sides of your culturing vessels. Make sure the water does not get inside the jars. Add the jar lids carefully. Don't put them on, just in -- this will sterilize them. If you put them on, everything may explode."

      "content": "Bring the water in the stock pot to a boil. Keep it on high for 15 minutes to sterilize the culturing vessels. Then remove vessels from the hot water using your kitchen tongs and cool completely. This may take a while, so be patient. [2] X Research source You need to wait for things to cool to at least 40 deg. C before attaching the sterile caps, otherwise the cooling growth-medium will cause the vials to either suck the caps into the vials, or actually implode. Once cool enough, put the caps on the vials firmly. Pros generally cool for 24 hours at a slant. These are often referred to as “slants” by home brewers because many use test tubes and invert them at an angle so the wort-gelatin mixture inside solidifies on a slant. [3] X Research source"

Within a couple of days you will see a cloudy film on the slant surface, and a few days later it will develop into a milky white layer about 1 mm thick. Wipe the outside of the jars and lids with alcohol swabs. As always, everything needs to be completely sterile."
