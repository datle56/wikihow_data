      "content": "Reply with a 😏 of your own if you want to mirror their sass or sexy energy. This will signal to the person you’re talking to that you’re both on the same page. If they’re being a sassy goofball, another 😏 emoji is sort of like saying, “Yeah, that is funny,” or, “I see what you’re doing over there!” If they’re flirting with you, another 😏 is sort of an invitation to keep that romantic energy going.

      "content": "If you like them but don’t want to take this too far, reply with 😉. The smile and a wink emoji is still flirty, but it’s not charged with the same sexual energy that the 😏 emoji contains. If you are interested in them romantically but don’t necessarily want to send the wrong message by suggesting that you’re up for dirty talk, this is the way to go. [2] X Research source This is also a good test for a guy who slid into your DMs and might be trying to hook up without working for it. A well-timed 😉 is a lot like saying, “You might get there if you play your cards right, but not so fast!” You can also use a 😊 or 😇 if you want something even more innocent and non-sexual."

      "title": "Emojis like 😘, ❤️, or 😍 signal romantic interest without too much sexual energy.",
      "content": "Emojis like 😘, ❤️, or 😍 signal romantic interest without too much sexual energy. If there’s a spectrum with love on one end and lust on the other, the 😏 emoji is pretty far on the lust side. If you’re romantically interested in this person but you aren’t ready to move the conversation into this kind of explicitly sexual territory yet, a 😘, ❤️, or 😍 emoji will pull things back a bit. [3] X Research source These emojis are a little sexier and more playful than something like 😉 or 😊, but nowhere near as sexy as the smirk."

      "content": "Lean into the sensual energy with a sexy emoji if you’re ready. The sexy emoji lineup (💋, 🍆, 🍑, 💦, 😈, and 👅) are all valid options if you’re comfortable moving into sexting territory here. You can either send the emojis on their own, or write a little sexy note alongside your emoji. [4] X Research source A little phrase like, “What are you up to? 😈” or, “Right back atcha 💋” can really hit a chord with the guy or girl you’re flirting with! If you don’t know this guy/gal that well, be careful doing this. Some people take a hint way too far, and if you aren’t sure you like them, this is a risky move. If you’re not comfortable going in this direction, that’s totally okay."

      "content": "The 😎 emoji works as a versatile, slick, and cool response. Replying to a smirk with the sunglasses emoji is a lot like someone saying, “You’re cute” and replying with “I know.” It’s not necessarily dismissive, but it is a little coy and braggy. All things considered, this is a playful and fun emoji that conveys a whole lot of confidence. [5] X Research source If they sent something like, “What’s up hot stuff 😏” you might reply with, “Just hanging out 😎” to send some too-cool-for-school energy their way. The sunglasses emoji also works if they’re smirking ironically. If they say, “I’m totally buying a PS5 with my tax refund 😏,” you could reply with “Oh, we’re playing so many games 😎.”"

      "content": "Keep it light and playful with a 😛, 😝, or 😜 and keep chatting. If you don’t really want to lean into the sexy smirk but you also don’t necessarily want to discourage them, throw one of these tongue-out emojis (😛, 😝, or 😜) and keep the original conversation moving. This is a good way to play things if you aren’t sure whether you like them or not. [6] X Research source This is also a good option if they’re using the smirk emoji ironically. The fun tongue-out emojis will all communicate, “That’s funny! You’re such a goofball.”"

      "title": "The 🙃 emoji is a versatile response to the smirk.",
      "content": "The 🙃 emoji is a versatile response to the smirk. Depending on the context, this can mean anything from, “Why are you doing this to me,” to, “Are you joking?” This is also the perfect emoji if they’re trying to be if they’re being sly or mischievous, since it’s kind of the equivalent of going, “Oh, you’re up to something insane, aren’t you?” [7] X Research source The 🙃 emoji is also great if you want to convey irony. If they sent you something sarcastic like, “Guess who got two hours of sleep because they couldn’t stop binge watching Netflix 😏” you might reply, “Sounds like you’re living a healthy lifestyle 🙃.”"

      "content": "If they’re being a goofball, say, “Oh well” with a 🤷 emoji. If you’re unamused with their sassiness or playful flirting, a shrug emoji (🤷, or 💁) is perfect. It conveys a lack of interest in the other person’s antics, which is good if you want them to stop whatever they’re doing or you’re trying to be ten times sassier than they’re being. [8] X Research source This emoji can also mean, “I don’t know what you want from me,” which is good if they’re sending the smirking emoji out of nowhere."

Did they send the smirk emoji as their opening message on Tinder? If so, they’ve earned the 🙄. [9] X Research source You can include a note, too. If they’re trying to flirt in an inappropriate way, or it’s way too early in the convo for a smirk emoji, you might say, “Seriously? 🙄” or, “You’re joking, right? 🙄.”"

If they’re trying to be sly, a lone 😒 is a funny way of going, “You think you’re being clever, huh?” If you’ve got a flirty smirk on your hands, the 😒 signals, “You’re going to do better than that, right?” or, “I’m not one of those guys/girls.” [10] X Research source The interpretation of this emoji is very context dependent, but this can be a good option depending on the nature of your convo."

If you want to pull them down a peg without being aggressive or rude, reply with one of these. If they have any tact at all, they’ll get the message. [11] X Research source The confused emoji (😕) is good if you want to say, “I don’t know what you’re doing, but it isn’t working.” The expressionless emoji with closed eyes (😑) signals, “I’m over it.” The expressionless emoji with eyes open (😐) is a lot like the closed-eye version, except there’s an added hint of, “I don’t know what you want from me.”"
