      "content": "Descale the coffee machine using vinegar and water. Descaling gets rid of mineral buildup inside your machine and keeps it working smoothly. Pour ½ cup of water and ½ cup of white distilled vinegar into the hot water tank. Turn on the machine, then unplug it when half the solution is brewed into the carafe. Allow the solution to soak for 2 hours to eliminate limescale from the interior. 1 cup of water-vinegar solution works best for the 10-cup Speed brewer. If you have a smaller machine, mix ⅓ cup of water with ⅓ cup of vinegar. If you have a 10-cup Platinum Thermal coffee maker, combine 2 cups of vinegar with 2 cups of water. [1] X Research source This method also works when cleaning a commercial VPR Series coffee maker—just make sure you let it cool down before beginning the vinegar cycle. [2] X Research source If you want to descale without using vinegar, combine 1 cup of warm water with ¼ cup of baking soda or ½ cup of water and ½ cup of lemon juice and put it into the hot water tank instead. [3] X Research source You can also put a non-commercial descaler in the water tank of your coffee maker. Pour half of the bottle in and fill the rest of the reservoir with clean water, then brew."

      "content": "Clean the spray head and its fitting. Remove the funnel from inside the coffee maker and carefully unscrew the spray head with your fingertips. Insert a toothpick into each of the holes, dislodging any mineral deposits that might be clogging the head. Use a clean cloth with warm water and a drop of mild unscented dish soap to clean the outside of the spray head and clear leftover mineral deposits. [4] X Research source If your spray head has a fitting on the end that’s hard to get to using a cloth, you can use a straw cleaner to gently scrub the inside. Consult the BUNN coffee maker’s instruction manual before cleaning—there could be specific instructions for your model."

      "content": "Clean the spray tube. Insert your deliming tool or a straw cleaner brush into the spray tube where the spray head was. Brush back and forth while rotating the tool. Clean any bypass fittings or tubes inside the machine by brushing the brush back and forth. Screw the spray head back on and reinsert the brew funnel. [5] X Research source Some coffee makers come with a deliming tool. If you have one, use it instead of a straw cleaner brush. You can also order a replacement by calling customer service at 1-800-352-2866 (USA) or 1-800-263-2256 (Canada)."

      "content": "Flush the cleaning solution out of the hot water tank. Reinsert the brew funnel and plug in the coffee maker. Hit the “On” button and allow it to finish brewing the cleaning solution, then empty out the carafe. Fill your carafe with fresh, cold water and pour it into the tank. Put the carafe back in place, close the lid, and hit the “On” button. After the water is brewed, pour it out and repeat this step 3-4 times, until the vinegar smell is gone. [6] X Research source You can then put fresh water into the tank, turn it on, and after 15 minutes your machine is ready to brew you a new pot of coffee."

      "content": "Clean the outside of the machine with warm water and soap. Turn off and unplug the coffee maker. Soak a soft clean cloth in warm water and mild dish soap. Wipe the machine, gently scrubbing at any stains you see. Use a damp non-soapy cloth to rinse the machine. After that, use a dry soft cloth to absorb the leftover water. [7] X Research source Add a little bit of lemon juice to your damp cloth to help make your machine smell fresh and clean."

      "title": "Soak the coffee pot in warm water with dish soap.",
      "content": "Soak the coffee pot in warm water with dish soap. Coffee pots, known as carafes, can gather brown stains and white powdery deposits over time. Bathe the carafe in a mixture of warm water and a teaspoon of unscented dish soap and let it soak for 2-3 hours. Use a soft cloth to gently wipe out the inside and outside of the carafe, rinse it with clean water, then let it air-dry upside-down on a towel. [8] X Research source If you have a dishwasher, you can run it through a wash with the rest of your dishes. Separate the carafe lid from the carafe and use the top shelf only."

      "content": "Descale your coffee maker every month, and clean the carafe every day. Coffee makers can harbor mold and germs, and mineral deposits over time can slow heating and brewing, which is why it’s recommended to descale and deep-clean your coffee maker once a month. [9] X Research source If you’re wondering if you should descale and deep-clean your BUNN machine, here are some signs that can let you know when it’s time: [10] X Research source Your coffee tastes weak or “off.” You have to wait a longer time than normal for your machine to finish brewing. You notice a chalky material on the inside of your machine. The water is sputtering into the carafe. The coffee maker isn’t producing the usual amount of coffee."

      "content": "Wash and dry your coffee maker after each use to eliminate germs. Throw out the filter and grounds from the brew filter, wash it out with warm water and unscented mild soap, and wipe down any coffee residue with a clean damp cloth. Wipe the water tank dry and keep the lid open while you’re not using the coffee maker. [11] X Research source After each use, hand-wash the carafe, its lid, the brew funnel, and the spray head with warm water, unscented soap, and a soft cloth. Rinse them well, then let them air dry. You can also throw the carafe, its lid, and the brew funnel into the dishwasher for a more thorough cleaning."
