Pros: If you're using Venmo to make purchases and not send money , adding a credit card may be most convenient for you. Credit card companies are required to abide by more guidelines when it comes to online purchases, including those made through Venmo. [2] X Research source Venmo's encryption and multi-level authentication helps secure your credit card information. You will not incur any extra fees when paying authorized merchants directly with your credit card via Venmo. Cons: Venmo charges a 3% fee if you use your credit card to send money to other people, and your credit card issuer may also charge an extra cash advance fee as well. [3] X Research source You also cannot move funds from your Venmo account to your credit card; you can only move your Venmo balance to an eligible debit card or bank account . If you need to update your card's expiration date, you must delete the credit card from your account and re-add it, as there's no way to update otherwise."
