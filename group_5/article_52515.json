This is a touch panel that allows anyone entering the room to control the fan and its lights. It receives commands from the hub to be a smart device in a smart home.

You can turn it on with a smart phone from the first floor to avoid walking to the second floor. Some smart whole house fan wall switches allow you to use a voice command device, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to control the fan. For this, you must use a smart bridge.

Some smart WiFi plugs are designed to be linked to a device called a \"smart bridge\" to form a network of fans. See Part 2, \"Creating a Network of Smart Fans\". If you have a \"smart home\", fans with smart plugs can be linked to its hub to become smart devices, controlled as are the other smart devices. Temperature and humidity sensors used in your smart home can trigger your fans to turn on when the temperature or humidity is high. A motion sensor can trigger them to turn on when you enter a room."
