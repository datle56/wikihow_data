[3] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 18 February 2021 Some reasons why you might not be the right person to comfort her would be: If you are affected by the same situation that is upsetting her. If you are shaken up, disturbed, or hurt by the situation that made her cry, you might not be in a good position to help her. If this is the case, you might want to seek out a support network who can help both you and her cope with whatever is going on. If she is crying from joy.

In order to be the best listener you can be, allow her to feel whatever she is feeling; just be there for her. [7] X Expert Source Connell Barrett Dating Coach Expert Interview. 18 February 2021 Keep in mind that comforting is not about changing the other person's feelings. Be especially careful not to turn the conversation back to yourself: this is about her. Don’t make it about you. Even if she’s not behaving in the way you would, that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t deserve comfort, or that she deserves to be sad. [8] X Research source Avoid phrases such as, \"If I were in your shoes,\" \"Have you tried . . .,\" or \"When that happened to me, I didn't make such a big deal out of it.\""

      "content": "Don't minimize her pain or tell her not to cry. Tears can often be a good or positive action, even if they were caused by something painful. Crying can bring physical as well as emotional relief to someone who is sad or stressed. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bottling up emotions can prevent the healing from taking place. Even if it makes you uncomfortable, let her cry as much as she needs to. She will likely feel better for doing so. In general, avoid any commands, negative language, or imperatives. Stay away from phrases such as, \"Don't cry,\" \"You shouldn't be sad,\" or \"That doesn't sound too bad.\" It won’t help her to claim to know all of the answers. Resist rushing right into what you think she should or shouldn't do to resolve her problems. Don’t claim claim to know everything she is going through and how to fix it. This may just make her feel invalidated. People who are crying because of a mental illness such as severe anxiety or depression might actually feel worse, not better, after crying. [10] X Research source If you think she might be crying because of a mental illness, you should still offer comfort and support, but you should also suggest that she see a doctor so that she can get the necessary treatment."

      "content": "Use nonverbal comforting techniques. A crying person might recognize comfort more readily from nonverbal comforting cues than from verbal communication. Nodding, using appropriate facial expressions, making eye contact, and leaning forward can help her know that you are concerned and that you care. [11] X Research source While offering a tissue can sometimes be interpreted as a caring gesture, it might also send the signal that you want the crying to stop. Only provide a tissue if the crying person asks for one or seems to be looking around for one."

      "content": "Assess whether physical contact is appropriate. Some people are comforted by touch, and others are made more anxious by it. You can offer a hug if you know that she responds well to hugging. Hugs can even help relieve stress over time. [12] X Research source Other kinds of appropriate touch might be holding her hand, touching her shoulder, stroking her hair, or kissing her forehead. Use your best judgment based on what you know about her preferences and the boundaries of your relationship, and always follow her lead. Be sure to back off if she asks you to. You can also observe her body language to determine whether she might be open to comforting touch. Defensive body language such as clenched fists, crossed arms and legs, or avoiding eye contact might mean that she would rather you backed off a little bit. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Resist the urge to avoid the situation. Many are uncomfortable with being around someone who is crying. If this is you, you might rush into saying something you think will help while not knowing what to say. Or, you might find a way to escape the situation. This will only make matters worse for her. If you don’t know what to do, try saying something like, “I’m sorry you’re upset. Is there anything I can do for you to make it better?” This will at least show her you care, which may be comforting for her."

However, she may not want help or may need something other than what you think she needs. The last thing you want to do is to make a situation worse. Resist the urge to problem-solve something when what you should be doing is helping her process her pain and grief. [14] X Research source Let her know that you’re here to help her, but don’t force it. Her idea of help may be simply having someone to talk to. Often listening is the best way to help comfort someone. Ask open-ended questions about whether you can help her out. For example, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" or \"I'd really like to help--can you think of anything that might make your situation better?\" might be good ways to start a conversation about how you can lend a hand. Sometimes someone who is upset is too overwhelmed to suggest ways for you to help her. If this is the case, try providing a list of a few specific things you might be able to do to comfort her. For example, you might ask if she might like to go out for ice cream, or if she would like for you to stop by later with a movie you could watch together. See if she responds positively to any of those comforting suggestions. [15] X Research source"

If it is possible for you to remove her troubles--and if she seems to want you to--then you can offer to step in in some way. For example, if she is crying because she is stressed out from work, you might offer to do some extra chores around the house to give her more time to focus on her job.

If you see no way that you are able to help her fix the problem, then apologize and tell her that you cannot help her fix the problem. If you know anyone whom you think can help her fix the problem, recommend that she talk to them and enlist their help."
