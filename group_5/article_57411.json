      "content": "Draw a circle on your paper. You’ll use this to form the rocket’s nose cone. A streamlined and pointy nose cone will really increase your paper rocket's aerodynamics. Place your plastic cup on a clean area of the paper, bottom side down. Trace around the bottom to make a perfect circle. Make a small dot in the center of the circle. Draw a small triangle with the tip ending at the circle. It should look like a slice of pie that is about 1/8th the size of the circle. [1] X Research source"

Fold down the right and left flaps to form a cone. It will look kind of like a teepee or a party hat. Hold it on the top and bottom with two hands and twirl it around in your finger to turn it into a pointy cone. Use tape to seal the cone. One piece should be enough to hold the seams in place and keep your cone tight, like a dunce cap or ice cream cone."

      "content": "Attach your cone to the body. Now that you have both the rocket body and nose cone, it’s time to put them together. [3] X Research source Put the cone on one of the rocket ends and tape them together. It’s okay if the cone is a little bigger than the body, just make sure you mold it tightly around the cylinder and tightly seal it with tape. You can test the seal by blowing into the open end of the cylinder. If some air leaks out, use more tape to seal it up."

Start at the left side of your paper and make a dot at the 5-inch mark. Next, measure 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the top of the paper and make a mark there. [4] X Research source Draw lines to connect these points and form a square in the top left corner. [5] X Research source"

[7] X Research source Place the corner of your square at the tip of the pencil with the rest of the paper pointing towards the eraser. Wrap the paper tightly around the pencil. You want to make this as tightly wrapped as possible. Keep rolling until you use all the paper to make a small, tight cylinder around the pencil. [8] X Research source Carefully wiggle the pencil out of the cylinder while holding the paper so that it stays rolled. Gently use the thumb and forefinger of your other hand to push down on the top and bottom of the cylinder to make sure it’s even. Tape around the seams in three different places (top, middle, bottom) to make sure the cylinder stays rolled. Now you’ve got a body for your rocket!"

The diagonal part of the triangle (also called the hypotenuse) should look like a fin extending from the body of your rocket."
