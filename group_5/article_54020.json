      "content": "Level up your Chansey while her friendship level is 160+ (Gen VIII and newer) or 220+ (Gen II to VII). After you’ve spent some time bonding with your Chansey (e.g., giving her a Soothe Bell, letting her stay in your active party, etc.), let her level up in battle, or level her up manually with the help of a Rare Candy. At that point, Chansey will evolve into Blissey (the last form of Chansey’s evolutionary line). [1] X Research source Chansey evolves the same way in all Pokémon titles, including recent games like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet . Fun fact: From Gen II to VII, Chansey needed to have a 220 friendship level to evolve into Blissey. In Gen VIII and newer games, this was lowered to 160. You can see if your Chansey is above this threshold by speaking to the friendship rater NPC in your game. [2] X Research source"
