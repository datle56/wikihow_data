      "content": "20% drop rate from beating The Factory Raid in the Second Sea. Raids in The Factory happen once every hour and 30 minutes since the last one. Each time the Raid is defeated successfully, players who did at least 10% of the damage to the Factory Core have a 20% chance of getting the Acidum Rifle. Since the drop rate isn't the best, be prepared to do this Raid a few times to get the drop. Different messages appear on everyone's screen in the server to alert them to the Raid: \"We are breaching the factory in 30 seconds\" means the Raid will start in 30 seconds. \"ALERT: THE FACTORY HAS BEEN BREACHED. POISON CONTROL ACTIVATING IN 5 MINUTES\" means the Raid has started, and players have 5 minutes to destroy the Factory Core. \"ALERT: FACTORY POISON CONTROL ACTIVATED. ALL STAFF RETURN TO WORK IMMEDIATELY.\" means the Factory Core wasn't destroyed within 5 minutes of the Raid starting, and that all remaining players should evacuate the area. Poison will flood the area and kill any remaining players. \"101 FACTorY MALfffffUNCtion. END.\" means the Factory Core was defeated! Upgrade your gun by talking to the Blacksmith in the Second Sea and trading 8 Vampire Fangs and 10 Leather."

      "title": "Pros:",
      "content": "Pros: This gun is good to use for these reasons: It has high damage. Breaks Instinct and the ticking damage from the acid prevents Instinct from charging up again. Moves work well at range and in the air. Great for grinding. M1 has high damage, no knockback, and a decent cooldown rate. Acidic smoke (X) stuns enemies so you can kite stronger enemies."
