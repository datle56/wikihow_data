      "title": "Translate your military title into its equivalent in the civilian world.",
      "content": "Translate your military title into its equivalent in the civilian world. Consider how your military title can be applied to a civilian role, such as “manager,” “team lead,” or “supervisor.” This will make it easier to find jobs you might be qualified for and to ensure you have the skills for specific jobs. [1] X Research source For example, you may translate a military role like “Commander” into a civilian role like “Director” or “Senior Manager.” Or you may be qualified for a civilian role like “Personnel Manager” if you were a “First Sergeant” in the military."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid military jargon, acronyms, and codes.",
      "content": "Avoid military jargon, acronyms, and codes. Remember that your employer will likely not know any military terminology or language. Translate your military ranking, duties, accomplishments, and history into language that a civilian can understand. Think about how you would describe your experience to someone who has never been in the military. Use an online tool that helps you rephrase military terms into civilian terms like: https://www.onetonline.org/crosswalk/MOC/ . Rephrase your military experience and show it to someone who is not in the military to see if they understand it."

    {
      "title": "Focus on military experience that shows you are a leader and a go-getter.",
      "content": "Focus on military experience that shows you are a leader and a go-getter. Most employers want candidates that can take initiative and be a self-starter. Make sure you include experience on your resume that highlights any leadership positions you had in the military. Show employers that you have the confidence and abilities to be assertive and lead others, when needed. [2] X Research source For example, you may have held a leadership position like the leader of a small group or of a unit within a larger team. Or you may have had a higher ranking in the military that meant you delegated tasks or jobs to others."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use military experience that highlights your accomplishments.",
      "content": "Use military experience that highlights your accomplishments. Let employers know that you were considered a valuable member of the military by including any decorations, acknowledgements, or awards you received. You should also note any major achievements you received during your service. For example, you may include any military medals or awards you received. Or you may note that you were “honorably discharged” to note this achievement."

      "title": "Read over the job description for keywords.",
      "content": "Read over the job description for keywords. [3] X Expert Source Katrina Georgiou Career Coach Expert Interview. 25 June 2020. Review the qualifications and skills required for the positions you are considering. Focus on any keywords in the job posting that you feel relate to your experience in the military. For example, if you notice a skill like “multi-tasker” is listed in the job description, choose roles in your time in the military that show you can multi-task."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a section called “Military Experience.\"",
      "content": "Create a section called “Military Experience.\" Your military experience should be listed in its own section on your resume. Under the main section title, you can organize your experience into sub sections or sub lists. This will make your military experience easier for employers to read and understand. If you do not have any other work experience for your resume, you can list your military experience first in a section called “Relevant Experience\" or \"Work Experience\" so it is the primary focus of the resume."

    {
      "title": "Organize your experience under specific skills for a focused structure.",
      "content": "Organize your experience under specific skills for a focused structure. Pick skills that will show employers you are a good fit for the position. List your experience under the applicable skills for the job. Use the skills listed in the job description as a guide so the employer gets a sense that you are well-rounded and well-qualified for the job. For example, you may group your experience under a subsection called “Leadership Skills” and include any experience that demonstrates your leadership. Or you may use a subsection called “Teaching and Training” and then include any relevant experience in this section."

    {
      "title": "List your experience under each position or role for a broad structure.",
      "content": "List your experience under each position or role for a broad structure. Another option is to include each role or position and describe them in civilian terms. Start with the most recent role or position and use a job title that will be easy for an employer to understand. Then, include 1-3 bullet points or short sentences that describe the role in detail. For example, you may use a job title like, “Information and Media Section Leader” or “Squad Director.” You can then explain each job, with a focus on language that is easy to follow."

      "title": "Discuss the character attributes and skills you gained from your experience.",
      "content": "Discuss the character attributes and skills you gained from your experience. Focus on the character-building skills you learned while in the military, as they can applied to a wide range of positions. Try to describe the skills you used in each position so your employer understands the value of your experience. For example, you may note attributes like “good time management,” “conflict-resolution,” and “the ability to stay organized under pressure.” Or you may discuss skills like “teaching and training young people,” “analyzing complex situations,” or “communicating with my colleagues.”"

    {
      "title": "Use data and numbers to add detail.",
      "content": "Use data and numbers to add detail. Give employers a better sense of the scale of your military experience by noting data like the number of employees you managed or worked with as well as the type and amount of supplies or equipment you worked with. You can also discuss how much the equipment was worth to add more detail. For example, you may note, “Trained and supervised an 8 person team,” “Arranged the transport of Air Force equipment worth millions of dollars,” or “Organized a 10 person team to setup and tear-down 2 Emergency rooms in a high stress environment.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include relevant dates for your experience.",
      "content": "Include relevant dates for your experience. Make sure you note the duration of your time in each role or position. Place the dates for each role, from year to year, next to the job title. This will tell employers how long you held each position. Usually employers like to see that you’ve held a position for at least 6 months-1 year. If you’ve held a position for several consecutive years, this usually tells employers you are a dedicated and reliable employee."

    {
      "title": "List honors and achievements in a separate section entitled “Honors.”",
      "content": "List honors and achievements in a separate section entitled “Honors.” If you have any specific honors or awards you earned while in the military, place them in a section separate from your relevant experience. This will make your resume feel less cluttered. List any honors, achievements, or awards by title. You can also include the date by year that you received the award. For example, you may write under the Honors heading, “Good Conduct Medal (2009)” or “Achievement Medal (2012).”"

If you learned how to use radio frequencies, coding, or other technical skills, note this as well. This will let employers know you have these skills in the event it is needed for a position or job. For example, you may write under the Skills and Training heading, “Proficient in Microsoft Word and Excel” or “Trained in computer programming software.”"

      "title": "Stay away from details about active combat or deployments.",
      "content": "Stay away from details about active combat or deployments. You do not need to provide graphic details about your experiences in active combat or while deployed, as this can end up cluttering your resume. Only provide details that you think employers will find relevant to the position you are applying for. Stay away from details that may feel unrelated to the position. For example, you may list operations or missions you worked on in your resume if you feel it illustrates important skills like leadership or conflict-resolution. However, you do not need to provide more than 1-2 key details about the operation or mission on your resume."
