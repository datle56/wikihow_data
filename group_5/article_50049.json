Choose the first 3 Man randomly or take turns rolling a die until someone gets a 3. [1] X Research source Give the 3 Man a special hat, piece of jewelry, or another noticeable piece of clothing to signify their role even more."

Check the roll to see if there are any special rules tied to the result. If the roll doesn’t have a rule tied to it, then the dice go to the next player to the left. [2] X Research source 3 on any die or sum of 3: The 3 Man takes a drink. If the 3 Man rolls any 3 or a sum of 3, they don’t have to drink and may choose someone else to be the new 3 Man. Sum of 7: The person to the right of the roller drinks. Sum of 9: The person across from the roller drinks. Sum of 10: Everybody drinks (also known as a “social”) Sum of 11: The person to the left of the roller drinks. Doubles: Give both dice to 1 player, or split them between 2 players. Whoever has the dice rolls them. The roller has to sip the number of times showing on their dice. If the result is another set of doubles, the original roller drinks instead."

Otherwise, keep playing as long as you’re having a good time. If you notice someone has been the 3 Man for a long time, try switching the role after they’ve had to drink a total of 9 times so they don’t have too much alcohol."

Set easier rules for common rolls like 6 or 7, but add harsher penalties for tough rolls like 2 or 12. Some fun custom rules you can try out include: Finish your drink whenever you roll a 2. Take a sip and then take another turn if you roll a 6. Nominate a different player to drink if you roll an even number. Take turns saying sentences with rhyming last words when you roll a 9. Whoever misses a rhyme drinks. Take turns naming items in a specific category when you roll a 10. Anyone who can't think of something or names an incorrect object has to drink."
