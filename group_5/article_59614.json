      "content": "“Safe travels” is an expression wishing someone good fortune on a trip. “Safe travels” conveys the hope that someone will have a safe, smooth journey and enjoy their travels without running into any difficulties. It also expresses the hope they’ll get back home safe and sound. It’s a common platitude used to show someone you care about them and wish them the best in their travels. [1] X Research source “Safe travels” is a truncated way of saying, “I wish you safe travels” (or a similar phrase). It doesn't depend on a specific type of travel (airplane, car, train, and so on), just the length of the trip. Though its exact roots are unclear, “safe travels” also has a historical context since travel used to come with many more risks. Although travel has become significantly safer over the years, the practice of wishing someone well on their journey has remained—which is why “safe travels” is such a popular saying!"

      "content": "Both are grammatically correct, but “Safe travels” is more common. You can use either version of the phrase when in doubt, but they convey slightly different messages. “Travels” implies an extended journey, likely with multiple stages or destinations all in the same trip. “Safe travel,” on the other hand, encompasses any and all travel someone might undertake on their trip. [2] X Research source “Safe travels” uses the countable form of the noun, while “safe travel” uses its uncountable form. “Safe travels” is much more popular and the version you’re more likely to hear. “Safe travel,” while correct, is rarely used. Instead of “safe travel,” you may hear an alternate phrase like “travel safe.”"

      "content": "Wish someone “safe travels” before a longer trip or vacation. For example, you might say “safe travels” to someone getting ready for an international trip, a cross-country drive, or a multi-city tour. If a person is likely to go through multiple legs of their journey, or they’re going on a trip that isn’t routine, “safe travels” is an easy way to wish them well for the entire adventure. [3] X Research source On the other hand, “safe travels” isn’t usually used for short, routine trips. For example, you wouldn’t say “safe travels” to someone commuting to work or running a few errands. Phrases like “drive safely” or “have a good ride” work better for those situations."

Some phrases mean basically the same thing as “safe travels,” while others have slightly different implications—or may work better depending on the situation.

      "content": "Ensure your hotel room is as safe as possible. A good hotel room should have a lock and deadbolt. Keep your door locked and deadbolted while you’re inside, and keep your windows shut. When you leave your room, try hanging a “Do not disturb” sign on your door and keep the blinds on your windows closed to make it look like someone is still inside. [7] X Research source You could invest in a portable door stopper —a tool that slips under the door to prevent it from being opened. If a friend or loved one is going to be traveling, you could also recommend they get one (to ensure “safe travels.”)"

Scan any documents you might need before a trip; save copies on your computer or a similar device and print a few hard copies out, too. [8] X Research source It may also be a good idea to give a friend or family member a copy of your documents, too. That way, they can send the copies to you (or a local embassy) if anything happens."

For example, figure out what to do if your passport or wallet goes missing or a few different ways to get to the airport or your hotel.
