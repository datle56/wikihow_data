      "title": "Use a light touch.",
      "content": "Use a light touch. When you are doing lymphatic massage, you want to make sure that you don’t press too hard. The lymphatic vessels are located right under the skin, so if you press too hard, you are going to go deeper than the vessels. Press down enough so that your fingers are not sliding over your skin, but make sure that you can’t feel anything beneath the skin. [1] X Research source You may feel like this is too light, especially if you are used to deeper tissue massages."

[3] X Research source Make sure to take your fingers off the skin after each stretch. If you move your fingers back and forth, you are just moving the lymph and not helping to drain it."
