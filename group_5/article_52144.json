If your can doesn’t have a long nozzle, you won’t be able to be as precise, but you can still use it to clean the computer with extra caution. Always wear a dust mask and work in a ventilated area when you are using pressurized air to blow out dust. Don't blow dust back into your case. Make sure you're aiming the canister of air away/at an angle from the inside of your computer case."

You can also tilt the bottle slightly down with the microfiber cloth underneath to pour 3 or 4 drops onto the cloth. Wear an anti-static wristband. Any time you're working with delicate electronics, you want to prevent static shock. You can get an anti-static wristband almost anywhere, like Walmart or Amazon, and it will help prevent you from generating static shocks to your computer's components, which can damage it.
