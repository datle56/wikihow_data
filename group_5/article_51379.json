If your temperature isn’t in Celcius already, convert it with the formula C = 5 9 ∗ ( F − 32 ) {\\displaystyle C={\\frac {5}{9}}*(F-32)} , where ( C ) {\\displaystyle (C)} = Celsius temperature and ( F ) {\\displaystyle (F)} = Fahrenheit temperature. [2] X Research source You can find the dew-point by checking the weather page of your local newspaper or a website that publishes weather information for your local area, such as weather.gov. [3] X Research source For example, if the temperature is 100°F, you would first subtract 32 from 100, which gives you 68. Then, you would multiply 68 by 5/9, which gives a temperature of 37.778°C. You can also use online temperature converters to simplify this step."

They are typically around 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and 6 inches (15 cm) long and have a hole through the top of the plastic backing and a bulb at the bottom of the tube. The thermometers should also be mercury-free. You should be able to find plastic student thermometers at most office supply stores and some major retailers."

As you swing the thermometers, water evaporates from the wet cloth you attached to your wet-bulb thermometer. This evaporation cools the bulb and lowers the temperature recorded on the wet-bulb thermometer. [12] X Research source The amount of water that will evaporate from your psychrometer depends on how much water the atmosphere around it can hold. In a very humid environment, there’s not as much space for the water to evaporate into , so your cloth will be wetter at the end of the experiment. More evaporation happens when the air is dry because dry air has a higher capacity than moist air to absorb additional moisture. Wear safety glasses during this step."
