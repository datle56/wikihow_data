      "content": "Check the unit’s Grade and Power values. Every card, known as a unit, has a number in the top left corner called the Grade, and the number in the bottom left called Power, and in some units, the number in the left center called Shield. Grades range from 0-5, with grade 0 being the weakest. Grades determine which cards you can play during your turn, Power determines how well a unit does during an attack, and Shield determines how well the unit does when guarding(Refer to Part 5 Step 1 for more). [1] X Research source Stronger cards usually have a higher Power and Grade than weaker cards, but they cannot be played until later in the game. Balance the unit grades in your deck so you have 17 Grade 0 and about 15 Grade 1, 10 Grade 2, and 8 Grade 3 units(And for Original series, up to 16 G units). Note that a deck must have exactly 50 cards(Excluding the deck in the G zone), 16 of which must be Trigger Units(Refer to Part 1 Step 6 for more)."

Each skill can only be activated at specific times during the game. There are 4 different skills that a unit may have. [2] X Research source The boost skill has an arrow pointing up and means the unit can be used to boost the power of another unit that’s attacking. This is an optional skill during your Battle Phase. The intercept skill resembling a checkmark and allows the unit in play to guard an incoming attack. This is an optional skill, and is only usable during your opponent's Battle Phase. The twin drive and triple drive skills resembling interweaving arrows means you perform that many drive checks during a battle(Refer to Part 4 Step 2 for more). This is a compulsory skill."

These abilities can help your units gain power or allow you to perform special actions during the game, but you don’t have to use the ability if you don’t want to. Follow the text on the card carefully to activate the ability. [3] X Research source Many abilities only affect certain zones on the playmat and require a cost, such as discarding cards from the top of your deck or from your hand, or sending units to the drop zone. Abilities labeled ACT can be activated during your Main Phase for any number of times – as long as you pay the cost each time. Abilities labeled AUTO triggers automatically once the conditions listed on the card are met. For units with a CONT ability, the ability is active as long as the card stays in play. Some CONT abilities require certain conditions to activate."

Such units with a yellow strip on the bottom of the card are called trigger units, and they can affect the outcome of a battle. The symbol in the top right corner of trigger units shows the effect that happens when they are revealed. Each trigger lets you choose 1 unit to gain 5000 power(In the original series) or 10,000 power(In the V and Overdress series), and one of 6 different effects that can happen after(Certain series may not have certain triggers). [5] X Research source Critical triggers allow you to choose a card and increase the damage it deals by 1. Draw triggers(引) lets you draw 1 card from your deck and add it to your hand. Stand triggers(醒) lets you stand a rear-guard, but it cannot perform drive checks for the rest of the turn. Front triggers(前) give all units in the front row on your side of your field an additional 10,000 power. Heal triggers(治) allows you to remove 1 damage from your damage zone if you have more or equal damage cards than your opponent. Up to four Heal triggers can be placed in a deck. Over triggers(超) remove themselves from the game and apply several effects when revealed for checks. When revealed as a damage check, you draw one card and choose one unit to gain 100 million Power. If revealed during your drive check, perform the above and activate it's additional effect. Only one Over trigger can be placed in a deck."

[7] X Research source The drop zone on the bottom right side of the playmat is where your cards are placed when they’ve been defeated/retired in battle or discarded for certain effects. The damage zone is where you’ll stack your damage cards when your vanguard is attacked and receives damage. The top left of the playmat is the G zone, where you can keep up to 16 G units(Formerly 8), stronger units that you can access later in the game. Units in the G zone are separate from the units in your deck. Place any G units there face down at the start of the game. The trigger zone is directly above your deck and is used during drive checks.

To guard, play the card horizontally on the Guardian Circle and add the shield value to the power of the unit that’s being attacked. You may guard with any number of units, but the shield will last until the end of that battle. After that, any unit you played for guarding will be sent to the Drop Zone.
