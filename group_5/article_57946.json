      "content": "Drink more water. [1] X Expert Source Sari Eitches, MBE, MD Sleep Specialist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. A classic fix-me-up for most ailments, drinking water regularly throughout your day will have you feeling peppy in no time. Oftentimes those feelings of fatigue and lethargy are due to nothing more than basic dehydration. Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning to start up your metabolism, and continue drinking several glasses throughout the day."

      "title": "Eat breakfast.",
      "content": "Eat breakfast. Rolling groggily out of bed in the morning after hitting snooze for the fifth time means you’ll probably be on your way to starting your day with a meager breakfast, if any. Doing so will keep your metabolism in sloth-mode, making you slow to start most anything throughout the day. Force yourself to get up a bit earlier if necessary, and take the time to eat a complete breakfast. The nutrients will energize you throughout the day, making sacrificing your snooze button worth it."

      "title": "Eat frequently.",
      "content": "Eat frequently. Similar to suffering from a bout of dehydration, exhaustion may be your body telling you that it’s hungry and needs energy in the form of food. [2] X Expert Source Sari Eitches, MBE, MD Sleep Specialist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Rather than complying with the socially dictated three large meals a day, try to eat 5-7 smaller meals throughout the day. This will keep your blood sugar levels from plummeting, and provide your body with more vitamins and nutrients that it needs to stay focused."

      "content": "Exercise more often. Getting on your feet and moving around can seem even more difficult when mid-afternoon drowsiness has a solid hold on you, but adding physical activity to your routine will limit your exhaustion. [3] X Expert Source Sari Eitches, MBE, MD Sleep Specialist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Work out for at least ten minutes a day, even if all you do is take a brisk walk outdoors.

      "title": "Get some sun.",
      "content": "Get some sun. There’s a reason you’re more sluggish in the winter; exposure to sunlight increases your vitamin D levels, which give you a boost of energy. If you’re lucky enough to have good weather, head outside for a brief reprieve from your lethargic work indoors. Kill two birds with one stone, and do your exercising outdoors as well!"

      "title": "Adjust your caffeine intake.",
      "content": "Adjust your caffeine intake. You get hit with a wave of sleepiness, and your first instinct is to reach for yet another cup of coffee. But wait! Turns out, drinking more than 2-3 cups of coffee a day doesn't increase your energy any more, and doing so after 12 or 1 in the afternoon will worsen your night of sleep later in the day. Therefore, limit your caffeine intake to three cups or less a day, so that you get the boost of energy without the nasty jittery side effects. Try to do so before lunchtime, and you’ll be thanking yourself the next day as well."

So last night you went to a great concert, staying up till the wee hours in the morning, and then you slept in till noon. Then you had to head to bed early later the following night in preparation for a 7 am meeting for work. With such a fluctuating sleep schedule, it’s no wonder you’re tired!

      "content": "Try a breathing exercise. Our breathing patterns are altered by our emotional and mental state, even when we aren't aware of it. If you’re stressed and tired, it is likely you are taking “chest” breaths that don’t supply enough oxygen to the brain. Try breathing in slowly, imagining that you’re filling your stomach with air like a balloon, and then breathing out slowly. Doing this for a minute or longer will help wake up your brain and de-fog your thoughts."

Rather than imposing fatigue on yourself by staying in a location that is much too comfortable, move to a place you are less likely to fall asleep in. Working in a coffee shop or at a hard desk will make it much more difficult to want to sleep than piles of cozy blankets and pillows will."
