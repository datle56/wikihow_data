      "content": "Start thinking about drainage issues at this point. If water tends to collect in the yard in spots, you may want to elevate the walk in those areas, so don’t dig as deeply there. Long, flat areas should have one side of the sidewalk lower so water can drain off the side. In most cases, make the top of the finished walk even with the (freshly cut) top of the grass for easy mowing and a neat, clean appearance. The bottom of the trench will be about 6 inch (15 cm) below grade to allow for 4 in. of gravel below the 4-in. thick slab of concrete. [3] X Research source"

Screw the forms to the inside of the stakes with a couple of 1-1/4 inch (2.5 cm - 3.5 cm) drywall screws. Bend the forms to make smooth curves, anchoring them with more stakes every 3 ft. Keep the tops of the forms about 1 inch (2.5cm) above the cut grass height for easy mowing and a nice appearance."

      "content": "Space and level in the opposite form sides using a homemade gauge board—just a 1x4 that’s a few inches longer than the width of the sidewalk. Screw short blocks onto the bottom spaced the same width as the sidewalk. Use this gauge board to position the forms and stakes to keep a consistent width the entire length of the sidewalk. Rest a 4-ft. (1.22 meters) level on top of the gauge board to keep forms level from side to side. For better drainage in long, level areas, drop this side about 1 in."

      "content": "For a long-lasting sidewalk, plan on a base of gravel under 4 inch of concrete. [5] X Research source If you live in a frost-free climate with a natural sand base with good drainage, you can pour right on top of the sand. But other soil types will expand and contract with weather conditions and can crack overlying concrete. Gravel protects concrete from these shifting conditions. Spread gravel 4 in. deep between the forms. Pack dirt against the outside and gravel against the inside of forms to add support when pouring and to achieve smooth curves. It’s not necessary to compact the gravel."

Park a helper on the end of the reinforcing mesh for ballast and unroll the mesh, holding it down with your feet. Cut it to length with a pair of bolt cutters. Flip the mesh over and pull one end toward the other to back-bend it slightly to eliminate the natural curl. Cut the edges of the mesh at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) back from the forms. Overlap mesh layers at least 6 inch (15 cm) and tie them together."
