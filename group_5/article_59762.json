      "title": "Search by username, subreddit, and more to find the Reddit you're looking for.",
      "content": "Search by username, subreddit, and more to find the Reddit you're looking for. Go to PullPush's site and enter your search parameters. For example, if you don't remember the username, enter the subreddit instead and any other search terms you remember. Click Search to get a list of anything that is close to your search."

      "content": "See deleted comments on posts. While other sites let you see posts, you can see deleted comments on Reddit posts this way. Go to https://www.resavr.com/ , enter the post title or username that you want to look for into the search bar in the top right corner (don't forget to press Enter/Return !), then click a search result to see more about it."

      "title": "See deleted posts using a bookmark tool.",
      "content": "See deleted posts using a bookmark tool. Go to https://undelete.pullpush.io/ and bookmark the page as it says (if you're having issues, see the FAQ on that page). Click the bookmark when you're viewing deleted content. Alternatively, replace www.reddit.com in the URL field with undelete.pullpush.io . You'll see the entirety of the post as well as the comments."

      "title": "View old versions of websites with the Wayback Machine.",
      "content": "View old versions of websites with the Wayback Machine. To use the Wayback Machine , go to https://archive.org/web/ and add the URL of the deleted post that you want to see. If you don't have the URL, your best bet is to use the search features in PullPush. Click the date that you think might contain the deleted post. The date will be circled in blue if there's a saved version. If you don't see a blue circle, the post may have been too recent for the Wayback Machine to crawl it."

      "content": "See deleted posts and comments with this third-party tool. Go to https://www.reveddit.com/ and enter a username, subreddit, or post link and click Go . Click a search result to see more, where you'll also be able to see if a comment was deleted by a mod or a bot."

    {
      "title": "The deleted post may show up in Google results.",
      "content": "The deleted post may show up in Google results. This is a last-resort move since the post you're looking for might not show up this way. But it's worth a shot! If you have the URL for the post you're looking for, put it into the search bar in Google, but add cache: to the beginning of the URL (right before the \"http\" part)."
