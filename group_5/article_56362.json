Perhaps you gave your password to someone and they gave your password to someone else without your permission. Netflix discourages account sharing. They recommend you use one account per household. If you share an account with people outside your household, Netflix may require you to verify the devices outside your household. [1] X Research source Additionally, Netflix has already begun testing a new feature that allows you to add extra members outside your household for a small fee. So you may be required to pay extra to share your account in the near future. [2] X Research source Netflix limits the number of screens that are allowed to stream at one time on an account. This means that sharing your account may limit your ability to stream whenever you want. A basic account only allows you to stream to one screen at a time. A standard account allows 2 screens to stream at one time. A premium account allows up to 4 screens to stream at once. [3] X Research source"
