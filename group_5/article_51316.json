      "content": "Find out what she wants, but subtly. Ask her about her favorite color, favorite animal or favorite pastime. Everyone has an interest that they consider their own; something that they feel identifies them as an individual. This interest is the key to a good gift. [1] X Research source Think about specific sports, activities, animals, bands, authors, or artists that she likes. Any one of these interests is a potential gift. If you don't want her to know you're asking about her, you can always ask around (her friends, or your friends) to gather more ideas. There's no shame in asking. Ask about other girls' interests, too, if you're worried that you might"

Put yourself in her shoes; think about what girls generally swoon over. Jewelry, flowers or candy are usually safe bets. Note : if you plan on buying her any one of these, don't expect to keep your crush secret. These gifts scream \"I'm really into you.\" Clothing can also be a good option, but choose with care. Shirts, scarves, hats, and socks are all fine clothing gifts. However , underwear, lingerie, camisoles or anything that goes underneath clothing is not! It's way too personal and may be taken the wrong way, or earn you a slap in the face. Underwear is only okay with her permission!"

      "content": "Be careful of how much you pay for her present. This may sound weird to say, but she may get a little uncomfortable if you buy her a $300 necklace and she buys you a pair of socks, or nothing at all. You might want to get her the world, but she might find it embarrassing. If you're just getting to know your crush, or haven't known her for too long, stick with presents that are under $100. It's still fairly easy to get her a great present that's classy and tasteful but doesn't cost too much. Think about: A nice set of paper and envelopes if she's a romantic or she likes to write letters. A pen (fountain or ball point) might be nice. A set of wonderfully-smelling candles. Just remember that the candles you think smell good might not appeal to her. A lomography camera. A lomography camera is a fancy name for a lo-fi camera that's coming back into style. These cameras are often available under $100. A miniature ecosystem if she's into nature, science, or biology. Mini ecosystems are customizable, require little upkeep, and can be bought for under $100. [2] X Research source"

If you really want to show her you care around her, make her something she'll enjoy and appreciate. There are tons of things you can make for her. Most involve a little bit of crafting. Maybe go with a rope bowl or some vintage stamp coasters. Both are ideas you can expand on. Make her a necklace with nice fabric and beads, or tiny Polaroid magnets with pictures of you and her. If she's a food-lover, make her some printable recipe cards where she can immortalize her favorite recipes, or a fruit bouquet packed with some of her favorite fruit."

More common ground can mean more time together. If you both like a sports team or a particular sport, get tickets to a game. Make sure she actually likes the sport though. You don't want to invite her to a baseball game only to find out she thinks it's incredibly boring. If you both like art or cooking, buy entry into a sculpture class or a cooking lesson. These are both fun group activities, and end up being pretty easy dates! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap up whatever you get her nicely. Simple wrapping paper with a pretty ribbon. Girls don't like presents handed to them in trash bags. There are a couple different wrapping methods you can experiment with, or you can always get your present gift wrapped for a fee (or sometimes free). Experiment a bit. Some people wrap the present inside a present. For example, cut a hole out of the middle of an old, used book and place a small, wrapped present inside the space you cut out. Then wrap up the book. Even if you're getting her tickets or something that fits into an envelope, take care to make the envelope look good. Make a great impression on her with sleek, high-quality paper."

All girls like to be told they are special. Keep your card short and sweet. An essay is probably what you'd like to write, but that much gushing can make her feel overwhelmed and embarrassed. Keep it simple. Cards are perfect opportunities for you to say something that will hit home with her. [4] X Research source You can make it suggestive and romantic by saying something like: \"Choosing gifts isn't easy, but what's worth all the world is to see you happy and healthy.\" Or you can stick to the friendly, familiar, or funny: \"Hope your holidays are filled with the brightest cheer.\""

If she has a gift for you, or gives you a gift over the course of the next couple of weeks, there's a good chance she really values you as a friend or likes you more intimately. If she really likes your gift, you could take a risk and tell her how you feel. She may even tell you how she feels! You may want to do this in a less populated area (e.g. not at school, work, or at a party), just in case her reaction to the news is unexpected. If she doesn't get you a gift back, and doesn't starting talking to you more, the signs aren't looking good. She probably doesn't like you in the same way that you like her, but you can never be sure. The surest way is to go out and ask her out at this point. You have nothing to lose."
