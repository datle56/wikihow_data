      "title": "Eat more slowly.",
      "content": "Eat more slowly. Eating slowly and in a relaxed atmosphere will help you digest your food more comfortably, giving your digestive enzymes more time to break down the food. Chewing your food thoroughly not only chops it down into more easily digestible chunks, but the more time it is in your mouth the more contact it will have with the saliva which begins your body’s digestive work. Eat at a more sedate pace, and make meals a social occasion and opportunity to chat and catch up with family and friends. If you are talking, you will eat more slowly and your digestion will be smoother and easier."

      "content": "Take a brief walk. After a big meal you will probably feel like having a lie down and maybe a nap, but the evidence suggests that taking a short walk for fifteen or twenty minutes is a great way to aid digestion. After heavy eating your blood sugar will generally rise and then fall, and going for a walk after eating can help you stabilise your blood sugar levels. A walk a little after eating can help you clear the glucose from your blood and get you feeling back to normal. [1] X Research source"
