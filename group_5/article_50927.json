      "content": "Take stock of your skills and experience. Historically, hobos have made their living from manual labor, but that doesn't always have to be the case. Any skill that is in wide demand and does not require an extended time commitment can be useful to a hobo. As long as you can advertise your services and earn people's trust (ideally through references), you can do anything. Some pursuits that lend themselves to this lifestyle are: Landscaping and construction - Many migrant workers who cross international borders find work in this area, as it is the least demanding in terms of language barriers. Having experience is essential, however, as you'd be required to work with potentially dangerous equipment and machinery. Farm hand - If you've ever thought about becoming a farmer , there are internships all over the world that offer housing, food, a stipend, and experience, in exchange for getting your hands dirty. You can follow harvest seasons around the country or around the globe. Progressive farms tend to provide better circumstances. Fishing - Serve as a deckhand, cook, or fisherman as you travel the high seas. Any web-based service such as writing , editing or programming ."

      "content": "Establish Plan B. This is a serious, life-altering decision. Don't abandon everything suddenly and disappear. You need something to come back to if your life on the road doesn't work out. Make sure all your debts are paid and responsibilities are handled before departure. If possible, have some savings set aside before you go, that you can access while you're on the road, if need be. Emergencies happen, and they cost money."

      "title": "Be prepared.",
      "content": "Be prepared. You may like the romantic idea of leaving with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever is in your wallet, but that is a sure-fire recipe for disaster. You must assume that you will be sleeping, cooking , traveling, and essentially living outdoors , unless you decide to drive a car . How will you get from place to place? Hobos are often associated with train-hopping, because this is what many hobos during the Great Depression did. A car can double as transportation and sleeping quarters, but keep in mind that gas is expensive, and upkeep on a vehicle is a major expense and if the expense bothers you, hitch-hiking is a good option since it's free. Some hobos prefer bicycles, but this will limit your range (to warm weather regions) and limit how much you can carry. A motorcycle can get you where you're going faster, but has maintenance requirements similar to those of a car , though not to the same degree. Buses are also an option: Greyhound, in the US at least, offers steep discounts when you purchase tickets a week in advance, and even more for still earlier purchases. Buy tickets at the station for the best deals; web purchases have an extra $3 or $4 tagged on whether the tickets are mailed or \"on call\". Where will you sleep ? Unless the place you work can offer housing, you will have to sleep in your car (if you have one), urban camp, squat in an abandoned building , or stay in hostels or motels. Another option is using the Communities Directory online to find urban co-ops, land trusts, and other alternative housing arrangements, which often welcome guests. See directory.ic.org. Yet another option is a traveler's network such as couchsurfing.com or globalfreeloaders.com , which offer free lodging to those who intend to contribute (in kind, or in other ways). Consider the costs and dangers associated with each. Where will you take showers ? Some campsites have showers, but many don't, so you may consider purchasing portable shower equipment. You can also obtain a membership to a national gym chain and use the showers there (provided you actually work out and maintain your appearance). How will you defend yourself? A nomadic lifestyle can be a dangerous one because you're constantly putting yourself in unfamiliar situations, and you're probably alone—both of which can make you a target for theft and assault. You'll need to outline some precautions you can take, such as always letting people know where you are, carrying a cell phone - and only going places where there's a reliable signal, having an alert system or weapon on you, etc. In addition, always know where you are so when you call for help you will be able to give them a location."

      "content": "Make a list of connections. Look at maps of the areas in which you'll be traveling, and determine whether or not there's anyone you know, directly or indirectly, who lives there. Ask your Aunt Sally if your great uncle Billy still lives in that cabin in the woods . Ask your friend if his cousin still works at the car dealership in Utah. Most important of all, ask them if it's okay if you can get in touch with those people in case of an emergency. Some people might offer to make arrangements so that you can actually visit, which is always nice. (Just be a good house guest! )"

The more prepared you are, the more you'll enjoy your travels."

Historically hobos relied on a shared system of symbols that let fellow travelers know more about their current environment.The symbols can vary from place to place and may no longer be used in many areas. Here are some symbols to get you started: spearhead - defend yourself circle with two parallel arrows - get out fast, hobos not welcome wavy line (signifying water) above an X - fresh water and a campsite nearby three diagonal lines - not a safe place. cross - \"angel food,\" (food served to hobos after a party)"

Make interesting friends (you never know when they might lend a helping hand). Life on the road means that every moment is your own. With no schedule and no responsibilities (except keeping yourself healthy), you must decide how to best use your time to achieve a balance between work, travel, relaxation, and entertainment. Enjoy the variety that each day has to offer...you're earning it."

      "content": "Don't hesitate to dumpster dive. You wouldn't believe the amount of free undamaged food that is thrown away all the time. For the best results check behind smaller grocery stores and fruit markets, as they usually don't invest money in a sealed garbage compactor (although these can sometimes be opened as well)—just be careful. Fast food chains are also usually good, but more traditional restaurants generally don't waste nearly as much food—although if you are really hungry you can usually find at least something there."
