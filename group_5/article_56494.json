      "title": "She's a free spirit, but too much restlessness could be a sign of trouble.",
      "content": "She's a free spirit, but too much restlessness could be a sign of trouble. It might be a sign she’s ready to move on to something new or more challenging to keep her attention. If she’s suddenly scrapping a night out to go on a trip across the country, she’s trying to keep herself busier than usual. If her favorite trails take the backseat, and books she’s wanted to read go unfinished, it might be time to see if something deeper is going on. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If you want to show her you can keep up with her wild ways, surprise her with a trip across town to a new restaurant. Bring her along when you go out for a morning coffee to keep things fresh. Showing initiative could be just the thing you need to make her see you’re well worth keeping around. Reader Poll: We asked 470 wikiHow readers who've dated a Sagittarius, and 55% of them agreed that the best way to excite them is by going on a spontaneous day trip. [Take Poll] Surprising her could be a great way to reignite the spark in your relationship."

      "title": "Too many heated debates could mean she’s losing patience.",
      "content": "Too many heated debates could mean she’s losing patience. She might not be one for the set and steady way, but she knows what she values, and bringing those into question, even as a calm debate could end with more trouble than you’d set out for. She might also quibble over little things that don’t seem to warrant a big reaction. [3] X Research source If a discussion about current politics turns into an argument about personal values, try to cool down by moving the discussion into history instead. If a playful question about food turns into a quibble about authentic cuisine, you could switch the topic to her favorite desserts or ask her about how she got interested in cooking. Also, Sagittarius women have zero tolerance to lies, and this can lead to heated arguments."

      "title": "You’ll want to watch out if her eyes wander more than normal.",
      "content": "You’ll want to watch out if her eyes wander more than normal. She’s not afraid to make the first move and get the ball rolling, but if you notice her attention is turned elsewhere, she might be trying to find someone to replace you. If she’s interested in someone else she may spend more time with them than you during a night out, she might go dancing and end up drawn to a new partner, or she might simply ask for someone’s number. If she has someone else on her radar, she might leave you behind to get to know them instead. [4] X Research source If you see her eyes wander, try reminding her how good you look by spicing up your appearance in a new outfit. Sagittarius women like things they can move in, but they appreciate a partner who compliments their style and is well put together. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "If her attention wanes, it likely means something is off.",
      "content": "If her attention wanes, it likely means something is off. If you notice her interest in you waning, you might be getting further down the list of the things she’s keeping track of. If you try to tell her about a new photography project, and she doesn’t take much interest, she might be trying to move on to something or someone new. If you’re excited about a book that just came out, but she doesn’t reciprocate, it could be a sign things aren’t the same. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Try shaking things up by asking her some questions. If you notice she’s taking on new projects, ask her what her goals are. If you see her finish a book with a smile on her face, ask her what she enjoyed about it. Put yourself back in by making some recommendations. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "She might be trying to keep you busy as she moves on.",
      "content": "She might be trying to keep you busy as she moves on. If she gets you into new dance lessons on top of learning languages and reading an exciting new thriller novel, don’t be so sure she’s doing it to try new things. She might be preparing you and herself for what’s coming. Not overly emotional, she might opt for keeping your mind on other things to spare you some heartache as she goes. It’ll help her not have to deal with the fallout if you’re too busy to be heartbroken. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source If you notice she’s keeping you up and about a lot of the time, it might be time to start a discussion about how things are. Sagittarius women are honest communicators, and appealing to her truth telling tendencies might get her to open up about what’s going on."

      "title": "Avoiding your concerns could point to a deeper issue.",
      "content": "Avoiding your concerns could point to a deeper issue. Sagittarians would rather be out living life, taking things as they come with optimism. If you bring up relationship concerns, and she doesn’t have much to say, she might not want to spend her energy on you much longer. She’ll be looking to focus more on new adventures than spending time trying to fix things emotionally. If she’s over you, she won’t be spending much energy trying to save your emotions for the better. [11] X Research source This might also be a sign she’s not a good match for you, especially if she avoids your concerns more often than not. It’s better not to take it personally, and instead shift the relationship to a fun-loving friendship rather than a romance."

      "title": "If she’s getting over you, she might start doing more things on her own.",
      "content": "If she’s getting over you, she might start doing more things on her own. She might stop inviting you to the club or have other friends around for a surprise camping trip. If she doesn’t think it’s worthwhile to have you around, she might leave you on the sidelines more than usual or cut you out completely. [12] X Research source For a change, you could try taking the reins and inviting her on a trip. If she still avoids outings with you, you could use the time to rest and give the both of you some space. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, after all, and Sagittarius women definitely need space.."

      "title": "These are nothing new, but you might want to watch out for long trips.",
      "content": "These are nothing new, but you might want to watch out for long trips. If you notice she leaves every other week for a flight across the country or that trip to Europe takes weeks on end, she might be trying to leave you behind. She loves traveling and exploring, and meeting interesting people is practically a hobby in itself. If she takes to straying from your side for too long, she might be close to moving on.

      "title": "Known for her honesty, it could spell trouble if she tries an indirect route.",
      "content": "Known for her honesty, it could spell trouble if she tries an indirect route. If you notice she’s picking fights or trying to push your buttons on purpose, she might be trying to steer you to end the relationship. This could be a way to soften the blow on each of you. If you come to the conclusion to move on and end things with her, she won’t have to concern herself with any emotional fallout that comes with ending it herself. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "She's a busy woman, but she could be giving you the cold shoulder.",
      "content": "She's a busy woman, but she could be giving you the cold shoulder. If she stops talking to you completely, however, it’s most likely a sign that she’s lost interest in you and moved onto her next grand adventure. You’ll know something is wrong if you ask her a thought-provoking question and don’t get an answer or if you try to ask for advice and get little to nothing from her. Usually forthcoming, an extended silence is probably a sign she’s on her way out. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Sagittarius women aren’t afraid to tell you the truth. If things have grown stale, she’ll probably let you know herself. If she’s over you and she tells you, there might not be anything to do but let her go. [16] X Research source If you want to fight for her, see if she’s open to talking about her emotions. While not overly emotional, Sagittarius women will be honest with you always, especially when it counts. It might be a sign you can mend things if she’s willing to open up and work on the relationship together. [17] X Research source"
