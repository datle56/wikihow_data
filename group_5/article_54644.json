Live File System) or \"With a CD/DVD player\" (a.k.a. Mastered). What you choose depends on how you intend to use the disc. [2] X Research source Live File System is appropriate if you want to be able to add and remove files from the disc at any time. The disc will act similarly to a USB drive and files will be burned to the disc as soon as they are added. Note: Live File System discs created in this manner are only compatible with Windows. Mastered is appropriate if you'd like the disc to function more like a closed system. All of the files are burned at once after you're finished adding them and no more files can be added without a full erase when using this format. Note: Mastered tends to be better for burning lots of files. In addition, Mastered discs will be compatible with other operating systems."
