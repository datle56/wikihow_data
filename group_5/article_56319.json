      "content": "Ensure you have a very large pasta pot. A pasta pot that is seven quarts (6.6l) or larger will allow you to cook a pound of pasta. Cooking with more than enough water also prevents clumping, sticky pasta. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour five to six quarts (4. 7 to 5.6l) of water into your stockpot for each pound (0.4kg) of spaghetti. Surplus water will also allow the pasta to return to boiling quickly after you add your dry pasta. Using a lot of water is extremely important when cooking long pasta, like spaghetti or fettuccini. The long pasta needs room to move around the pot without sticking to the sides."
