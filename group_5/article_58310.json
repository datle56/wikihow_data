      "title": "Platonic soulmates are people who share a deep, meaningful bond.",
      "content": "Platonic soulmates are people who share a deep, meaningful bond. It may feel as though your souls are “linked,” like you were meant to be in one another’s lives. The true definition of a platonic soulmate is someone with whom you have an intimate connection without romantic or sexual interest. In other words, your bond goes beyond good friends, but neither of you wants to be in a relationship. [1] X Research source Though many assume soulmates must be romantically linked, the actual definition is more general. Soulmates are simply people whose souls are profoundly connected. Soulmates often feel like they know one another right away, possibly even from a past life. For many people, finding a soulmate—platonic or otherwise—feels like finally finding a missing piece of their soul. They understand their soulmate completely, and their soulmate understands them in return."

Platonic soulmates often have a knack for making one another laugh because they find the same things funny and love exchanging all their best jokes.

You might get a lot of questions from family or other friends, like, “Why don’t you start dating? You have so much in common,” or “What’s up with you two? It really seems like you’d make a good match.” Consider your reaction when somebody asks you that. Do you immediately say “no” and firmly shut down the idea because you genuinely don’t like it?
