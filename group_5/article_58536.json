Surah al-Fatihah goes as follows: [6] X Research source “Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem Alhamdu lillaahi Rabbil 'aalameen Ar-Rahmaanir-Raheem Maaliki Yawmid-Deen Iyyaaka na'budu wa lyyaaka nasta'een Ihdinas-Siraatal-Mustaqeem Siraatal-lazeena an'amta 'alaihim ghayril-maghdoobi 'alaihim wa lad-daaalleen” Meaning : “In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Universe, the Beneficent, the Merciful and Master of the Day of Judgment. Lord, You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance.

Forgive our living and our dead, those who are with us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our men and our women. O Allah, whoever you give life from among us, give him life in Islam, and whomever you take away from us, take him away in Faith. O Allah, do not forbid us their reward and do not send us astray after them.”"
