      "title": "The restrained condition renders creatures unable to move.",
      "content": "The restrained condition renders creatures unable to move. There are many conditions in D&D 5e, many of which can impair your PC (player character) in some way. “Restrained” is a condition designed to stop your character (or any creature) from moving while also making it more difficult for you to act in combat. Thus, when used strategically, the restrained condition can easily turn the tide of a difficult fight! [1] X Research source Like all conditions, the restrained condition lasts until it is somehow countered (meaning you find a way to cancel it out). Alternatively, in some cases, the condition lasts until the magical effect causing it (like an enemy’s spell, for example) naturally ends."

    {
      "title": "A restrained creature’s movement speed becomes 0.",
      "content": "A restrained creature’s movement speed becomes 0. All creatures (including your PC) in D&D 5e have a movement speed, which measures how far they can move (in feet) in a single round. When creatures get restrained, however, they can’t move at all—and, as a result, lose the ability to use their movement speed until the retrained condition goes away. [2] X Research source For example, say you created a D&D character with a movement speed of 30 feet per round. Every time it’s your turn to act in combat, you can choose to move your PC up to 30 feet. However, if an enemy spellcaster successfully cast Snare on your PC and gave them the restrained condition, their movement speed would become 0 (meaning they can’t move) for the duration of that spell."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attackers have advantage against restrained creatures.",
      "content": "Attackers have advantage against restrained creatures. Because a restrained creature can’t move, it’s naturally easier to hit them with both weapon and spell attack. Mechanically, any attack roll against a restrained creature has advantage—and “advantage” basically means rolling 2d20 (20-sided dice) instead of 1 and taking the higher number for the attack roll, increasing the chances of a successful hit. [3] X Research source For example: say your PC is restrained, and a vindictive foe tries to attack them with a sword. On a normal attack, your DM would have to roll 1d20 and add the enemy’s ability modifier (which impacts their chances of making attacks) to that roll. However, with advantage, your DM can instead roll 2d20, take the higher result, and add the enemy’s ability modifier to that. So, if your DM rolled a 5 first and a 15 next, they could take the 15 for their attack roll—making a successful hit much more likely."
    },
    {
      "title": "Restrained creatures have disadvantage on attacks and DEX saves.",
      "content": "Restrained creatures have disadvantage on attacks and DEX saves. Lack of movement makes it difficult to do just about anything effectively—so, mechanically, restrained creatures have to make all their attack rolls and DEX saves (Dexterity saving throws) with disadvantage. Disadvantage simply means rolling 2d20 for an attack, ability check, or saving throw and taking the lower roll, reducing your chances of success. [4] X Research source You get to make attack rolls, which determine whether an attack succeeds, whenever your PC attacks with a physical weapon or a spell that allows them. Dexterity is one of 6 ability scores (along with Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Strength, and Constitution) all creatures in D&D have, and it measures their agility. Therefore, DEX saves measure your PC’s ability to dodge an incoming threat, such as an area effect spell. If they’re restrained, it’s harder to successfully dodge those threats. Say your PC is restrained, and an enemy wizard casts a Fireball spell in their area. You’d have to make a DEX save with disadvantage to try and dodge the fiery blast. You might roll 2d20 and get a 15 first (which is a pretty good roll) and a 2 next (which is very low). Since 2 is the lower roll, you’d have to use that for the DEX save, lowering your character’s chances of success."

      "title": "Your character can still attack and cast spells while restrained.",
      "content": "Your character can still attack and cast spells while restrained. Don’t assume your PC is helpless just because they’re restrained! You might have disadvantage at times, but you’re absolutely able to take turns in combat. Furthermore, there’s nothing in the rules saying you can’t attack enemies with both weapons and spells—particularly area-of-effect spells, which don’t impose disadvantage because they don’t require attack rolls. [5] X Research source For example, if you want your PC to shoot an arrow at an enemy or slash them with a dagger, you can do it—but it’ll be at disadvantage. If you want to hit an enemy with a spell requiring an attack roll, like Guiding Bolt or Eldritch Blast, you would also have to do it at disadvantage. However, if you want to cast a spell like Burning Hands or Ice Storm (which both require making a Dexterity saving throw to avoid), you could do it without any negative effects."

      "title": "Some monsters have the natural ability to restrain creatures.",
      "content": "Some monsters have the natural ability to restrain creatures. Typically, creatures get restrained as the result of a particular spell effect or tool (like rope). However, some monsters that you might encounter (and fight) over the course of your D&D campaign have innate abilities that allow them to restrain creatures in combat. [6] X Research source So, be prepared to dodge out of the way if you spot any of the following monsters: Giant spiders create webs that trap and restrain their prey. Ropers (monstrosities that take the appearance of stalactites) have tendrils that constrict and restrain unsuspecting creatures. Medusas have a Petrifying Gaze ability that, when successful, first restrains creatures and eventually petrifies them. Giant crocodiles have a bite powerful enough to hold enemies in place, effectively restraining them."

      "content": "Grappler feat In D&D 5e, you can choose to give your character a new feat (which is essentially an extra, optional ability) at certain times when they level up. The Grappler feat gives your PC advantage on any athletics checks made to grapple another creature and lets you attempt to restrain any creature your PC successfully grapples. [7] X Research source Grappling a target effectively stops them from moving. So, restraining an enemy directly after a grapple would then impose disadvantage on their attacks and DEX saves, plus advantage on attacks against them, in addition to the limited movement."

      "content": "Rope Don’t overthink! If you want to restrain your enemies while playing D&D 5e , sometimes the best way to do it is with a length of rope. The rules for rope in 5e state that a tied-up creature can break free of their binds with a DC (difficulty class) 17 athletics check, which in turn means that you can theoretically restrain any creature using a rope with an escape DC of 17.

It doesn’t have many uses, and the DC to escape a net is 10 (which is relatively low), but a large or smaller creature can nonetheless be restrained using a net—so consider keeping one on hand during your adventures, just in case! [9] X Research source Every creature in D&D 5e is classified by size, from “tiny” to “gargantuan.” The fact that nets restrain large or smaller creatures simply means that any creature classified as “large,” “medium,” “small,” or “tiny” are vulnerable to nets."

Athletics checks (which measure a PC’s strength and athleticism) are most commonly used for escaping the restrained condition. [26] X Research source For example, if your PC gets retrained, your DM might tell you to make an athletics check to try and free your PC on their next turn in combat.
