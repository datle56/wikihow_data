      "title": "Blink your eyes.",
      "content": "Blink your eyes. You may be able to dislodge the dirt in your eye with very little effort. Once you notice the dirt in your eye, blink your eyes several times. The blinking reflex in the eye allows the lashes and lids to move tears around and remove bacteria and debris out of the eye. If simple blinking does not help, stretch your upper eyelid over your lower eyelid and then blink your eye repeatedly. This allows the lashes on the lower lid to sweep the dirt out of your eye.

Washing hands before handling your eyes is important to reduce any possible contamination from bacteria, germs, or additional irritants. You don't want to remove any dirt from your eye only to infect it with something worse. This is important because your eyes are vulnerable to infections.

      "content": "Remove the dirt. If the dirt is on your eyelid or easily accessible area of your eye, you may be able to remove it with a cotton swab. If you can see the area of your eye or eyelid where the dirt is, take a clean cotton swab and dab it on the dirt. It should attach to the end of the swab after you dab it a few times. Do not jab your eye with the swab or swipe the swab too harshly against the dirt. This could embed the dirt in your eyelid. If the dirt doesn't come off when you dab it, try another method."
