      "content": "Fold over and pin the edges of the blanket if desired. You can fold over the edges of the blanket to create a hemmed edge on your blanket, or you can leave the edge unfolded and sew along the raw edge of the blanket. It is up to you. If you decide to fold the blanket over, fold 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of material over on each of the 4 sides of the blanket and insert pins into the folded fabric to hold it in place. [1] X Research source Fleece does not fray easily, so having a folded hem is not really necessary unless you like the look of a folded hem."

You can use a zigzag stitch to secure a folded hem or you can sew over the raw edges of a fleece blanket to create a finished look. Consult your sewing machine’s manual to find out how to set your sewing machine to the zigzag stitch setting. There should be a dial or digital control where you can select the stitch type. Adjust the zigzag stitch settings to a long and wide setting by turning the width and length to the highest settings. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew along the edges of the blanket.",
      "content": "Sew along the edges of the blanket. Raise your sewing machine’s presser foot, and then place the fleece fabric under it. Lower the presser foot and then begin sewing the zigzag stitch along the raw edges of your fabric. Go slow and hold the fabric taut as you sew. If you have folded the fabric over, then position the needle about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the folded edge. This will ensure that the needle will go right up to or just over the raw edge of the folded fabric. [3] X Research source If you have left the fabric unfolded, then sew about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the raw edges of the fabric. If you are having trouble keeping the fabric moving evenly under your presser foot, you can place a piece of tissue paper or wax paper under the fabric and over the feed dogs. This will help to prevent it from getting caught on the feed dogs and you can tear away the paper after you finish sewing. [4] X Research source"

To secure the last few stitches, press down on the reverse direction lever on the side of your sewing machine while continuing to keep light pressure on the pedal. Sew backwards about 1 inch (2.5 cm) and then release the lever to sew forward again. Sew off the last edge of the blanket and stop the machine. Cut the excess thread near the blanket and you are finished!"

If you are making a double layer fleece blanket, then you will need to cut out a square of fabric on each of the corners or your blanket will not lay flat. Measure and mark the area with a fabric marker or pen and then cut along the lines. [5] X Research source You do not need to cut out a square of fabric at the corners if you are only adding fringe to a single layer blanket."

Use a ruler to draw 2 inches (5.1 cm) lines on a piece of construction paper or cardstock. The lines should be 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) apart. [6] X Research source Make sure to use a dark pen or marker to draw the lines so that they will be easy to see."

Use the template as your guide to cut the fringe. Align the scissors with 1 of the guidelines when you make each cut in the fleece.

When you have finished cutting all the fringe, go around the edges of the blanket and tie together the fringe pieces that are next to each other. Tie 2 pieces of fringe together, then tie the next 2 pieces of fringe together. Do this all the way around the blanket. [9] X Research source If you are making a double layer blanket, then you will really be tying 4 pieces of fringe together at a time because the fringe will be layered."

Creating a braided edge requires 2 layers of fleece, so you will need to place 2 equally sized pieces of fleece together so that the print sides are facing each other. Then, sew a straight stitch 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) all the way around the edges of the fleece pieces and except for a 6 in (15 cm) gap through which you can invert the pieces. [10] X Research source Use gentle pressure on the pedal to avoid sewing too quickly. Slow is best when sewing fleece. It is very important that you do not sew all the way around the edges of the blanket because you will need an opening to pull the blanket fabric through. Hold the fabric taut to help prevent it from getting caught in the machine’s feed dogs. If the fleece still gets caught or is not moving along smoothly, place a piece of tissue paper or wax paper over the feed dogs and then place the fleece fabric over the paper. Sew through both and then tear the paper off of the seam when you are done. [11] X Research source"

Place the template about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the raw edges of the blanket and cut the fringe using the template as your guide. Cut from the edge of the fabric up to the edge of the template.

Sew across the loops and then press the lever on your machine to reverse the direction and sew back over the same area. Then, release the pedal on your sewing machine and remove the fabric from under the presser foot. [15] X Research source Cut the excess threads near the blanket and your blanket is ready to use! If desired, you may hand sew across the loops to secure them. Thread a needle with 18 inches (46 cm) of thread and pull the thread through the eye of the needle until the ends are even. Tie the ends in a knot and then sew through the two loops a few times to secure them. Tie the thread in a knot to secure it when you are finished and cut the excess thread."
