      "content": "You can easily change the quality of just about any YouTube video. When someone uploads a high-definition video to YouTube, YouTube makes their video available in different resolutions to suit different internet speeds and screen sizes. [1] X Research source If your connection or device slows down and the video you're watching keeps stopping to buffer, try reducing the video quality so there's less data to download. Or, if the video looks grainy or blurry, you can try increasing the quality. Mobile app: Tap the three vertical dots at the top-right corner of the video, select Quality , then choose a different quality level. You can choose Auto to let YouTube choose the best quality, Higher picture quality to use the video's maximum quality, Data saver to switch to a lower quality, or Advanced to choose a specific resolution. Computer: Click the gear icon on the video, select Quality , then choose your preferred resolution. The higher the number, the better the quality. If the person who created the video didn't upload it in a high-definition resolution like 1080p or better, you won't be able to watch that video in HD."
