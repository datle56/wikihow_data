If you punish your cats for jumping on off-limits surfaces yourself, they will learn to keep off counters only when you're at home. You can create some devices for remote correction yourself, but never create a deterrent that might hurt your cat(s)."

      "content": "Place light baking sheets at the counter's edge. This simple means of discouraging your cats from jumping on the countertop works because the cats will land on the sheets when they jump onto the counter. The noise and unexpected movement will frighten them, but not physically hurt the cats. Over time, they will associate the countertops with this sound and the stress it creates and avoid jumping up there. You can also fill baking trays with water and set them on the counter. Cats will be startled not only by the noise, but by the water as well. The drawback here is that cats can slip in the water, so if your cat is old or not especially spry, it would probably be better to avoid this method, as they might slip and hurt themselves."

Attach one end of the string to empty cans that can be easily knocked over. If you position it just right, a cat jumping onto the counter will move the string enough to knock over the cans, creating a startling noise that will deter him or her from jumping up there again. For an even more startling noise, add coins or other small objects to the cans."

Cats are easily distracted and annoyed by objects that stick to them, so the double-stick tape should be effective. You can also try putting aluminum foil on surfaces.

[3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source These devices startle cats with loud noises, unexpected movement, or double-sided tape. There is quite a market for these types of deterrents, so do some research to see what works. Motion-activated air blasters are one example of electronic devices meant to deter cats from countertops or other unwanted surfaces or areas. [4] X Expert Source Molly DeVoss Certified Feline Training and Behavior Specialist & Certified Cat Behavior Consultant Expert Interview. 28 June 2021. A motion sensor detects the cat in the off-limits area and immediately sprays the animal with a strong gust of air, startling them. Motion-activated alarms are another device that can help deter cats from countertops. A motion sensor activates a loud alarm that startles the cat and alerts the owner. Some motion-activated alarms are pressure sensitive, so they are activated when the cat touches them or what they are positioned under. There are even mats that are pressure sensitive that you can roll out on the countertop so they will be triggered when the cat lands on them. Silent motion-activated alarms provide a less bothersome alternative to other motion-activated alarms. These alarms emit a tone of such a high pitch that they are inaudible to humans and even dogs, but they will deter cats. Textured mats are a harmless deterrent that require no electricity, batteries, or compressed air. These mats are simply-textured with a minimally-pointed nub that is uncomfortable for the cat to tread upon. Encountering them, the cats will generally jump off."

There are many noisemakers from which to choose, and there are even some that are manufactured for this specific purpose. An air horn can be an effective way of startling the cat enough to get them off the surface from which they are banned if you can catch them in the act and remain concealed. Just be sure the air horn you choose is not so loud the you damage the cat's or you own hearing. Some manufacturers have created air horns that are loud when activated, but that also spray a pheromone which further deters the cat from unwanted behavior."

Like cat trees and other cat furniture, cat shelves satisfy curiosity while stimulating your pet at the same time. Choose windows with good sun exposure, as cats do like to lay in the sun, and the cat shelf is a great place to do so in a window that gets a lot of sunlight. The cat shelf gives your cat(s) an alternative place to sleep and/or watch what's happening outside, which can help keep them distracted from countertops."

If you can keep your cat interested enough in toys that stay on the floor in particular, you may also be able to keep them from becoming interested in jumping onto countertops. Change the available toys occasionally so they don't get bored and start jumping on counters for new stimulation. Many cats like simple toys, like small, fake mice that you can throw across the room for them to chase—they may even bring them back to you! Some cats will inevitably avoid expensive toys and play instead with empty plastic bags, boxes, laundry baskets, etc. Experiment with different types of toys to see what you cat likes before you buy an expensive toy. Many cat toys are now electronic, with toy mice that run around a track or even ones with wheels so they can roll across carpeting or other floors on their own. Still other toys incorporate LED lights and other technology. These toys can be very stimulating for cats, thereby keeping them off off-limits surfaces like countertops."

Cats sleep 16-20 hours per day, which is a lot of time they won't be interested in jumping on countertops. If you give them especially inviting spaces in which to sleep, you'll be encouraging them to sleep in these spaces and not on countertops. You'll also be helping to ensure they are taking full advantage of sleeping time and not seeking out new stimulation around the house—such as on the countertops."

      "content": "Put your cats in another room while you're cooking. This is so they don't become curious about what is on the counter from the smell of food coming from there. Cats' sense of smell is forty times stronger than that of humans. They will smell whatever you are cooking, and this can excite their sense of curiosity when you're not around, so they may jump onto the surface these smells emanate from. Cats might even have trouble controlling their curiosity and jump on the counter even while you are actively cooking. Putting cats in another room while you cook can minimize their curiosity about countertops and help keep them from jumping there. Be sure to provide a toy and comfortable place to sleep in whatever space you leave them while using the kitchen to cook or prepare meals so they are stimulated and comfortable. Confining cats to another room while you're cooking doesn't work with all cats, so don't be surprised if your cat whines from inside the room. If this happens, try not to leave them in there too long or you may cause them stress. Your cat may jump on the counter because it wants to spend more time with you, so be sure you have quality bonding time with it other times during the day.

      "content": "Consider giving more food to your cats. It is possible your cat is jumping on your countertops to scavenge for food because he or she is hungry. You might be able to determine if this is the case simply by offering your cat more food than usual. If the cat doesn't seem to jump on the counter after you start offering more food than before, then you might have solved the problem. However, some cats do overeat, and even if you do offer more food, they may still jump onto counters. Be prepared for this possibility as you try offering more food to combat countertop incursions. Feed your cats more frequent meals. Many cats are \"grazers\" meaning they like to eat small amounts of food over the course of the day instead of having specific mealtimes where they eat a lot of food at once. If your cats are grazers, feed them small, frequent meals throughout the day. Just be sure you don't exceed the daily serving amount on the food package (unless your veterinarian instructs you to do otherwise).
