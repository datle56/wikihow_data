      "content": "This simple gesture can really brighten your friend's day. If your friend is in need of comfort, send them frequent reminders that you're thinking of them. Try to reach out every day to tell them that you miss them and can't wait to see them again. Share that something reminded you of them in class that day. It will let your friend know that they're still very much a presence in your life even if they're far away. [1] X Research source Texting something like, \"Thinking of you! Hope you're having a great day.\" Send a video of yourself jamming to their favorite song. Say something like, \"This came on the radio and it made me wish you were here so bad! Miss you.\" Reader Poll: We asked 210 wikiHow readers how they have supported an upset friend over text and 52% of them agreed that the best way to help is by offering a listening ear. [Take Poll] Sometimes just listening to them can help them feel so much better."

      "content": "If they've been down on themselves lately, they may need a reminder. Send them a list of all the reasons you think they're amazing. Whether it be their kind and compassionate nature, their sense of style, or their knack for finding the coolest music, tell them why you are so grateful to know them. [2] X Research source Preface your list with a text like, \"Hey just in case you're wondering, these are all the reasons why I think you're the coolest!\""

      "content": "Help them remember all of the good times. Message them a random shared memory that always makes you smile. Next time you talk on the phone, reminisce with them about all of the fun experiences you two have had. It will hopefully brighten their mood and remind them of the positive things in life. Call them out of the blue to share a memory that's on your mind. Say something like, \"I just remembered when we wore those wild outfits to that school dance. What were we thinking?!\" Text them, \"Do you ever think about all those over-the-top pranks we pulled on my little brother? Good times.\""

      "content": "Different people prefer to be comforted in different ways. Ask if there's anything specific you can do to help your friend. The question alone will show that you care, and your friend will appreciate your kind offer. [3] X Research source Text them something like, \"I'm sorry things have been rough. Is there anything I can do to help?\" While you're talking on the phone, say something like, \"What can I do to help? I'm always here if you need anything.\""

      "content": "Provide a humorous distraction. Next time you see a funny cat picture online or a meme that you know your friend would like, send it their way. Avoid sending something funny during a deep discussion or right after your friend has confided in you, though. Wait for a more lighthearted conversation or send it randomly to start a new one. [4] X Research source Text your friend a SpongeBob meme with the caption, \"Thought you would like this.\" Message them a silly picture of your dog along with the text, \"Toby misses you!\""

      "content": "Make it more of an event than your usual phone calls and Skype dates. Watch a movie over Zoom or FaceTime together. Pick a recipe and make it in your respective kitchens. Schedule a virtual game night. It'll be a welcome distraction for your friend and will help remind them of all the fun you two can still have together. [5] X Research source Pick something that you know your friend will like and plan the event for them. It'll make them feel super valued to know that you went out of your way to cheer them up.

      "content": "This is a classic way to show someone that you care. First, draft what you want to include in your letter. Try things like updates about what's been going on in your life, all the reasons you miss them, and fond memories you have of the last time you hung out. When you decide what to include, write it out on some nice paper. Mail the letter to their address and text them that something is coming their way soon. [8] X Research source For a creative touch, write your message on a postcard. Find one with an image that reminds you of your friend. For example, if you and your friend once hiked to a waterfall in your area, choose a postcard with a picture of that waterfall."

      "content": "Surprise them with something special to make their day. Arrange for flowers to be delivered to their apartment. Mail them one of their favorite albums on vinyl. You don't have to go all out in terms of spending, either. A homemade gift, like a knitted scarf or a piece of artwork, will lift their spirits all the same. Other ideas include a candle in a scent that you know they like, a gift card to a restaurant that they go to a lot, and a funny T-shirt that references their favorite show."

Make travel arrangements to drive or fly to the city they live in. If that's too far away, agree to meet somewhere in the middle. [10] X Research source Once you plan the trip, count down the days on your calendar and share updates with your friend as it gets closer. Keep reminding them that there are fun things to look forward to in the future."
