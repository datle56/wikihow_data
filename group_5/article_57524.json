      "content": "Gather all your materials. You'll need a piece of corrugated paper that is about 24 inches in length (this is a ridge material, easily available from paper stores or craft stores). You'll need two magnifying glasses that are NOT the same size. You will also need strong glue, scissors, and a pencil. If the magnifying glasses are the same size, the telescope won't work."

      "content": "Measure along the edge of the paper from the first mark. You will need to measure about 1 1/2 inches from the mark. This will create the extra length to glue around the magnifying glass."

      "content": "Cut down the marked line on the paper to the other side. You should be cutting across the width of it (don't cut lengthwise). The paper should be about 24 inches in length on one side. Cut a slot in the cardboard tube near the front opening about an inch (2.5 cm) away. Do not cut all the way through the tube. The slot should be able to hold the large magnifying glass."

[4] X Research source This type of telescope is really good for viewing the moon. The images will be upside down, since astronomers don't care about up and down in space (there is no up or down in space, after all). if you wish to align the image with gravity, you can use two prisms aligned in an \"N\" shape to correct the image, but you will have to re-position the lenses."

You'll need two lenses, a mailing tube that has an inside tube and an outside tube (you can get this at the post office or office supply store; it should have a diameter of 2 inches and a length of 43.3 inches), a coping saw, a box cutter, some strong glue and a drill. [5] X Research source Lenses should be a different focal length. For best results get a concave-convex lens with a diameter of 49 mm, and a focal length of 1,350 mm and a plano-concave lens with a diameter of 49 mm, and a focal length of 152 mm. It's very easy to order lenses off the internet and they aren't very expensive. You can get the pair of lenses for about $16. The coping saw is the most effective for making clean, straight lines , but you can use any other kind of saw or cutting device if you need to."

You'll need to make the holes where the lens is going to be placed in the outer tube, because the holes allow you to put glue into the inner part of the tube. Near the end of the inner tube is the best place, about an inch in. You'll also need to the make holes at the end of the outer tube for the eyepiece and the cap."
