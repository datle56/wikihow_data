      "content": "Open communication is the key to any healthy relationship. You and your partner need to talk about any struggles you’re going through. [1] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 18 September 2019. When you let things go or assume they’ll get better on their own, they tend to fester, which can lead to resentment over time. When you notice issues cropping up, sit your spouse down and talk with them about it. [2] X Expert Source Jin S. Kim, MA Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 14 May 2019. You can bring up issues in the relationship by saying something like, “Hey honey, could we sit down and talk later this evening? I have a few things I’d like to chat with you about, just to make sure we’re on the same page.” To avoid putting your spouse on the defensive, use “I” statements. [3] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 7 August 2019. For instance, instead of saying, “You always come home late,” you might say, “When you stay out late without telling me where you’re going, I feel worried.”"

      "title": "Bringing up all your problems at once can feel overwhelming.",
      "content": "Bringing up all your problems at once can feel overwhelming. When you sit down with your partner to chat about what you’re struggling with, try to pick one thing to talk about at a time. That way, you can dig deep into a specific issue instead of generalizing about a ton of things at once. [4] X Research source For example, if you want to talk about your intimacy (or lack thereof) but also about your stress levels, pick one and save the other for a different time."

      "title": "Listen closely, and try not to interrupt.",
      "content": "Listen closely, and try not to interrupt. Your partner probably has their own view of what’s going on in your marriage. Do your best to see things from their perspective, and don’t dismiss how they’re feeling right away. If you try your best to be understanding, you two can have better, more productive conversations. [5] X Expert Source Raffi Bilek, LCSW-C Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 15 October 2021. Show that you’re listening to your partner by asking follow-up questions like, “Interesting.

      "content": "The goal is to reach a decision that benefits both of you. Even if it’s an issue that only one of you is having, you should try to reach a win-win solution: something that makes you both feel like you’re improving your relationship and growing closer together. [6] X Expert Source Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 18 September 2019. This may take a little while, and you might have to talk multiple times with your spouse, but in the end, it will be worth it. [7] X Research source For instance, if the issue is that you feel you do more chores around the house than your spouse does, you might create a chore list that you both work on throughout the week. That way, you can both see how many chores the two of you are doing, and you both feel like you’re equally contributing to the household."

      "content": "There may be recurring issues that crop up over time. This can sound like a red flag, but in reality, it’s normal for most long-term relationships. You and your partner will probably disagree about similar things a lot, and that’s okay. The important thing is that you stay respectful and kind when addressing these disagreements, whether it’s the first time or the fiftieth time. [8] X Research source For example, maybe you like to clean up the house at the end of each day, while your partner prefers to do a big cleanup at the end of the week. You two might discuss this a lot over your relationship, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing—it’s just a difference in preferences."

      "content": "Hanging onto anger and resentment isn’t great for your marriage. If you feel hurt or mad at your partner still, work on forgiving them for the past. Make sure you’ve fully talked through the issue, and try to get a sincere apology from your partner, if they’re willing. Then, you can choose whether or not you can forgive your spouse to keep the relationship moving forward.

      "content": "Division of labor is a huge point of contention in most relationships. Often, both partners feel like they’re doing all the work, so they start to get resentful. Sit down with your spouse and talk about who does what around the house, and make some changes if there are any issues. [10] X Research source It might help to make a list of what the both of you do day by day. That way, you can see how many tasks each of you are doing throughout the week."

Sit down with your spouse and discuss the specifics of what you’d like to do with your children, and how you’ll do it. Even if you don’t agree 100%, it’s important to be on the same page, at least about bigger issues. [11] X Research source You could say something like, “I think it’s important that we talk about how we’ll raise our child. Do you want to discuss some things with me?”"

It takes two to tango, just like it takes two to make a marriage work. Even if you feel like you’re completely in the right, try to look at it from your partner’s perspective. Then, you can start implementing small changes in yourself that will lead to bigger changes overall. [17] X Research source For instance, if you and your spouse often fight when you have to stay late at work, you may be dedicating too much time to your job and not enough time for your spouse. You could work on that by reevaluating your schedule and prioritizing quality time with your partner."

Try to spend more time doing things you love, like hanging out with close friends, diving into hobbies, and getting out into nature. Try not to ignore your responsibilities or your home life (don’t leave your spouse to take care of the kids every weekend), but inject a little fun into your routine to make your life easier. [19] X Research source You can also focus on self-care and do things that don’t take much time at all.
