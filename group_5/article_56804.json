      "content": "Shave your arm hair. You may shave your arms with a safety razor just as any part of your body. This is a temporary solution, and you may see hair regrowth within a few days.

      "content": "Try at-home waxing. Waxing will keep your arms smooth for about four weeks. At-home waxing treatments are therefore long-lasting and relatively inexpensive.

Allow your hair to grow out for a few weeks to a reasonable length before attempting to wax it. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Try sugaring for a treatment similar to waxing.",
      "content": "Try sugaring for a treatment similar to waxing. If you don't want to purchase a wax treatment, make your own hair remover at home using sugar and water. Combine 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium heat. Pour into a glass container when it turns a ginger-ale brown color. Let cool slightly, then apply to skin with a butter knife. Pull firmly upwards and the sugar wax will remove the hairs. Try applying corn starch to your skin beforehand to get rid of excess moisture. Sugaring removes the hair from the root each time you do it, so if you continue the treatments every 6 weeks or so, you should notice your hair becoming finer and sparser over time.

      "content": "Try laser hair removal. [14] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to penetrate the hair follicle and destroy the hair. It is certified by the FDA to permanently reduce hair. This means that hair growth will be reduced over time, and hair may be completely gone for years at a time. Many patients will need multiple treatments to keep hair from growing back. This is not a permanent solution, but may last for years. There are few side effects, although treatments can cause pain afterward. This pain is usually treated with over the counter medication. [15] X Research source Visit a dermatologic surgeon to get laser hair removal done. Make sure you find a doctor experienced and trained in performing laser hair removal. It may take 6-8 sessions to see results, so talk to your dermatologist about what to expect from the procedure.
