    {
      "title": "Begin with an unloaded firearm.",
      "content": "Begin with an unloaded firearm. You’ll be touching the trigger, so it’s imperative that your rifle is unloaded for these tests. Remove all ammunition and clear the chamber before beginning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the distance between the trigger and the butt plate or recoil pad.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the trigger and the butt plate or recoil pad. Use a tape measure to find the distance between the center of the trigger and the center of the back of the butt plate or recoil pad. This is the LOP of the rifle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the measurement.",
      "content": "Write down the measurement. In case the LOP turns out to be too long or short, you’ll need to know the measurement to determine if your stock should be trimmed or replaced. Most factory rifles have an LOP between 13.00 and 13.75 inches (33.0 and 34.9 cm)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rest your index finger on the trigger face and bend your arm 90 degrees.",
      "content": "Rest your index finger on the trigger face and bend your arm 90 degrees. Make sure the firearm is still unloaded before beginning. Hold the gun with the hand you generally shoot with. Extend your arm first, then, with your index finger resting on the trigger face, bend your elbow 90 degrees."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ensure the butt plate is nestled in your elbow.",
      "content": "Ensure the butt plate is nestled in your elbow. The LOP is too long if you are unable to bend your elbow. If there’s more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between the butt plate and the crook of your elbow, the LOP is too short."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoulder the firearm as though you are about to shoot it.",
      "content": "Shoulder the firearm as though you are about to shoot it. Though you may take shots from many different angles or positions, choose the one that you use most often. With the gun still unloaded, set up as you normally would to take a shot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the distance from the thumb of your firing hand to your nose.",
      "content": "Check the distance from the thumb of your firing hand to your nose. The firing hand should be holding the wrist of the stock. Generally, the thumb of the firing hand should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from your nose. The LOP is too long if the distance is greater, and too short if the distance is less than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shorten the LOP by removing the recoil pad.",
      "content": "Shorten the LOP by removing the recoil pad. If the LOP is too long for you, you can remove the recoil pad for a quick fix. However, this means your shoulder will absorb more of the impact when you fire the weapon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lengthen the LOP by adding spacers or a thicker recoil pad.",
      "content": "Lengthen the LOP by adding spacers or a thicker recoil pad. If the LOP is too short for you, you can easily replace the recoil pad with a thicker one. Or, you can add spacers between the stock and the buttplate or recoil pad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get the stock trimmed or replaced by a gunsmith.",
      "content": "Get the stock trimmed or replaced by a gunsmith. For best results, take the rifle to a local gunsmith and ask them to trim the stock to the correct size or replace the stock with a longer one, depending on the intended LOP. They’ll take into account the space to add a new butt plate or recoil pad, too."
