      "content": "If someone’s “green-eyed,” they’re full of envy. Have you ever heard of the green-eyed monster? Well, this monster is an allegory for jealousy and is often used to warn children about the dangers of acting on jealous feelings. The term “green-eyed” embodies this notion, meaning to act jealous, envious, or distrustful. So, if a friend says they’re “green-eyed,” they’re jealous. [1] X Research source For example, you may hear someone say, “He’s becoming a green-eyed monster” when referring to someone acting on jealousy. William Shakespeare became the first to associate green eyes with jealousy in The Merchant of Venice : “And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!” However, the phrase was first coined later in Othello : “O beware, my lord, of jealousy; It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.”"

      "content": "Green eyes symbolize jealousy. After Shakespeare compared jealous feelings with a “green-eyed monster,” the color green has been associated with envy. Green eyes are often used in literature to represent or foreshadow jealousy within a character. This symbol likely originated from the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. In the tale, Cupid is overcome with jealousy and turns into a monster with green eyes. [2] X Research source In modern pop culture, Disney’s Rapunzel and J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter both have green eyes. These characters may not outwardly present envious feelings, but they long for something outside their tower and cupboard under the stairs. Subconsciously, they’re envious of a life they don’t have."
