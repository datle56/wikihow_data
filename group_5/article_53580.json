A European-inspired dragon tattoo may, therefore, be a symbol of overcoming challenges."

      "content": "Use your personal preferences to choose a tattoo location. Since tattoos are permanent, it’s important to choose a location that you like. Dragon tattoos can be placed anywhere on the body, though many people choose larger areas since the designs tend to be intricate. In some cases, the location carries additional meaning, but it’s up to you whether you interpret it this way or not. Here are some common places to get a dragon tattoo: [11] X Research source Back: Back tattoos sometimes symbolize strength and dominance, and dragon back tattoos are a great way to make a bold statement. The back is an ideal location for large, intricate designs. Chest: Chest tattoos can symbolize courage and protection. They can also serve as a constant reminder of inner strength and resilience. Like back tattoos, the chest is a great location for large dragon tattoos. Arm: Because of their visibility, arm tattoos sometimes symbolize pride and confidence. The arm is a great location for a smaller dragon tattoo or a larger, more intricate design that wraps around like a sleeve . Leg: Dragon tattoos on the leg can represent freedom and adventure. These function the same way as arm tattoos, though they can be more easily hidden . It’s also possible to extend the design down to the foot or ankle. Hand: Getting a dragon tattoo on your hand can represent strength, freedom, and wisdom. Since hand tattoos cannot easily be hidden, this is a bold statement that shows you’re steadfast in your decisions and beliefs."
