This is also known as your metabolic rate or metabolism. Your body burns calories just to fulfill life-sustaining processes like breathing, digesting food, repairing and growing tissue and circulating blood. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You will use the results from the BMR equation to find out how many calories you need to either lose weight or maintain your weight. Use the following equation (known as the Harris Benedict Equation) that is commonly used by health professionals to determine calorie needs. for men: 66.47 + (13.7 * weight [kg]) + (5 * size [cm]) − (6.8 * age [years]) [2] X Research source Use the following equation for women: 655.1 + (9.6 * weight [kg]) + (1.8 * size [cm]) − (4.7 * age [years]) [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Account for your activity level. In addition to essential bodily functions, you must also account for the calories you burn through daily activity. [4] X Research source Once you have your BMR, multiply your BMR by the appropriate activity factor: If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : BMR x 1.2 If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports one to three days/week) : BMR x 1.375 If you are moderately active (moderate exercise/sports three to five days/week) : BMR x 1.55 If you are very active (hard exercise/sports six to seven days a week) : BMR x 1.725 If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports and physical job or 2x training) : BMR x 1.9 For example, a 19-year-old woman who is 5’5” and 130 pounds would plug her information into the calculator and find out that her BMR is 1,366.8 calories. Then, since she is moderately active, exercising three to five days per week, she would multiply 1,366.8 by 1.55, to equal 2,118.5 calories. That is the number of calories that her body burns on an average day."

Only aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds per week. If you were to lose weight through diet alone, you'd need a 500-calorie deficit every day to lose one pound in a week. If you were really pushing it and wanted to lose 2 pounds in a week, you'd need a 1,000-calorie deficit every day.

      "content": "Keep track of how many calories you currently eat each day. When you first start your attempt to lose weight, it may be helpful to keep track of how many calories you're currently eating. Keep a food journal or use an online calculator to help you get an estimate of how much you currently consume. Compare this amount to your calculated and activity-adjusted BMR. If the numbers aren't even remotely close, it may be easier to start your diet by consuming your calculated amount of calories daily. Consuming a significant amount of calories less than you're typical day might be difficult. Decrease slowly by first adjusting your diet to line up with your activity-adjusted BMR level."

When your body doesn't take in enough calories each day to sustain basic functions, it starts burning muscle for energy.

Studies show that those who journal their foods regularly stick to their diet plans longer and lose more weight. [9] X Research source Search online for free apps or websites that allow you to enter what you ate — some will even calculate the calories for you. Try MyFitnessPal or Super Tracker by the USDA. You can also log your activity level and the amount of exercise you get each day. Seeing the actual amount of calories you consume each day will force you to take responsibility for your health and cut back on eating. Be vigilant about logging everything that goes into your mouth, and you'll find it's easier to stick to your diet."

Try to get on the scale at the same time of day (try for first thing in the morning after you've just emptied your bladder) while you're wearing the same clothes for the most accurate record of progress. If you're not losing weight, reevaluate your total calorie intake. You may need to cut out more calories or be more accurate with your food journaling."
