      "content": "Prepare for your fight with the Hellkite Wyvern by purchasing the items required from the male undead merchant in Undeadsberg. The trader can be found near the bonfire in Undeadsberg, underneath the two spear Hollows and sniper, before you reach the area with the firebombing Hollows. Break the boxes after defeating the spearman and go down the stairs. In this room, you will see a bookcase to your right. Be careful, as there is an ax-wielding undead behind it. In the doorway right in front of the stairs, you exit and there you find the merchant on the balcony. If you don't have one already, you will need to buy a bow from the trader for 600 souls and a few arrows, ranging from 3 souls each to 50 souls each."

After you pass through the tower the Taurus Demon jumped off, you'll find yourself at an area with the knight Solaire of Astoria to the left and the large empty bridge ahead to the right, with a few Hollows on it."

If you begin to walk onto the bridge, after a while you will trigger the appearance of the wyvern, who will roar and immediately burn you to a crisp (along with the Hollows on the bridge). Try running back to the beginning of the bridge to avoid dying, although if you're not quick enough, this will probably be inevitable."

      "content": "Sprint halfway up the bridge. This will trigger the Hellkite Wyvern to begin breathing fire upon the bridge, but you will notice there is a flight of stairs to the right of you leading down from the bridge. If you are fast enough you should reach this area before the wyvern's fire kills you."

Congratulations!"
