      "content": "Unscrew the existing head from the shower arm. Hold a cloth around the base of the shower arm with one hand. Use an adjustable wrench or a pair of pliers to unscrew the head from the arm over the cloth. Twist the head counterclockwise until it comes off the arm. [1] X Research source The cloth ensures that the finish on your fixtures won’t get scratched or damaged by your tool. If you don’t have one readily available, wrap Teflon tape around the plier’s jaws. Ensure the shower arm stays still while removing the shower head so it doesn’t unscrew inside the wall. Make sure the water is turned completely off before replacing the shower head. However, because this is a simple repair, there’s no need to turn off the water to the house."

      "content": "Wrap the threads of the shower arm clockwise with Teflon tape. Apply Teflon tape around the threads of the shower arm 2 to 3 times, wrapping the tape tightly in a clockwise direction. That way, when you screw on the new showerhead in the same direction, the Teflon tape doesn’t come undone. [4] X Research source When you’re done, pull gently on the tape to break it off. [5] X Research source Press the tape into the grooves of the threads as you wrap. Try not to wrap too high up on the arm above the threads so the Teflon tape won’t show after you screw on the shower head."

Wrap the base of the shower head and the shower arm with a cloth. Hold the shower arm in place, clamp onto the cloth with a pair of pliers, and turn the shower head clockwise as far as it will go. [6] X Research source If you’re just changing the Teflon tape to fix a leaky showerhead , simply screw on your old shower head. When tightening the shower head, be careful not to over tighten it."

If it isn’t, simply screw the mount onto the arm until it’s finger-tight. If the instructions recommend Teflon tape, wrap it around the threads at the end of the arm in a clockwise direction 2 or 3 times. [8] X Research source The instructions will also tell you which end of the hose inserts into the mount and which end goes into the head."

If they are, tighten the connections with your hands or place a rag on top of the nut and tighten it with a pair of pliers. [11] X Research source Try not to tighten the connections too much, or the shower components may crack.

[12] X Research source Place a cloth over the connection and tighten the diverter with pliers. When you’re finished tightening the diverter, make sure the clip that holds the shower head faces to the side. Some shower heads come with a small cover to screw onto the arm before attaching the diverter. This covers and protects the Teflon tape and the connection."

[13] X Research source There’s no need to tighten the connections with a pair of pliers—hand-tightening can do the job without the risk of cracking your shower head’s components.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Most types of heads can simply be replaced with each other, however, it’s best to consult the instructions to make sure this is the case before you buy a new one. The main types of shower heads include: Fixed shower heads : These cannot be removed from the wall like a hand-held shower head. They usually screw directly onto the arm pipe that sticks out of the wall. Handheld shower heads : These have a mount that attaches to the shower arm and holds a removable shower head, which can be useful for bathing kids or pets. Combination or dual shower heads : These have a fixed and a hand-held shower head that both attach to the arm using a diverter. Some allow you to use both at once. Rain shower heads : Rain heads have an additional horizontal spout that screws onto the shower arm and the shower head. [19] X Research source However, ceiling-mount heads may require a plumber to install. [20] X Research source Sliding bar shower heads : The heads on these shower systems move up and down along a wall-mounted base, which is great for family members of different heights. [21] X Research source However, having a professional install this kind of shower may be best."

[22] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source If everyone in the U.S. installed WaterSense shower heads, it would save about $1.5 billion in water utility bills and 250,000,000,000 US gal (9.5 × 10 11 L) of water each year. [23] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source There are 2 basic types of WaterSense heads: aerating and laminar flow. Aerating shower heads form a misty spray, while laminar-flow heads create individual streams of water.
