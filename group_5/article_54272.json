Since it’s just a straight line, it’s the change in y divided by the change in x. [1] X Research source If you’re given the interval [x 1 , x 2 ], plug each value into your equation to get y 1 and y 2 . For example, if you had the function f(x) = x 2 + 3x and the interval [1, 3], then f(1) = 1 2 + 3 * 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 and f(3) = 3 2 + 3 * 3 = 9 + 9 = 18. So your x values are 1 and 3 and your y values are 4 and 18. The variable y is also referred to as f(x) since it’s the value you get when you plug an x value into the function."

To get your numerator, subtract y 1 from y 2 (AKA f(x 1 ) from f(x 2 )). Then find your denominator by subtracting x 1 from x 2 . [2] X Research source For the function f(x) = x 2 + 3x over the interval [1, 3], the fraction would look like 18 − 4 3 − 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {18-4}{3-1}}} = 14 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {14}{2}}} ."

To find the x value of a point on a graph, draw a straight line from the point to the x-axis—you will either have to draw straight up or straight down. Where your line intersects the axis is your value. Find y by drawing a straight line to the y-axis, either to the left or right of the point. [4] X Research source If your y value is negative, draw straight up for x. If it’s positive, draw straight down. If the x value is negative, draw right for y, and if it’s positive draw left."

You can choose either, but usually, people put the leftmost coordinates first (lowest value of x). [5] X Research source So if you had the points (1, 3) and (5, 10), 1 would be x 1 and 3 would be y 1 . If you put the right coordinates first your numerator and denominator will switch from positive to negative, or from negative to positive. However, the equation gives you the same answer either way."

If you find yourself in that situation, do the same thing, but look for the given values in the y column, instead."

If the rate of change of a stock’s price is rising, for example, it means the value will go up in the short term, and if it goes down the value may decline. [13] X Research source Financial professionals also compare the rate of change of different variables to try and predict what will happen to the price of a stock. For example, if the price of a stock is rising while the rate of change is lowering, that can signal that the price is about to trend down. [14] X Research source"
