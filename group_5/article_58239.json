Prepare any practicalities such as a fire pit, etc. Appropriate any major props such as firewood, lanterns or an altar."

You can also do this by eating and drinking something, hugging a friend, patting yourself all over your body or visualizing roots growing into the ground to steady you. Both solitary and group workings benefit from the sharing of wine and cake for grounding and blessing at this point. Pass wine and then cake or bread clockwise, being blessed and blessing the next person in turn. When everyone feels settled, discussion and expression is a great idea."
