      "content": "A smear campaign is a manipulation tactic to tarnish a person’s reputation. If a narcissist is upset or feeling insecure, like at the end of a relationship, they may try to humiliate the person that made them feel that way. During a smear campaign, a narcissist may speak of you poorly or spread rumors to turn others against you and make themselves feel superior. A narcissist may also try using a smear campaign to distract others from their own behavior. [1] X Research source Narcissistic smear campaigns can happen in any type of relationship or setting. A narcissistic family member may talk poorly about you to hide their own dysfunction at home, while a narcissistic coworker may talk to your boss about you behind your back if they feel like you’re competition."

      "content": "They spread rumors or false accusations about you. During a smear campaign, a narcissist will exaggerate the truth about your interactions to make it seem like you were causing issues. They may also tell blatant lies about you as a way to gain control over the situation. Narcissists may tell these lies in person or spread them over social media. [2] X Research source A narcissistic ex may accuse you of cheating on them to make it seem like you’re the reason for the breakup. An old boss running a narcissistic smear campaign may spread a rumor about your poor work performance to prevent you from getting another position."

      "title": "They persistently bad-mouth you.",
      "content": "They persistently bad-mouth you. When a narcissist has their sights set on you for their smear campaign, it’ll be their main focus during a conversation even if other people disagree. If they’re given the opportunity, they’ll continue attacking what makes you feel the most vulnerable or telling stories about all the “bad things” you’ve done to them. They may also play the victim so it seems like you’re the person causing problems. [3] X Research source If you made a narcissistic friend feel ashamed, they may go on a smear campaign and may share secrets you told them in confidence. Narcissists may say something like, “I don’t want to cause any trouble, but I’m really concerned about John’s anger issues toward me.” Even though it may sound like a concern, it still may change how the person hearing it views you."

      "title": "They try turning other people against you.",
      "content": "They try turning other people against you. A narcissist that feels threatened by you will try damaging your reputation behind your back by reaching out to your friends, family, coworkers, or anyone in your social circle. They’ll tell lies or bad-talk you to draw attention to themselves and make other people side with them. [4] X Research source A narcissistic partner may tell your friends that you don’t actually like them so you spend less time with them. A narcissistic coworker may lie about your boss so they overlook you for a promotion that they also want."

      "title": "They project their behaviors onto you.",
      "content": "They project their behaviors onto you. Even if you call a narcissist out on their behavior, they may try turning it around on you and play the victim instead. They may shift the blame and say that you’re the one that’s making things up or gaslighting others to believe your side of the story. The narcissist is either afraid of being caught in a lie or having someone see through their facade, so they’ll redirect the attention on your behaviors instead. [5] X Research source A narcissistic partner may say that you’re the one causing a relationship issue if you’re bringing up a behavior you want them to change. If a narcissistic parent doesn’t reach out to you, they may say that they’re still caring and that you’re the problem for not contacting them on your own."

      "title": "Avoid engaging in the conversation.",
      "content": "Avoid engaging in the conversation. Rather than letting a narcissist push your buttons, do your best to ignore what they’re saying and move on. If you can, try to go no contact with a narcissist so you limit any conversations with them. If you do have to talk with them, establish your boundaries for what you’re comfortable talking about and what topics you want to avoid. [6] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source You may say, “It hurts when you spread rumors like that, and I will not engage in the conversation if this is what we’re discussing right now.” Common narcissistic responses to no contact may include ignoring the boundaries you set, getting angry, or trying to convince you that they’ve changed. Stay strong and continue maintaining your boundary and the narcissist will move on when they realize they don’t have control over you anymore."

If you lash out or get upset by what a narcissist says during a smear campaign, it may make you seem like you’re overly emotional and make the narcissist’s claims more believable. When you do have to talk on the subject, use the grey rock method by maintaining a neutral expression and a calm demeanor to show that you’re not bothered. Move on to the next subject to help redirect your attention. [7] X Research source If someone says something that makes you upset, just say something simple like, “Mmhmm. I’d like to talk about something else.”"

Rather than getting upset or defensive when you hear a narcissist’s smear campaign, pick your battles with what to address and what not to. While you may want to defend yourself on bold claims that affect your livelihood, let comments go about things that are difficult to disprove. [8] X Research source The narcissist is only trying to get control over your emotions and trying to disprove them may make it seem like you’re acting unstable. [9] X Research source Even if you’re not in the wrong, avoid feeling the need to try proving it to everybody. People who are close to the narcissist may not shift their perspective regardless of the evidence."

Take a moment to calm down so you can keep pressing forward. Then, check in with your emotions and refocus on what makes you feel good and positive when you’re riled up by the smear campaign. When people see you acting yourself and not how the narcissist described you, they’ll recognize the lies they were told.

Rather than trying to go through a narcissistic smear campaign on your own, contact the friends and family that are still on your side. Try to spend more time with them and let them know how they can show their support. Be open about what’s happening and how you’re feeling because your loved ones may offer helpful advice on how they’ve handled similar situations. Consider seeing a therapist or finding a narcissistic abuse support group in your area. They may be able to give you more targeted advice for recovering from a narcissist. If people you know are taking the narcissist’s side during the smear campaign, avoid putting your energy into seeing them. They may believe the narcissist even if you spend time trying to convince them. It may hurt to lose some friends, but it’s better to be around people who believe and support you."
