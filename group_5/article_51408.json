Each corn kernel is an electron , and the stream of kernels flowing into the bowl is the current. [1] X Research source Serway, R.A. and John W. Jewett, Jr., Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics. 8th edition. California: Brooks/Cole. 2010. Ebook When talking about the flow, you describe it by saying how many kernels are flowing each second. When talking about a current, you measure it in amperes ( amps ), or a certain (very large) number of electrons flowing per second."

      "content": "Think about electrical charge. Electrons have a \"negative\" electrical charge. This means they attract (or flow toward) objects with a positive charge, and repel (or flow away from) objects with a negative charge. Since they're all negative, electrons are always trying to push away from other electrons, spreading out wherever they can. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand voltage.",
      "content": "Understand voltage. Voltage measures the difference in electrical charge between two points. [3] X Research source The greater the difference, the more energetically the two sides attract each other. Here's an example with an everyday battery: Inside a battery, chemical reactions happen that produces a buildup of electrons. The electrons go to the negative end, while the positive end stays mostly empty. (These are called the negative and positive terminals.) The longer this goes on, the larger the voltage between the two ends. When you connect a wire between the negative and positive ends, the electrons at the negative end suddenly have somewhere to go. They shoot toward the positive end, creating a current. The larger the voltage, the more electrons move to the positive end each second."

      "title": "Figure out resistance.",
      "content": "Figure out resistance. Resistance is exactly what it sounds like. The more resistance something has, the harder it is for the electrons to push through. This slows the current, since fewer electrons can push through each second. [4] X Research source A resistor is anything in the circuit that adds resistance. You can buy an actual \"resistor\" at an electronics store, but in a circuits problem it might represent a light bulb or anything else with resistance."

[5] X Research source Write this down or memorize it; you'll use it often when solving circuit problems: Current = voltage divided by resistance This is usually written: I = V / R Think about what happens when you increase V (voltage) or R (resistance). Does this match what you learned in the explanations above?"

      "content": "Understand a series circuit. A series circuit is easy to identify. It's just one loop of wire, with everything arranged in a row. The current flows around the entire loop, going through each resistor or element in order. The current is always the same at any point along the circuit. [6] X Research source When calculating voltage, it doesn't matter where the resistor is on the circuit. You can pick up the resistors and move them around, and you'll still have the same voltage across each one. We'll use an example circuit with three resistors in series: R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 . This is powered by a 12 volt battery. We'll find the voltage across each one."

Once we calculate the current this way, we can use it for all our calculations. [7] X Research source Ohm's Law says that the current I = V / R . The voltage across the whole circuit is 12 volts, and the total resistance is 10 ohms. The answer is I = 12 / 10 = 1.2 amperes ."

Add up every voltage you calculated and see if you get the voltage of the entire circuit. [10] X Research source If you didn't, go back and check for mistakes. In our example, 2.4 + 3.6 + 6.0 = 12 volts, the voltage across the whole circuit. If your answer is slightly off (for instance, 11.97 instead of 12), you probably rounded a number at some point. Your answer is still correct. Remember, voltage measures the differences in charge, or numbers of electrons. Imagine counting the number of new electrons you see as you travel along the circuit. If you count them correctly, you're going to end up with the total change in electrons from the beginning to the end."

These two wires run parallel to each other, then join up again before they reach the other end of the battery. If there's a resistor on the left wire and a resistor on the right wire, those two resistors are connected \"in parallel.\" [11] X Research source You can have any number of wires in a parallel circuit. These instructions will still work for a circuit that splits into one hundred wires and comes back together."

Current will flow through the wire on the left, cross the left resistor, and reach the other end. At the same time, current will flow through the wire on the right, cross the right resistor, and reach the end. No part of the current doubles back or flows through two parallel resistors."

Each parallel wire has the same voltage as the entire circuit. [12] X Research source Let's say a circuit with two parallel resistors is powered by a 6 volt battery. The voltage across the left resistor is 6 volts, and the voltage across the right resistor is 6 volts. It doesn't even matter how much resistance there is. To understand why, think back to the series circuits described above: Remember that adding voltage drops in a series circuit always results in the total voltage across the circuit. Think of each path the current takes as a series circuit. The same holds true for this: if you count up all the voltage drops, you'll end up with the total voltage. Since the current through each of the two wires only passes through one resistor, the voltage across that resistor must equal the total voltage."

      "content": "Compute the total resistance of the circuit. Resistors are not as effective in a parallel circuit, because they only block the current going along one wire. In fact, the more wires there are, the easier it is for the current to find a way through. To find the total resistance, solve for R total in this equation: [15] X Research source 1 / R total = 1 / R 1 + 1 / R 2 + 1 / R 3 ... For example, a circuit has a 2 ohm and a 4 ohm resistor in parallel. 1 / R total = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 → 1 = (3/4)R total → R total = 1/(3/4) = 4/3 = ~1.33 ohms."

According to Ohm's Law, I = V / R, therefore V = IR V = (5A)(1.33Ω) = 6.65 volts."
