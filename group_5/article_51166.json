Villagers need to be in close proximity in order to breed. It will also protect them from hostile mobs and raiders. The structure can be made out of any building material. It needs to be big enough to house all the villagers you want to breed as well as beds for each villager and the offspring they produce. Make sure any windows are covered with glass or iron bars. Baby villagers can escape through open gaps in structures. The roof needs to be at least two block spaces above each bed in order for the villagers to be able to use them. Don't build a door to your structure. Villagers can open and close doors. To prevent them from escaping, use a fence gate instead. [1] X Research source Make sure the area you keep your villagers is larger enough for them to get around. Your area should have at least 3 square blocks of empty space for each villager you want to breed. Villager occupations are now determined by any available workstation block nearby (such as a fletching table , or composter). Any new villagers will automatically be registered to any available workstation in the village and assigned an occupation based on that workstation. If you have a specific occupation you want your new villagers to fill, you may want to build the structure at least 48 blocks away from any nearby workstations to keep them from registering an occupation automatically. Baby villagers will be assigned a nearby workstation when they become adults. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source"

In order for villagers to breed, they need either 3 loaves of bread, 12 carrots, 12 beetroot, or 12 potatoes in their inventory. The good news is, you won't need to go far to find these items because they can all be found inside the village. Carrots : Carrots are grown by farmer villagers inside the village. You can harvest them from the village gardens once they are fully matured. Carrots are fully matured when the green leaves at the top are at their fullest and a tip of the orange carrot is sticking out of the ground where they are planted. Potatoes: Potatoes are also grown by farmer villagers Potatoes can be harvested from village gardens. Potatoes are fully matured when there is a full stalk of leaves growing out of the ground where the potatoes are planted. However, sometimes you get a poisonous potato, which isn't useful for anything. Beetroot: Beetroot is also grown by farmer villagers. However, unlike potatoes and carrots, you cannot plant the beetroot itself to grow more beetroot. You need to plant beetroot seeds in order to grow beetroot, which takes up more space in your inventory. Beetroot and beetroot seeds can be harvested from village gardens. Beetroot is fully mature when you can see the leaves and red of beetroot sticking out of the ground where they are planted. Bread: You can purchase bread from villagers or craft it using three bushels of wheat and a crafting table. Sometimes, you can also find bread in chests in villages. Wheat is grown by farmer villagers in village gardens. Wheat is fully matured when it grows tall and turns slightly brown. Break fully matured wheat to obtain bushels of wheat."
