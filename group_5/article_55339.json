      "content": "Grabovoi codes are a manifestation tool based on electromagnetic fields. Self-proclaimed Russian psychic Grigori Grabovoi invented the codes in 1999 as an expansion of the theory of radionics. Grabovoi claims that the codes can alter a person's electromagnetic field and therefore impact their health, wellness, wealth, and more. The idea is that you can manifest your desires, or make your dreams a reality , by saying the codes out loud while concentrating on what you want. Radionics, founded by Albert Abrams, is a medical treatment that uses radio frequencies to \"cure\" illnesses by manipulating electromagnetic fields (EMFs). [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Abrams and Grabovoi believed that all things have an EMF and are connected through the earth’s electromagnetic field. According to them, illnesses are the result of a distorted EMF, and by playing a frequency (or saying a code), they can be cured. [2] X Research source"

There's no harm in trying to use them, and many people think they work. However, while the manipulation of EMFs is gaining popularity for treating pain, Abrams was widely criticized, and radionics is considered pseudoscience. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Grabovoi’s practices have also been questioned. It’s unclear if his credentials are real or not (he claims to have several PhDs), and in 2008, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for defrauding the parents of victims of a school shooting. [4] X Research source He falsely claimed that he could resurrect their children for $1,200 apiece."
