      "content": "Use a pry bar to loosen the trim from the wall. Start at an outside corner where it’s easier to loosen a joint. Gently slip the pry bar between the wall and the baseboard and gently pull the trim away. If the pry bar doesn’t fit, use another object, like a flat-head screwdriver or a stack of wood shims, and shimmy it between the trim to create more space. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull the trim and remove any debris. As you pull the trim away, the old nails should come with it. Use the back head of a hammer to pull up any nails and discard them. Remove any glue or caulking that may obstruct the new baseboard installation using a 150-grit sandpaper or the scraper end of a pry bar. [3] X Research source You may be able to reuse nails if they’re still in good condition."

      "title": "Measure the perimeter of each wall.",
      "content": "Measure the perimeter of each wall. Use a tape measure to determine the dimensions of each straight wall, rounding up by 10%. It’s important to give yourself leeway and cut slightly more than is necessary to fit a tight baseboard. Calculate the linear footage of a room by measuring length x width. Once you have these measurements, multiply each number by 2 and add them together. [4] X Research source An example of a 9’ x 11’ room would be: (9 x 2) + (11 x 2) = 58 linear feet. Add 10% to account for overages by multiplying your total linear feet by 0.1. For example, 58’ x 0.1 = 5.8. So, you would need an extra 5.8 (or round up to 6) feet. Remember, it's always possible to cut off but not always possible to add back on."

      "content": "Select and purchase your materials. The most common baseboard materials are pine, hardwood, or vinyl, which can be purchased online or through a local hardwood supplier or store. Acclimate your baseboards to their new environment a week before installation. In dry climates, baseboards shrink, while in wet climates they expand. [5] X Research source You only need a baseboard for a basic installation. However, additional components may be needed depending on the type of project. Moving from top to bottom, they include: The cap molding, optional. These moldings fit on top of the baseboards, adding a detailed and ornamental flourish. They are typically only needed if you have wainscot paneling. The baseboard . Usually at least 3.5–6 inches (8.9–15.2 cm) high, they are predominantly flat and form the bulk of the baseboard. The shoe molding, optional. Another ornamental detail at the bottom, between the baseboard and the floor, completes the look. Shoe molding is typically used when retrofitting or putting down new flooring."

      "content": "Use a level beam to ensure the ground is leveled. Take a 4-foot level beam and place it on the ground. To read a level, look for the air bubble in the green vial and center it between the two-level indication line marks. If the floor isn’t leveled, scribe the baseboards. Scribing uses a compass fitted with a sharp pencil to easily transfer odd shapes and profiles to a baseboard. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Scribe the baseboards with a pencil if your floors aren’t leveled. Whether leveling the ground or putting in shoe molding, scribing is necessary to ensure the top of the baseboard is even. Tack a piece of baseboard to an inside corner with one or two nails or shims leveling it. Then, scribe the unleveled ground or corner to the wall using a compass to measure the distance. [7] X Research source Keeping your compass spread rigid, hold the point-side of the compass on the floor and the pencil-side on the baseboard. Move the pencil across the entire distance of the baseboard to trace an outline. Use a table saw or a jigsaw to cut along the scribed line on the baseboard. Set a slight (2° - 5°) bevel on the cut if you have a circular saw. This will make scribe-fitting much easier in the end. [8] X Research source With a block plane, plane down the beveled edge of the baseboard. Then, dry-fit the baseboard back onto the floor and ensure it lines up evenly. Use a level to test."

Using a power miter saw cut each piece at a the correct angle—usually, 45º. Match the ends of two corners to form an outside corner. When in doubt, make the cuts a little longer than you need and shorten them when necessary. [9] X Research source"

Cut a traditional coped joint by setting the blade at a 45° angle on the baseboard you want to cope. Use a coping saw to cut back the angled profile made by your initial cut. Leave the paint line intact, but clear away the wood “behind” the paint line. Go slowly to follow the profile accurately. [10] X Research source The other end of the baseboard won't need to be cut at all; the coped joint will simply cover up the remaining piece of baseboard. Sand away any excess rough patches or debris to smooth out the coped seam."

      "content": "Use scrap material for trial-and-error fitting. In a perfect world, every room you work in has perfectly square walls. However, that’s rarely the case. Use scrap material to find the correct angle cut for odd-corner pieces so you don’t ruin perfectly good material. Use scrap material to test out scribing, as it can be tedious. Similar baseboard issues include: Mid-wall pieces. If you have very long walls, you’ll need to use more than one piece of baseboard. Cut both pieces at overlapping 45° angles to fit them together like so //. This will help eventually make wood shrinkage less visible. End pieces. If the baseboard butts into a door casing, simply cut it and scoot it up against the object."

Power the device on and slowly slide the stud finder to the right until you’re alerted via a beep or flashing light where a stud is located. Use a nail gun to sink two nails into every stud at a downward angle into the baseboard. [12] X Research source Afterward, fill all the nail holes with putty, allow it to dry, and sand with 120-grit sandpaper again. On outside corners, apply a thin bead of wood glue or adhesive to mitered edges to ensure a better bond. For inside corners, the adhesive is unnecessary if you’ve properly coped your baseboards."

Then, nail each piece of shoe molding, ensuring the nails go into the baseboard, not the floor. Use brad nails that have soft rubber tips to avoid damaging the floor or boards. [13] X Research source For cap molding, use a nail set to insert the nail heads just below the surface. Use spackle to cover up all the nail holes, sand the surface down, and prime them."
