To use the Sandwich Approach, as Rosenberg describes it, “start with a positive, ask for what you want or need, and then end with a positive.” “For example,” Rosenberg continues, “you can say ‘I’m really looking forward to hanging out with you and, at the same time, I can no longer make it at this time. Can we please schedule another time to get together? Thanks for understanding.’”​​"

      "content": "A guilty pleasure is something you enjoy despite feeling slightly shameful. Guilty pleasures can be certain activities, foods, habits, movies, TV programs, songs, etc. The minor shame or embarrassment around these enjoyable things usually comes from a belief that you’ll be judged for it, that it’s bad for you, or that it’s a purposeless endeavor. [25] X Research source You can identify a guilty pleasure if there’s something in your life that brings you joy but that you feel embarrassed to share with others. It’s important to remember that guilty pleasures are a completely healthy and normal part of life. They can make living feel more enjoyable, especially during stressful periods of your life. Research shows that guilty pleasures can even be good for your brain function. [26] X Research source Guilty pleasures allow your brain to rest and bring you more happiness, which can, in turn, make you more productive.

      "content": "Unlike destructive habits, guilty pleasures shouldn’t harm yourself or others. Guilty pleasures should be used in moderation to balance out the more stressful or difficult parts of life, and they should never be so awful or so consuming as to ruin someone’s life. After you’ve enjoyed your so-called “guilty pleasure,” reflect on how the activity made you feel. Do you feel more inspired, happy, and motivated to be productive? Or do you feel drained, lazy, and unproductive? [28] X Research source If you don’t feel like your guilty pleasures benefit you, consider adjusting how much time you spend on this activity or swap it out with a different one. If you use your guilty pleasures to cope with stress, procrastinate, or avoid responsibilities to a damaging degree, they may be more harmful than you think. For example, harmful habits disguised as guilty pleasures may look like eating an entire cake after a stressful Monday on more than one occasion or obsessively exercising every day (even when you’re ill). These types of habits may point to addictive or disordered behaviors that should be addressed through counseling. Boswell advises that “sleuthing out your pattern will help you know proactively when you are at risk of doing something self-destructive. Because addictive behavior is often a way to avoid the intense pain of isolation and loneliness, support groups are a great way to find help.”"

      "content": "We feel guilty about pleasurable activities we perceive as silly or unproductive. “Perpetual guilt often has its seeds in childhood,” asserts Boswell, so much of our shame around “guilty” pleasures comes from cultural or societal ideals ingrained during our youth. In general, the main psychological reasons why we feel guilty about pleasure include: [29] X Research source Productivity & hustle culture: A societal pressure to always be productive or be achieving more can lead to guilty feelings during leisure time. [30] X Research source Religious and cultural beliefs: The beliefs taught to you as a child may make you feel that certain activities are frivolous, pointless, or even immoral. Fear of judgment: Worrying about what other people will think about our sources of joy can lead to guilty or shameful feelings. Health and fitness expectations: The cultural focus on fitness and body image can create guilt around skipping a workout or eating supposedly “bad” foods. The myth of self-improvement: The societal idea that we constantly need to be bettering ourselves can make time for relaxation feel like a waste of time (it isn’t)."
