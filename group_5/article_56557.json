      "content": "Make sure you're eligible to leave. You may only leave a fantasy football league prior to that season's draft. Once you are fielding a roster, no platform will allow you to leave that team without a manager. On some platforms, including Yahoo! Sports, leagues lock even earlier. Once a commissioner finalizes the team list (which happens prior to the draft) in a Yahoo! Sports Private League, no manager may leave. Public Prize Leagues on Yahoo! Sports lock 72 hours before the league's draft. If you still feel like you need to leave a league after the draft , you will need to work with your commissioner and fellow league members to determine the best path forward."

If you still want to play fantasy football but just want to leave your league over an issue with another league member, try talking to them first! Despite the competitive nature of fantasy, all players want to have fun, and your continued involvement is likely a huge part of that. If you are unsure of your skills as a fantasy player, remember that there are countless resources available to help you draft and manage your team! If you feel that a play was scored incorrectly, consult with your commissioner, or be on the lookout for a stat correction from your chosen fantasy platform. If you disagree with a trade or roster move made by another team, raise the issue in a league-wide chat. Of course, remember that each manager is responsible for their own decisions, and that even real-life NFL teams can make costly or lopsided deals!"

Being able to present this option to your commissioner will likely make them more receptive to the idea, and the ensuing transition much easier. If you are in a workplace league, ask around your office. If you are in a league with friends, ask other friends or league members if they know anyone looking to join a fantasy league. Be transparent about the players on your roster. Being unhappy with your roster is not necessarily a reason to leave a league, especially as you can still improve your team by being active on the waiver wire! Passionate fantasy players may still be willing to take over your team even if they don't love the roster. But remain flexible in explaining the situation to interested parties."
