      "content": "An app can crash, leaving you with a black screen. Apps that aren't updated or optimized for iPhone can crash as soon as you open them, leaving an eerily similar black screen. However, if your screen is currently black, you may be unable to close all your open apps. Fix this by force-closing your open apps. If you're using an iPhone without a Home button or a newer iPhone SE, swipe up from the bottom of your screen, then swipe up on the app that's giving you a black screen. If you have an iPhone with the Home button, double-tap the Home button and swipe up on an app to close it. This is also a fix if your App Store is blank ."

      "content": "Connect your phone to a PC or Mac, then put it into Recovery Mode. With your phone connected to your computer and in Recovery Mode, you'll be able to update it or reset it. First, try updating it. On macOS Catalina or later, use Finder. On macOS Mojave and earlier or a PC, use iTunes. Next, connect your iPhone to your computer using a lightning cable. There are different ways to put your iPhone into Recovery Mode depending on the model: For iPhone 8 or later, including newer iPhone SE (phones without the Home button), press and release the volume up key and the volume down key, then press and hold the side button until you see the Recovery Mode screen. For iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (without a Home button), press and hold the Top or Side button and the volume down button at the same time until you see the Recovery Mode screen. For iPhone 6s or earlier (with a Home button), press and hold both the Home and top or side buttons until you see the Recovery Mode screen. Click Update when you see the prompt on your computer's screen. [2] X Research source If your phone simply restarts instead of entering Recovery Mode, your computer hasn't recognized it. Try another cable or see if your phone will charge before taking it to a Genius Bar."
