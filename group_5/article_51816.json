      "content": "Unhook the two wires just below the bottom sensor. (These two sensors could be your problem (in 50% of the cases, it is). Also, there is a heating fuse to your left, under the larger casing on the left. It is about an inch long, and has two wires attached. This can also be your problem. One screw holds it in. If in doubt, take all these to the appliance store, and they'll test them with a voltmeter.) Test the heating element with a multimeter by setting it to read continuity. Touch the 2 leads of the heating element with the multimeter. If there isn't any continuity, then you need to replace the element."

Examine the coil for breaks. If you have a voltmeter, test the element. Also test the Sensors. This will tell you what's broken."
