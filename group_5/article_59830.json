[6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Another option is to send money using a credit card or prepaid debit card. You don’t need a bank account to use either of these, and the recipient can still pick up the transfer as cash. Using these cards may have higher fees than using cash or a bank account. The retailer Walmart has a service called Walmart-to-Walmart that allows you to send a transfer from one of their store locations or from their online site . You then select whether you’d like the recipient to be able to pick it up at another Walmart, a Western Union agent location, or a Money Gram agent location. [7] X Research source"

Your name and personal information won’t be anywhere on the card so you’re free to load it on another person’s behalf and give it to them to use."

These kinds of gift cards are also known as “open-loop gift cards.” These are network-branded cards that are accepted wherever other cards from that network are. Buy one either at your local grocery store or online. Use either cash or a credit card to make your purchase. [9] X Research source Open-loop gift cards can be used much more freely than a gift card intended only for one specific business, and they act more like prepaid debit cards.

Either meet up with the other person to give them the cash or leave it for them in a secure location to pick up later—such as a locked mailbox or a private office. While sending cash through the mail is an option, it’s not the most secure. [12] X Research source If you want to send cash via the post office, use USPS’s Registered Mail service or a similar service provided by the national mail carrier or postal service in your country. Registered Mail provides delivery status updates, and the recipient is required to sign once they get their package.

Sending cash through Registered Mail can be slow going, so this might not be the best option if you need to get money to someone quickly."
