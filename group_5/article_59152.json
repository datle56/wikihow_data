      "title": "Acetone is the most popular solvent for removing super glue from metal.",
      "content": "Acetone is the most popular solvent for removing super glue from metal. Wipe the glue area clean with a cotton pad and rubbing alcohol, then soak a cotton pad in acetone and hold it to the glue for 5 to 10 minutes. Scrape the glue away with a plastic scraper once the glue loosens up. [1] X Research source Use a razor blade or putty knife if you don’t have a plastic scraper, or nail polish remover in place of pure acetone. Scrape gently to avoid scratching or damaging the metal surface. Repeat the acetone soak until all of the glue is gone. Afterward, use a clean rag and soapy water to wash the metal, then dry."

      "title": "Lighter fluid is stronger than acetone and works on stubborn glue spots.",
      "content": "Lighter fluid is stronger than acetone and works on stubborn glue spots. Put on protective gloves and soak a cotton pad or rag in lighter fluid . Hold the rag to the glue for several minutes until the glue is soft enough to wipe away. Clean the metal with soapy water to remove any lingering lighter fluid. [2] X Research source If needed, repeat the lighter fluid soak or use a plastic scraper to remove large chunks or glue or residue. Ventilate your work area as much as possible to reduce the chance of inhaling lighter fluid fumes."

      "content": "WD-40 is a lubricant that loosens strong adhesives. Wipe the area clean with rubbing alcohol and a rag, then spray the glue generously with WD-40 . Wait about 5 minutes for the WD-40 to dissolve the glue, then wipe the glue away with a rag or scrape residue off with a plastic scraper. [3] X Research source Afterward, clean the metal with soapy water and dry it to remove toxic chemicals and prevent rust. Use WD-40 to remove adhesive from a variety of household objects and materials."

      "title": "Hydrogen peroxide is metal-safe and destroys tough glue.",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide is metal-safe and destroys tough glue. Wipe the metal and dried glue clean, then hold a rag or cotton pad soaked in hydrogen peroxide onto the glue spot until it’s saturated. Wipe the glue away once it’s loose, or use a scraper to remove big chunks and residue. [4] X Research source Repeat the hydrogen peroxide soak if necessary to remove all of the glue. Once the glue is gone, use a rag and soapy water to clean away residue and leftover chemicals. Use hydrogen peroxide for a variety of cleaning tasks around the house."

      "title": "Rubbing alcohol",
      "content": "Rubbing alcohol is great for removing sticky substances like glue. Soak a cotton pad or rag in alcohol and hold it to the glue spot for 5 to 10 minutes. When the glue loosens, use the pad to wipe the glue and residue away. Clean the metal with a fresh cloth and hot water. [5] X Research source Rub the glue in the direction of the metal’s grain (if it has one). Alcohol evaporates quickly, which makes for an easy cleanup."

      "content": "Petroleum jelly contains natural waxes and oils that soften and lift glue. Use your fingers to apply the jelly to the glue spot, rubbing in circular motions to unbind the glue from the metal surface. Wipe the metal clean with soapy water and a rag once the glue is gone, or use a scraper to lift stubborn pieces. [6] X Research source For extra difficult glue spots, use petroleum jelly to loosen the glue before applying a stronger solvent, like acetone or lighter fluid. Use petroleum jelly to remove glue from your skin or hair, too."

      "content": "Vinegar is a natural alternative that’s acidic enough to remove glue. Wipe the area clean and then apply distilled, white vinegar to the glue with a cotton pad. Vinegar works slowly, so let it soak for about an hour. Scrape off the dissolved glue with a plastic scraper. Wash the metal with a clean rag and soapy water after all of the glue is gone."

      "content": "Mix baking soda and coconut oil to make natural glue remover. Combine equal parts baking soda and coconut oil in a bowl (the bigger the glue spot, the more you should use). Then rub the paste over the dried glue and let it sit for 15 minutes. Wipe the glue away or use a scraper to remove it, if needed. [7] X Research source Rinse the metal with clean water afterward and then dry it off to prevent rust."
