      "content": "Load a medium-sized brush with a small amount of paint. Gently dip your brush into the first color of paint you want to use. Start with a small amount -- you can always add more if you need it, but using too much paint will make the feathers clump together."

      "content": "Brush gently across the feather in the direction that the feather grows. Painting in the direction of growth stops the brush from damaging or ruffling the feathers and helps to ensure you evenly coat the surface with paint. Use the paint sparingly, you only need a thin coat. [3] X Research source If you want to change colors, make sure you thoroughly clean your brush before using the next color."

      "title": "Turn the feather over and paint any patches you missed.",
      "content": "Turn the feather over and paint any patches you missed. Wait for the top coat of paint to try before turning the feathers over. This should take about 1 hour. You don't need to paint the entire back-side of the feather, only paint any patches that aren't colored. Try to match the colors so they mirror what is on the top of the feather. Avoid add unnecessary extra paint as this will make the feathers clump together. If the top coat of paint has soaked all the feathers you can skip this step. Let the feathers to dry for another hour before applying any more paint."

      "title": "Choose your colour scheme.",
      "content": "Choose your colour scheme. If you want to use multiple colors try putting the tubes of paint beside each other so you can see if the colors look good together. If the colors on the tubes are darker than what you want, test them out on a spare piece of paper. Adding more water to the paint will make the color lighter. For example, change a deep-blue to a mid-blue by adding a few drops of water. Choosing a mixture of all light colors or all vibrant colors will give the feathers a cohesive look."

Keep adding water until you are satisfied with the color of the paint. For example, turn a dark-green to a mid-green by adding a few drops of water. If you don't have the color of paint that you want, try mixing the colors. Red and white will make pink, blue and yellow will make green and blue and red make purple."

If the colours are too dark or aren't blending well, try adding more water to the paint. Paint each side of the feather in the direction that the feathers grow. This stops the brush from damaging or ruffling the feathers. Wash your brush after you have finished painting with one color. This will stop the colors from mixing on your brush. The water will absorb quickly into the feather so you only need to apply a thin coat of paint."
