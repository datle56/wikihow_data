[2] X Research source You might tell yourself: “I’m feeling sad, and that’s okay.” “I’m allowed to feel angry about this. Everyone feels upset at some point.” “I feel really crushed and heartbroken, and those emotions are valid.”"

      "content": "A self-evaluation can let you know if your hopes are realistic or false. Maybe you’re aiming to be a famous soccer player, or hoping for the person of your dreams to ask you out. Whatever the case, try looking at the situation from an objective perspective. You could be setting yourself up for false hope if your expectations and goals don’t line up with reality. [5] X Research source Here are a few examples of unrealistic expectations: Expecting to get a college-level job as a high school student Expecting to make the varsity team when you’re not as experienced as the other players who tried out Expecting a guy to ask you out when you’ve never talked to him While there's nothing wrong with dreaming big, it's important to know what your expectations are before entering any situation."

      "content": "False hopes and expectations leave us with a feeling of disappointment. Chasing false, unrealistic hope rarely feels good; in fact, you’re almost always feeling disappointed in yourself, or that the efforts you make are never quite enough. Make a list of all your goals and dreams, whether they’re academic, athletic, or something else entirely. Do you feel fulfilled and happy as you try to reach these goals, or do you feel a sense of helplessness? [6] X Research source Take a look at these examples: You want to be a coder, but you’re struggling to pass your computer programming classes even with plenty of studying and tutoring. You want to be a pro wrestler but you’re just not able to bulk up, even when you follow a consistent diet and workout regimen. You want to be at the top of your class even though you feel overwhelmed with challenging courses and assignments. Limiting your expectations can help prevent you from feeling constantly disappointed."

Ask them what they think about the situation, and if they think your false hopes are warranted. Your loved ones can give you some valid insight and help you see the scenario in a new light. [7] X Research source You might ask: “Yale was my number one college choice, and I worked so hard on my application. Was it unrealistic to think that I’d make it in?” “Megan said she’d call me last week, but she never did. I tried texting her a couple of times, but she still didn’t respond. Is it worth waiting for her, or is she just blowing me off?”"

For some, that might mean breaking a larger goal into baby steps; for others, it could mean setting a course for an entirely new goal. Think about which path makes the most sense for you as well as your hopes and dreams. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re a chemistry student who’s struggling to get Cs and Ds in your chemistry classes, you might be better off switching majors. It could be worth switching mediums if you’re an artist who can’t seem to master a specific art form."

That’s where Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Trackable (SMART) goals come in. This goal-setting method helps you focus on what you can accomplish, instead of what you want to accomplish. [9] X Research source Here are few ways you might make your goals SMART: Specific: I’m going to write 1 page of my novel each day. Measurable: I’m going to practice for 30 minutes every day so I’m more prepared for basketball tryouts. Attainable: I’m going to learn 50 new vocab words by the end of the semester. Realistic: I’m going to have a conversation with Kelly by the end of the month. Trackable: I’m going to mark down my exercise and calorie intake in an app so I can keep track of the progress that I’m making."

[10] X Research source Here are a couple of ways to approach your loved ones: You might tell your Mom, “I’ve decided to start learning Korean. I’m studying a little bit each day, and I’m hoping to take the TOPIK test next summer.” You might tell your friend, “I’m hoping to run a 5K next spring, so I’ve decided to start running 3 times a week.”"

A lot of people tend to filter out the positive things that happen to them or assume that the worst is going to happen. Rewriting negative thoughts: Narrow in on your negative thoughts and look for ways to reframe them in a positive way. Instead of thinking “I’ll never reach this goal,” think “This may not be in my wheelhouse, but I’m up for the challenge.”"
