      "content": "The mixie haircut is a mullet-pixie combo. Like the name suggests, the mixie haircut is a fun blend of two very retro and classic styles. The short pixie cut on the top of the head tapers into longer pieces in the back. [1] X Research source Somewhat inspired by the 1970s, the mixie is a bit rebellious, which is why you’ll see celebs like Miley Cyrus, Florence Pugh, and Zendaya rocking the edgy style. The cool thing about the mixie is that virtually anybody can pull it off. Whether your hair is straight, curly, textured, long, or short, you can definitely don a mixie and customize it to your liking. Even if you have very fine hair, the pixie elements come in and add some much-needed volume."

      "content": "Bring in a picture of a mixie for your stylist. Pictures speak a thousand words, so the best thing you can do when asking your hairdresser for a mixie is to provide them with a photo reference. This allows them to see exactly how long or short you’d like your style to be, how much layering and texturizing you want, and how dramatic you want the cut look. If possible, find photos of people with a similar hair texture to your own. The closer the hair type is to your own, the better your results will turn out."

      "content": "Ask for a combination of a mullet and a pixie if your stylist isn't familiar with the cut. If your stylist is up-to-date with all of the latest trends, they should have a pretty good idea of what a mixie is. If not, explain that it’s a combination of a mullet and a pixie, and that you’d like the back to feature the long length of the mullet, while you want the top to be short, texturized, and choppy. When choosing a stylist, keep in mind that those who specialize in edgy, dramatic, trendy haircuts are going to be more familiar with the mixie. While your regular stylist may do a wonderful job with this cut, consider finding someone who isn’t afraid to be bold."

If you have a defined jaw or square face shape, keeping the sides a bit longer around your face can incorporate a bit of added softness. On the other hand, if your face is on the longer side, keeping those sides shorter can draw attention upward and create balance to your features. [2] X Research source"

If you’re someone who likes the defined, funky layers of the mixie, schedule regular trims to make sure the hair doesn’t grow out and lose all of that definition, which might result in a look that’s not so much like the mixie anymore.

With a mixie cut, definition and volume is a main part of the look, so flatness is something you want to avoid. When you use a clarifying shampoo , it goes in to clear out all of that gunky stuff and provide your scalp and hair with a fresh slate. Think of it as a deep cleaning for your hair.

      "content": "Combination haircuts combine two cuts in one. Aside from the mixie, TikTok has shown us that merging two cuts into one really is a thing. If you’re curious about which other haircuts offer two for the price of one, take a look: The Bixie : The bixie is somewhat like a mixie, but instead of a mullet in the back, the ends are cut into a bob (bixie means bob and pixie). Here, the top of the hair is cut into a pixie, while the ends go straight around the head for a classic bob look. [8] X Research source The Wolf Cut : The wolf haircut blends elements of the vintage '70s shag and the '80s mullet to create an entirely new look. It can be worn in a million variations, and you’ll see the wolf cut being rocked in every style from short and grungy, to long and glam. [9] X Research source The Butterfly Haircut : The butterfly haircut is a look that offers short, wispy layers around the chin and longer layers that fall below the shoulders. The goal of combining longer layers with shorter ones is to give your hair a boost of volume, body, and movement—a bit of oomph that we all love to see. [10] X Research source The Lob : Though the lob is nothing new, it still deserves an honorable mention. Combining the words “long” and “bob,” a lob is basically, well, a long bob. [11] X Research source The Octopus Haircut : The octopus haircut is the baby of a shag and a mullet. It has heavy layers on top that eventually blend into long, shaggy, bottom layers. The result? It has the silhouette of an octopus. If aquatic creatures are your vibe, this could totally be the look for you. [12] X Research source"
