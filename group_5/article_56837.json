      "content": "Combine the dry ingredients and vanilla extract. Dump 2 tbsp (25 g) of brown sugar into the mug. Then, add 1 ⁄ 2 tsp (2.5 mL) of vanilla extract followed by 3 tbsp (25 g) of self-rising flour. It’s okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will have a more brownie-like texture."

      "title": "Add 1 egg and 1 tbsp (15 g) of butter or margarine.",
      "content": "Add 1 egg and 1 tbsp (15 g) of butter or margarine. Crack an egg directly into the mug. Then, soften a stick of butter on the countertop and scoop a tablespoon into the mug—you can use salted or unsalted butter, as well as margarine. The great thing about mug cakes is that there is virtually no clean-up; just toss the shell in the compost or trash."

      "title": "Add 2 tbsp (20 g) of chocolate chips, if you’d like.",
      "content": "Add 2 tbsp (20 g) of chocolate chips, if you’d like. Adding the chocolate chips will create a chocolate-flavored mug cake. If you prefer a vanilla cake, add a tiny bit more vanilla extract instead."

    {
      "title": "Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly.",
      "content": "Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly. Use a spoon to stir up the contents of the mug until the chocolate chips are folded in or all the contents are combined. Don’t worry about the top edges of the mug getting messy—your cake will rise in the microwave, anyway."

    {
      "title": "Put the mug in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power.",
      "content": "Put the mug in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power. After 50 seconds, check to see if the cake is baked by sticking a toothpick straight down into the center. The toothpick should come out clean. If there is gooey cake residue on the toothpick, put the mug back in the microwave and cook it in 30-second increments until done. [1] X Research source Try not to overcook the cake. If you microwave it for too long, the cake will dry out. It shouldn't need to be cooked for any longer than 2 minutes. Don’t worry about the toothpick creating a hole in the cake. You won't be able to see that when you frost it later."

      "title": "Let the cake sit for 1-2 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the cake sit for 1-2 minutes. Microwaves often don’t distribute heat as evenly as ovens do. Let the cake sit on the counter for a couple of minutes after baking, allowing time for the heat to distribute throughout the mug."

      "title": "Take a spoon and dig in.",
      "content": "Take a spoon and dig in. If you'd like, frost and decorate the cake first. Be careful when removing the mug from the microwave. Use a pot holder or a towel to lift it out, as it may be too hot to grab. Top your cake with a scoop of ice cream for an even sweeter treat."

Stir the ingredients together with a spoon or rubber spatula. It's okay to use regular flour if you don't have self-rising, but the cake will end up more like a brownie in texture."

      "content": "Mix all of the ingredients together. Stir everything well with a fork or use an electric mixer to mix for about 4-5 minutes (or until the batter is smooth). If you have a food processor, add all of the ingredients to the food processor for about 60 seconds instead."

The toothpick should come out clean. If there is gooey cake residue on the toothpick, put the cake back in the microwave and cook it in 1-minute increments until done. Take care not to overcook it.

      "content": "Frosting Use store bought or make your own frosting. Try chocolate, vanilla, lemon, or any flavor that you like the most. Use a long rubber spatula or spoon to spread frosting over the surface of your cake. Cool the cake fully before trying to put on icing, or the icing will melt. Make sufficient frosting. It’s better to end up with leftover frosting than to run out before you are done decorating."

Substitute the strawberries for fresh mango, banana, or any softer fruit you desire. If you're using fresh fruit, add it at the last minute (especially if you’ve frosted the cake). If the fruit is wet, it could cause the frosting to move or melt slightly. [3] X Research source"
