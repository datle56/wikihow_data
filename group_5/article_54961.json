      "title": "Talk with your doctor about treatment options.",
      "content": "Talk with your doctor about treatment options. There are a variety of different medical options for treating keloids including topical ointments, laser treatment, steroid injections, surgery, etc. Your doctor can help determine which option is best for your. For example, some treatment options only work on newly formed scars and keloids. Other treatments are costly and invasive and may not fully remove the keloid."

      "title": "Use topical retinoid ointments.",
      "content": "Use topical retinoid ointments. Drugstores sell ointments, creams, and gels that are formulated to reduce the appearance of scars over time. Retinoids work to help regulate collagen production, which can reduce the appearance of keloids. These creams can also reduce itching associated with scars. Ask your pharmacist for a recommendation. [2] X Research source It may take several months for the treatment to work. Apply the ointment, cream, or gel as directed on the bottle for the recommended period of time."

    {
      "title": "Try steroid injections.",
      "content": "Try steroid injections. These injections may help reduce scars that are raised above the surface of the skin. They are usually given every two to six weeks, until the scars begin to improve. In some instances this can take several months. This treatment will help to shrink the keloids and reduce any swelling. [3] X Research source While steroid injections may help flatten these scars, they cannot permanently remove keloids."

    {
      "title": "Get laser treatments.",
      "content": "Get laser treatments. Laser treatment is a popular form of scar removal and has been successful for reducing keloids as well. Pulsed dye lasers and the long pulsed ND:YAG laser are considered the most effective in treating keloid scars. However, these lasers are not as effective on dark skin. Laser treatment can be quite costly because a specialist is required and it will take several treatments before noticeable results are achieved. [4] X Research source The side effects associated with laser treatment include redness and mild irritation."

      "title": "Talk to your doctor about silicone sheets.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor about silicone sheets. Silicone sheets work best if applied to the infected area before a scar has developed. They work by keeping the area hydrated and preventing the development of scar tissue. A silicone sheet is tightly wrapped around the scar tissue and is worn for days or even months following the injury. [5] X Research source Silicone sheets are one of the only treatment options available for children."

      "title": "Have keloid scars surgically removed.",
      "content": "Have keloid scars surgically removed. If you want to completely remove the keloid, rather than just reduce its appearance, you can try surgical removal. This is an invasive procedure, but will likely remove the entire keloid. The only issue is that surgeries often cause the development of new scars. [6] X Research source Surgical treatment of scars can be expensive, but it may be the most effective way to significantly reduce their appearance. You can immediately treat the post-surgery scar using topical retinoids and compression therapy to reduce the chances of another keloid developing. Some surgeons use radiation after the procedure, too, but this is controversial. But keep in mind that surgery is risky and may trigger the formation of an even bigger keloid."

      "title": "Try cryotherapy on newly formed keloid scars.",
      "content": "Try cryotherapy on newly formed keloid scars. This type of treatment works by freezing the skin tissue at the site of the keloid with a substance similar to liquid nitrogen. It is often used in combination with other treatments, most notable steroid injections, to reduce the visibility of the scar. Cryotherapy will flatten the keloid but it may also leave the skin site darker. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Try pressure therapy treatment.",
      "content": "Try pressure therapy treatment. This treatment involves the compression of the wound or injured skin to reduce skin tension. Experts believe that compression will reduce cell production and flatten scars. This type of treatment works best on newly developed scars. You will need to wear a compression wrap or tape all day for several weeks or even months.

      "title": "Try Aloe Vera gel.",
      "content": "Try Aloe Vera gel. Using aloe can help reduce keloids, especially if the scar is relatively fresh. Buy a bottle of Aloe Vera gel or use fresh aloe from the plant. Apply the gel at least twice a day. [9] X Research source Similarly, you can mix 2 teaspoons of aloe with 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil, and 1 tablespoon of cocoa butter. Apply a thick layer to the damaged area and leave on your skin for 30 minutes. Then, wipe any excess of the skin and allow the rest to dry naturally."

      "title": "Try vitamin E.",
      "content": "Try vitamin E. This natural substance is said to help reduce the appearance of scars by fostering healthy skin growth. Buy a cream containing vitamin E, or purchase vitamin E capsules that contain an oil you can rub over the keloids."

      "content": "Avoid tattoos and piercings. The development of keloids may be hereditary, so the best way to reduce your likelihood of developing a keloid is to avoid certain scar-inducing procedures. For example, many people will develop keloids after received a piercing or tattoo.

      "content": "Avoid elected cosmetic surgery. Another way you can prevent the development of keloids, is by avoiding any type of elected or cosmetic surgery. This is especially true if you are prone to keloids. [11] X Research source If surgery is medically required, talk with your doctor in advance so that steps can be taken to treat the scar tissue with steroid injections before a keloid develops."

      "content": "Resist the temptation to pop or squeeze pimples. Severe acne can also cause scarring and may lead to the development of keloids. If you suffer from acne, make sure to treat it immediately. This will reduce the likelihood that scars will develop. You should also avoid popping or squeezing pimples because this can damage the skin and cause scarring. [12] X Research source"
