      "content": "Catch Rayquaza. To catch it more easily, it is suggested that you freeze it at the beginning of the battle, use False Swipe multiple times so that is gets down to one HP left. Also use a move like Confuse Ray to confuse it, thus raising your chance of catching it even more. Once it's frozen, confused, and left with only one HP, throw Ultra and/or Timer Balls until you catch it. This may take a while, so be patient."
