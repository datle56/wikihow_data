      "content": "Choose which size of foam rollers to use. The size of the roller will affect the size and shape of the curl. If you want tight, bouncy curls, choose small foam rollers. Or, choose large rollers for loose, soft curls. Generally, smaller rollers are better for shorter hair, while any size roller can be used for longer hair. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Position rollers vertically or horizontally. The way you wind the rollers determines the type of curl. If you want ringlets, like Shirley Temple, roll the curlers vertically. For fuller, softer curls with more of a wave, roll the curlers horizontally. [4] X Research source To roll them vertically, hold a section of your hair straight out from your head at a 90 degree angle. Wrap the ends of your hair around the roller and continue rolling the curler in toward your scalp. To roll them horizontally, hold a section of your hair straight down from your head. Wrap the ends of your hair around the roller and continue rolling the curler up to your scalp."

      "content": "Start rolling the top section. Choose a one-inch (2.54-cm) section of hair at the crown of your head. Wrap the tips of the hair around the foam roller and continue to roll the hair up until it touches the scalp. Close the clasp to keep the roller in place. The larger the section of hair, the looser the curl will be. How big each section is depends on your hair's thickness, density, texture, and length."

      "content": "Continue adding foam rollers to the rest of your hair. After finishing the top section of hair, move on to the sides and then the back, using one-inch (2.54-cm) sections of hair for each roller. Roll the hair as tight as possible to prevent the rollers from loosening while they set or while you sleep."

      "content": "Clasp the rollers on the bottom to prevent unsightly crimps or dents. Crimps and dents come from the impression in the hair left by the plastic clasp or closure on the foam roller. To keep this from happening, gently reposition the clasp from the top of the curl to the bottom after the roller has been fastened. [5] X Research source Anchor the closure with either an aluminum duckbill clip or a bobby pin."

      "content": "Wait eight hours before removing the rollers. In order for your hair to dry completely and the curls to set, you need to wait at least eight hours before removing the rollers. Many people choose to put the rollers in before going to sleep, then remove them in the morning. If you can't wait eight hours, sit under a heated hair dryer for at least one hour."

      "content": "Shampoo and condition your hair as usual, then towel dry. It's best to start this style with clean, damp hair, so cleanse and condition your hair before adding rollers. You may want to do this around bedtime so that there will be plenty of time overnight for your rolled tresses to dry completely. When drying your hair, gently squeeze excess moisture from your hair with a clean, soft towel. Don't rub your hair or twist it up in the towel, as this can cause breakage. [8] X Research source"

Use your fingers to run the product through the length of your hair, from roots to tips. [10] X Research source How much product you use may depend on what type of hair you have. Thick and curly hair may need more product while fine hair may need less. If you've got frizzy hair, apply an anti-frizz serum or spray before adding the rollers."
