      "content": "Find an oven-safe pan or dish. Alternatively, use an oven-safe coffee mug or similar heatproof container. Turn your oven to 300ºF/150ºC. You don’t want to actually cook the vanilla, just warm it, so if your oven runs hot, decrease the temperature to 275ºF/140ºC. Do not use a non-stick pan as the odors might be compromised by the chemical make-up of the non-stick surface and you may not get the true essence of the vanilla. You want the aroma of the vanilla to permeate the cooking device, which will translate over to your home. Prefer ceramic, terracotta, glass, etc. style containers."

[2] X Research source If the vanilla smell seems a bit on the strong side, open a few windows and allow the breeze to diffuse the fragrance. Set the kitchen timer so you don’t forget the vanilla is in the oven. Twenty minutes is usually adequate to refresh the home. Setting the timer will remind you to turn off the heat and remove the pan from the oven or stovetop."
