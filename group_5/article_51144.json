If there is an event going on that allows Rare monsters to be bred, you could end up breeding a Rare Congle, Rare Woolabee, Rare Tweedle, or Rare Mammott with a combination of a Congle and a Woolabee. This will decrease your chances that the Congle and Woolabee will breed a Cherubble. [6] X Research source"
