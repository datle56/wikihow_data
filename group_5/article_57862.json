Either print the cards yourself, or take the image files from a proxy maker to a print shop for a more professional touch.

If you’re using a proxy card printed on regular paper, place another Magic card in the sleeve behind it. That way, it will have the same weight and feel as an actual card."

Create the proxy image using a proxy printing service or a photo editing app. Print the proxy art on transparent sticker paper . Cut out your proxy card.
