      "content": "Acknowledge that a toxic mother may use manipulation to get what she wants. Manipulation is a defining characteristic of a toxic parent. A manipulative person attempts to change the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors of another person for their own benefit. This is frequently done in a covert manner. If you suspect you are being manipulated, consider whether your thoughts, feelings, and actions are your own or appear to be influenced by someone else. [2] X Research source This is more common in parents with serious manipulative personality/mental disorders, such as Borderline Personality Disorder."

      "content": "Acknowledge that many toxic parents tend to be overly controlling. If you have ever felt as if your mother has tried to control what you think, feel, or do, she may be toxic. Even as an adult, your mother may have decided what college you would attend, who you would date, or what clothes you would wear. A toxic mother's behavior is sometimes accompanied by controlling tendencies. [3] X Research source This can be damaging, since having a controlling parent can also prevent you from learning necessary skills for adulthood. When it comes to being an adult, you may feel insecure or lost."

      "content": "Know toxic mothers often ignore boundaries. A mother's failure to respect boundaries is one of her most common characteristics of a toxic parent. You may have tried to establish boundaries in your relationship only to have them ignored. [4] X Research source For example, you may have requested that she respect your privacy, only to discover that she has been reading your journal entries or snooping on your social media. This is more common in mother-daughter relationships, where mothers infringe on their daughters' privacy because they are both women. If these issues persist into adulthood, it is critical to recognize them and inform your parents that you will not tolerate this type of behavior. If it's constantly bothering you, it might be time to limit the amount of communication you allow from that parent since this can be damaging in the long run. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Set boundaries that are beneficial to you. It may be necessary to set some boundaries when dealing with a toxic mother. You may become codependent in your quest for your mother's love or approval. A healthy boundary might be limiting the number of phone calls you accept from your parent or informing them that they cannot drop by your house unannounced. Explain these boundaries to your parents in a clear but gentle manner, and then stand by them by keeping your word. [10] X Research source [11] X Research source When setting boundaries, do your best to recognize your self-worth as important and get clear on what you need and what is important to you. Figure out what behaviors you will no longer tolerateâ€”if necessary, talk to a therapist about this so you can learn to better stand up for yourself. State it clearly and matter of fact, without hesitation or defensiveness. Remember that boundaries are not negotiable, and a toxic parent will do whatever it takes to win the negotiation. You have to be clear, direct and firm. And decide on what the consequences will be for violating those boundaries."
