      "content": "Notice the telltale sign of butterflies in your stomach. The next time you see your best friend, note whether you feel tingly inside. When they talk to you, the words in your mind get tangled up in a huge knot and you don't know what to say. You try your best to get those words out of your mouth but it ends up that you just can't bring yourself to. If talking just became a huge challenge for you, it may be a sign you're falling in love.

      "content": "Notice your inability to concentrate. When you go somewhere and get bored. Or, if you have extra time and feel like it, you take out your binder and a piece of paper and a few colored pencils and start doodling their name on the paper you brought out. You do this to make yourself feel that feeling, that feeling of love and a crush. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Recognize those dreams of a future together.",
      "content": "Recognize those dreams of a future together. When you're asleep at night, you dream of you and them living a carefree and happy life together. Maybe you even dream about a honeymoon. Sometimes you get this one dream where they ask you out, and you say yes, and until you wake up you feel that that dream is real––you never want it to end.

      "content": "Consider whether you think about them every minute of every day. If you try to stop it, you just can't. They have altered your mind somehow and you can't get them out of there, everywhere you go and anytime of the day that's all your imagination has in store for you, more of them."

      "title": "Notice your daydreaming.",
      "content": "Notice your daydreaming. You sit down for a while and start writing, until you run out of ideas and you start to daydream about them and you like it. Until the point when someone snaps you out of it and you go back to reality. Your daydreams seem timeless and you imagine that you and them are the only two people in the world.

      "title": "Note how music leaves you feeling.",
      "content": "Note how music leaves you feeling. You start listening to slow love songs, and those songs explain a sweet love story and strangely remind you of them. Then it becomes your favorite type of music for a long while. You listen to those songs again and again and you just can't get enough, pretty soon you'll know every single one of the lyrics."

      "title": "Consider how easy it is for you to stay put.",
      "content": "Consider how easy it is for you to stay put. If you're falling in love, you'll likely find that you just can't settle down and you find yourself wanting more and more of them. Maybe your friends also notice you've been acting strange lately. Somehow you seem to be getting a little bit clumsy––you start getting clumsy because they are the only thing that seems to go around in your mind and nothing else."

You find most happiness when you're both together, not apart. You just can't wait to hang out together again."
