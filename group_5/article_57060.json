      "title": "Prepare a cooking sheet.",
      "content": "Prepare a cooking sheet. Sprinkle cornmeal over a baking sheet or cover it in parchment paper. This will prevent the dough from sticking to the sheet as it thaws. Set the sheet out on a flat surface in your kitchen."

      "title": "Place the dough on the sheet.",
      "content": "Place the dough on the sheet. If the dough came wrapped in any packaging, unwrap it or remove from the packaging. Set the dough flat on the sheet."

    {
      "title": "Check the bread dough after two hours.",
      "content": "Check the bread dough after two hours. Let the dough sit for two hours and then check on it. The dough should be rising slightly and softening at this point. If the bread seems to be rising on its own, simply continue to let it sit."

      "title": "Transfer the dough to the oven.",
      "content": "Transfer the dough to the oven. If the bread is not rising or thawing after two hours, place it in the oven. You don't need to turn on the heat. The oven's insulation will help the bread rise."

      "title": "Let the bread dough thaw until it doubles in size.",
      "content": "Let the bread dough thaw until it doubles in size. As the bread continues to thaw, it will also continue to rise. Within four to six hours, the bread will have doubled in size and you can proceed to make rolls."

      "title": "Divide the dough into equal pieces.",
      "content": "Divide the dough into equal pieces. The number of pieces you end up with depends on the amount of dough. Most batches of frozen bread doughs, however, contain enough dough to make roughly 16 equal pieces. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Add seasoning.",
      "content": "Add seasoning. The type of seasoning you use is up to you. You can try something like simple salt and paper. However, you can also try sprinkling Parmesan cheese and dried garlic over the rolls for some extra flavor. [3] X Research source You can add any types of herbs you want. You could also try parsley, fresh basil, or even something unconventional like cajun seasoning."

The precise amount will vary depending on the size of your bread dough, but use enough that you have an even layer of butter spread across the dough.
