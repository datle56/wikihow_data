      "content": "This is a great ice breaker, because it lets him show off his skills. If you immediately ask him to do something for you, he’ll feel good about himself, and you can praise him for his efforts. Plus, it gives you an excuse to chat with him so you don’t look like you just came up to flirt! Try something like: “Hey, I’m having trouble grabbing this bag of dog food off the top shelf. Could you help me out?” “Hi, I live right next door and I just ran out of eggs. Do you happen to have any extra? I promise I’ll get you back next time I go shopping!” “You look super strong—would you mind helping me carry these heavy bags up to my door?”"

As you two chat (or if you catch his eye across the room), hold his gaze, and make sure you have a small smile on your face.

      "content": "Your body language can signal that you like him without even saying a word. When you’re near him, try to lean in close, and touch his hand or pat him on the arm. Breaking the touch barrier is a very effective way to let someone know you’re interested, and if you only do it once or twice during a conversation, you won’t come off too strong.

      "title": "If you don’t have it already, think of a reason why you might need it.",
      "content": "If you don’t have it already, think of a reason why you might need it. For instance, if you two live on the same block, maybe you need it “in case of emergencies.” If he’s new to the area, you could grab his number to show him around some time. Finding an excuse is a little more subtle than outright asking, so think on your feet to find something good. Other examples include: “You seem like you know a lot about this area. Could I grab your number in case I need any recommendations?” “Your dog is so cute! I’d love to grab your number and set up a doggy playdate sometime.” “I loved talking about books with you today! If you want, we could exchange digits in case you need any more authors to check out.”"

      "title": "If he’s interested, he’ll definitely send you a message.",
      "content": "If he’s interested, he’ll definitely send you a message. If you’re worried about coming off as desperate, let him take the lead, and wait for a message from him. That way, if he doesn’t text you, you’ll know he’s not interested, and you can simply move on. Some guys will wait an arbitrary amount of days before texting someone they like (ever heard of the 3 day rule?). In general, though, if it’s been a week or more and you haven’t heard from him, he’s probably not interested."

      "title": "Double texting someone can come off a little strong.",
      "content": "Double texting someone can come off a little strong. Instead, only send one text at a time, and don’t worry if he isn’t responding. Usually, people forget to text back because they get busy with something else—if he likes you, he’ll remember that you’re waiting on him, and he’ll reply within a timely manner. Keep his schedule in mind, too. If he works full time or goes to school, there will probably be times when he’s just too busy to chat via text."

      "title": "Try to match his response times so you don’t seem too eager.",
      "content": "Try to match his response times so you don’t seem too eager. Texting back right away is okay, but it can make you seem like you’ve been waiting by the phone for his message. Instead, if he takes a few minutes to respond, try to match that time. That way, you’re giving him the exact same energy that he’s giving you. For instance, if he takes an hour to text back, wait at least 45 minutes before responding."

      "title": "Sexting too early can make you seem a little desperate.",
      "content": "Sexting too early can make you seem a little desperate. It’s totally fine to send sensual messages if you’re looking for a strictly sexual fling, but if you want a relationship, it’s best to hold off. Keep your messages PG-rated, and save anything more saucy for when you two know each other more. If he tries to sext and you don’t want to, you could say something like, “I’d rather wait until we know each other a little better. It’s just a boundary that I have.”"

      "title": "That way, it can either be a date-thing or a friend-thing.",
      "content": "That way, it can either be a date-thing or a friend-thing. Figure out something you both have in common, like your love of rock climbing, horror movies, or pottery. Then, invite him out to go do an activity that you both like. If things go well, you can call it a date; if things are more platonic, you’re just two buddies hanging out. You could say something like, “Do you want to go frisbee golfing this weekend? You have way more experience than me, so I could probably learn a thing or two from you.” Or, “I was thinking of hitting up that new hiking trail next week. Want to join me?”"

If you want to be a little more forward (and you feel comfortable doing it), see if he wants to come over to yours for a quiet night in. Then, you can pop on a movie and see where the night takes you. Say something like, “I wanted to watch that new horror movie on Netflix. You wanna come over tonight?” Or, “There’s a new Tarantino film that I’m dying to see! You interested?”"

Plus, it sets you up to talk about maybe going out again, if that’s what you both want. [9] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Try saying something like: “Had a really fun time tonight. Thanks for taking me out!” “Can’t believe I lost so bad during mini golf. I demand a rematch!”"
