It can be difficult to come up with a password that meets all of your email service's criteria that's actually easy to remember, but here are a few tips: [1] X Research source Your password should be long: The golden rule now is that a password should be 12 characters and contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

      "content": "Use a unique password for your email account. Avoid the temptation of reusing passwords on multiple accounts. If you use the same password to log in to your favorite website as you do your email, you're putting your email at risk—if someone cracks your password on that site, they'll also have your email password. Since there are so many passwords to remember nowadays, you may want to try using a password manager . Avoid choosing the option to save your passwords on the web. If you save your password to make it easier to log in, anyone using your computer may access your email. This is especially important when you're using a public computer."

      "content": "Turn on two-step verification. Most of the popular email services, such as Gmail and Outlook , allow you to enable two-step verification, which adds a second layer of protection to your account. When two-step verification is turned on, you'll also have to enter a special security code that is sent to you via SMS or in an authentication app when logging in from an unknown source (a computer in a different area than you usually log in from). This makes it so if someone manages to crack your email password, they'd also need access to your phone to actually sign in. [3] X Research source"

If you're using Outlook, you can check your account history to make sure nothing you haven't approved has happened."

      "content": "Learn to identify phishing scams. Scammers may use email to target victims—they'll often send emails requesting personal information that can be used to forge your identity, such as your social security number or banking information. Never provide any personal information over email unless you know exactly who is requesting the information. If you're using Gmail or Outlook, you'll see a red or yellow message at the top of the email, warning you that the email might be spam or a phishing scam. [8] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Check the return email address—is the person claiming to represent a certain company but using a free email account? Check the domain name (the part that comes after the @ sign) in the email address—is that actually the company's domain name? Sometimes scammers register fake domain names that look like the real thing to bait victims. For example, you could get an email from @netfl1x.com instead of the actual site, @netflix.com.

Go to source Does the message contain an offer that's too good to be true, or a claim that you've won a contest you never actually entered? Are you being asked to wire money to someone you don't know? These are all signs of scams. When in doubt, if a scammer claims to be affiliated with a company, contact the company or service directly by phone or on their website. If there's a phone number in the email, don't call it—instead, go directly to the company's official website and locate the phone number there. Sometimes scammers include fake contact information."

Just make sure not to forget what you enter!"
