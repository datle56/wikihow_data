      "content": "A gigachad is a confident, attractive alpha male with a muscular body. \"Gigachad\" is an online slang term that describes a person with the “ultimate” male form. Big, muscular, handsome, and confident, a gigachad is the stereotypical alpha male. Chiseled like a Greek god, his features and physique are the stuff of legends. The term can be used seriously or ironically. A gigachad is a variation of the slang label “chad.” “Chad” is another way of saying “bro,” or to refer to someone as a stereotypical alpha male type. \"Giga\" means “billion,” so when you combine the “giga” with “chad,” it describes someone who is a “Chad” at a very excessive level.
