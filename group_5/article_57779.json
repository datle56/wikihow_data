      "content": "Midheaven in Taurus means the Taurus sign shapes your idea of success. On an astrology chart, Midheaven (also called MC or Medium Coeli ) is an angle that reflects your public image, career, and what you want to do with your life. It’s located on the top of your astrology chart at the cusp of the 10th house, and it represents the highest point on the horizon that a planet can reach. So, when it comes to public image and career, you think a lot like a strong-willed Taurus. In astrology, the 10th house on an astrology chart rules a person’s career and social standing. If you’re a Taurus Midheaven, that means you were born with Midheaven on your astrology chart falling under the Taurus zodiac sign. Midheaven in Taurus people typically make it their mission in life to leave a lasting legacy. That might be their career, a hobby, or the family they create—but either way, they yearn to make their mark on the world."

This zodiac placement is often skilled at finding ways to make passive income and enjoy their downtime, for example."

      "title": "Loyal",
      "content": "Loyal Taurus is a fixed sign, which means Taurus Midheavens have a tendency to be extremely loyal and reliable. Once they commit to something, they stand by it. This applies to a Taurus MC’s career and personal life; they tend to stick with the same company once they find a job they really love, and similarly, they’re fiercely dedicated partners once they meet someone they can envision a future with. [3] X Research source Fixed signs are the zodiac’s “stabilizers.” They’re loyal, driven, reliable, and tend to see all their commitments through to the end. Taurus, in particular, is one of the most loyal zodiac signs !"

      "content": "Persistent Taurus Midheavens have incredible endurance and rarely give up on anything. They know how to weather any storm and chase their goals with single-minded determination! Taurus MCs want to excel in every aspect of their life, and they make that happen through their persistence and commitment to hard work. For Taurus in Midheaven, “success” generally means living a secure and stable life free of financial strain. Thus, that tends to be their greatest goal in life—and because they’re so persistent, they often achieve this goal. Their perseverance also helps Taurus Midheavens meet their career goals, even if it takes longer than expected. Taurus MCs have ambition, but they’re also patient and stubborn, so they’ll put in the work as long as they have to."

      "title": "Materialistic",
      "content": "Materialistic Midheaven in Taurus has a taste for the finer things; their ultimate goal is usually to live a comfortable life using their hard-earned wages. Taurus’s connection to Venus also plays into this, as they tend to have great (although expensive) taste in everything from food to furniture. Thus, Midheaven in Taurus works hard and earns money because they want the best of the best in life. The older a Midheaven in Taurus gets, the more they typically learn to enjoy life (and the nice things they own). Younger Taurus MCs may get caught up in the hustle of finding a good job because they don’t have a lot of money or resources, whereas a Taurus MC with success and material wealth often finds it easier to slow down and smell the flowers."

      "title": "Resilient",
      "content": "Resilient Having a Taurus Midheaven also means having a Scorpio Imum Coeli. Imum Coeli (IC) is connected to Midheaven (MC)—the two are located exactly opposite of one another on an astrology chart, with MC at the top and IC at the bottom. IC predicts the roots that shape a person during childhood, and IC in Scorpios are thought to be resilient because of chaotic home lives when they were kids. Astrologers believe IC in Scorpio means a person has lived through traumatic events as a kid; specifically, the adults in their life may have been immature, unstable, or controlling. Because of this, people with the IC in Scorpio (and MC Taurus) placement may also grow up believing that they need to be completely self-sufficient. IC in Scorpio/MC in Taurus people may also crave the stability as adults that they didn't have as children. Imum Coeli means “bottom of the sky” in Latin, while Medium Coeli means “middle of the sky.”"

      "title": "Midheaven in Taurus can sometimes be set in their ways.",
      "content": "Midheaven in Taurus can sometimes be set in their ways. Remember how Taurus is a fixed sign? Well, their methodical nature can make Taurus Midheavens a little rigid and obstinate; they tend to think conservatively and like to do things the same way no matter what. For example, if you’re a Taurus Midheaven, you might insist on always going to the same grocery store to shop or cycle through the same 5 restaurants on date nights. Don’t be afraid to shake things up occasionally! It’s okay to want to play it safe, but trying something new once in a while isn’t really that risky—and you might discover a new store or restaurant you love even more than your usuals."

      "title": "Taurus MCs may feel the need to control others’ perceptions of them.",
      "content": "Taurus MCs may feel the need to control others’ perceptions of them. In some cases, a Taurus Midheaven might worry their values are too different from someone else’s, particularly someone with pull in their workplace. The Taurus MC might not speak up about their values because they don’t want to lose any position or respect—and end up isolating themselves because they’re not being honest about who they are. Let people see the real you! Rather than trying to control peoples’ perceptions by becoming the person you think they want you to be, be true to yourself and your values. Establishing a genuine personal identity may help you find a sense of inner stability as well—which can, in turn, make you feel much more confident and self-assured."

People with their Midheaven sign in Taurus make an effort to stand out and show the best side of themselves to the outside world, so they typically have stellar reputations. Taurus MCs are often thought to be organized, reliable, and even-tempered among their peers and usually end up being pretty popular people who know how to connect with others. [5] X Research source Taurus Midheavens may even grow into influential and important community members, especially if they have other ambitious sign placements on their chart (like Capricorn, Aries, Leo, or Scorpio)."

      "title": "Taurus MCs flourish in careers that let them build a legacy over time.",
      "content": "Taurus MCs flourish in careers that let them build a legacy over time. The idea of creating a lasting legacy is extremely important to Taurus Midheavens; they want to grow something that will stand the test of time. They work best in relaxed environments that allow them to move at their own speed and don’t always like being managed (they’re very stubborn, after all!) Thus, they may prefer to take charge and become leaders. Ideal career paths include: Art and design. Their innate creativity makes Taurus Midheavens amazing designers. Farming or gardening. Taurus MCs are earth signs and love working with their hands out in nature. Finance. Midheaven in Taurus does well in jobs that let them flex their financial smarts. Fashion or beauty. Venus-ruled Midheaven in Taurus is naturally fashionable and makes a great beauty guru. Unlike other Midheaven placements, Taurus in Midheaven doesn’t just jump into careers. They want a clear idea of their career path before they even begin. If you haven’t started your career yet (or you’re thinking of making a change), take the time you need to think your options through. Taurus MCs feel best when making careful, informed decisions."
