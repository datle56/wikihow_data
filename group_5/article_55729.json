      "content": "Move money into your Credit Builder card. The Chime Credit Builder Visa card is what's known as a secured credit card . These cards are designed to help consumers build their credit using their own money, but unlike other secured cards, there is no minimum security deposit with the Chime Credit Builder card. You can manually move money from your Chime checking account into your Chime Credit Builder card, or you can use Move My Pay to designate a certain amount of your direct deposit payments that will be automatically transferred over."

      "content": "Secured credit cards like Credit Builder can help build credit.

Chime's Credit Builder card reports to these three bureaus, and your credit score will increase over time.

      "title": "Credit Builder does not report credit utilization to the three credit bureaus.",
      "content": "Credit Builder does not report credit utilization to the three credit bureaus. One aspect of your credit score is the credit utilization ratio, or how much credit you have compared to how much credit you've used. Unlike a standard credit card, however, Credit Builder does not report credit utilizationâ€”so you can use 100% of your security deposit on your card without fear that your score will be lowered due to high utilization."

      "content": "You may see a decrease in your score right after getting Credit Builder. Applying for a credit card puts a hard inquiry on your credit report, which will stay on your report for two years but will likely only affect your credit score for a few months to a year. Opening a Credit Builder card will also decrease the average age of your credit history, which can lead to decreased credit scores until your card ages. According to Experian, your credit history length makes up 15% of your credit score and hard inquiries make up 10%. [3] X Research source This is much lower than the two biggest impacts to your credit score: payment history (35%) and credit utilization (30%)."

Credit Builder functions like a normal Visa credit card , and you can use it anywhere Visa cards are accepted."
