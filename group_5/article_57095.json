      "title": "Use an old chair or piano bench to simulate wood creaking.",
      "content": "Use an old chair or piano bench to simulate wood creaking. Sit on a wooden bench or chair and shift your weight from side to side to get the wood to creak. You can also stand on a wooden pallet and shift your weight in order to achieve the same effect. [1] X Research source The biggest upside to this method is that it allows you to control the volume of the wood creaking sound, depending on how forcefully you shift your weight."

      "content": "Go with scrunched up magnetic tape or sod to make footsteps. Take the tape out of a cassette or VHS tape and scrunch it up in your hands to mimic the sound of walking in grass. If you have access to a kiddie pool and a recording studio, you can also fill the pool with sod and walk on it to get a much more realistic effect. [2] X Research source Note that this is only for footfalls in grass. To make the sound of walking in snow, squeeze a handful of cornstarch in a leather glove."

      "title": "Use wet, juicy food to make body sounds.",
      "content": "Use wet, juicy food to make body sounds. Stab or smash a watermelon, pumpkin, or some other gourd to mimic the types of body sounds you might use in a horror movie. Conversely, hit a slab of raw steak with a hammer or a fist to make the sound of a body impact. [3] X Research source Tomatoes are a bit too fragile to use for impact sounds. However, their goopy interior makes them ideal for making certain sound effects, such as a surgical operation."

      "title": "Snap pieces of crunchy food for crinkling or breaking sounds.",
      "content": "Snap pieces of crunchy food for crinkling or breaking sounds. Twist, crush, or break dry spaghetti to mimic spindly, crinkly sounds. Use larger pieces of crispy food, like carrots or celery, to create the sounds of bones breaking. [4] X Research source If you want to create a more nuanced breaking sound, such as the sound of a bone breaking inside a human body, try wrapping a thick frozen carrot in a towel and then snapping it. Breaking crab legs with the shells still on them is also a good way to make a fleshy breaking sound."

      "title": "Fill a balloon or water bottle and drag it to simulate car skids.",
      "content": "Fill a balloon or water bottle and drag it to simulate car skids. Drag your balloon or water bottle across a glass or ceramic surface, then pitch down the recording to make it sound like tires on concrete. You can also try dragging a filled water bottle across actual concrete, although this will require you to record your audio outside of a controlled environment. [5] X Research source This is an infinitely safer method of recording the sound of tires skidding than using an actual car."

      "title": "Make sword scraping sounds with a spatula and cooking tray.",
      "content": "Make sword scraping sounds with a spatula and cooking tray. Drag a metal spatula across a pizza tray or cookie sheet to record this sound effect. Lift the spatula quickly off the surface of the cooking tray in order to make a “shing” sound. [6] X Research source You can also use this to simulate the sound of a prison cell door closing."

      "title": "Use a stapler or hole punch to create the sound of a gun.",
      "content": "Use a stapler or hole punch to create the sound of a gun. Move a heavy-duty stapler or hole punch around in your hands to mimic the sound of a person handling a gun. For best results, go with a large piece of office equipment with a lot of moving parts (e.g., a 3-hole hole punch). [7] X Research source Note that this only produces the sound of handling a gun, not firing one."

      "content": "Visit freesound.org to have easy access to free-to-use sounds. Freesound.org collects various sound effects and samples from a community of users who share their recordings for free. All of the sounds are protected by Creative Commons Licenses, so they’re perfect for anyone working on a budget. [8] X Research source Freesound.org also has a handy search engine that you can use to peruse their database of sounds and look for the exact sound effect you want. The downside of this method is that you have to rely on the sound effects that other users have made instead of creating your own."

      "content": "Use bfxr if you’re making sound effects for a computer game. Bfxr is an online database that specializes in collecting sound effects commonly used in video games. These include sounds like jumps, powerups, explosions, and lasers. [9] X Research source Bfxr sounds are also free-to-use, although you do need to have Adobe Flash in order to make use of the soundboard."

      "title": "Check for sound recordings on YouTube.",
      "content": "Check for sound recordings on YouTube. Many foley artists make recordings of various sound effects and upload them to YouTube for anyone to use. This method definitely requires the least effort on your part, but it does have a limited selection of sounds to choose from. [10] X Research source Some notable YouTube channels that focus on sound include Akash Thakkar, Robert Dudzic, and Indepth Sound Design. YouTube also has a searchable Audio Library that allows you to download sounds directly, rather than look at videos."

      "content": "Invest in a reliable audio recorder and microphone for quality sounds. You can find cheap, portable recorders and microphones in most electronics retail stores. However, generally speaking, the more money you’re willing to invest in a relatively expensive recording kit, the higher quality your recorded sounds will be. You can buy recorders and microphones online or in most electronics stores. If you plan to do a lot of audio recording on the go, you may want to invest in a handheld recorder and microphone set instead of a stationary kit. Portable recorders are also much cheaper."

      "content": "Get a pair of large headphones that will pick up acute sounds. If you can pick up the tiny, almost imperceptible sounds of whatever you’re recording, you’ll be able to create much higher quality recordings by eliminating unwanted sounds. For best results, go with noise-cancelling headphones so you don’t hear the various other sounds of the room you’re in. You can buy noise-cancelling headphones online and at any electronics store. You may also be able to find them at an ordinary mass retailer, but this isn’t guaranteed. You don’t technically need to have headphones in order to record sound effects for fun. However, having good noise-cancelling headphones will do a lot to help you make crystal clear sounds in your studio."

      "content": "Pick up a kiddie pool for working with loose materials. Pour soil, water, or any other outdoor material you’re working with into this pool to have easy access to it. This way, you won’t have to venture outside to record sounds with materials you can’t normally use indoors. [11] X Research source This is especially important for making sound effects with water, since you need to keep a large amount of water in a stable container to record with it. You can pick up kiddie pools at many mass retail stores and at any pool retailer."

      "content": "Hang soundproof material on the walls of your studio. Soundproofing your studio will prevent noise pollution from sounds coming from other rooms or outside. Use wall panels made with Mass-Loaded Vinyl or acoustic mineral wool for the most effective soundproofing. If you’re on a budget, try using pillows and thick blankets to soundproof your studio space. [12] X Research source You can buy soundproofing materials from any music store. If you’re working on a budget, you can also try large rugs and tapestries to soundproof your workspace. If you’re doing a lot of recording or making loud sound effects, soundproofing your studio will also keep you from disturbing your neighbors."
