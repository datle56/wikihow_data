      "title": "Meditation helps reconnect your spiritual and physical self.",
      "content": "Meditation helps reconnect your spiritual and physical self. Every day, sit down for at least 10 minutes and clear your head of any thoughts. Focus on your breathing, and try to connect with your inner self. The more you meditate, the more you can strengthen your moon and improve your spiritual connection with yourself. [1] X Research source If there’s a full moon happening soon, try meditating at night instead of in the morning. You’ll be able to connect with the moon more, and it could enhance your experience."

      "title": "Yoga",
      "content": "Yoga can connect you more to your body and mind. Try to clear your mind as much as possible before you start, and really feel everything in your body. If you do this a few times a week (or even every day), it can help strengthen your moon. [2] X Research source Many astrologers recommend doing yoga underneath the moon. If you can, wait until the evening time and try to do your yoga near a window so you can stay beneath the moonlight."

      "title": "Many astrologers recommend a specific moon-mantra to strengthen your moon.",
      "content": "Many astrologers recommend a specific moon-mantra to strengthen your moon. Try repeating ”Om Shraam Shreem Shroum Sah Chandramase Namah” (“I bow to the Moon God whose hue resembles the hue of Curds, a conch and the color of snow”) out loud as many times a day as you would like, or while you are meditating. Repeating this mantra can help connect you to the moon and calm your mind. [3] X Research source Lord Chandra, who the chant is worshipping, is said to dress in all white. He is strongly connected to the moon and its powers, which is why this mantra is usually recommended."

      "content": "Acts of service may help offset some of the symptoms of a weak moon. Try donating your money or goods to places like homeless shelters or food banks. And, if you have time, you could volunteer in your community to give back to the people around you. [4] X Research source Astrologers note that while donation and volunteering are good, they won’t work on their own. Make sure you’re doing other things to strengthen your moon in conjunction with donations and volunteering."

      "title": "The moon is heavily affected by water and how you use it.",
      "content": "The moon is heavily affected by water and how you use it. Throughout the day, try not to waste any water, and use what you have thoughtfully. Take short showers, drink all the water you pour into your glass, and be mindful about what you use for chores.

      "title": "Silver reflects the moon’s properties.",
      "content": "Silver reflects the moon’s properties. Both silver and the moon are seen as reflective, connective, and sensual, which is why wearing silver jewelry may bring you closer to the moon spiritually. Try to wear at least one silver piece per day to connect you to the moon. [6] X Research source In fact, scientists have found that the moon contains trace amounts of silver on its surface.

Try not to fight with your mom, and respect her as much as you can. Do your best to obey her wishes and strengthen your relationship with her. [9] X Research source"

This type of bath can help leave a positive aura around you. [10] X Research source Many astrologers recommend taking this bath on a Monday, since Monday is the day of the moon."

The more you encourage free birds to fly in the sky around you, the more that you can strengthen your connection with the moon. [11] X Research source You might also try putting a bird-feeder in your yard to feed free birds all day long."
