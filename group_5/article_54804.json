If you want to become a child's legal guardian in order to assist the child financially while one or both of his or her parents are incarcerated, you should talk about your options with a lawyer. When searching for an lawyer, contact your state bar's lawyer referral service and ask for help finding a qualified family law lawyer. The state bar representative will ask you a few questions and will give you the names and contact information of qualified lawyers in your area. Call each candidate and set up an initial consultation. Hire the attorney you feel most comfortable with. While you do not need an attorney to receive legal guardianship, it may be advantageous if: [2] X Research source The child has a lot of property worth a large amount of money You live outside the state you are seeking guardianship in One or both parents are contesting the guardianship The child has special needs The child is a Native American (because federal laws will apply)"

      "content": "Consider your options with your lawyer. When you talk with each lawyer, they may discuss a variety of options for taking care of the child. While each option will have its benefits and drawbacks, legal guardianship is the best option for offering you financial opportunities to help care for the child. Some of the options include: If Child Protective Services does not become involved in the family's case (i.e., the child was not removed from the parents custody by the state), the parent will usually be able to arrange for the child's care on their own. The parent may ask you to be a caregiver, which is only an option if you are a relative of the child. In addition, a caregiver can only make schooling decisions and it only lasts for one year. The parent may also sign a power of attorney making you the child's caregiver. If you are an immediate relative you may be able to get financial assistance. If you are not, the state may not be able to help you and the child financially. If you want to get a court involved, you should ask for legal guardianship, which will transfer the legal rights of the child to you. A legal guardian can be a relative, friends, or foster parent. The parent's rights will be suspended but not terminated. When the parent gets out of prison, they will hopefully be able to reunite with their child. As the child's legal guardian, you will be eligible for many financial opportunities to help you."
