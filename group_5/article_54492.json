      "content": "Turn off other components in your car to see if the noise goes away. Make sure your air conditioning, windshield wipers, lights, and turn signals are all off. Then, try playing audio from your speakers again. If the distortion is gone, it’s probably one of those components making a noise, not your stereo. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the connection from any outside devices to your stereo. If you are using a phone to connect to your stereo through Bluetooth or an auxiliary cord, make sure the connections are secure. Go into the Bluetooth settings on your phone and pair your car stereo with your phone. Or, make sure your auxiliary cord is plugged all the way into your headphone jack. [2] X Research source If you are using an old auxiliary cord, you may need to buy a new one."

      "content": "Isolate the noise coming from each speaker to check them individually. Use the balance and fader controls on your stereo to play sound out of each speaker in your car one at a time. If the distortion comes from only one of the speakers, it may need to be replaced. Most cars have 4 speakers: 2 in the front and 2 in the back. If your car is an older model, it may not have balance and fader controls."

      "content": "Take your car into the mechanic to check the grounding wires. If you are still hearing distortion through your stereo, there could be a problem with the electrical connection. Take your car into an automotive shop and describe your problem in detail. Most stereos only require a few quick fixes, but it’s important to let a professional do them since they are dealing with the electrical system in your car."

[7] X Research source If your speakers aren’t connected to your phone through Bluetooth, try turning your Bluetooth off then on again. Then, look for the name of your speakers in your Bluetooth settings and click on them to pair your devices. If your cord is loose in the headphone jack, it could cause your audio to crackle."

If you turn up your volume too high, it could cause the audio to crackle. Try gradually turning down the volume on your speaker or phone until the audio clears up. If the audio doesn’t clear up when you turn down the volume, that’s probably not the issue."

If you have instruments, like guitars, basses, or keyboards plugged into your speakers, make sure they aren’t sending more power to the speakers than they can handle. Try lowering the wattage of the amp to see if that helps your speaker distortion.

Roll back the volume on your amp gradually until you hit a spot where the sound is no longer distorted.
