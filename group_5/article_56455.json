      "content": "You rarely think about sex. Think about how often you think about sex and for how long. If you’re asexual, you might find that sex doesn’t really interest you. [1] X Research source For aces, it’s completely possible to go days, weeks, or even years without thinking about sex. For example, you might not be able to remember the last time you had a sexual thought. Similarly, you may realize that you occasionally think about sex when people bring it up, but it quickly leaves your mind. It’s still possible to be asexual even if you do think about sex a lot. Similarly, asexual people can definitely have a “dirty” mind even if they don't experience sexual attraction. Take wikiHow’s “Am I Asexual” quiz to get a general idea of how you might identify."

While asexuality is a normal, healthy sexual orientation, some mental and physical disorders can cause low libido or disinterest in sex. Visit your doctor if you’re concerned that your feelings toward sex are related to an underlying condition rather than your sexuality. Some conditions that may impact your sex drive include: [7] X Research source Body dysmorphia : This is when you’re consumed by negative thoughts about your body or perceived flaws. If you have body dysmorphia, it may be hard for you to imagine or feel confident about having sex with someone. Sexual dysfunction disorders : These cover a wide range of symptoms. Some disorders that fall under this category include desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and pain disorders.

      "content": "Recognize the difference between romantic orientation and sexual orientation. It’s possible to feel romantic attraction but not sexual attraction, and vice versa. In other words, you can be asexual and still feel romantic attraction towards someone. Even if you don’t want to have sex with someone, you may still enjoy things like holding hands, cuddling, talking, sharing meals, and even kissing. [9] X Research source You may also be aromantic , which means you don’t feel romantic attraction toward others. Instead, you may feel perfectly content with platonic and familial relationships. [10] X Research source Someone who is asexual might also be panromantic, meaning they feel romantic attraction towards anyone regardless of their gender. Asexual individuals still express affection and care for other people. They're just not interested in expressing this in a sexual way."

      "title": "Notice the differences between aesthetic, sensual, and sexual attraction.",
      "content": "Notice the differences between aesthetic, sensual, and sexual attraction. There are different types of attraction, and sometimes that can be confusing. Aesthetic attraction is when you think someone looks good but don’t necessarily feel sexually interested in them. Sensual attraction is when you want to cuddle, kiss, or be close to someone but, again, not in a sexual way. Sexual attraction happens when you have the desire to have sexual contact with someone. [11] X Research source It’s possible to feel aesthetically or sensually attracted to someone, but not sexually attracted. If you’re aesthetically attracted to someone, you might think, “Her face is so beautiful.” However, you have no desire to be intimate. With sensual attraction, you might think, “This person is attractive and fun to be around. I want to cuddle and hold hands with them.” In the case of sexual attraction, you may be able to easily picture yourself having sex with the other person."

      "content": "Watch for signs that you may be gray-asexual or demisexual. Both gray-asexuality (graysexuality) and demisexuality are part of the asexual spectrum. You may be gray-asexual if you have some sexual interest or occasionally feel sexually attracted to someone. Similarly, you might be demisexual if you feel sexual attraction to someone only after you’ve developed a deep emotional connection with them. If you’re conflicted about whether or not you may be asexual, consider if these other labels might better reflect your sexual identity. To figure out if you’re gray-asexual, think about times you’ve been attracted to someone or gotten aroused by something sexual. This could be a sign that you fit better under the term “graysexual.” If you suspect you may be demisexual, consider if you’ve only been sexually attracted to someone you love or deeply like. For instance, you might develop sexual feelings for someone you’ve dated for a long time but not be sexually attracted to anyone else. Take this wikiHow quiz to get an idea of whether you may be demisexual."

      "content": "Accept that your asexual identity is completely normal. While people may not understand asexuality, it’s a completely valid sexual identity that’s a part of who you are. Don’t worry about trying to change yourself. Instead, embrace your asexuality as a part of what makes you a unique, interesting person, and be confident in who you are. [12] X Research source There’s nothing wrong or bad about being disinterested in sex. It’s okay to question your sexual identity and be uncertain about how you feel. Take as much time as you need to understand yourself. You’re not obligated to fulfill someone else’s stereotype or desires. You don’t need to have sex to prove something or make someone else happy."

      "content": "Recognize that every asexual person is unique. You may relate to some traits of asexuality but not others and still consider yourself to be asexual. Asexuality is a spectrum, so you may think differently about sex than others. There are a couple of different attitudes asexuals can have when it comes to sex. [13] X Research source Sex-favorable : You’re willing to compromise with your partner about sex, and you may feel happy just by giving pleasure rather than receiving it. Sex-indifferent : You might not enjoy sex that much, but it doesn’t stress you out to think about it. To you, sex might just be more like something to cross off your to-do list rather than something you actually take pleasure in. Sex-averse/sex-repulsed : You might become rather distressed when you think about having sex, and you may not be willing to compromise with your partner at all about doing sexual things. You might have different opinions when it comes to sex as a societal concept versus your personal sexual experiences. For example, you might have no problem with the idea of other people having sex, but you might feel uncomfortable when it comes to thinking about yourself engaging in sexual activities."

While some people instinctively know their sexual identity, it’s normal to go through a period of questioning and discovery. This can last as long as you need to figure out your preferences. Don’t rush to label your identity or feel pressured to explain yourself. Continue researching and learning about yourself and how you feel. You’ll figure out your sexual identity when you’re ready. [14] X Research source It’s okay to experiment with sex to find out if you like it, but don’t feel pressured to do it. Take your time and only do what feels comfortable to you. Don’t feel pressured to come out about your sexuality before you’re ready. However, if you feel comfortable telling a few trusted friends or family members, it might help to have them there for support."
