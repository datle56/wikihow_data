      "content": "Getting a few drinks is a great way to wind down after work. Skip the long dinner date and meet your date at a favorite bar. It's a simple and casual idea suitable if you're just beginning a relationship, but it's also a nice way to relax after work with your partner. Dress up a little, have a couple of cocktails, and spend the evening chatting. To make things more interesting, you could both resolve to try a new drink each date or pick a mystery drink for each other. Alternatively, do a mini-bar crawl. Pick a couple of places you'd like to try and sample a cocktail at each. The goal isn't to go crazy, as it's a weeknight, but you can still get a little adventurous! You can also just do a cocktail hour at home. Buy a few spirits and mixers so you and your date can make delicious cocktails together."
