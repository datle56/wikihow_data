[11] X Research source How to overcome : Work on honest, open communication with the people in your life to overcome trust issues. If you’re feeling suspicious or distrustful of someone, talk to them about it, rather than just assuming the worst. Avoid making accusatory statements about what you think they’ve done. Instead, focus on communicating how you’re feeling. [12] X Research source For example: “I started to get nervous that you were seeing someone else when our date got canceled last night. Can we talk things out?”"
