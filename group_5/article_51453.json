When you purchase an international calling card, you are essentially purchasing calling credit. Calling cards normally cost between $10 and $50. In general, the more expensive the card, the more calling credit you receive. There are many options when choosing a calling card, so make sure you compare and read the fine print to decide which one is best for your situation. You will still be paying a per-minute rate when you use a calling card. This rate, however, will probably be much less expensive than calling without using a calling card. The per-minute rate for calling cards will vary, but usually start around one or two cents per minute. Be aware of hidden charges. Many calling card companies charge a connection fee or a weekly fee."
