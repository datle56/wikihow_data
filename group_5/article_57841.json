      "title": "Use a trundler.",
      "content": "Use a trundler. This requires thinking ahead when you first place your pot plant down. A trundler is a small frame on casters. This will allow the pot to be moved for cleaning and moving and also allows for the rotation of the plant for pruning, watering etc. It's a worthwhile investment to make at the beginning, so ask your local garden center what they have in stock. Look online if you can't get this locally. When purchasing one, see if it is possible to lock the wheels. If not, you may need to chock it to stop if from moving in high wind locations."

      "title": "Use a trolley.",
      "content": "Use a trolley. Purchase or hire a trolley with adequate width at the base able to take the pot size. There are many trolleys on the market; preferably look for one able to negotiate the terrain that you have, such as stairs, rough ground, etc. Use straps to tie the pot in place on the trolley. In terms of easing the pot onto the trolley in the first place, have at least three strong people available to help out; strength is important when shifting such a heavy item."

      "title": "Use a cardboard box.",
      "content": "Use a cardboard box. For pots that aren't too heavy but are still cumbersome to lift up, slipping a fully opened cardboard box under the pot and then sliding the pot along can be an easy option. Simply undo a carton until it is completely flat. Slide it under the pot (get a helper to lift very briefly) and ensure that the pot is sitting in the middle. Shift the pot by pulling along the cardboard until the pot reaches its new destination. Slide the cardboard out (you can tear it off if easiest, as the portion under the pot will eventually decompose)."
