      "content": "Solve like a normal equation. This will generate a coordinate for your y-intercept. First, substitute x to zero. Then, subtract the product from both sides of the equation. Note that the operation you will perform with both sides depends on the sign of your number. In this case the number is zero so we will use its opposite, subtraction. After that, divide three from both sides. And, VOILA! You have the answer. [3] X Research source"
