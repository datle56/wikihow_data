This will steady it on the wall once it is hung and allow air to circulate behind it. [1] X Research source Quickly flip over your picture and double-check that the bumpers are in the bottom corners before installing the hardware."

      "content": "Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure no further than ⅓ of the way down from the top on 1 side and make a mark with a pencil. Repeat this on the other side. [3] X Research source For example, if the picture frame is 30 cm (12 in) long, make a mark on each side 10 cm (3.9 in) down from the top of the frame. Alternatively, mount the D-rings further up on your painting (about ¼ of the way down) so the painting lays flat against the wall. Stick bumper pads underneath the top corners to ensure there’s still airflow between the painting and the wall. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a drill to make pilot holes on each side. Lay the D-rings so the screw holes line up with your marks and the D shapes face inwards towards the center of the frame. Attach the D-rings using the provided screws and a screwdriver. [5] X Research source Make sure to wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying debris from the drill. In wood frames, pilot holes prevent the frame from splitting. If your frame is plastic, pilot holes will give you a clean hole through the metal for your screw to go into. If your picture is open in the back, allowing you to access the inside of the frame, screw eye-hooks about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) in from the back of the frame. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Picture frame wire comes in different sizes that can support different weights. Choose a gauge of wire that can support the weight of the picture you want to hang. [7] X Research source Braided wire : Made from strands of galvanized steel that have been braided together, this material is sold in a variety of thicknesses. The thickest wire can hold up to 36 lb (16 kg). Vinyl-coated wire : This is stainless steel wire that’s coated with a soft layer of vinyl, making it gentle on your hands and surfaces. Use for pictures up to 60 lb (27 kg). Stainless steel wire : This is stronger than braided wire but less flexible. It’s best for hanging large, heavy pictures that weigh up to 100 lb (45 kg)."

Pass the end of the wire through the loop and pull both sides of the wire to tighten the knot. [9] X Research source Repeat on the other side. [10] X Research source Make sure there is a little slack in the line so the wire can stretch upward to hook onto the wall. If the wire is tight with no slack, undo the slipknots and retie them with less wire."

Wrap the excess wire around the main length of the wire, pushing the coils down toward the D-ring as you go. Repeat with the end of the wire on the other side.

      "content": "DIY specialist David Julien says the first way to hang a piece of artwork or mirror with a wire is to “hold the artwork by the wire and… measure the distance from the top of the frame to the tensioned wire.” If you’re using 2 nails or mounting points to hang your picture, pull up on the wire at both points, then measure to the top of the frame.

      "content": "Julien says the next step to hang a wired piece of artwork is to “Place the artwork in the desired location and mark the wall at the top center of the frame.” Then, “Mark where to place your nail, starting from your last marker and adding your first measurement down.” If the distance from the top of the frame to the wire is 2 in (5.1 cm), measure 2 in (5.1 cm) down from the mark on the wall from the top of the frame. This is where the hanging hook will go."

      "content": "Nail or screw a picture frame hanging hook into your wall. Carefully place the frame against the wall over the hook and slide it down into place until the hook catches the wire on the back. Use a level to make sure the picture is hanging straight on the wall. [13] X Research source Julien says “If the artwork or mirror is heavy, be sure to nail it into a wall stud or use gypsum anchors.” Use a hanging hook that can support the frame’s weight. The packaging will tell you the weight capacity of the hook."
