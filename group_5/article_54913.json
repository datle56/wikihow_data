      "content": "Alter your device's date to any date between December 15th and December 31st. The Christmas season occurs in December and into January, depending on the version of the game you're playing, but all versions will have Christmas during these dates. Change your computer's date in the system settings. The steps vary based on your operating system, though you can read this wikiHow for steps for Windows. If you don't want to actually change the date, you can launch Terraria with the application RunAsDate on Windows or faketime on macOS or Linux. On Xbox or Playstation, launch the game, then disconnect from Xbox Live or PSN. After doing so, you can change the date on your console in the system settings. On Android or iPhone , disable your phone from automatically setting the date and time, then change the date to the appropriate one. On 3DS, change the date in the device's system settings."
