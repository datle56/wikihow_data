      "content": "A Projectors’ role is to guide others. Each Human Design type has a unique role to play in society that will benefit them and the world as a whole. Projectors are natural leaders who easily pick up on the energy of others and advise them on how to best use it. [1] X Research source Projectors make up about 22% of the population. There are 3 sub-types of Projectors: classic, energy, and mental. These types are determined by which motor centers are defined within an individual’s Human Design chart. Projectors are the youngest Human Design type, with the first Projectors originating in 1781. It is believed that Projectors are here to usher in a New World."

      "title": "Their strategy is to wait for an invitation.",
      "content": "Their strategy is to wait for an invitation. Human Design strategy refers to the way in which an individual can best use their energy to create opportunities in their life. Projectors tend to be their best when they wait for someone to invite them to do something rather than jumping in head first. [2] X Research source This strategy may seem counterintuitive, as Projectors are meant to guide and direct others, but it’s important because not everyone is open to a Projector’s guidance. Waiting to be invited ensures the Projector directs their energy where it will be most effective. This doesn’t mean Projectors have to wait to be invited for every little task. Invitations are related to big life events, like careers, marriage, and choosing a place to live."

      "title": "Projectors can have 1 of 5 authorities.",
      "content": "Projectors can have 1 of 5 authorities. In Human Design, the authority refers to the way we make decisions, like following our heart or trusting our gut. Projectors are guided by their authority to determine which invitations to accept and when to accept them. Here are the 5 possible authorities a Projector could have: [3] X Research source Emotional Solar Plexus: guided by emotion Splenic: guided by intuition and safety Ego: guided by desire Self-projected: guided by personal truth Environmental: guided by the environment you’re in"

    {
      "title": "Projectors have an undefined Sacral Center.",
      "content": "Projectors have an undefined Sacral Center. In Human Design, the Sacral Center represents life force and is the source of our energy. Because a Projectors’ Sacral Center is undefined, they do not have unlimited access to their energy and often need long periods of rest between tasks. [4] X Research source Because they don’t have unlimited access to their own energy, Projectors sometimes take in, amplify, and use the energy of other types. However, if they do this too frequently, they can feel drained or burnt out."

    {
      "title": "Projectors’ Not-Self theme is bitterness.",
      "content": "Projectors’ Not-Self theme is bitterness. In Human Design, the Not-Self theme refers to how a type feels when they are not living authentically according to their strategy and authority. Projectors may be viewed as inconsistent because of their limited energy, so they often push themselves to work harder. However, because they are not living according to their strategy, they’re often overlooked and don’t get the acknowledgment they’re looking for, which can make them feel unappreciated and bitter. [5] X Research source Projectors can avoid their Not-Self theme by being patient and waiting for the right invitations so they can share their ideas where they will be most valued."
    },
    {
      "title": "Classic Projectors",
      "content": "Classic Projectors Classic Projectors, or non-energy Projectors, are the most traditional Projector sub-type. They have no defined motor centers in their chart, and because of this, they have the gift of instant clarity and automatically know which people will drain or fuel their energy. [6] X Research source Projectors are the only Human Design type with sub-types. The sub-type is determined by which centers are defined in an individual’s chart, and each sub-type uses their energy a bit differently."
    },
    {
      "title": "Energy Projectors",
      "content": "Energy Projectors Energy Projectors have at least one defined motor center (heart, emotional solar plexus, or root). Because of this, they have more access to energy than classic Projectors but are more prone to burnout. Energy Projectors need to pay attention to their authority and only accept invitations that feel right to them. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mental Projectors",
      "content": "Mental Projectors Mental Projectors have 2 or 3 of the top centers defined, with no definition below the throat. They are lifelong learners who are meant to share their opinions with the world. Their environment affects how they receive guidance on decision-making. This is a rare Projector type. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Projectors are good at reading others.",
      "content": "Projectors are good at reading others. One of the Projectors’ innate talents is to look at another Type (particularly the energy types like Generators, Manifestors, and Manifesting Generators) and know exactly what they need to do to be successful and work effectively. They’re very intuitive and easily pick up on others’ auras, allowing them to read people, look at the bigger picture, and guide others. [9] X Research source Projectors are especially good at recognizing other people’s potential and talents and guiding them toward the best decisions for their careers and energy usage."

    {
      "title": "They’re great organizers and networkers.",
      "content": "They’re great organizers and networkers. Projectors are naturally good at understanding where and how others can best use their energy, so they’re great at organizing groups, tasks, and events. Because they’re so good at reading people, they’re capable of matching others’ energy and connecting with them on a deeper level. This allows them to network and help others meet the people who are most likely to help them succeed. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They sometimes push themselves to the point of exhaustion.",
      "content": "They sometimes push themselves to the point of exhaustion. Projectors work best in short bursts of energy with plenty of breaks in between. However, modern society is set up for energetic types who can work for long periods of time. Because of this, Projectors often want to prove that they can keep up and force themselves to work far longer than they should. If they aren’t careful, this can lead to burnout. [11] X Research source Projectors aren’t lazy; they just need to use their energy differently from other types, like Generators and Manifesting Generators. It’s important to take breaks between tasks and get a full 8 hours of sleep every night to avoid exhaustion. It’s extremely easy for Projectors to feel overwhelmed. Taking deep breaths and making time for self-care are important factors for Projectors to stay mentally and physically healthy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Projectors often feel unappreciated.",
      "content": "Projectors often feel unappreciated. Because Projectors have no defined Sacral or throat centers, they often struggle with being heard or recognized when it comes to their work and accomplishments. Projectors want to feel acknowledged and appreciated for their contributions, so if they feel ignored, they often grow bitter toward the person or situation. [12] X Research source To combat this, Projectors should follow their strategy and wait to be invited. It’s important to surround themselves with people who understand them and their energy and are eager for their guidance and ideas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for an invitation before making decisions.",
      "content": "Wait for an invitation before making decisions. The best way to be successful as a Projector is to follow your strategy and authority. Even when you want to rush to make a decision, wait to make sure your energy is needed and wanted. This will prevent you from focusing your energy on situations or people that will drain you. [13] X Research source Additionally, you don’t have to say yes to every invitation. Trust your instincts and listen to your authority to decide which invitations feel right."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give yourself time to rest.",
      "content": "Give yourself time to rest. Because we live in a work-based society, you may push yourself harder than necessary to try to meet societal expectations. Remember, your energy isn’t unlimited. If you don’t allow yourself time to recuperate, you’ll likely burn yourself out. Make time for self-care. Unwind by listening to your favorite music, reading your favorite book, or practicing meditation . Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep each night, too. [14] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t compare yourself to others.",
      "content": "Don’t compare yourself to others. Because your strategy is to wait rather than act, it’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind or don’t work as hard as more energetic types. However, try to remember that everyone has a different role in society, and you’re fulfilling yours by offering guidance to those types. You’re exactly where you need to be, so don’t let insecurities stop you from seeing all your strengths and positive traits. [15] X Research source Remember, just because someone else is successful doesn’t mean you’re unsuccessful. Everyone is at a different place in life, and life isn’t a race. Take things at your own pace."

      "title": "Repeat positive affirmations to feel confident in your abilities.",
      "content": "Repeat positive affirmations to feel confident in your abilities. It’s important for Projectors to understand and come to terms with all aspects of their Human Design type in order to be successful. [16] X Research source If you find yourself struggling to connect with your strategy, authority, or any other aspect of your type, try repeating affirmations until you feel confident in your abilities. If you don’t know where to start, try some of these examples: I know my value and worth. I embrace the fact that my energetic output might not be as extensive as others. I do not have to work hard. I work smart. I allow myself personal space to unwind and reset. I am not limited by my design. I am empowered by it. I work sustainably with my energy. I embrace and celebrate the aspects of myself that are inconsistent. My self-worth is not based on recognition or measured by the output of my energy. Resting is a personal and active practice for my growth and evolution. I am enough just the way I am. I respect and honor people’s boundaries by asking if they’re open to my ideas before sharing. I allow myself to be fully seen and share myself authentically."

      "title": "Projectors do well in leadership roles.",
      "content": "Projectors do well in leadership roles. Because Projectors easily pick up on patterns and energy dynamics in others, they’re capable of being great leaders. They’re often able to see concepts and systems from a new perspective, which allows them to guide others to make better decisions. They do well in roles where they direct rather than execute. [17] X Research source Possible careers for Projectors include coaching, teaching, advising, and consulting. They may also make good counselors or therapists."
    },
    {
      "title": "Most Projectors don’t do well with manual labor.",
      "content": "Most Projectors don’t do well with manual labor. Because Projectors don’t have a defined Sacral Center, they can’t access their manual energy for long periods of time, so they may struggle with traditional 9 to 5s or jobs that require a lot of physical labor. This doesn’t mean they aren’t hard workers, but they often need to plan for periods of rest between bursts of energy. [18] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Projectors need a partner who makes them feel valued.",
      "content": "Projectors need a partner who makes them feel valued. Because recognition is often very important for Projectors and their self-esteem, they often seek partners and friends who understand and appreciate their ideas. Projectors feel most loved when their partner is open to their guidance. [19] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Projectors often form deep, meaningful connections.",
      "content": "Projectors often form deep, meaningful connections. Because Projectors are naturally good at reading others and recognizing their talents, they often form deep, emotional relationships more quickly than other types. Most Projectors are likely looking for long-term commitments and aren’t interested in fair-weather friends. [20] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They need to form and uphold boundaries in relationships.",
      "content": "They need to form and uphold boundaries in relationships. Projectors’ need for recognition and validation, as well as their ability to quickly form deep connections, means that it’s sometimes easy for them to lose themselves in a relationship. Both the Projector and their partner should create boundaries and make sure to spend time away from each other now and then. [21] X Research source It’s also important for Projectors to make sure they have plenty of time to rest and relax in a relationship. It may even help if they sleep alone a few times a week."

    {
      "title": "Projectors are often attracted to Generators and Manifesting Generators.",
      "content": "Projectors are often attracted to Generators and Manifesting Generators. Projectors are naturally drawn to energy types like Generators and Manifesting Generators because the Projectors want to help direct and guide their energy. [22] X Research source These types often work well together because of this, though Projectors can have a healthy relationship with any Human Design type as long as there is mutual respect and recognition."

    {
      "title": "Human Design is a new-age practice based on energy.",
      "content": "Human Design is a new-age practice based on energy. It combines ancient and modern holistic practices like astrology, Kabbalah, and I’Ching to help you determine how you use your energy and live your best life. Your Human Design type is based on a number of factors, like where and when you were born, and can be found by filling out a Human Design chart online. [23] X Research source There are 5 Human Design Types: Manifestors, Generators, Manifesting Generators, Projectors, and Reflectors. To read a Human Design chart , fill out all required information, like the date, time, and place of your birth. Your chart should tell you which type you are. Look at which centers are colored (defined) or white (undefined) to learn more details about how to use your energy."
