      "content": "Pour 2 tsp (1.6 g) of coffee grounds into a bowl. Pinch or scoop a few spoonfuls of coffee grounds into a small bowl. If you’ve already brewed a pot of coffee, use the old grounds from the pot. If you’re using fresh grounds, add a few drops of water into the bowl to make the coffee moist and easier to apply. If the coffee isn’t moist, then it won’t adhere to your skin very well. Coffee powder can also work for this treatment! If you’re using instant coffee packets, 1 sachet should do the trick.

      "content": "Mix in 0.5 tablespoons (7.4 mL) of honey to make your skin feel smooth. Squeeze a small amount of liquid honey into your bowl of coffee grounds, then use a spoon to stir the mixture together.

      "content": "Spread the grounds in a curved, 1 in (2.5 cm) line beneath your eye. Apply the coffee grounds beneath the inner corner of your eye. Move your fingers slowly, so you don’t get any grounds in your eyes. As you apply the coffee to your under eye area, focus on creating a line that’s around 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. Then, repeat the process on your opposite eye. [10] X Research source Always work outwards from the inner corner of your eye. If necessary, dip into the coffee mixture again to evenly coat the skin. Double check that you’ve covered the entirety of your under eye bags with the coffee before letting the grounds sit on your skin."

After the coffee mixture is gone, use another damp cloth or tissue to finish cleaning off your skin. At this point, look in the mirror to see if you notice a difference in your eye bags!

      "content": "Repeat this process twice a week, or as needed. Once or twice each week, continue applying coffee grounds over your eye bags. Perform the treatment on days when your bags are especially prominent, like when you first wake up. As you go about your normal schedule, try incorporating this new treatment into your standard skincare routine. [13] X Research source"
