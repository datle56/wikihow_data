      "content": "A Taurus man wants someone with a stellar personality, not just looks. Try playing up your sense of humor to help you stand out and stick in his mind. Engage in some witty text banter, reference any inside jokes if you have them, or send memes and YouTube clips that you think he'd enjoy. Your sense of humor is one of a kind, and he'll miss the one person that really makes him laugh (you!). If you have a class together, send him a text referencing something funny or absurd your professor did that day. Try, \"Omg still can't stop laughing at what happened in class today.\" Text him a GIF from his favorite comedy. If his favorite movie is Hot Rod, send over a funny GIF along with the caption, \"This made me think of you.\" Save sarcasm for your in-person interactions. A sarcastic text can lead to misunderstandings pretty easily, especially if you don't know each other super well."

      "content": "Show the Taurus man you fancy that you don't need him. It may seem counter-intuitive, but seeing that you're happy with yourself without his approval will make him want you more. Play up your accomplishments when you text him and be vocal about your thoughts and opinions. Avoid putting yourself down or seeming insecure when you hang out as best you can. It can be hard to do, but your self-assurance will make this Taurus man go after you in no time. When you're chatting about your passion for trivia, don't be shy about all the trivia nights you've won. Say something like, \"I don't tell everyone this, but I'm actually a trivia aficionado...\" After getting back from a movie date, text him about what you thought of it. You might try, \"I loved the characters and the costumes, but some of those plot twists were just too much for me. What did you think?\" If you struggle to feel confident on dates, that's totally normal. Try giving yourself a pre-date pep talk to boost your self-esteem. You can also repeat positive messages in your head, such as, \"I'm super cute and worthy of love\" or \"I can do this!\""
