Alternatively, you can open a 3D rending program, like Blender, or pull up a video editing program and drop in some large files to edit. Anything that has intensive graphics will work for this test.

      "content": "Monitor the fans while the game or program runs. Assuming your GPU is mounted horizontally, look underneath it to see if the fans are moving. If your GPU is mounted vertically, you should see the fans facing you. As the game or program progresses, your fans should kick on at some point if they’re working correctly. The GPU normally has to reach around 55-60℃ before the fans turn on, so let the game or program run for a while to give the GPU time to heat up."

      "content": "Your GPU is fine if the fans turn on and off. If the GPU’s fans spin while the game or program is running but they shut off once you’re done testing, the fans are working correctly. GPU fans are only supposed to kick on when the GPU generates excess heat, so it’s 100% normal for the fans not to turn when you aren’t doing anything intensive. If the fans do not turn on at all, your GPU fans may not be working correctly. Just to clarify, your GPU fans are fine if they turn on while playing a game or running a big program, but they stay off when you’re just web browsing or replying to emails . The fans are not supposed to run all the time."

Then, locate the fan settings menu. Every motherboard has its own BIOS interface, so you may need to poke around a bit in the various menus to find your GPU fans. [2] X Research source Alternative: You may be able to set the fan curves in your GPU’s proprietary software. If you’ve already downloaded your GPU brand’s software, check there first. What’s the setup key? It depends on your motherboard. Here are the most common options. ASUS – F2 Acer – F2 or DEL Dell – F2 or F12 HP – F10 Lenovo – F1 (Enter and F1 for ThinkPad models) MSI – DEL"

      "content": "Reshape the fan curves based on your personal preferences. Once you’ve located the fan curve settings, adjust them to suit your preferences. Drag the individual points for each temperature profile until the curve Generally speaking, the default fan curves should be ideal. However, you may want to raise the bottom end of the curve if your computer tends to run hot, or raise the high end if you run a lot of very intense programs and your CPU has trouble keeping up. As a rule of thumb, it’s better to have your fans come on too early than too late. The fans need to run to dispel heat, and an overheating GPU is prone to fail. The downside of raising your GPU fans so that they run more frequently is that your GPU will wear down faster than it otherwise normally would. It shouldn’t cause your GPU to fail or anything, though."
