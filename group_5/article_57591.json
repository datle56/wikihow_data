      "content": "Fill a small container with a spoonful of baking soda. Any plastic or paper container will work for this. Set your container down with a newspaper or towel underneath, and add 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 g) of baking soda to the empty container. [1] X Research source The more baking soda you use, the more powerful the reaction will be. This is the classic volcano experiment that many people are familiar with. If you want to make a volcano, set a paper cup down and use modeling clay to form the body of the volcano around the cup."

      "title": "Pour distilled white vinegar slowly into the container.",
      "content": "Pour distilled white vinegar slowly into the container. Put on some rubber gloves and protective eyewear . Use a funnel or watering can to slowly pour distilled white vinegar into the container. The baking soda and vinegar reaction takes a few seconds to occur, so don’t pour the vinegar out all at once! [2] X Research source If you pour too quickly, the reaction will cause a serious mess. White vinegar can be a skin irritant, so try to avoid getting wet as your explosion goes off. Baking soda and vinegar react because vinegar is an acid and baking soda is a base. The combination creates an explosion burst of carbonation that causes the vinegar to bubble up and expand."

      "content": "Set out all of your supplies. Get some 30% hydrogen peroxide , dish soap , food coloring , dried yeast , water, a funnel, and an empty 2 liter (0.5 US gal) soda bottle. [3] X Research source Set up your demonstration in an area that will be easy to clean up."

      "content": "Pour some hydrogen peroxide into the empty soda bottle. Hydrogen peroxide is a skin irritant, so throw on some rubber gloves and protective eyewear . Pour a little bit of hydrogen peroxide into your empty container so that you fill the bottom 1/4 of the bottle. [4] X Research source Use a funnel and get help from an adult if you’re worried about making a mess."

      "content": "Add some food coloring to make the explosion vibrant. This is optional, but whatever color you add will look really neat once the explosion goes off! Add a healthy squirt of food coloring if you want your explosion to have a color. You can use any color you like. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the watery yeast into the soda bottle.",
      "content": "Pour the watery yeast into the soda bottle. Pour it in quickly and stand back! The reaction will cause the peroxide, yeast, and soap to expand and shoot out the top of the bottle. [8] X Research source The yeast and the hydrogen peroxide will combine to make an explosion of foam. The dish soap helps capture the oxygen to enable the explosion to take place. Be careful, this reaction is exothermic, which means it creates heat. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a bar of Ivory soap. Choose a fresh, unused bar of unscented Ivory soap . The brand is important, so don’t try to swap the Ivory out for some other brand. [10] X Research source Unscented Ivory soap is unique because it’s almost entirely pure soap (in the sense that it’s just raw fat and oil, which is actually what soap is!). Because it’s so pure, the air pockets inside of the soap will expand when you heat it."

[15] X Trustworthy Source American Chemical Society Scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer-reviewed scientific journals Go to source This is probably the messiest way to make an explosion, so be sure to work in an area that is easy to clean up! If possible, do this outside. You can actually do this experiment with any soda, but the aspartame levels in Diet Coke and Diet A&W Root Beer are very high. Aspartame is a key ingredient in the explosion, so your results may be lacking if you choose a soda other than Diet Coke or A&W. The lack of sugar also makes cleanup a lot less sticky! [16] X Research source Use a brand-new soda. A flat soda will make a less impressive explosion."
