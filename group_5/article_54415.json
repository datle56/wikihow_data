      "content": "Test each comb. Don't test it on your hair, as some combs may cause damage to your hair. Test it on a doll with tangly hair or anything else that has tangly hair, but not family/friends or it may damage their hair too. When testing, look at how the comb smoothes out the hair. Test combing your hair with that comb, but only at least an inch of hair (remember:damage!). Test this on hairy, tangly things you don't want. See if that comb causes damage. Don't test this on your hair. Choose the comb that doesn't cause damage. Before doing this, test that comb many times to make sure it really won't cause damage. [1] X Research source"

Choose a comb with the right bristles and right amount. Try to find a comb that does not cause damage and has at least more than a 100 bristles."
