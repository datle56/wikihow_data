In Sanskrit, namaste translates to “I bow to you.” The term comes from 2 Sanskrit words: namah and te . Namah means “bow,” and te means “to you.” Therefore, namaste is often said while bowing to demonstrate honor or respect to the universe, others, or self.

[5] X Research source Some argue that the Americanized version of namaste is culturally inaccurate, insensitive, and takes away from the term’s Hindu origins. [6] X Research source"
