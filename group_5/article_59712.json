      "content": "Scorpio’s love languages are physical touch and quality time. Expert astrologer Angel Eyedealism explains how “vulnerability is a cherished prize for a Scorpio. Without vulnerability, there is no intimacy—and that’s why Scorpio is the sign of intimacy, because they like to lay everything bare.” With this in mind, any sort of physical touch can be a great way to show the Scorpio in your life how loved and appreciated they are. This love language spans all types of physical affection, like cuddling, kissing, hugging, and even holding hands. [2] X Research source Eyedealism also notes how Scorpios have “an obsessive need for privacy.” The “quality time” love language could be a way to respect this as you strike a balance between spending quality time with your partner and giving them quality time by themselves. Scorpios also tend toward long-term relationships with emotional depth and serious devotion. So, it’s no wonder that they love spending lots of time with their significant other! Reader Poll: We asked 704 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios and only 5% of them said that they mainly look for totally casual and strictly physical relationships. [Take Poll]"

Quality time can be just about any activity that gives you personal, meaningful time with your Scorpio. Cooking a delicious meal together, playing board games, or enjoying a home movie night together are all great ways to enjoy each other’s company."
