      "content": "A “serial dater” is someone who jumps from relationship to relationship without committing long-term. They tend to love the thrill of the chase with no strings attached. Serial daters may date several different people in the same week or even on the same day, all while concealing their true intentions. There are many different reasons a person might be a serial dater - they’re not looking for anything serious, they don’t like commitment or loneliness, they enjoy the “serial dater lifestyle,” they don’t know what they want in a partner, etc. However, the general idea is still the same: they don’t commit to relationships easily and move on quickly after the romance of early dating fades.

      "content": "Your dates with them are always casual. Whether they take you to a local dive bar or an arcade, there’s always a laid-back vibe to your dates. It's okay to keep things casual, but if you want to move forward in the relationship and your partner does not, that might be a red flag. They may shy away from dates where the two of you have to sit down and talk, and they seem to be more focused on having fun than getting to know who you are. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "They like long romantic dates or grand gestures.",
      "content": "They like long romantic dates or grand gestures. Alternatively, instead of keeping their dates casual, they may try to completely sweep you off your feet. They might have not only taken you out to dinner but also on a candlelit walk along the pier and out to the best ice cream joint, stretching the date out for hours. Not every dream date means they could be a serial dater, but if all of your early dates try to imitate romcom-levels of dreaminess, it may be a sign they’re trying to woo you so you fall for them quickly. Serial daters tend to focus on earning money, showing off their success, or seeking out someone who has both of those things. While grand romantic gestures can be a sign that they’re serious about you, be sure not to ignore any signs that they could be using you for their own personal gain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "They push you to get intimate quickly. Some serial daters can be more interested in pursuing opportunities for sex than seeking emotional intimacy. This can be OK if both parties are looking for a one-night stand or a casual relationship. However, if you’re looking for a serious relationship and they’re pushing for sex right away, it could be a sign that they’re a serial dater.

      "content": "They have a history of ending short relationships. You might notice that if you dig into their dating history, they have a long list of past relationships, especially ones in which they are the ones who end the relationship. Take note when they mention their dating experiences. If they seem overly casual or talk about their previous relationships without much emotional investment, that could be a red flag. They could also refuse to talk about their previous relationships. Watch for signs your date is hiding details, or if their stories just don’t add up. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "They don’t talk with you about your relationship or life after the date. Your date might be hiding details or even lying about their past relationships to hide their true intentions. They might also avoid talking about their emotions, how they feel about your relationship or their future with you. Look for signs that your partner is dodging personal questions or steering clear of talking about life with you after the date is over. When the two of you are talking, it may even seem like they’re avoiding getting to know you, or like they only focus on themselves. Note when your date keeps you at arm's length or never asks you questions about yourself. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "They like to make you jealous. Whether they flirt constantly with other people (while you’re right next to them), text other people when you’re around, or talk about the other people they’re seeing, serial daters can make you feel jealous. If your serial-dating partner knows you want a deeper relationship and still flirts with others, this can be unhealthy and manipulative. [9] X Research source They might not hide the fact that they’re dating around or they might use a dating app while they’re still around you. Many serial daters benefit from dating apps since they can talk to a variety of people at once and keep their options open. [10] X Research source"

Take note if your conversations only last a handful of minutes or if it seems like they prioritize their career or their own needs and desires over building a meaningful relationship with you. They might also seem like they always have a dark storm cloud hovering over them, or like they show interest one day and pull back the next. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "They randomly go off the grid. This can be one of the clearest signs that they’re not looking for anything serious. They might consistently break off or reschedule your plans or they may ghost you entirely. They may go MIA to maintain their independence, avoid getting too invested in the relationship, or explore other romantic options. It can be incredibly frustrating to put your heart on the line, only for them to ignore your attempts to hang out. Just remember that it’s probably not your fault. [12] X Research source"

They may disappear or withdraw when things start getting serious, only to reappear later, seeking attention or validation. Take note if your partner doesn’t make an effort to move the relationship forward."

      "content": "Be open and honest about your expectations. If you still want to pursue the person you’re dating, then being honest can be the best way to communicate your feelings. Tell them openly what you’re looking for in a relationship and allow the opportunity for them to do the same. This will help you see if your goals align or if it would be better to part ways. “I’m interested in settling down with the person I’m dating. I really like you, and I’d like to take this relationship to the next level. Would you be interested in something more serious?” Reader Poll: We asked 659 wikiHow readers about what they wanted from their romantic life, and only 8% of people said they enjoyed periods of casual dating without building any lasting connections. [Take Poll] So if your ultimate goal is to move from casual to committed, that's totally normal!"

      "content": "Try to take things slow. If you want to continue the relationship, resist the urge to get too emotionally invested too quickly. By pacing the relationship, you can prioritize your own needs and potentially protect yourself from heartbreak. Focus on building a personal connection while observing their actions so you can determine their level of commitment. Put your own well-being first. Spend time with your friends and family, engage in self-care activities, and seek a fulfilling life outside of dating. This will help keep you from becoming emotionally dependent on the serial dater."

      "content": "Consider ending the relationship. If the serial dater is unwilling to meet your relationship expectations, then maybe it’s time to move to greener pastures. Although ending a relationship can be painful, continuously seeking a connection that leaves you unfulfilled can hurt more in the long run. One-sided relationships can have damaging effects, especially if one side is taking advantage of the other. While change is possible, if an unequal relationship brings you stress and decreases your self-esteem, know when it may be time to cut ties and move on. [13] X Research source"

However, don’t assume they’re going to change overnight. Change is an individual journey, and not all serial daters may choose or be able to change their dating behavior. [14] X Research source If you want to pursue a committed relationship with them, try to have an open and honest conversation with them about their behavior. Ask them if they really want to be in a relationship, or if they’re just playing the field. If they aren’t interested in anything deeper, don’t try to change their mind for them – it may be better for both of you to go your separate ways. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Serial dating is not inherently good or bad. Serial dating can be problematic when it involves manipulative or dishonest behavior, like leading on multiple people at the same time or using others for their body or money without considering their feelings. However, some people date multiple people casually to explore their options, seek personal growth, or branch out and enjoy a variety of experiences. The biggest problem with serial dating comes up when there's a mismatch in expectations and emotional investment. Serial daters might intentionally or unintentionally hurt others who are looking for a committed relationship by stringing them along for their own enjoyment. [16] X Research source"
