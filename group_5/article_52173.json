Remove the top sheets, fitted sheets, and mattress protector. [1] X Research source Wash the bedding, including sheets, linens, and pillowcases, in the washing machine while the mattress is being cleaned. If you use a duvet, remove the cover and wash it with the linens. Read and follow care labels when washing any fabrics. Use the hottest water and dryer settings possible to kill any bacteria or dust mites that may be hiding in your linens. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your vacuum’s upholstery and crevice tools to remove debris. The first step to cleaning your mattress is vacuuming. This removes mites, dust, dead skin, hair, and other debris from the mattress. Use a wide brush attachment to vacuum the mattress top. Then, use the long upholstery nozzle or crevice tool to get into cracks, vacuum edges and piping, and clean the sides and corners. [3] X Research source Before vacuuming, make sure the nozzle and brush attachments are completely clean."

      "content": "Skim a steam cleaner over the mattress to help kill dust mites. To steam clean your mattress , hold the steamer head above the mattress’s surface without touching it. Use long, slow strokes to go over the entire surface with the steam cleaner . Keep your hand moving and don’t concentrate on one spot or the mattress may get too wet. [4] X Research source Check your mattress label to see if it’s safe to steam clean it. Look for a symbol that looks like an iron with lines coming down from the bottom. If the symbol has an X over the lines, don’t steam it. [5] X Research source Steam cleaning your mattress may not be necessary but is recommended if you suspect you might have dust mites. Allow the mattress to dry completely before moving on to the next step."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda over the mattress to absorb odors. Baking soda naturally neutralizes odors and helps absorb moisture. Sprinkle a generous dusting of baking soda over the entire surface of the mattress. To give your mattress a fresh smell, stir five drops of your favorite essential oil into the baking soda before sprinkling it onto the mattress. [6] X Research source To apply the baking soda more evenly, pour it into a sifter first, and then distribute it over the mattress. Let the baking soda sit on the mattress for at least 30 minutes. This gives it time to break down acids, neutralize smells, and absorb any liquid left over from your spot cleaning. [7] X Research source Leave the baking soda on for several hours if you have the time. The longer it’s on the mattress, the more it absorbs and cleans."

You'll take acids, odors, and liquid that the baking soda has absorbed along with it.

      "content": "Open a window or use a fan to air out the mattress. Once the mattress is clean, it’s a good idea to let it air out so it is completely dry before re-making the bed. Moisture that’s trapped inside the mattress can lead to mold, which is very difficult to remove. [9] X Research source During the warmer seasons, open a window in the room to let in fresh air and dry out the mattress faster. Open drapes and curtains to let in the sunshine, as the UV rays in the sun help kill bacteria and mold on the mattress, eliminating even more odors and drying it out faster.

      "content": "Flip or rotate your mattress to ensure even wear. For conventional inner-spring mattresses that don’t have a designated top and bottom, flip the mattress over so you're sleeping on the other side. Rotate mattresses with a designated top and bottom – like memory foam and hybrid mattresses – 180 degrees so the head ends up at the foot of the bed. This ensures even wear over the surface of the mattress. [11] X Research source If you flip the mattress, make sure to vacuum and deodorize the second side before re-making the bed. Flip or rotate your mattress every three to six months to ensure even wear. When the mattress is clean, dry, flipped, and protected, make the bed with your clean linens. Start with the fitted sheet, followed by the top sheet. Put the pillows back in their cases, and return all pillows, blankets, and decorations to the bed. [12] X Research source Feel the mattress before making the bed to check for moisture. If you encase a damp mattress in linens and blankets, it won’t dry out, and you'll have mold growth.

Close the bottle and shake it to combine them together and create suds. Spray the solution onto the stain. Use an old toothbrush to gently scrub the solution into the stains. Then, allow it to sit for 20-30 minutes. Blot the excess cleaner with a clean, damp cloth. [15] X Research source This solution is effective to treat stains from dirt, food, and drinks. Alternatively, expert house cleaning professional Chris Willatt says, “You can hit [the stain] with some Oxi Clean and it dyes [the mattress] and turns it back to white.” [16] X Expert Source Chris Willatt House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 12 July 2019. For a memory foam mattress, use only the smallest amount of cleaner possible, because memory foam should never get saturated."

[17] X Research source Mattresses, especially memory foam, aren't designed to get wet, so use as little cleaner as necessary to treat the stains. An enzyme cleaner breaks down the proteins in blood, urine, sweat, vomit, oil, grease, and other biological stains.

If the protector is machine washable, toss it in the machine and add at least 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of laundry detergent. Wash the mattress protector by setting the machine to a hot cycle to disinfect it. Tumble dry the protector in the dryer on low heat or hang it to dry. [20] X Research source Look for a symbol that looks like a cup filled with water. If it has an X through it, your mattress protector is not machine washable. [21] X Research source Avoid washing mattress protectors unless the label specifically states it’s machine washable. If it’s not washable, sprinkle baking soda on it, then let it sit for 30 minutes and vacuum it before removing it from the mattress."
