      "content": "Fortnite’s ranks measure your skill level to match it with other players. Ranked levels enable you to play with players with the same rank as you, and ranks are based on the points you score in matches. The ranking system also factors into the quality of your enemies and your lobby. There are 18 total ranks in Fortnite, and the first 5 have three tiers each to win before proceeding to the next rank. Fortnite’s ranked levels are: [1] X Research source Bronze (I, II, and III) Silver (I, II, and III) Gold (I, II, and III) Platinum (I, II, and III) Diamond (I, II, and III) Elite Champion Unreal"

      "content": "Ranked matches are available in Battle Royale and Zero Build mode. Additionally, you can play matches solo or in groups in each mode. Battle Royale features ranked solo, duo, and squad matches, while Zero Build features solo, duo, and squad matches. Each mode has its own rank, and matchmaking is different based on whether you’re solo or with a team. [2] X Research source In solo matches, you’ll be matched against opponents with the same rank (or a similar one). In duo and squad games, your party rank equals the highest-ranking teammate’s rank, and you’ll be matched with teams with the same (or similar) party rank."

      "title": "Initial ranks are decided by the first match at the start of each season.",
      "content": "Initial ranks are decided by the first match at the start of each season. However, your initial rank will be based on past performances and your first match in both Battle Royale and Zero Build matches. It’s possible to be demoted and drop to a lower rank based on your ongoing performance; you can’t drop to lower ranks for the rest of the season after you reach Unreal. [3] X Research source After reaching Unreal, your progress will be recorded on a global leaderboard, and you’ll get a number (which you can raise) to represent your rank among Unreal players worldwide. Experienced players will likely get a higher rank right away at the start of each season (like Platinum or Diamond), while newer players might have a lower initial rank."

      "content": "Eliminations Eliminating opponents in a match adds to your score, allowing you to earn points that count toward your ranking. The game will factor in the number of eliminations you (or your team) got, as well as the rank of the opponents you eliminated. However, keep in mind that eliminations in the match count more than early ones. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Placement",
      "content": "Placement The higher you place in a match, the higher your points—and the better your score will be. You can earn points by advancing in a match and surviving to the end. Thus, to improve your rank, the goal is to place as high as possible—whether you get to the top 10 or get 1st place in a match (which is ideal). [5] X Research source Teams are treated as one unit in ranked matches, meaning they’ll earn points equally based on the team’s collective eliminations and placement after a match."

      "content": "Match Type You’ll get different points depending on the match you play. The highest points come from major tournaments like the World Cup and FNCS Invitational, while Cash Cups and Hype Nights come with moderate points. Finally, regular rank matches award the least points. [6] X Research source Thus, if you want to increase your rank fast, aim to perform well in matches with higher point values."

      "content": "Performance in a Match Your performance in a match is influenced by many factors, including the amount of damage you deal (and take from opponents), the materials you collect, and any objectives you complete during the match. After a match, Fortnite will measure your general performance and reward you if you perform well, regardless of eliminations or how high you place. [7] X Research source Ranking up in Fortnite is about getting as many points as possible across all the factors affecting matches—eliminations, placement, match type, and performance!"

Practice is the easiest (and most effective) way to get better at Fortnite—and, in the process, improve your rank. So, when you can, try grinding as many matches as possible—in both modes and as a solo, duo, and squad. [8] X Research source Playing in every mode will help you learn the ins and outs of each one, so you’ll be able to excel (and improve your rank) no matter what kind of match you’re playing."

Early fights don’t award as many points (which count toward your ranking), so try landing in a fairly secluded spot so you can survive the start of the match easily. Endgame fights offer the most points, so pick and choose your battles wisely! Save your strength for fights at the end of the match; that’ll boost your ranking. [9] X Research source"

Come up with a strategy to win before the match, put it into action once it begins, and act carefully.

High ground is most helpful when you need to get the drop on an opponent since you’ll get bonuses for being above them. Furthermore, it’s important to know about the battleground map’s layout, including landing zones and resource locations. [12] X Research source When you’re aware of your surroundings and the map, it’s easier to find a good position early on and collect supplies when you need them!"

Try not to go into a match without an understanding of the team you’re with; it’s easier to strategize and communicate when you know one another’s strengths and weaknesses. If you don’t know your team’s abilities, you might not know how to coordinate movements and attacks or decide when to move at the right time. [13] X Research source If you ever feel like you make a mistake in a match, you can always view the VOD (video on demand) to see what happened—and then learn from that mistake in the next match. Additionally, don’t stick to a strategy that isn’t working (or use the same strategy with every match). Be adaptable! Learn how to figure out what would work best depending on the situation and switch tactics as needed."
