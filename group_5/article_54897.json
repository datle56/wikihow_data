      "content": "Stop the behavior that got you sprayed (accidentally or intentionally). For instance, if you or someone else mishandled the bottle of spray (in relaxed circumstances or playing), be careful. By continuing the behavior, you can cause more exposure and more damage to be incurred on you or any person in the vicinity. Never do something illegal, because someone can pepper spray you to stop you from: Committing a violent crime (e.g. in self-defense) Leaving after you clearly committed a crime (e.g. by a citizen's arrest), especially when it's a felony, and Resisting arrest if that person is a police officer who is arresting you, which is illegal, even if you're innocent."

Get a basin or a container that can hold water and is clean. Be careful, and don't panic while getting the materials. Get some soap. Try dish soap, because it works fine. If the pepper spray was chemical, then you may be wary of mixing it with the dish soap, but you should be fine using Dawn or similar brands. What you may need is a fingernail brush."

      "content": "Take your hands out of the water. After letting them dry a little (they shouldn't be dripping water anymore), you can wash them again. You should make sure to wash them like you did the first time. Do this step until your hands feel normal again. If they always felt fine (no pain or burning) then you should still wash them at least 5 times. Wash them more between 5-10, if you felt pain or burning, though. If your hands were very contaminated then you may want to change the dishwater between the first, second, and third washings."
