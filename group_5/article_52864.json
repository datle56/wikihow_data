      "content": "Clear quartz balances and cleanses the negative energy around you. It’s an extremely versatile crystal, and it’s thought to be able to absorb and dispel negative energy while attracting positive energy at the same time. That’s why clear quartz is ideal for cleansing the energy in your space and helping you release any negativity that is no longer serving you. It also amplifies other crystals and enhances their abilities. Always set an intention before using clear quartz! It’s an impressionable stone and works best when you have a specific purpose for it. Hold a crystal in your hand and state your intentions for it. For example, you might say, “I am banishing the negative energy from my life,” or “I am deflecting negativity and attracting positivity.” From there, keep your crystal on your person at all times to get the most from its protective abilities. You might keep one in your pocket, place it on your bedside at night, or wear crystals as jewelry (such as necklaces, earrings, or rings)."

      "content": "Black obsidian wards away and absorbs negative energy in your home. The crystal is believed to protect you and your surroundings from dark energy and help you come to terms with difficult emotions that might be weighing you down.

[6] X Research source Keep a black obsidian stone near each of the entryways in your home to ensure they absorb all the negative energy trying to get inside. Alternatively, keep a crystal in any room you feel has high levels of negative, unpleasant energy—from your bedroom to your living room. It’s also very important to cleanse your black obsidian often to prevent negative energy from building up and making the crystal less effective. There are plenty of ways to cleanse crystals (clear away negative energy and replenish their natural positive energy). For example, you could soak them in a saltwater bath for an hour, leave them outside overnight to be cleansed by moonlight, or hold them under running water."

Keep the opal crystal pressed directly against your skin whenever possible—which is why a piece of jewelry, like a necklace or bracelet, may be especially effective."
