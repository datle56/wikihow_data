It uses FaceTime to make calls, which can cause problems. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue: Go to FaceTime in the iPhone Settings app. Under the section “you can be reached by FaceTime at,” make sure there is a checkmark next to your email address. Make a FaceTime call using your iPhone. Then, make a FaceTime call to that person again using the call history in the Apple Watch Phone app. Then, use Walkie-Talkie to call the person. Send the invite multiple times. It can take several attempts before the invitation shows up. Turn off Bluetooth. If you have an Apple Watch with a cellular plan, turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone. Then try using Walkie-Talkie to make a call."
