Press your thumb up with moderate force and open your mouth until it is comfortably wide, against the resistance of your thumb. Hold the position for 5-10 seconds.

      "title": "Locate the notch in front of your ear and under your cheekbone.",
      "content": "Locate the notch in front of your ear and under your cheekbone. Press your fingertip against the underside of your cheekbone, about 1 in (2.5 cm) in front of your ear. After some probing, you should find a small indentation or notch. This is a pressure point that you can use to massage your masseter muscle. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Located on both sides of your face, your masseter muscles power your jaw, especially when you bite or chew. Based on their size, your masseter muscles are the strongest muscles in your body."

      "content": "Press your finger, thumb, or knuckle into the notch. Push inward and slightly upward with your fingertip until you feel a “sweet ache”—in other words, the soothing but slightly painful feeling you probably associate with a massage. If you find it difficult to press firmly enough with your fingertip, try your thumb or knuckle. [6] X Research source Don’t aim for outright pain here—push until you feel only slight discomfort."

      "content": "Apply constant pressure or kneading circles to the notch. Once you have the pressure right, you can simply hold your finger, thumb, or knuckle in place. Alternatively, try making small circles with your finger, thumb, or knuckle while maintaining pressure on the notch. [7] X Research source Massage the area for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then switch to your other cheek. Do this massage every night before bedtime. You can also do it when you wake up in the morning, and any other time that your jaw feels tight."

      "title": "Increase the pressure you apply over time.",
      "content": "Increase the pressure you apply over time. Since your masseters are such dense, strong muscles, it can take a lot of pressure to soothe and loosen them. Over time, you’ll probably find that you need to apply greater pressure to get the same results. That’s fine—your masseters can handle it! [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Switch to using your knuckle if you can’t apply adequate pressure with your finger or thumb."

These are very common stress responses that can cause jaw tightness and pain, as well as dental problems. By better managing the stress in your life, you’ll reduce these behaviors.

      "content": "Train yourself to keep your teeth separated during the day. If easing your stress isn’t enough to reduce your jaw clenching or teeth grinding, try to catch yourself in the act throughout the day. When you notice it, focus on holding your mouth in the proper position—teeth slightly apart, tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth just behind the front teeth. [11] X Research source Ideally, your teeth should only touch when you’re eating. You can also try holding your mouth open wide (but not painfully wide) for 1-2 minutes at a time whenever you notice yourself clenching or grinding. This might not be a good idea during a budget meeting, though!"

While the masseter muscles that power your jaw are some of the strongest muscles in your body, you can still overwork them by chewing. During the day, and especially as bedtime nears, avoid hard-to-manage foods like a tough steak, chewy candy, or a whole carrot. [13] X Research source Skip chewing gum as well, especially in the evening if you get nighttime jaw pain. Also avoid clenching your teeth around non-foods like pencils, straws, or toothpicks."
