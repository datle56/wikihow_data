      "content": "The Bible forbids taking the Lord’s name in vain. Exodus 20:7 says, “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.” Christians believe God’s name should be revered, and using it in phrases like “on God” and “oh my God” is disrespectful. For this reason, most Christians agree that saying “on God” is a sin. [1] X Research source Matthew 5:36-37 says, “And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No;’ anything more than this comes from evil.” This means that Christians shouldn’t need to take oaths to swear their honesty because they should already be living honestly and telling the truth."

      "title": "On God is a slang phrase used to show you’re being truthful.",
      "content": "On God is a slang phrase used to show you’re being truthful. Mostly used by younger generations, if someone says “on God,” it essentially means they’re swearing on God that they’re being honest. It’s similar to saying “I swear to God.” The phrase has gained popularity through social media like TikTok, memes, and song lyrics. [2] X Research source Many people use the expression when others are skeptical of whatever they’re telling them. For example, one might say, “On God, I just found $100 on the ground.” Most Christians believe saying “on God” is taking the Lord’s name in vain, like saying “Oh my God” or “I swear to God,” and that fellow Christians should avoid using the phrase."

      "title": "Christians can swear before God in a court of law.",
      "content": "Christians can swear before God in a court of law. While the Bible forbids making unnecessary oaths and taking the Lord’s name in vain, it does not prohibit taking formal oaths, making solemn promises, or signing contracts. In these cases, invoking God’s Word is meant to make one aware of God’s presence, as His honor and righteousness are held as a standard. [3] X Research source For example, in a court of law, witnesses traditionally place their hand on the Bible and swear before God to tell the truth. This is an acceptable time to take an oath. It’s also okay to mention God in your wedding vows, as these are carefully thought-out promises. Otherwise, avoid using God’s name in jest or in disrespectful situations. Remember, God’s name is to be praised, not used as an exclamation or an afterthought."

      "title": "Pray to God and confess your sins.",
      "content": "Pray to God and confess your sins. If you have intentionally or accidentally taken the Lord’s name in vain, one of the best things you can do as a Christian is to pray and ask for forgiveness . Remember that God is forgiving, and continue to pray to and honor Him daily. [4] X Research source Theology expert Olivia Woodford says prayer is the “foundation for any religious practice.” If you’re unsure how to start praying, she says, “The first thing is to express gratitude or thanks,” then, when you’re asking God for help, “don’t demand” but rather be vulnerable and express your need for help."

      "content": "Ask others to point out when you take His name in vain. If you’re used to taking the Lord’s name in vain, you may not even realize when you’re doing it. If this is a habit you want to break , ask friends or family to stop you any time you do so. With their help, you’ll soon be able to catch yourself and adjust your speech patterns.

      "content": "Pay attention to how others use His name. In conversations, notice when people use the names God and Jesus respectfully and how it differs from when they’re used casually and in vain. Surrounding yourself with those who use His name positively will help reinforce your understanding of how to use it correctly. [6] X Research source"

Don’t lose hope and continue challenging yourself to do your best. God understands your intention and will forgive your mistakes. [7] X Research source"
