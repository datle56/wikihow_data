Each knows Tackle and Mud-Slap, and Pidgeotto knows Gust. Pidgey is at level 7, while Pidgeotto is at level 9. Trainers that picked Chikorita may have a difficult time with this gym. Exercise patience. Falkner will give you the Zephyr Badge, which you will need to use Flash (he will also give you TM31, Mud-Slap)."
