Danker points out, \"You can have two people in a relationship where one person feels like [sexting is] cheating and the other person feels like it isn't cheating.\" If you and your partner have pre-established that sexting crosses the line, then it’s infidelity—but if you and your partner haven’t set that boundary, it’s worth exploring your individual personal views on the subject so you know what’s expected of you both within your marriage or relationship. [1] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source “Infidelity” looks different to different people, but generally speaking, it’s a breach of trust—physical or emotional—that indicates a lack of commitment to one’s partner. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Banker suggests, \"I think that in general, the majority of people that are traditionally monogamous would say that if you are emotionally and sexually engaging with another person outside of the [relationship], then you are cheating.\" People who consider sexting cheating may view it as somewhere between an emotional affair and a physical affair, evidence of an emotional affair, or a precursor to a physical affair."

People sext to share sexual desires, turn-ons, turn-offs, fantasies, or just for fun. [3] X Research source Note that sexting is consensual: sending random nudes to someone who didn’t ask for them and doesn’t want them is just harassment. [4] X Research source Despite what you might think, sexting isn’t always about sex. Studies indicate the main motivations behind sexting in relationships include using it as foreplay for sex later on; using it to get relationship reassurance from a partner; and using it as a “favor” to a partner, with the hope that the favor will later be returned in a non-sexual way. [5] X Research source The fact that many couples use sex to get reassurance from their partners showcases how sexting may be seen as a form of emotional betrayal."

Ask your partner if you can have a discussion at a time when neither of you has anything going on and you’re both relatively calm and comfortable. Let them know what you’ve discovered, and share how it made you feel to find that on their phone. Keegan advises remaining calm, even though you're likely feeling upset: \"[A]sk him about it, get him to open up about it and see how he responds.... [I]f you keep your head clear [and] look at...how is he responding...maybe you can move forward with the relationship.\" “Mandy, I saw those texts you shared with Joan, and I was really shocked and hurt. I know we haven’t exactly established what counts as cheating in this relationship, but I was still really surprised. Can we talk about this?” “Joel, you left your computer open, and I saw some really upsetting messages you sent. We discussed this and agreed sexting wasn’t OK, so I’m just so hurt and angry and confused. What happened?”"

Whether you and your partner have previously discussed what qualifies as infidelity in your relationship or not, now may be a time to ensure you both know what one another’s personal boundaries are . For instance, maybe pornography is OK, but sexting isn’t. Clarify your expectations as much as possible. [9] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source If you and your partner haven’t discussed what qualifies as cheating in your relationship, you may feel conflicted here: did they do anything wrong? If you feel upset by it, is it OK to feel upset? Should you just let it go? While you might feel unsure whether your partner has done something wrong, know that however you’re feeling is totally valid. If you and your partner have already decided that sexting qualifies as cheating, you may feel particularly betrayed by their actions, because your partner knew this behavior would hurt you. Sometimes, what’s considered betrayal is hard to articulate. For example, having good friends isn’t cheating, but establishing a deep emotional connection with another person might be a form of emotional betrayal. Try to articulate your needs to your partner, but realize some boundaries may be hard to define."

[10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source While some couples do end their relationship over sexting—particularly if the person who sexted knew their partner wouldn’t approve—many couples find a way to move forward by carefully rebuilding trust. If your partner expresses remorse for their behavior, the relationship may be repairable. Forgiveness is essential to moving forward with your partner. [11] X Research source However, it’s not a linear process, so go easy on yourself if you begin to feel more trusting, only to slip back into anger or mistrust on occasion. Rebuilding trust is a slow process, and it takes lots of patience and understanding. Putting some rules in place may help you both rebuild your relationship: For instance, you might ask that your partner stop interacting with whomever they’ve sexted, or tell you whenever they encounter this person. You might also ask to do random checks on your partner’s phone or social media for a few months while you work to trust your partner again. If you discovered evidence of sexting while snooping through your partner’s phone or computer, know that they may feel as if their trust has been betrayed as well. It may be worth considering why you felt compelled to go through their phone or computer—have they given you other reasons to question their commitment or trustworthiness?

Should you and your partner decide to continue the relationship, it’ll take time to rebuild the trust that was lost by their actions, and regular check-ins and monitoring their phone or internet activity may help you begin to trust them again.

It may take a long time to stop feeling resentful towards your partner, and these feelings may continue to surface even after you have “gotten over it.” This is common: just remember that forgiveness isn’t a linear process. You may feel particularly resentful if you were already feeling as if your own needs were not being adequately met by your partner: it may feel as if they prioritized someone else over you.
