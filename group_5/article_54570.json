      "content": "Stick to open-ended questions to keep the conversation going. If you ask anything that has a “yes” or “no” answer, you run the risk of a boring conversation. Instead, use your questions to let your match tell you a story. For example, instead of saying, “Do you have any pets?” try, “What’s your favorite animal?” Instead of “Do you like snowboarding?” try, “What do you like to do on the weekends?”"

      "content": "Take a look at the person’s profile to learn more about them. Pick out anything that seems interesting: do they have a dog? Are they out in nature a lot? Do they talk about something funny in their bio? Spend a few minutes gathering intel on the person so you don’t show up to the convo empty-handed. [1] X Research source People tend to post pictures of things they’re interested in. Even if their bio doesn’t say much, you can peruse their photos to see what they like to do. Make a profile that represents your interests, lifestyle, and personality. [2] X Expert Source Maya Diamond, MA Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 17 January 2019.

      "content": "Ask about something they mention in their bio. This makes your opening message sound personal and like you’ve given it some thought. You can ask about movies they like, hobbies they enjoy, or a pet they own. [5] X Research source For example, if they mention they like James Bond movies, you could say, “Which Bond movie was your fav? I love anything with Sean Connery in it, personally.” Or, if they’re into Disney, ask something like, “If you could date any Disney prince or princess, who would you choose?”"

      "title": "Talk about your common interests.",
      "content": "Talk about your common interests. If you swiped right on this person, there’s a good chance you have something in common. Mention that in your opening message so you have something to talk about. For example: “I love Animal Crossing! Who’s your favorite villager?” “I just watched Parasite too. What’d you think?” “I have a pug too! How old is yours?” Reader Poll: We asked 379 wikiHow readers, and 59% agreed that bonding over a common interest is a great way to start a conversation with someone online. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Show off your sense of humor with a one-liner. It doesn’t have to be a pickup line, but you can use a one-liner to make your match laugh. Try something like: “I’ve been trying to come up with a psychology pickup line to use, but I’m 'aFreud' I couldn’t come up with anything.” “Hey, I’m writing an article on the finer things in life and I was wondering if I could interview you.” “If you were a triangle, you’d be acute one.” “Do you believe in love at first sight, or should we match again?” “They say Tinder is a numbers game… so can I get your number?”"

Tell your match that you like something about them or their profile. [6] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Dating Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. You could try something like, “It’s really cool that you like to rock climb. I’ve never met someone who does that before!” Or, “You look great in that first pic you posted.”"

      "content": "Try a “would you rather” question to have some fun. These funny situations can take your conversation to the next level. Come up with a ridiculous scenario, then ask your match what they’d rather do. For example: [7] X Research source “Would you rather fight 1 horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?” “Would you rather get matching tattoos or matching piercings?” “Would you rather shave your head or shave your eyebrows?”"

      "content": "Ask a question indirectly by making an assumption about them. This is more interesting than asking a million questions, and it can lead to a fun conversation. Take another quick glance over their profile, then come up with something you think they do or enjoy. For example: [8] X Research source “Your scarf is so colorful, you must be an art student.” “You visit a lot of restaurants! You must be a foodie.” “You sure love to hike! You’re probably in great shape.”"

If you want to make your match interested with a little play on words, try something like: [9] X Research source “Y’know, comedy isn’t really my strong suit. My navy one is.” “Are you a keyboard? Because I think you’re my type.” “You’re sweeter than 3.14.”"

Everyone’s busy with other things, so if you can’t reply for a while, let your match know. You could say something like, “Hey, I’m gonna be pretty swamped at work this week, so sorry if it takes me a while to reply.” You should try to reply as often as you can if you’re enjoying the conversation. Don’t feel like you have to wait a certain amount of time before responding to their messages!"

Ask them if they’d be down to exchange digits so you can talk more later. [10] X Research source Texting is pretty similar to talking on Tinder, so see if they’d like to chat on the phone or FaceTime instead. Try something like, “I really like talking to you. Here’s my number if you wanna text me.” Or, “Would you want to exchange numbers? I’m not on Tinder very often.”"

Instead, ask your match if they’d like to FaceTime or video chat for some face-to-face contact. Say something like, “I’d love to meet up in person but that’s not really an option right now. Would you be down to FaceTime later?” You could also try watching a movie or TV show together through Netflix or Hulu’s “watch party” feature."

You can inquire about their weekend plans to stay cool and casual while gauging their response; if they’re interested, they’ll say they don’t have plans. For example: “What are you doing this weekend? I was thinking about going bowling.” “Got any plans next week? I kinda wanted to see the new Marvel movie.”"

Any ideas?”"
