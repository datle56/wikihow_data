      "content": "Make eye contact with him and maintain it. Looking at him a lot and making eye contact is a great way to make sure his attention stays on you. Look straight into his eyes when you’re talking to let him know that you’re interested in the conversation and in him. If you’re not talking yet, try to catch his eye and smile, hold his gaze for a moment, and then look away to flirt subtly and remind him that he’s on your radar. [2] X Research source Don't rush to fill up pauses with conversation. If you stare into his eyes and smile, then that can help build up the romantic tension and give him a chance to just go for the kiss.

      "content": "Bite your lips to draw attention to your mouth. Bite your bottom lip softly while making eye contact and giving him a small smile. You can also lick your lips or touch your mouth casually with your hand. These simple, flirty moves put his attention on your lips and encourage him to make a move. [4] X Research source Don’t go overboard with this! Only bite your lips 1-2 times per conversation, otherwise it might look strange."

      "content": "Ask him to kiss you in a playful way. If all your hints still aren’t enough to encourage him to kiss you, but you can tell he’s interested, try taking it one step further. Directly asking him to kiss you might sound awkward, but if you do it in a playful, flirty way, it can come off as confident and attractive. Move a little closer and try saying something like: [5] X Research source “So… are you gonna kiss me now, or what?” “Just wanted to say that it’s OK with me if you wanted to kiss me… that’s all…” “Beating around the bush is fun and all, but I think it’d be even better if you just kissed me.”"

      "content": "Look for hints that he’s interested, too. Once you’ve started hanging out, look for signs that he’s interested in you, too. This can tell you whether it’s worth it to keep angling for a kiss, or if your time is better spent somewhere else. He’s probably interested if: [6] X Research source He gets as close to you as he can and even goes out of his way to do it. He touches you in playful, flirty ways, like tickling you, touching your arms, or brushing back your hair. He compliments or teases you. He looks at you a lot, and will glance away when you catch him looking. He looks directly at your lips every once in awhile.

      "content": "Keep your lips hydrated and your breath fresh if you think you’ll be kissing. You might not be able to pull out your lip balm as he’s leaning in, but try to keep your lips and breath fresh throughout the day or night if you think you might be kissing someone! Keep breath mints handy and make sure your lips stay hydrated with lip balm. [8] X Research source Taking the time to rub on some chapstick can also be a great way to draw his attention to your mouth and show him that kissing is on your mind. You can also try to stay away from garlic, onions, and processed cheese, which can make breath a little smelly. If you can’t avoid bad breath, try washing out your mouth with water and eating some breath mints or chewing gum."

      "content": "Mirror his actions for a smooth, natural kiss. When he starts to lean in, do the same thing. If you’re not sure how much to open your mouth, follow his lead—he’s probably feeling unsure too! Stay in your own comfort zone and copy his own actions to make sure it’s a comfortable, enjoyable kiss for both of you. [9] X Research source Copy his actions when you can, but don’t be afraid to slow things down if he’s moving a little too fast for you."

Tilt yours in the opposite direction to make sure you don’t bump noses. Let your eyes drift shut, if that feels comfortable. [10] X Research source Even if you’re nervous, try to move slowly and stay calm and relaxed."

      "content": "Pay attention to his reaction to decide your next move. If he’s moving his mouth against yours, getting closer, or touching your face, waist, or shoulders, he’s enjoying the kiss. You can try to deepen it, or slowly pull back if you’re ready. If he’s not enjoying it, he’ll be more stiff. He might not move his lips very much, or hold his body away from yours. If this happens, simply pull back."

      "content": "Use your tongue when you feel ready. You definitely don’t have to French kiss right away, but if you’re ready to try, go slowly and gently. Open your mouth just slightly, then lightly run your tongue over his lower lip. If you feel his lips start to part, gently move your tongue into his mouth. Keep your tongue in motion—don’t just let it sit in his mouth. Move it lightly and playfully, keeping your movements gentle and slow at first so you don’t overwhelm him."

Showing him that you enjoyed the kiss will make him feel good and increase the chances of it happening again! You can also say something like, “That was nice,” or “I’ve been waiting for that.” If you want to keep the kiss going, stay standing close to him and keep touching his shoulders or his chest gently. If you want a little more space, simply take a step back."

Tease him or make fun, playful bets to show him that you’re interested and keep him talking to you. Try something like: [12] X Research source “They gave you so many fries! There’s no way you’ll finish all those. Go ahead and give me half right now.” “Let me guess how long it took you to do the Spanish homework last night… 10 minutes? You’re really off your game.

Give him a wave or a grin when you walk past each other in the halls, or stop by his desk and say hi or make a funny face. This lets him know that he’s on your mind and keeps you on his!

Try something like: [14] X Research source Texting him about something that reminded you of him, like, “I saw the funniest thing today, you would’ve laughed soooo hard…” Don’t tell him the story until he responds! Texting him a question that you know he can answer, like “Tell me you got the history homework for tonight?? I totally forgot to write it down.” When he responds, say something like, “Thank you!!!

Like a few (but not all) of his posts and stories and leave a comment on the ones you think are most funny or interesting. You could also start a Snapchat streak with each other to make sure you’re on his mind everyday. Leave funny comments on his pictures or send him DMs. For example, if he posts something about a vacation, you could comment something like, “Ummm could you bring me next time??” or “Looks amazing, I’m so jealous.”"
