Loop or fold the yarn around the base of the hook, beneath the swinging latch. Stick the hook under the canvas bar in the bottom of the first square, so that the latch passes under the canvas bar and back up to the top side again. Take the ends of the loop and put them over the canvas bar, through the latch and under the actual hook."
