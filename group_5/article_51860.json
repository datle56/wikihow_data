Put 5 good cards, along with 2 number cards, in the first pile. The other 3 piles should be 6 number cards, with 1 Skip, Reverse, Wild, or Swap Hands card. Do not put any Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards into anyone else's hands."

      "content": "Check the \"good\" hand of cards (the one with 5 action cards) and see if you have any Skip, Reverse, or Draw 2 cards. If so, take the first card from the top of the deck, but if its color doesn't match, keep going with the cards until the colors match. If you have all Wilds, Draw 4s, or Swap Hands cards, this step doesn't matter since you can always just change the color."

[1] X Research source For example, you can point out an insect high up on a wall. In addition, you can scream and point to something behind the other players."

Do this in a very quick motion so they don’t notice movement from behind and catch you. [3] X Research source Don’t place all of your cards in the pile so it seems more realistic. Instead, keep 1-3 cards and run out in a couple turns. This way, the other players are less likely to notice your deception."

Say silly comments and tease other players, for instance. Act a bit clumsy as well. Then, when you are ready to make your move, lift up both of your arms so you can bump into another player. [5] X Research source You can sway from side to side or almost spill your drink. This makes it more convincing when you bump into the other player."

As you do this, drop your cards nearby. This way, your cards get mixed up and you can switch some of their cards for your own. [6] X Research source Make this look as natural as possible so you don’t get caught. If you look like you are intentionally knocking their cards out, it will not look authentic."

Let me get those for you,” and quickly duck under the table. Pick up the cards into 2 loose piles, 1 for you and 1 for the other player. As you do this, select the cards that you want and put them in your pile. Rearrange the cards as quickly as you can. [7] X Research source You can also reach for the cards as soon as it happens, though the other player may try to help pick them up. Make sure the other player cannot see you rearranging the cards."

Without anyone noticing, sneak your cards into your lap in 1 stack, and place them in your hand. Use the sleeve of your jacket to hide the cards, and politely excuse yourself to use the restroom. Then, put the cards inside the bottle when you walk towards the bathroom. [11] X Research source This way, you get rid of many of your cards, so you can be the first to say, “UNO.” The item you use will depend on what is available to you. For instance, you can also hide the cards in a cabinet in your bathroom. This requires some sleight of hand."

This may take some practice, but the more attention you pay to the game, the better your focus will be. [13] X Research source Doing this will give you an advantage over the other players. By counting cards, you can learn to predict the moves of other players."

While paying attention to the cards, if you notice 1 player using many of the same color, such as green, use a card to throw them off track. You can use a card with the same number but with a different color, for instance. [14] X Research source For example, if 1 player plays a green 7, play a blue 7. This changes the suit from green to blue."

You can maintain the suit by using yellow cards if you have them. [15] X Research source This gets rid of your cards while making them draw additional cards."

      "content": "Use Wild cards to control the color in play. When it is your turn, select a Wild card to change the color to any suit you’d like. If a player uses many of the same color, use a Wild card to switch the suit. In addition, if you want to keep a color the same as long as you can, play a Wild card to switch the color back. [16] X Research source Wild cards are the most powerful card in the game. By using them to your advantage, you can easily win."

They should use a notepad to record all moves in case anybody gets into a game-related argument. The referee is not a part of regular gameplay, but it is a good idea especially if you have young children who cheat."

      "content": "Come up with a house rule that makes you draw another full hand if you are caught cheating. This would be terrible if you are caught with cards in your lap as you are about to go out of cards, so this should keep people from cheating. Similarly, there could be a rule that says the person is \"out\" if they cheat. This is where they are still playing the game, but are ineligible to win, get an Uno, or make other players draw cards. They must forfeit any action cards in their hand upon being caught cheating."
