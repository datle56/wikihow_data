Before you form the knot and begin backsplicing it, the end of each strand should be finished to prevent unraveling during this splicing technique. [1] X Research source With polypropylene, nylon, or dacron ropes, you can heat treat the ends over a flame or some other source of heat hot enough to melt the rope fibres to fuse the ends together. With cotton, manila or sisal rope, wrap the ends with masking tape."

Since this is your last strand, the crowning is getting \"crowded\" and it is easier now to make a mistake. Keep in mind that only one strand is passed over at a time, that only one strand can pass below another, and that only the strands of the standing end itself can be the ones passed over and gone under. With this in mind, grip the standing end of the rope in your left hand, twist the strands open as before, and insert the last crowned stand."
