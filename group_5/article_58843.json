Down the left hand side of the page are the manga that have been most recently updated, and down the right is a box for the \"Manga of the Week\" and the overall most popular manga. You can also use the search bar at the top to search for a particular title. [1] X Research source Each individual manga page will start off with a few fields of information, like alternate names, authors, genres, type, rating, etc. Scroll down a little to find a short synopsis. Under that will show the latest discussion threads from the forum about that particular manga. The \"Go to Forum\" button to the right of this will take you to the main forum section for that manga. Underneath this are the manga chapters! They start from the most recently updated, so you will need to scroll down to the bottom of the page for the very first chapter. Once you've chosen a chapter, just click through the pages and read !"

Once you're there, a list of all the manga they have on file should pop up. Clicking on the headers for each column will order the list by that particular field, so you can order the list by title alphabetically, by overall rating, by number of views, by number of chapters and by how recently it was last updated."

      "title": "Narrow down your search.",
      "content": "Narrow down your search. Clicking the \"Option\" button on the Manga Directory page will open up a plethora of ways you can narrow down your manga selection. [2] X Research source Choose from Japanese Manga, Korean Manwha, Chinese Manhua or Any. They generally have different drawing styles, and manwha and manhua are read left to right as opposed to right to left. Do you have a favourite author or artist? Here you can filter down the selection to include only works by them, if you want. Narrow down by genre. Hovering your mouse over the name of a genre will display a quick description of it if you're not completely sure what it is. If you click once on the genre name it will include it in your search; twice and it will exclude it from your search and clicking three times will just deselect it again. So, for example: Clicking twice on Drama will completely exclude all manga tagged with the drama genre from your search results. Filter by year. Different years will have different content and different styles of drawing, on the whole. You can specify that the manga is from a particular year, or that it originates before or after a particular year, e.g. all manga first published after 1995. Pick your rating. You can do this to choose manga of a particular rating to show up in your search, however instead you could just order the results you do get by rating. Specify whether you want a completed series or not. Series that aren't completed may have stopped in the middle of the story and will not be updated again. Also with incomplete series, you might have to wait a while before the ending is published. However, the incomplete series are mostly a lot more recent, and it is easy to check for updates using the bookmarks feature or something like the All Mangas extension for Google Chrome. It's your choice."
