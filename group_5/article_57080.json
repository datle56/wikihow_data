      "content": "Scoop sherbet into a chilled punch bowl. A cold punch bowl will ensure that your punch stays the right consistency for longer. As for the sherbet, the amount depends on the quantity needed. Figure about 1 large scoop of sherbet per person. For a glass just for yourself, chill your favorite glass in the freezer. Take it out along with the sherbet, add in a scoop (or two if you're feeling adventurous), and fill with the appropriate juices. Mix it up and you're good to go!"

      "content": "Mix the sherbet and soda/juices until it's a uniform consistency. If your sherbet was rock hard out of the freezer, it may take a few minutes to combine. The punch should be just about perfect when the sherbet has just started melting. For lime sherbet punch, add the ginger ale and pineapple juice. Don't have ginger ale? You could use any lemon-lime or citrus-y soda. For raspberry sherbet punch, add the lemon-lime soda and fruit juice. Raspberry compliments most flavors. For orange sherbet punch, add the ginger ale, orange juice, and pineapple juice. You could also experiment with mango or pomegranate if you'd like."

      "title": "Give it a taste test.",
      "content": "Give it a taste test. Are your ratios of sherbet to liquid how you like it? Should it be sweeter or tangier? Now is the time to adjust with more sherbet or additional juices. Is it too thick? Too thin? How could it be better? If the recipe doesn't taste like you imagined, get creative! What other juices or sodas could you throw in the mix to get that zing you're looking for?"

      "title": "Serve the punch to waiting guests, or just enjoy it by yourself.",
      "content": "Serve the punch to waiting guests, or just enjoy it by yourself. Sherbet punch has a sweet bite that can be quite addictive. You probably won't need to worry about leftovers! These are best served immediately, in chilled glasses if possible. Add a wedge of lemon, lime, orange, or a raspberry or cherry (heck, all 5 if you'd like!) for additional presentation points!"
