      "content": "Brush out your hair thoroughly. Make sure you don't have any tangles or knots in your hair. Styling tangled hair can cause severe knots when you take down your hairdo. It's important to brush in the direction of the ponytail. That is, brush as if you are trying to sweep your hair into a ponytail, brushing towards the crown of your head. That means also flipping your head over to brush upwards toward the crown. [2] X Research source"

Twist the band into a figure 8 and pull the new loop back through your hair. Repeat this movement until the hair tie is tight enough that it stays put. [5] X Research source Do not use a rubber band, as that will tangle your hair and could even break some strands. Always use a hair tie made for hair. You may need an extra thick one for a high ponytail. [6] X Research source Consider a fiber-wrapped elastic band for a tighter ponytail.

To look extra nice, take a small section of hair from the bottom of your ponytail and carefully wrap it around the elastic. Secure it with a bobby pin running along the bottom of the hair tie to completely disguise it."

Secure it with bobby pins or a small hair clip, then proceed with putting your hair up in a ponytail. Use your eyebrows to gauge how much hair you should pull back.

Don't add products like serum or hairspray, and don't secure the ponytail too tight. This gives the style a more casual feel."
