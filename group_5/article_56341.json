      "title": "Brush the area carefully.",
      "content": "Brush the area carefully. Ideally, brushing your teeth will help prevent cavities altogether. However, brushing is also important to prevent cavities from getting worse. Buildup of food stimulates the growth of bacteria. This will get into the cavity and make it worse. Focus on the cavity while brushing to clean away excess food and slow the cavity's progression. Use a soft-bristled brush and don’t press too hard as you move it. Move the toothbrush back and forth in gentle motions for at least 2 minutes total. Brush your teeth twice a day and after eating. It’s particularly important that you keep your mouth clean when you have a cavity, since plaque begins to form within 20 minutes of eating."

      "content": "Look out for symptoms of a cavity. Tooth decay happens gradually, and sometimes, cavities can exist and progress without showing many symptoms. [2] X Research source This is one reason why it’s important to get regular dentist checkups. There are a number of signs that either a cavity is forming or has already taken hold of your tooth. If you experience the following symptoms, make an appointment with your dentist. While you wait for your appointment, take steps to prevent the cavity from getting worse. [3] X Research source A white spot on your tooth. This can be an early sign of tooth decay or of fluorosis. It represents a spot where acids have eaten away the minerals in your tooth enamel. The decay is still reversible at this point, so take action if you notice this in your mouth. Tooth sensitivity. Sensitivity commonly occurs after consuming sweet, hot, or cold foods or drinks. Sensitivity is not always a sign of decay, and many people have sensitive teeth normally. But if you've never had sensitive teeth before and suddenly start feeling sensitivity to certain foods or drinks, this could be a cause for concern. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Pain when you bite down. Toothache. When your cavity has progressed so far that it’s affecting the nerve of your tooth, you may experience persistent pain in the affected tooth. This may or may not get worse when eating and drinking. Pain may also be spontaneous. A visible hole in your tooth. This indicates that your cavity is far advanced and has significantly eroded your tooth. Cavities can exist and enlarge over time with no symptoms."

      "title": "Use a fluoride treatment.",
      "content": "Use a fluoride treatment. Fluoride is bacteriostatic, which means that it keeps bacteria from multiplying in your mouth. It also strengthens your teeth by re-mineralizing enamel, which makes your teeth more resistant to cavities. If you've caught a cavity early enough, a good fluoride treatment may even reverse the decay. You can purchase fluoride-enriched products over-the-counter, but for stronger products you must get a prescription from your dentist. The best option is a professional fluoride application from the dentist, but there are several products you can use while you wait for that. [5] X Research source [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Fluoride toothpastes. Most of the toothpastes available over-the-counter have around 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm of sodium fluoride. Dentists can also prescribe fluoride-enriched toothpaste that contains roughly 5000 ppm of sodium fluoride. Fluoride mouth rinses. Fluoride mouth rinses can be used daily. These mouthwashes generally contain 225 to 1000 ppm of sodium fluoride. Look for a mouth rinse with an ADA seal of approval to indicate that the rinse has been evaluated by the American Dental Association. Fluoride gel. Fluoride gel is thick and will remain on your teeth for a longer period of time. You squirt the gel into trays that you then fit over your teeth."

Keep your mouth moist to slow the cavity's progression and rinse away food particles that could make decay worse. [7] X Research source If your mouth stays dry regardless of how much water you drink, this could be a symptom of a larger medical condition, or caused by prescription medication. Talk with your doctor if dry mouth remains a problem for you."

      "content": "Chew sugar free gum with xylitol. Xylitol is a naturally-occurring alcohol that is extracted from plants. It has anti-bacterial properties and is used to prevent infections. Gum that contains 1–20 grams (0.035–0.71 oz) of xylitol helps kill bacteria that causes cavities and makes them worse. If you suspect you have a cavity, try chewing xylitol gum to slow its growth until you see the dentist. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Look for chewing gum with the ADA seal. This ensures that you won’t accidentally be doing your teeth more harm than good. Chewing gum also stimulates saliva production, which can help wash away food particles and keep tooth enamel strong.

      "content": "Try a salt water rinse. Salt water has antiseptic qualities, and dentists often recommend it when treating wounds or infections in the mouth. Salt water can also kill the bacteria that causes cavities, slowing their growth until you can get to the dentist. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water. Swish a mouthful of this water around your mouth for 1 minute. Concentrate on the affected tooth. Repeat this treatment 3 times daily."

It may kill cavity-causing bacteria and can cut down on inflammation. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try using licorice root for a home remedy to slow cavity growth while you wait for an appointment at the dentist. Some toothpastes made by Tom's of Maine contain licorice root. Alternatively, you could buy some licorice root powder at the store and mix it with your toothpaste. Make sure to look for deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), which does not contain glycyrrhiza, a compound that can cause unpleasant and often serious side effects. Always consult with your doctor before you use licorice root. It can interact with certain medications, including ACE inhibitors, insulin, MAO inhibitors, and oral contraceptives. It can also cause health problems for people with certain medical conditions, including liver or kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure or heart disease, or hormone-sensitive cancers."

      "content": "Avoid refined sugar. Cavities are caused by acid-producing bacteria that thrive in acidic environments. These bacteria use sugar found in dental plaque as fuel. This is why sugary foods and beverages should be minimized. If possible, brush your teeth after eating. [11] X Research source Foods high in starch, like potatoes, bread, and pasta, also provide a welcoming environment for acid-producing bacteria. Keep your simple and refined carbohydrate intake low, and brush your teeth after eating."

During this process, the dentist will drill out the affected portion of your tooth. S/he will then fill the hole with some sort of material. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Commonly, your dentist will use porcelain or a composite resin to fill a cavity, especially for front teeth. These are top choices because they can be shaded to match your tooth’s natural appearance. Dentists may fill cavities in back teeth with silver alloy or gold, as these tend to be stronger. Plaque also usually builds up more extensively on the back teeth."

To ensure that you're brushing your teeth effectively, use the following instructions from the American Dental Association. [17] X Research source Angle the toothbrush 45 degrees to the gumline. Plaque tends to build up on the gumline. Gently move the brush back and forth using small strokes. The strokes should only be about the width of one tooth. Brush both the outer and inner surfaces of your teeth. Continue brushing for about two minutes. Finish by brushing your tongue. If you miss your tongue, you'll leave behind a lot of bacteria that will recontaminate your mouth as soon as you stop brushing. Repeat this at least twice a day."

Follow these simple steps to make sure you're flossing your teeth properly. Take about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss. Wrap most of it around the middle finger of one hand, the rest around your other middle finger. Grasp the string tightly between your thumb and forefinger. Use a rubbing motion to guide it between teeth. When the floss reaches the gum line, form a “C” shape to follow the shape of the tooth. Hold the strand firmly against the tooth, and move it gently up and down. Repeat the entire process with the rest of your teeth. Use fresh sections of floss as you go. If your teeth are packed very tightly, look for a waxed or “easy glide” floss. You may also find the small pre-threaded flossers more helpful. The most important thing is to floss faithfully.

      "content": "Maintain a tooth-healthy diet. What you eat has a big effect on your oral health. Some foods are beneficial for your teeth, while others should be kept to a minimum or avoid altogether. [19] X Research source Eat foods high in fiber. Fiber helps push plaque off of your teeth. It also stimulates production of saliva, which helps clean harmful acids and enzymes off your teeth. For fiber, eat fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grain products. Eat dairy products. Milk, cheese, and plain yogurt also stimulate production of saliva. They also contain calcium, which strengthens your tooth enamel. Drink tea. Nutrients in green and black tea help break down plaque and slow the growth of bacteria. Brewing your tea with water containing fluoride will give you a double dose of nutrients for your teeth. Avoid sugary foods and drinks. Sugar increases the growth of plaque and bacteria, leading to tooth decay. Keep candy and soft drinks to a minimum. If you do eat sugary foods, do so with a meal and drink plenty of water. This way, your mouth will produce more saliva which will help wash away the sugar and reduce acid and bacterial growth. Brush your teeth after eating starchy foods. Foods like potatoes and corn get stuck in between teeth more readily, leading to tooth decay. Be sure to clean your teeth after eating these foods to avoid cavities."
