Once you give your partner the pendant, the wedding will be scheduled three days after you propose. If you want your wedding to be on a particular day, make sure to give your partner the pendant three days before. For example, if you want your wedding to be on Summer 4, you must give the pendant on Summer 1. The date of the wedding will be marked on the calendar with a Mermaid's Pendant icon. If your wedding falls on the same date as an event, it will be postponed to the next day without an event."

      "title": "After getting married, some aspects of gameplay change slightly.",
      "content": "After getting married, some aspects of gameplay change slightly. Note that gameplay only changes if you marry an NPC. If you marry another player character, you won't get these benefits. These gameplay aspects are listed below [5] X Research source : You can get more friendship hearts with your spouse. You can increase your spouse's friendship to 14 hearts, but every day you do not interact with your spouse you'll lose 20 friendship points. Your spouse will water all crops on the farm (in Spring, Summer, or Fall), feed all animals, water the dog or cat bowl, repair broken fences, and give gifts (including breakfast and dinner food dishes ). Once you reach 12.5 hearts with your spouse, they will give you a Stardrop . If you marry another player in multiplayer, the Stardrop will show up in a purple present box next to each player's bed the next morning. Your spouse will set up a personal room in the Farmhouse and a small outdoor area behind the Farmhouse. How these areas are decorated depends on which character you marry. Kissing your spouse will remove exhaustion from your energy bar. The first kiss of the day is the only one that can remove exhaustion. If there are objects in the way of your spouse's path, objects blocking the kitchen, or no bed before evening, your spouse will be annoyed and comment on it. They will also temporarily refuse to kiss you if this happens. If you've given a bouquet to another villager who is the same gender as your spouse and you give that villager a gift they don't hate, your spouse has a chance to get jealous. The jealousy chance depends on your daily luck. If your spouse gets jealous of you giving a gift, you will lose 30 friendship points and your spouse will be angry when you speak to them next. Note that birthday gifts are fine to give and will not cause your spouse to get jealous."
