      "content": "Natural log, written as l n {\\displaystyle ln} , is a logarithm that uses the base of e {\\displaystyle e} . A logarithm is the inverse of an exponent. It tells you what a base number has to be raised to in order to produce another number. Natural logs, written as l n {\\displaystyle ln} always use the base number e {\\displaystyle e} , which is an irrational number that is approximately equal to 2.718. [1] X Research source In simpler terms, logs and natural logs ask what exponent produced the answer. Because logs and exponents are inverses of each other, writing l o g 2 ( 8 ) = 3 {\\displaystyle log2(8)=3} is the same thing as writing 2 3 = 8 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}=8} . The base of the logarithm is 2, which is raised to the power of 3 to produce 8. Using a natural log example, l n ( 30 ) = 3.4012 {\\displaystyle ln(30)=3.4012} is another way of writing e 3.4012 = 30 {\\displaystyle e^{3.4012}=30} . The base e {\\displaystyle e} is raised to 3.4012 to produce 30."
