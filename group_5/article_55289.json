      "content": "Making her feel good about herself is a surefire way to give her butterflies. Let her know you appreciate her by giving her a compliment, either in person or via text. Be sure to acknowledge her non-physical qualities, like her kindness, creativity, intelligence, and wicked sense of humor, as well as her physical traits, like her eyes, hair, or smile. “You’re the funniest person I’ve ever known. You know that? I’m crackin’ up over here!” “You’re a knockout in that sweater!” “I’m constantly inspired by your kindness towards others. You’re one in a million.”"

      "content": "Flirting is a tried and true method for igniting passion. Smile, laugh, even tease her a little bit (nicely, of course!). Flirting is a way to create sexual tension and let her know you’re interested in taking things further. Here are a few more surefire ways to create some anticipation in her in the form of butterflies: Employ a little boldness—but don’t come on too strong. In other words, say, “I’ve gotta admit you’ve been on my mind all day,” but avoid “I’m in love with you.” If you’re in person, use body language to flirt: lean in close to talk, keep arms and legs uncrossed to seem more “open,” and turn your body towards hers. If you’re flirting over text , send her occasional flirty emoji, like winking smiley faces or hearts."

      "content": "Your curiosity will make her feel adored (and filled with butterflies! ). Whether you’re getting to know your crush or chatting with your long-time girlfriend at the day's end, show that you’re interested in her life by asking her about herself. Don’t settle for “How are you?” or “Tell me about yourself”—be specific, even going as far as to allude to things she might have said or done in the past to show you’re really paying attention. “You said last week you were nervous to take that math test—have you taken it yet? How did it go?” “You had that big meeting today, didn’t you? How did it go? Probably glad it’s over with, huh?” “I noticed you were reading a book when I came in. What was it? Are you enjoying it?”"

      "content": "OK, hear us out: sexual chemistry is complex, but scent plays a role. If you like this girl, you probably like the way she smells. And it’s more than just that she wears a certain perfume or lotion or whatever—it’s her genes . [1] X Research source Telling her you’re drawn to her scent will let her know (on a subconscious level) that you’re attracted to her and want to be intimate. Plus, it indicates you’ve gotten close enough to smell her, which will give her belly some flip-flops. Be careful telling someone you don’t know all that well that she smells good, as it could make her a little uncomfortable. But a date or a significant other? Go for it!"

      "content": "Light, flirtatious touches will get her heart a-tumblin’. If you’re on a date, you might lightly graze her knee under the table with your own knee, or place your hand over her hand. When you see her in class or at work, indicate interest by lightly brushing shoulders or asking if you can help remove an eyelash from her cheek. Oh la laaa. Of course, keep alert for signs she doesn’t want to be touched, especially if you’re not dating or have only recently begun dating. If she pulls away or seems uncomfortable, give her space. You can even create sexual tension and give her butterflies by maintaining a close distance without touching: try leaning close to her when you speak or whispering in her ear. While physical passion is important in a relationship, don’t worry if being physically affectionate doesn’t come naturally to you. Work on letting your other qualities shine, like kindness and intelligence.

      "content": "Humor is the key to the heart. And why shouldn’t it be? Laughing and having a good time make us feel good and confident, and sharing a laugh with another person makes us feel warm and connected to them. Make your girl laugh , and you’ll make her stomach flip-flop. You don’t have to be a comedian to get her ROFL-ing. Just be friendly and able to laugh at yourself, make sure to laugh at her jokes, and the two of you will have a good time. Make her laugh over text by sending her an intentionally cheesy pickup line, like \"Are you on loan? 'Cause you've got my interest,\" or referencing an inside joke."

      "content": "Show her you've got a sense of style, and she'll be smitten. A few extra minutes in front of the mirror can make a big difference. Of course, appearance doesn’t matter nearly as much as your attitude, sense of humor, and sensitivity. But maintaining your appearance is a simple way to give a girl butterflies. It's also likely to boost your confidence, which is another surefire way to make her want you more! Practice good hygiene: wear deodorant, shower regularly, and keep your hair and any facial hair kempt. We're not talking a Princess Diaries makeover here. You can stay true to you and still take your style to the next level. Just spend a little extra time grooming yourself before you go out—and trust us, she’ll notice."

      "content": "Self-esteem is the one of the most attractive qualities there is. We know it's easier said than done, but just pretending to be confident can make you actually feel more confident! In other words, fake it 'til you make it. Show your crush you believe in yourself and know your worth by smiling, standing up straight, and making eye contact, and she’ll be super attracted to you. If you know you’re going to see her soon—like in class, at work, or on a date—you can “plan” to be confident by rehearsing for your encounter beforehand or having some conversation starters in your back pocket if the chitchat lags. If you’ve got butterflies yourself around this girl, try calming them by drinking some water and taking a few long, deep breaths."

So hold the door open, be attentive if she seems tired or cold or hungry or sad—basically, show her you're a kind and compassionate person, on par with Mr. Rogers himself.

      "content": "Shared interests and passions will help you two feel bonded. Your girl will feel she can connect with you and trust you, that you are both “the same,” in a sense. Whether you share a laugh over your favorite sitcom or hotly debate which Taylor Swift album is best, finding things you both have in common can bring you together and increase the flame of love between you. What you share might be surface-level, like favorite TV shows or music, or more personal and intimate—say, you both grew up in the same religion, or you are both majoring in the same subject."

Whether you’re working together on a science project or huddled together in the corner at a party, spending time alone with her will show her she’s got your undivided attention and make her feel comfortable around you. If you’re at a public place or a party with lots of people, make it clear you want to spend time with her and her alone by talking to her or trying to draw her away from the others. [3] X Research source Of course, be sensitive to signs she’s not receptive to your attempts to draw her away: if she doesn’t follow your lead or excuses herself to mingle with others, she might not be up for it."

Tell her you want to take her on a romantic getaway, or light her fire by saying you want to have a hot night in bed together. She’ll feel appreciated and excited! If you’ve been together for a little while, the “honeymoon” phase might have worn off a bit. That doesn’t mean the romantic dates stop—in fact, dates are maybe more important now than ever!"

When she speaks, whether it’s about something superficial or something more serious, show you’re listening by nodding, maintaining eye contact, validating her feelings, and occasionally interjecting with statements or questions that indicate engagement. It can be tough not to go into problem-solving mode when she tells you about the bad day she just had—after all, you care so much about her! But a lot of the time, what she’s really looking for is just someone to listen, not fix her problems. “Go on! I want to hear the rest of this story.” “You failed that test? Oh man, that must have felt crummy.” “Wow! I can’t believe that happened. That sucks.”"

      "content": "A bold declaration can be totally thrilling (and really attractive). Tell her you’re drawn to her, that you’ve never known anyone as special as her, or that she’s changed your life. Unexpected declarations of adoration can take her by surprise and give her major butterflies. The level of boldness will probably depend on how well you know her and what your dynamic is like. If she’s a crush you don’t know all that well, boldly declaring your love may be too strong. If she’s a girl you’ve been dating for a little while, on the other hand, a bold declaration may be just the thing to ignite some passion. “I feel totally bewitched by you. I can’t stop thinking about you.” “I’ve never felt this way about anyone before.” “I am crazy in love with you.”"
