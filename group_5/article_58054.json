      "content": "There are 78 cards in a Tarot deck. No matter what type of Tarot deck you pick up, it’ll have 78 cards and 2 types of cards: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. This set amount of cards makes it easier to do accurate and detailed readings with any Tarot deck. [2] X Research source There are 22 Major Arcana cards in a deck. These cards represent the archetypes and depict major life influences and revelations. [3] X Research source There are 46 Minor Arcana cards divided into 4 suits. These cards refer to everyday matters and influences. Although the name of a deck’s suits can vary, they all represent the same thing."

      "content": "Tarot cards give a more personalized and detailed reading. There are positive and negative cards within a Tarot deck, just as there are positive and negative events in life. When you ask a Tarot deck a question , it’s more likely that you’ll receive a logical answer because there are several possible outcomes for any situation."

      "title": "Each Oracle deck has its own system.",
      "content": "Each Oracle deck has its own system. Unlike Tarot cards, Oracle cards can vary in meaning depending on who made them. Decks usually have general themes, and it’s up to the artist or creator to determine what each card represents. [4] X Research source For instance, a Camelot Oracle deck may have cards based on the characters from King Arthur, like Merlin, Lancelot, and Guinevere. These cards could represent specific archetypes like the hero or maiden, but they might also convey overall feelings of hope or grace, depending on the creator."

      "title": "Oracle decks usually have less than 78 cards.",
      "content": "Oracle decks usually have less than 78 cards. Typically, Oracle decks have around 35 and 60 cards, but this can vary based on the individual. [5] X Research source Because there are so few Oracle cards, they’re a bit easier to manage."

      "title": "It may be harder to get a detailed reading with Oracle cards.",
      "content": "It may be harder to get a detailed reading with Oracle cards. Many Oracle decks follow a specific mood or tone, which is why they’re often used as daily affirmation cards. Having a deck full of positive cards is a great morning boost, but these cards probably won’t give the most accurate responses to detailed questions. [6] X Research source For instance, say you ask a fairy-themed Oracle deck , “When will I get a raise?” and pull a fairy that conveys emotions of bliss and serenity. This card can’t tell you exactly when you’ll get a raise, but it can tell you how you may feel around that time. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use Tarot cards for more detailed readings. The mix of themes and quantity of cards in a Tarot deck make them perfect for gathering insight on the future. A Tarot reading is far more detailed than an Oracle reading, as more concrete results can be given. So, if you’re looking for an answer to a specific question, stick with Tarot cards."

      "content": "Try Oracle cards if you’re just starting your divination practice. An Oracle reading is all about interpretation, thanks to the deck’s free-flowing structure. Unlike Tarot cards, there are no set meanings or themes to memorize. Instead, you can follow you own intuition and interpret the cards however you like. If you’re a beginner and gravitate more toward Tarot, pick up a Tarot deck instead! There are no rules on what you have to do—follow you heart and choose a deck that best fits your needs."

      "content": "Use Tarot and Oracle cards together for a deeper reading. Who says you only have to use one type of deck? One of the many beautiful things about a divination practice is that it can be personalized. Pull an Oracle card to understand the overall tone, mood, or emotion, and then draw Tarot cards to identify key events or points of influence. [8] X Research source Play around with your decks to create more and more layers in your readings. Use whichever deck you feel drawn to during a reading. Lay out your cards or create spreads based on how you feel and what you can visualize."
