      "content": "Stock your home with healthy foods. Fatigue can make your body crave junk food heavy in processed carbs and sugars. You may feel you deserve a treat after a long night, so you'll be unlikely to reach for unhealthy foods. Make sure this is not an option. Keep your home stocked with healthy snacks for when you get off work. [1] X Research source Healthy snacks include fruits, vegetables, and spreads like hummus. Prepare food in an easily snack-able form so you don't have to waste time preparing when you're tired from work. Cut fruits and vegetables into slices before leaving for work. You can also buy pre-cut fruits and veggies at the supermarket if you have a particularly long week."

      "content": "Eat breakfast. Even if you sleep in late, you should always have breakfast. Within one hour of waking up, make sure that you eat a healthy meal. This can help rev your metabolism for the coming day. Try oatmeal and fruit, or healthy proteins like hard boiled eggs."

      "content": "Bring meals from home. If you're exhausted from working late, the 24 hour McDonald's across from your office may seem like a well-deserved treat at 3 AM. However, part of the reason night shift workers gain weight is because of unhealthy eating habits like these. If you need a meal during your shift, prepare a meal at home before work. Make sure any meal you bring is healthy. Strive for meals rich in lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. You should also bring in your own snacks. This will help you avoid unhealthy vending machine foods during your shift."

      "title": "Snack healthily throughout a late shift, if possible.",
      "content": "Snack healthily throughout a late shift, if possible. Metabolism tends to slow down if you wait until you're extremely hungry to eat. Due to the unusual schedule, night shift workers often end up eating when they're already famished. Not only does this have a poor effect on the body, it's a cause for post-shift overeating and can make you feel sluggish on the job. Opt for light snacks between meal times and, when it's time for your dinner break, stick to a low calorie, healthy meal. [2] X Research source Pick filling, wholesome snacks such as nuts and fruits, not chips or cookies."

      "title": "Drink water at work.",
      "content": "Drink water at work. Many people mistake thirst for hunger, so make sure that you stay hydrated during your shift. Dehydration can lead to food cravings and overeating, which can cause you to pack on the pounds when working a night shift. [3] X Research source Purchase a water bottle and fill it before your shift. This will cut down on the cost of purchasing bottled water at work. Refill the bottle at a water fountain when necessary. If you're not a big water drinker, consider infusing your water with fruit to add flavor. For example, you can add a squeeze of lemon or toss a few berries into your water bottle. This may also add a small amount of calories to your drinks, cutting back on the urge to snack or overeat. Using flavor mixes or additives adds unnecessary sugar and coloring."

      "content": "Strive to eat at the same time each day. It can be hard to maintain a regular eating schedule when you're working a night shift. However, it's vital you do so if you want to lose weight. Your body learns to expect food at certain times. If you're working a late shift, your eating habits may be erratic. If you shift your eating schedule during weekends or days off, your body never has time to fully adjust to an eating schedule. This may cause weight gain. Try to eat at specific times each day. For example, if you get up at 1:30PM, make sure to eat breakfast by 2PM. Even on weekends or days off, when you may get up earlier, strive to eat at 2PM. This can be difficult when it comes to socializing. For you, dinnertime may be around midnight, but your friends may be getting together for food at 7PM on a Saturday. Show up and have a drink or a light appetizer instead of a full meal."

However, if you want to lose weight, regular exercise needs to be part of your schedule. [5] X Research source Find a time that works for you to exercise. Exercising after work is probably not practical, and may actually be dangerous if you're jogging on the street at 3AM. However, see if you can find time in the afternoon. Look for gaps in your schedule. Say you get to bed by 4AM on most nights, and tend to sleep until one. Your shift typically starts at nine o'clock. You could find some time during the afternoon to get in 45 minutes of aerobics a few times a week."

For weight loss, it's recommended you get in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of intense physical activity each week. Make sure you hit those numbers by exercising three to four times a week.

You can find ways to make working out less tedious. Listen to music while you jog or use your treadmill. Watch television at the gym to make the time go by faster."

You should also talk to your doctor before beginning a new form of exercise. You want to make sure you do not strain yourself."

For example, taking a warm bath may be a good idea. Reading can also take your mind off of the moment, promoting sleep. You should stay away from electronic screens before bed. The blue light that comes from a laptop or phone stimulates brain activity, making sleep difficult. Stay consistent. If you engage in the same ritual every night, your body will learn to associate that routine with sleep. This will help encourage your brain and body to shut down for rest."
