      "title": "Clean your teddy bear regularly.",
      "content": "Clean your teddy bear regularly. Wash your teddy bear often, especially if you go outside with teddy a lot. When washing, follow the manufacturer's care instructions. Hand-washing is kindest to the teddy. To wash by hand, fill a small tub with cool water and a squirt of gentle liquid dishwashing detergent (it is safe to apply directly to stains and teddy). Place the teddy into the tub and gently massage teddy's fur fabric with your hands. Empty the tub, then rinse teddy under cool, running water. To dry, use a towel to dab and blot dry gently. Then leave somewhere sunny, like a window ledge, to dry completely. If teddy can be machine washed (check with dad or mom first), you might find How to machine wash your teddy bear useful as guidance. Treat stains quickly. This makes it easier to get the stains out, rather than letting them set permanently. If your teddy bear has a simple food stain on it, you can blot it out with some warm water and a towel. Ask your parent or guardian for help if the teddy has a really bad stain that won't come out. They'll know what to do to help remove it. Sometimes it may be enough to just use a wet cloth and carefully wipe over dirty parts of the teddy bear. Keep teddy away from dirty areas. This means if you need to leave teddy at home, put it in its bed or on your bed. Or if you're outside, don't leave teddy on the ground in case it's muddy or teddy gets stepped on."

      "title": "Brush teddy's fur.",
      "content": "Brush teddy's fur. When teddy's hair is messy, use a baby's brush or a very soft brush to gently brush teddy's fur back in place. Do not use spiky brushes for teddy bear fur. The spikes will catch on the fur and can rip it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store teddy with care.",
      "content": "Store teddy with care. When you aren't tucking teddy into bed or placing it on your bed, put it somewhere safe. Good places include on a shelf, inside a toy box or chest or sitting on a chair. Don't leave teddy on the floor, in direct sunlight, next to a heater or squashed under heavy things. These sorts of places can hurt teddy and cause teddy's fur to change colour or its body to become misshapen."
