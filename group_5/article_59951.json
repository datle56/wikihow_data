      "title": "On dating apps, this tag means the user is open-minded about sex.",
      "content": "On dating apps, this tag means the user is open-minded about sex. If someone uses the “sex positivity” tag, or has “sex positive” in their bio on apps like Bumble, Tinder, or Hinge, it usually means they strive to approach the topic of sex with curiosity and an open mind. [1] X Research source They’re probably not ashamed to talk about sex and all its different facets, and are often looking for like-minded users. Someone with this descriptor may (or may not) be willing to try new things and explore their sexuality and what it means for them."

      "title": "Sex positivity is the belief that sex is natural, complex, and morally neutral.",
      "content": "Sex positivity is the belief that sex is natural, complex, and morally neutral. For the most part, “sex positivity” is a response to society’s tendency to be hush-hush about all things sex. Sex positivity is a mindset that aims to approach sexual topics with openness, to discuss sexual experiences without shame, and to explore what sex means to an individual. [2] X Research source It doesn’t mean that someone sees sex as a constant good thing. Rather, sex positivity frames sex as neutral, like say, owning a dog or enjoying sports—it’s not right or wrong, it just means different things to different people, and that’s okay. Someone can be sex positive and prefer not to engage in sex! It’s just about acknowledging that sex isn’t some taboo thing to be swept under the rug."

      "title": "Sex positivity in general isn’t a bad thing.",
      "content": "Sex positivity in general isn’t a bad thing. If someone has “sex positivity” in their profile, there’s no need to back away, at least not until you know a little more about them. Generally, sex positivity is a belief and movement like any other. You may agree or disagree with the idea, but at its core, it’s a movement that aims to have open and honest talks about sex, and that’s not a particularly bad thing to strive for."

      "content": "Some dating app users see the tag as a warning sign. While sex positivity itself isn’t a red flag, users around the internet have expressed some hesitation when they see it on a profile. They say that some dating app users, particularly men, use the label “sex positivity” just to jump straight to the topic of sex, in the hopes of landing a hookup, or to try to manipulate other users into sex. [3] X Research source If you don’t want others to think the same of you, it might be best not to put the tag on your own profile. Instead, you might say that you’re “accepting and open-minded” while writing your bio."

      "title": "Ask the user what sex positivity means to them.",
      "content": "Ask the user what sex positivity means to them. If you’re unsure of what “sex positivity” means to a certain user, or want to get a better idea of what they’re like, just ask them! They’ve likely advertised themself as sex positive in order to have that talk. If nothing else, it’ll get the conversation going. For example, say: “I notice you say you’re sex positive. What does that mean to you?” or, “Can I ask what your views on sex positivity are?”"

      "content": "In a spectrum “In a spectrum” often means that the user identifies as on the autism spectrum, and wants to let other users know, or to find other users on the spectrum. Sometimes, it may mean that the user considers their sexuality to be on a spectrum, rather than just identifying as gay or straight."

      "content": "Situationship A situationship is a romantic relationship that doesn’t really have definite terms or labels. It’s relationship limbo, essentially. If someone on a dating app says they’re “in a situationship,” they may be in a noncommittal relationship and looking for something else."
