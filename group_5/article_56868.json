      "content": "Print 4 inch (10 cm) images on Shrinky Dinks Ink Jet paper. Shrinky Dinks are a super fun craft product that shrink large images or drawings into small plastic pieces—and all you have to do to make Shrinky Dinks is put your design on paper! Find pictures for your charms, and then import them to a printable document on Microsoft Word, InDesign, or Photoshop. Reduce the images opacity by 20 to 30%, so the design doesn’t come out too dark once it’s shrunk. [1] X Research source Leave enough space between each image so you can cut them out. Choose pictures of your friends, pet, or a favorite movie character or quote. The software you use to print and format your charm designs doesn’t matter, as long as you can alter the vibrancy of the image and print it out. Use clear Shrinky Dinks to draw or paint a custom design rather than print one out. Follow the instructions on your Shrinky Dinks when printing your designs, as you may need to adjust a few settings on your printer first."

Arrange your cut out designs on the sheet so there’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them. [4] X Research source Take your Shrinky Dinks out of the oven once they’ve completely flattened out. If your Shrinky Dinks are still curled after 5 minutes in the oven, take them out and flatten them with the bottom of a glass. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Coat the charms in resin to make them last longer. Adding epoxy resin to your Croc charms is optional but can help them last longer, especially in wet weather. Mix the epoxy resin with a hardener at a 2:1 ratio. [7] X Research source Use a craft stick to smooth the mixed resin evenly over the front of your charm. Let the resin dry or cure for at least 24 hours before moving to the next step. [8] X Research source If you want to add resin to your Croc charm but don’t have much time on your hands, try using UV resin . It’s a faster alternative that doesn’t require mixing and cures under a UV light for 2 minutes. [9] X Research source"

The versatility of the clay lets you create any Croc charm you’d like, whether that’s a simple crescent moon or a life-like ice cream cone. Simply work the clay with your hands until it’s moldable. Then, start shaping it into your desired design. [15] X Research source Place your charm(s) on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake in a 275 °F (135 °C) oven for 30 minutes. [16] X Research source Remember, you’ll be gluing on a Jibbitz backing, so make sure the back of your charm is flat and wide enough to hold the backing. Try using more than one color of polymer clay to make your charm even more detailed. Read the polymer clay’s instructions carefully and follow the baking directions, as different brands can have different baking times."

Follow the directions on your liquid polymer clay, as many products have specific baking or curing instructions. Check that your silicone is oven-safe before baking it."
