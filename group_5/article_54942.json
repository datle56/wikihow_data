      "content": "Eat healthy fats. Cellulite is caused by the fat just under the skin, but if your skin is toned and healthy, the cellulite won't be as noticeable. Foods like olives, nuts, avocados, fish and olive oil contain omega-3 fatty acids , which are essential for healthy skin. Consume Omega-3 fatty acid. Since we eat fatty foods or at least foods filled with all kinds of fats all the time, therefore, consuming the proper fatty acids and neglecting the ones that are harmful to us are vital for a complete recovery from cellulite. Pasture-raised meats, dairy products enriched with Omega-3, Edamame, wild rice, canola oil, or walnuts are only a few of the many foods that are rich in this fatty acid and should be consumed in large quantities for a complete removal of cellulite."

      "content": "Incorporate weight training. Weight training, unlike cardio exercises, tones the muscles under your skin and causes it to look more taught. This can greatly reduce the appearance of cellulite. Buy free weights and perform exercises meant to tone your thighs, buttocks, and abs. If you have cellulite on your arms, perform arm exercises as well. Join a gym and work with a trainer to increase the amount of weight you lift over time. Contrary to common belief, lifting heavier weights fewer times, rather than doing a lot of reps with lighter weights, is better for building muscle."
