If not, you may need to see about a specific program provided by the manufacturer of your phone. If your phone doesn't, and you want to use the e-mail/picture message method: then follow steps 3-4. If both your phone and your computer has Bluetooth: then follow steps 5-6."

Don't panic, it's easier than it sounds. You need to set up your computer to allow Bluetooth connections. This can be done through Control Panel. Double-click the Bluetooth icon and you should see a Bluetooth Devices window. Click the Options tab and make sure \"Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer\" and \"Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer\" are both checked. Go to the Devices tab and click the \"Add\" button. This will open the Add Bluetooth Device Wizard, and after verifying that your device is set up and ready to be found, it will search for your phone. Select your phone and click Next. You should now enter a passkey, for security reasons. Something simple will do, if you're not one for remembering numbers. For example, 0000 or 1212. Your phone should now prompt you to enter this passkey. Do so, and the pairing process will now be complete after Windows finishes the process."
