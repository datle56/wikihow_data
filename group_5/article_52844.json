Slip stitch into the first chain stitch you made. Insert your hook into the first chain stitch. Yarn over and pull through. Pull the same loop through the second loop on your hook. This connects the ends of the chain to form the center ring of your heart. You can also begin your heart by making a Magic Ring . The Magic Ring can be pulled tight after you finish the heart."

      "content": "Crochet 4 treble and 4 double stitches for the first half of your heart. Work 4 chain stitches. These 4 stitches are the same size as one treble crochet. Work a treble crochet stitch 4 times into the center of the ring. Make sure you are inserting the hook into the center of your ring, or the heart will not look even when you’re done. Work a double crochet stitch 4 times into the center ring. Chain 1 stitch, treble crochet 1 stitch, and then chain 1 stitch \"You’ll want to hold the yarn tight enough to keep tension on the yarn but loose enough that it can still slide through your fingers while you crochet,\" DIY Specialist Sarah Stearns advises."

Think of it as making the first half from the top down and the second half from the bottom up. Work 4 double crochet stitches into the center ring. Work 4 treble crochet stitches into the center ring and then chain 4. Slip stitch into the center ring and then cut the working yarn to finish off the crocheted heart. Weave in the ends with a yarn needle . [1] X Research source Your finished heart will be roughly 2” x 2”. The size of your heart can vary depending on how tightly you make your stitches. Tighter stitches result in a smaller heart, while looser stitches make the heart larger."

Using different yarns and hooks can alter the size and texture of your hearts. Bulkier yarn and larger hooks will produce larger hearts. For example, a heart made with fingering weight yarn and a C-2 (2.75mm) hook will be roughly half the size of a heart made with worsted weight yarn and an H-8 (5mm) hook. A heart made with super bulky yarn and an N/P-15 (10mm) hook would be roughly twice as large as the hearth made with worsted-weight yarn. [9] X Research source"
