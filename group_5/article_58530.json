      "title": "Praying in the Spirit means communicating to God through the Holy Spirit.",
      "content": "Praying in the Spirit means communicating to God through the Holy Spirit. This style of prayer allows the Holy Spirit to perfect our prayers. By giving ourselves over to Him (the Spirit), we become vessels for the glorification of God. When we pray in the Spirit, we aspire towards a more selfless form of prayer that allows us to be fully moved, more in the moment, and further in line with the will of God. [1] X Research source There’s a scriptural basis for this style of prayer. As Paul advocates, “Pray at all times in the Spirit” (Eph. 6:18). All Christians are called to pray in the Spirit. The kind of intimate relationship with God that it offers is something that is an expectation for anyone following His word."

      "title": "Praying in the Spirit is the opposite of praying in the flesh.",
      "content": "Praying in the Spirit is the opposite of praying in the flesh. While praying in the flesh involves praying for that which makes us happy (career success, love, or material objects), praying in the Spirit is about praying for what makes us holy. Praying in the Spirit gives us a greater sense of self-control, as we refuse temporary material pleasures in order to attain greater spiritual ones. The Holy Spirit can offer us many things. As Paul tells us, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control” (Gal. 5:22)."

      "title": "Praying in the Spirit is not necessarily speaking in tongues.",
      "content": "Praying in the Spirit is not necessarily speaking in tongues. Some believers see speaking in tongues as a kind of praying in the Spirit, but this is not universally accepted among Christians. While speaking in tongues is treated in the Bible as a gift offered to some believers, praying in the Spirit is something that all believers must do. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Praying in the Spirit isn’t a magical incantation.",
      "content": "Praying in the Spirit isn’t a magical incantation. Praying in the spirit isn’t ritualistic or showy, and it won’t necessarily grant you boons and blessings in your daily life. Instead, it is a prayer that offers glory to God selflessly and guided by the Holy Spirit. This sustains our spiritual lives. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Praying in the Spirit moves both your mind and heart.",
      "content": "Praying in the Spirit moves both your mind and heart. While praying in the Spirit, you may feel a deep desire to worship and glorify God, one given to you by the Holy Spirit. In this way, you yourself become a temple for God’s glory. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that praying in the Spirit doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll feel a lot of excitement, or that you’ll have to break silence in order to praise God. You can pray in the Spirit excitedly and out loud, or stoically and in silence."

      "title": "Find a special, private place for prayer.",
      "content": "Find a special, private place for prayer. To open yourself to the Holy Spirit, it’s a good idea to find a place where you can relax, free of distractions. This might be a quiet place at home, a church during non-service hours, or a favorite spot in the woods. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Take some deep breaths to set your mind at ease.",
      "content": "Take some deep breaths to set your mind at ease. Praying in the Spirit is not something that you can rush, so take a few moments to center yourself and focus on the task at hand. Pay attention to your breathing, inhaling and exhaling in a deliberate and slow way. This will put you in the proper frame of mind to begin prayer. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask the Holy Spirit to aid you.",
      "content": "Ask the Holy Spirit to aid you. Talk to the Holy Spirit as you would a person, asking Him to help you connect to God, the Father. You may decide to use a favorite prayer in order to help you invoke the Holy Spirit. After asking for the aid of the Holy Spirit, wait a few minutes so that His power can fill you and help direct your prayers. [7] X Research source For example, you might say something like, “Holy Spirit, please help me connect to God.”"

      "title": "Let the Spirit lead you in prayer.",
      "content": "Let the Spirit lead you in prayer. After inviting the Holy Spirit into your prayer, you may feel moved to express praise toward God in words, or you may find that your feelings cannot be expressed in language. All kinds of prayer are acceptable. With the help of the Holy Spirit, God will direct your mind to prayers that are in keeping with His will. [8] X Research source The Holy Spirit may direct you to pray for other members of the community, the advance of the kingdom of God, or any other matter. Follow your heart when praying. For example, the Spirit might inspire you to make a prayer like, “I pray for the welfare of those suffering in my community, and to grow closer to You, my Lord.” You may end up praying for yourself—this is appropriate as well if the Holy Spirit guides you towards it, for as the Bible tells us, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” (Philippians 4:6)."

      "content": "Practice praying in the Spirit every day. Even a few minutes of prayer each day is a meaningful way to grow closer to God. By invoking the Holy Spirit whenever you enter prayer, you’ll become much more familiar with the feeling of His presence. Like any skill, practice makes praying in the Spirit easier over time. [9] X Research source When you’re starting out practicing praying in the Spirit, it’s a good idea to keep a prayer journal. After each prayer session, write down how you felt, and whether you could sense the Holy Spirit moving you. [10] X Research source"
