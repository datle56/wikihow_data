Though MBTI compatibility hasn’t been comprehensively studied, some research suggests that sharing the same S-N type (both partners being Sensing-dominant or both partners being Intuition-dominant) increases romantic attraction. [55] X Research source Sharing two of the four traits further increases compatibility, especially if you and your partner are both Sensing/Judging, or Intuition/Feeling. [56] X Research source For example, ESTJ and ESFJ are likely compatible because they share the Sensing and Judging traits. This means that they process information and move through the world in similar ways.

[58] X Research source For example, ISTJ is likely incompatible with ENFP because they have major differences in how social they are, how they make decisions, and how they move through the world. Pairings where one partner is Extraverted and the other partner is Introverted also tend to be less compatible. They might not see eye-to-eye about how often they should go out and socialize, which could cause conflict in the long run. [59] X Research source If your partner is an “incompatible” Myers-Briggs type, don’t worry! You can still have a healthy and fulfilling long-term relationship. Work on building healthy communication skills and focus on seeing things from each other’s perspective , so that you can understand one another’s differences.MBTI can be a great tool to learn more about yourself and your partner, but it shouldn’t be the sole factor you consider when making decisions about your relationship. Your personal interactions and connection with someone are what matter most!"

      "title": "The MBTI is a test you can take to identify your personality type.",
      "content": "The MBTI is a test you can take to identify your personality type. According to the MBTI, there are four categories that determine your personality . Each person has one preferred quality from each category, and the different combinations produce 16 distinct personality types. [60] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Here are explanations of the four categories: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I) : based on where you focus your energy and how you receive energy. Extraverts focus energy outward and are energized by spending time with others. Introverts focus energy inward and need alone time to recharge after socializing. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N) : based on how you gather information. Sensing people take in information through their five senses and focus on things they can see or observe. Intuitive people observe patterns and put a heavier weight on their impressions about things. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) : based on how you make decisions. Thinking types prefer using hard facts and logic to make decisions. Feeling types consider people’s emotions and circumstances when making decisions. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P) : based on how you move through the world. Judging people prefer structure and routine, and they move through the world methodically. Perceiving people prefer spontaneity and flexibility, and they use their adaptability to move through the world.
