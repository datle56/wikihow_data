Check the cables from your TV to your sound system and make sure they are securely connected. Also, check to make sure the connection from any external sources (such as cable boxes and video games consoles) is also securely connected. You can also try swapping the HDMI or optical cable that is connected to your devices with a new one and see if it fixes the problem. Most sound systems and soundbars use an HDMI ARC connection. If your audio receiver or soundbar is connected with an HDMI cable, make sure it is connected to an HDMI port labeled \"HDMI ARC\" or \"HDMI eARC.\""

If the problem starts happening while watching a streaming video, try watching a different video or watching a different streaming app. See if the problem is happening on all videos and all apps. If the problem is only happening on one TV channel, the problem is most likely with the channel itself. Contact your cable or satellite provider to let them know. Try again later and see if the problem has been fixed. If the problem is only happening with one streaming video, most likely the audio and video are not properly mixed. Contact the creator or streaming service to let them know. If the problem is only happening on one streaming app, try downloading that app to a different device, such as a game console or streaming box (i.e, Roku, Firestick TV). If you are already watching the app on a game console, try downloading the app to your smart TV or a streaming box and see if the problem happens on a different device. If the problem only happens while watching streaming videos, check your internet connection. This could be caused by a poor internet connection. Try resetting your modem or router and see if the problem is fixed."

If you are experiencing problems when using an external source, such as a video game console or cable box, you may want to try connecting the game console or cable box directly to your soundbar or sound system reciever. If you connect an external source to your TV and then connect your TV to an external sound system, the audio signal has a longer distance to travel, which can cause a delay in the audio. Connecting your external source directly to your sound system can reduce this distance and limit the audio delay. If the external source doesn't have an extra audio-out HDMI port, check to see if has a port for an optical or digital cable. You can connect it to your sound system using an optical cable, or a digital audio cable."
