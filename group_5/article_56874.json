Here are some basic ideas to get you started: [1] X Research source Skirts and dresses that are flirty and girly. They are not too short and not too tight. Most are going to be mid-thigh of longer. Blouses and shirts are modest. Great options are loose, flowing blouses, button-up shirts, scoop-neck fitted tees, and even printed or graphic tees. Boot-cut and skinny jeans aren't the only pants that can be cute. Shorts (especially with lace insets), baggy boyfriend jeans, rompers, jumpsuits, and culottes can also be quite cute.

      "content": "Consider the colors. Some people associate certain colors with \"cute\" more so than other colors. Light colors, such as pinks, light blues, and whites are youthful and feminine. Clothes with these colors are often quite cute. You can branch out to other colors too. For example: Neutrals, such as browns and creams are great for the fall and winter months. A flash of a bright color, such as red, can also be cute, but try to stay away from too many dark colors. These can look more mature, or chic than cute."

They can help the final outfit look all the more cute. Here are some ideas: Knits, especially chunky knits, can help make a winter outfit look cozier. Think cardigans and over-sized sweaters. Flannel will usually come in the form of a plaid, button-up shirt. They are great for layering. Leather and fake leather can add a touch of smoothness to any outfit.

      "content": "Keep the cut and shape in mind. Modesty is often associated with cuteness, so you might want to consider softer shapes rather than pointier ones. Here are some examples: Consider a softer neckline, such as a scoop or sweetheart instead of a sharp point. Try a flirty, loose-fitting skirt that goes past your mid-thigh over a short or tight fitting skirt for something a little more sexy or chic. Choose loose fitting blouses, oversized sweaters, and full-circle skirts. Opt for a turtleneck in winter for something casual, but sophisticated. Experiment with different textures as well, such as a lightweight ribbed knit or cotton during warmer weather or a heavier knit during cold weather."

There are many other shoes that can also count as \"cute.\" Here are some ideas to get you started: [3] X Research source Ballet flats and moccasins are great because they can work with almost any outfit. Shoes with embellishments, such as lace and bows, are always a great start. Wedges are perfect for the summertime, especially if they come with long, ballerina-style laces. Heeled, chunky boots are a mixture of the feminine and the outdoors. They can be quite cute, especially if paired with skinny jeans. If you like to wear canvas sneakers or clunky boots, consider getting a pair that has a colorful lining on the inside. You can also switch out the shoelaces for something more colorful or patterned."

If you like to make a statement, don't shy away from chunky bracelets, large earrings, or a flashy statement necklace. Make your jewelry the focal point of your outfit, and keep the rest simple. Take advantage of trinkets you got while traveling, especially if you cannot get any in your hometown. Your friends will see it as both unique and cute.

Berets and slouching beanies in bright or pastel colors are great for the cooler months. A wide brimmed felt hat can look both chic and cute in the summer, especially if paired with over-sized sunglasses and red lipstick. Big, chunky scarves are perfect for the winter.

You can also make your own clips by buying some blank hair clips from an arts and crafts store, and hot gluing buttons, tiny bows, or silk flowers to the top.

[4] X Research source If you got a new pair of shoes that you just love, pair them with a simple dress, then wear a belt or scarf that matches those shoes. Draw attention to colorful patterned scarf by pairing it with plain jeans and a solid-colored shirt. If you get stuck, you can always close your eyes, reach into your closet, and pull something out.

Here are some examples: If you have a skirt with pink flowers on a blue background with some white detailing, choose a white shirt to bring out the white details. If you have a white-and-navy stripped shirt, consider pairing it with a pair of dark-blue jeans or white jeans. You can add a bit of color with accessories, such as a pair of red sunglasses or a red bracelet. Avoid wearing two or more different patterns together.

Add some girlish flats, a little clutch, and you are good to go. [7] X Research source In the summertime, you can get away with more whites, bright colors, and bold patterns. Now's the time to bring out those linen maxi gowns, wide-brimmed hats, statement jewelry, and over-sized glasses. Wedges and heeled sandals are prefect for those warm, sunny days. Start wearing more neutral colors in the fall. Depending on how cold it is, you can also start wearing some knits and flannels. For example, on a chilly day, you could pair a long, chunky sweater with a pair of solid-colored leggings and some ridding boots.

Use light or neutral colors, such as pastels or earth tones. Keep the fabrics simple. Leave the sequins, glitter, and silk for the evening, and focus on jersey, knits, flannels, cotton, linen, denim, and so forth. Wear lighter colors when in doubt. If you can't decide between two dresses, go for the lighter one; it will look more casual than the black or bright red one. Don't pile on too much jewelry—unless you are going for a boho look.

They can also make running to class more difficult. Consider wearing shorter heels or flat-bottomed shoes, such as ballet flats, canvas sneakers, or boots. Wear layers. Some classrooms get chilly while others get hot. Consider wearing a cardigan or flannel blouse over your shirt that you can easily take on/off. Tone down the accessories. They can get in the way while you are taking notes or carrying your backpack around. If you do choose to wear jewelry, make sure that it does not get in the way. A statement necklace can work well, but make sure that it won't get tangled with your backpack strap. [9] X Research source Consider styling your hair instead of leaving it down. Braids, ponytails, and updos will keep it out of the way while you study. Consider getting a shoulder bag instead of a backpack.
