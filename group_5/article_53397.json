      "content": "When you “do it for the plot,” you're doing something for the excitement. This Gen Z slang yourself as the main character in your life and to do things that are exciting, memorable, and great material for amazing stories. This can help people do things that are riskier, but more fun and character-building. [1] X Research source The idea is that, even if you do something that has some kind of negative result (maybe it makes you sad, or maybe it's a little embarrassing), you can stop feeling guilty or regretful: because you didn't do it for the outcome. You do it for the plot! You may do something for the plot if you just want to add drama to your life. For example, going on blind dates that you know won’t end in a relationship. The phrase can also be used for once-in-a-lifetime experiences. If you randomly decide to go skydiving one day, you’re doing it for the plot. Think of it as the Gen Z version of “YOLO.”"

      "title": "Talk about doing something that scared you.",
      "content": "Talk about doing something that scared you. One of the best ways to do it for the plot is to try something out of your comfort zone. If you did something that scared you and it worked out in your favor (or even if it didn’t), tell everyone about your experience. Here are some examples: [2] X Research source “I was really nervous to talk to the pretty girl at the bar, but I did it for the plot and ended up getting her number!” “I’ve never gone to a concert alone before, but all my friends are busy, so I’m going to do it for the plot.” “I decided to move abroad to France. I’m really nervous, but I’m doing it for the plot.”"

      "content": "Laugh about your dating life. Many people on social media talk about dating “for the plot.” In this case, they’re not dating to try to find a lifelong partner, but instead to have fun and meet new, interesting people. If you’ve gone on some wacky dates, tell everyone how you did it for the plot. Here are some examples: [3] X Research source “This guy I matched with on Tinder wants to take me to a heavy metal concert. I’m not into that kind of music, but I’m doing it for the plot.” “I decided to date for the plot and met a girl who plays the bagpipes. You never know who you’ll meet!” “The date I went on didn’t go very well, but at least I did it for the plot.”"

      "content": "Use it as an excuse to do something reckless. While it’s probably not a good idea to do something dangerous just for the plot, many people use the phrase when they want to do something dumb or that they know won’t work out well in the end. Here are some examples: [4] X Research source “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to go to the bar last night, but I did it for the plot.” “I decided to go bungee jumping even though I’m terrified of heights. Is it crazy? Yes, but I’m doing it for the plot.” “I’m really bored, so I’m about to text my ex just to do it for the plot.”"

      "content": "Start saying “yes” to new experiences. Remember, you’re the main character in your life, and you can’t advance your plot if you’re stuck in a rut. If someone invites you to something that’s out of your comfort zone, do it anyway ! You may end up having a blast, and even if you don’t, at least you did it for the plot. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Meet new people. Adding new characters is a great way to advance the plot. Even if you aren’t looking for a relationship, try online dating or going on blind dates to meet new, interesting people . Talk to people when you’re out shopping or at events. Even if you don’t find lifelong friends in the process, you may meet someone so fascinating that you’re sure to think of them for years to come. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Move to or visit new places. If you feel like your life has gotten dull, seeing new sights can help you remember how much there is to explore. If you want to do it for the plot, go on a spontaneous road trip , either alone or with some friends. Or, if you’re feeling really adventurous, get a fresh start and move to a new city, state, or even a new country. This way, there will be plenty of new side plots for you to discover."
