      "content": "828 is a sign positive change is coming. If you feel like you’ve been floundering lately, 828 is a good omen: it’s a sign that your guardian angels are on your side, and that your hard work is finally going to pay off. In the coming days and weeks, expect to get further along on your life path. The changes coming your way could be related to your love life, your spiritual health, your career—or all 3! By sending you the number 828, your angels could be asking you to take steps to make important change, or they could be telling you to prepare for change to happen to you. Either way, keep marching down the path you’re currently on, and keep an eye out for opportunities for growth—your angels are cheering you on! The entire number 828 adds up to 18, with the individual digits 1 and 8 adding up to 9. The 9 symbolizes not only the completion or end of a cycle, but 9 is also about change on every level; in fact, it's considered the highest change number in numerology (the most active number on the mind plane). With the numerical sequence of 828, following your intuitive voice or gut instinct will lead you to the right changes to make and pathways to take in order to create and attract the types of abundance that you desire."

      "content": "828 means you will experience spiritual ascension. This is a number of harmony, destiny, and peace, so if you’re seeing it everywhere you go, a spiritual breakthrough is on the horizon. Your guardian angels have seen your efforts to cultivate a spiritual identity, and those efforts will be rewarded soon. Expect to undergo some major personal and spiritual growth in the days ahead. Now isn’t the time to take a break from your spiritual practice: keep up with your daily meditation , yoga , or whatever you do to engage your spiritual side and open your third eye chakra . If you don’t already, it’s worth it to implement manifestation into your daily spiritual practice. As you hone your spiritual powers, your ability to manifest your dreams will grow stronger."

      "title": "8 stands for eternity and the life cycle, and 2 stands for balance.",
      "content": "8 stands for eternity and the life cycle, and 2 stands for balance. The positive changes portended by the number 828 are reflected in the number 2, which promises balance and harmony, and the number 8, which represents destiny and the life cycle. You can rest easy when you see this number, as it indicates harmony and fulfillment are headed your way. [1] X Research source The number 8 represents eternity and destiny, but when doubled, the power of this digit is magnified. Take this to mean that the changes you’ll experience soon will be noticeable and life-altering! Eight is considered the number of abundance and manifestation—it is a doubtless and confident energy. Even Chinese culture reveres the number 8 in relation to money and abundance (and they often seek out anything related to the number 8, considering it \"lucky\" in a financial sense). Having the number 2 in between two abundant 8s is saying to go with your gut and follow your intuition in order to manifest whatever it is you want to receive in this life. After all, 2 is the number of intuition and sensitivity and is the number that resonates most with the soul."

      "content": "If you’re in a relationship, anticipate positive growth. 828 is a symbol of harmony and love, and if you’re in a relationship, you can expect your connection with your partner to deepen. You both respect and love yourselves and one another, and the hard work you’ve done on yourselves as individuals is going to pay off in your relationship as well. The stronger connection you experience may take the form of something overt, like an engagement or moving in together, or it may just be a sense of deepening love for one another. Promote intimacy in your relationship by cuddling your partner more this week, telling them you love them, and going out of your way to do special favors for them, like buying them chocolate or doing chores for them."

      "content": "If you’re single, you may find your soulmate soon. If you’re seeing 828, it’s because you’ve been working hard on yourself. You’ve been investing in your talents, showing yourself love, and working to overcome past demons, and your angels recognize that. If you’ve been looking for a new love, now is the perfect time to ask out a stranger or see if the person you’ve been dating casually could become something more. If you’re not already dating, set up a dating profile or ask friends to set you up. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there this week—it’ll be worth it in the end."

      "content": "If you haven’t met your twin flame, you may meet them soon. We’re all born with someone who shares half of our soul, but only a very small number of us ever meet our twin flame. If you’re seeing 828, you might be one of the lucky few. Your hard personal work will come to fruition: it’s only by knowing ourselves really well that we can truly recognize our twin flame when we come upon them. Embrace being wholly yourself, and you’ll not only be able to find them, they’ll be attracted to you —just like magnets. If you’ve already met and lost your twin flame, 828 may be a sign you’re going to reunite. Don’t be nervous to get close to them again: you’ve both grown a lot in your time apart. Treat your reunion as an entirely new relationship—because it is."

      "content": "If you have met your twin flame, expect to deepen your connection. The twin flame relationship is one of the most intense relationships you’ll ever experience, and if you’re seeing 828, it’s a sign your relationship will become even more intense and intimate in the coming days or weeks. You’ll learn more about one another and learn to rely on each other more than you ever have, and while it can be scary to be so entwined with another person, don’t fight it: it’s scary, but it’s rewarding. Practice being open with your twin flame this week. Invite them into your heart, and trust that they won’t judge you. They’ll likely relate to everything you feel and experience, and they’ll reciprocate your openness."
