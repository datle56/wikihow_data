      "content": "Use only the foamy suds so you don’t rewet the stain. Mix some hot water with a few drops of dish soap in a large bowl until you have a lot of suds. Dip the corner of a soft cloth into the bubbles, making sure not to get the cloth wet. Gently rub the foam into the stain until it lifts up. Then, just wipe the soap off with another damp towel.

      "content": "Working petroleum jelly into the surface could hide minor rings or stains. Scoop out a fingertip-sized amount of petroleum jelly onto a clean soft cloth. Work the petroleum jelly into the stain using circular movements. If the stain doesn’t disappear after you rub it in completely, try applying a little more and leaving it for about an hour before rubbing it in. [2] X Research source The petroleum jelly should absorb into the wood, but wipe away any excess you still see with a soft cloth."

      "content": "Mayonnaise works best on newer stains that are only a few days old. You can use any mayonnaise you have in your fridge. Rub some mayo onto the stain with a rag. Leave the mayo on the wood overnight, but be sure to reapply more if it dries out. The next day, wipe the mayonnaise and stain away with a clean cloth. The oils from the mayonnaise will absorb into the wood and remove the moisture. [3] X Research source You can try adding wood ashes to the mayonnaise to make it slightly abrasive to help the oils penetrate deeper."

      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar work best on tough, darker stains. Combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of 3% hydrogen peroxide with 1 cup (240 ml) of warm water in a bowl.

      "content": "The fizzing reaction between baking soda and vinegar loosens stains. Cover the entire stain with a thin layer of baking soda and rub it in with a dry cloth. Then, dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in white vinegar and gently scrub the baking soda. When the mixture stops bubbling, wipe it off with a dry cloth. [5] X Expert Source Guy Peters House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 27 September 2021. You can do this as many times as you need to completely remove the stains.

      "content": "Stick with a white, non-gel toothpaste for the best clean. Squeeze some of the toothpaste onto the corner of a soft cloth and slowly rub it onto the stain in the same direction as the wood grain. Gently scrub the toothpaste onto the stain for about a minute to work the stain out from your wood. [6] X Research source Toothpaste has a slight abrasive that helps scrape the stain away, but it could damage the wood’s finish."

      "content": "Use the finest steel wool you can find to prevent damage. Apply a few drops of lemon oil to the stain, and gently rub it into the stain with the steel wool. Use light pressure and work in the same direction as the wood grain so any scratches from the steel wool blend in easier. [7] X Research source Only use steel wool on the stained area of your wood so you don’t accidentally damage another section."

Cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice out onto the salt to form a paste. Scrub the salt paste deeper into the stain with the cut side of the lemon. Let the paste dry overnight before rinsing it off with a damp cloth. [8] X Research source Salt and lemon make a slight abrasive that could clear the stains from your wood."

      "content": "The heat from the iron draws moisture out from the wood. If your iron has water in it, be sure to empty it before using it on wood. Lay a cotton napkin or a T-shirt over the stain to protect your wood. Turn the iron to the lowest setting and rub it over the stain for a few seconds. Lift up the napkin or shirt to check if the stain disappeared. If it hasn’t, try rubbing the iron over the stain for a few more seconds.

      "content": "Dry out the moisture in the stain on the lowest heat setting. This works best on newer stains even after the milk has dried on the wood’s surface. Wave the hair dryer over the stain so you don’t damage or overheat the wood. After about 10 minutes, the stain should dry up. [10] X Research source The white stain is actually moisture caught between the wood and the finish. When you apply heat, the moisture evaporates and escapes from the wood."
