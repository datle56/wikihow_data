When someone posts an Instagram Story and selects the Close Friends option, the people they've added to their Close Friends list will see a green circle around the Story at the top of the Instagram app. Only you and the user's other Close Friends will be able to view the Story. Instagram Stories are collections of photos or videos posted by users. Similar to Snapchat Stories , these will disappear after a set timeframe. You can't request to join someone's Close Friends list. You also won't be notified if you are added to or deleted from a Close Friends list."
