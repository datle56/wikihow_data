      "content": "This is the direct translation of “I don’t speak Spanish.” In many Spanish-speaking countries, if you tell someone in a touristy area that you don’t speak Spanish, they might immediately begin speaking to you in English. Keep this sentence in your back pocket—it’s likely to be pretty useful. [1] X Research source Pronounce this sentence as: “no AB-low es-PAHN-yol” You can also add the Spanish word for “sorry,” “disculpe” (dees-COOL-pay), at the beginning or end of this sentence in order to sound more polite. [2] X Research source Instead of “disculpe,” you can also use “lo siento” (lo SEE-ehn-to) or “perdón,” (per-DOAN) which also translate to “sorry.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Say “I speak a little Spanish” if you know a few words. It’s worth letting someone know if you can understand a little bit of Spanish, since this can definitely help make communication easier. They may be able to speak slower or with a simpler vocabulary in order to communicate with you. [4] X Research source Pronounce this sentence as: “AB-low oon po-KEY-to day es-PAHN-yol” If you feel a little more confident in your skills, say, “Hablo un poquito de español, ¿puedes hablar más despacio?” (AB-low oon po-KEY-to day es-PAHN-yol poo-EH-day AB-lar mas des-PAH-see-oh). This means, “I speak a little Spanish. Can you speak slower?”"

      "content": "Use this question to ask, “Do you speak English?” Depending on what country or region you’re in, you may encounter many native Spanish speakers who have a good command of English as well. Ask this question to see if they’d be willing to switch to English. [6] X Research source Pronounce this question as: “poo-EH-dess AB-lahr en eeng-LAYS” If you’re speaking with someone older than you or someone in a position of authority, try using the formal variation of this question instead: “¿Puede hablar en inglés?” (“poo-EH-day AB-lahr en eeng-LAYS.”) It’s a bit more polite to introduce this question by first explaining you don’t speak Spanish. For example: “Disculpe, no hablo español. ¿Puedes hablar en inglés?”"
