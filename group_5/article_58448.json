Make your wrist straight as a carrot!\" Flex your fingers and touch the strings. Put the chin rest under your jaw and align the violin with your arm. Don't put the violin right on your arm, a bit beside it. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold the bow correctly.",
      "content": "Hold the bow correctly. Put your thumb just next to the frog. Place your middle and ring finger together on the frog(the end or the ‘thick part’). Make sure they don't go all the way around the frog. Your pointing finger should rest on its side at the second knuckle about four centimeters above your middle finger. Lastly, place your pinky finger next to the scroll. Always remember that your pinky should not go around the bow; it's the only finger that stays on top. Relax your fingers. Your fingers will hold it well. You can practice first using an expo marker. [2] X Research source It might also be beneficial to place your fingers near the balance point of the bow. To do this, lay out your middle finger (since it has the most balance) and place the bow on it. Move the bow to the right or left until it stays on your finger without falling off. Then put all of your fingers in place - your finger positioning stays the same, you are just placing your hand in a different place."

      "content": "Hold the bow gently but firmly. Be sure that your bow stick is parallel to the bridge. Start with E, the string closest to your right. E is the highest string. Rest the bow on the E string and start at the bottom of the bow. Put the hair on the string and slowly pull the bow down. Flex from your elbow. Remember not to put pressure on your hand; use the weight of your arm to pull the bow."
