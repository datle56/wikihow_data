You can obtain a teleport crystal with four charges by starting the \"Mourning's End Part I\" quest [1] X Research source . After starting Mourning's End Part I you can also find teleport crystals and crystal teleport seeds as drops from the following: Teleport crystals with 1 charge (~.8% drop rate): Elf Archers in Lletya and Prifddinas (level 90 combat) Elf Warriors in Lletya and Prifddinas (level 108 combat) Guards in Prifddinas (level 108 combat) Iowerth Warriors (in Iowerth Dungeon, not Iowerth Camp) (level 108 combat) Crystal teleport seeds (~19% drop rate): Elf Archers in Lletya and Prifddinas (level 90 combat) Elf Warriors in Lletya and Prifddinas (level 108 combat) Guards in Prifddinas (level 108 combat) Iowerth Warriors (in Iowerth Dungeon, not Iowerth Camp) (level 108 combat)"

Eluned will recharge your teleport crystal, but only if it's been completely used up and has turned into a crystal teleport seed.

Prior to completing Song of the Elves, Eluned can be found at the magic trees southwest of Lletya or in the clearing just northwest of Tyras Camp. She will teleport between these two locations, so the best way to find her pre-Song of the Elves is to go to one of her locations and world hop until you find her, or wait about 5 minutes for her to teleport to your location. During Song of the Elves, sometimes Eluned will be unavailable if she's involved in the quest. In her place will be an Elven scout who can recharge your crystal teleport seed instead. After Song of the Elves, Eluned can be found near Guinevere's Dyes in southwest Prifddinas."

[3] X Research source At first, Eluned can only recharge each teleport crystal with 3 charges. However, if you complete the Hard Western Provinces Diary, she will recharge your crystals with 5 charges each. [4] X Research source"

There are two ways to get an enhanced teleport crystal seed: thieving and combat. Both methods have about a 0.01% chance of dropping an enhanced crystal teleport seed. Thieving (level 85): Elf Using the rogue equipment will increase your chance of getting 2 enhanced crystal teleport seeds, and a full set will guarantee getting 2 drops. Combat (level 108): Guards in Prifddinas, Iowerth Warriors (in Iowerth Dungeon, not Iowerth Camp) You can also buy enhanced crystal teleport seeds at the Grand Exchange . While prices fluctuate all the time, the price has fluctuated from a low of about 1.5 million coins and a high of 2.8 million coins over the past year. [5] X Research source"

The first percentage chance is your chance of getting that loot table when opening the chest, and the second percentage chance is your chance of getting crystal shards as a reward. Coins (7.8% chance): 8-13 shards (7.8% chance) Crystal Shards (6.6% chance): 20-30 shards (6.6% chance) Rune Platelegs/Plateskirt (6.6% chance): 4-6 shards (6.6% chance) Completing Prifddinas Agility Course laps: 1 shard (33% chance per shortcut portal) Catching crystal implings: 5-10 shards (5% chance) Killing Guards in Prifddinas or NPCs in Iowerth Dungeon: 1 shard (4% chance) Killing superior slayer monsters in Iowerth Dungeon: 1 shard Pickpocketing an Elf in Prifddinas: 1 shard (2.8% chance) or 2 shards (guaranteed with full rogue equipment) Chopping a tree in Prifddinas: 1 shard when getting a log (1.2% chance) Mining ore in Trahaearn mine or tephra during the Zalcano fight: 1 shard (.8% chance)"
