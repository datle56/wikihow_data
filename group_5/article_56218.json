      "content": "This pair will never run out of things to talk about. Sagittarius is ruled by planet Jupiter, the planet of knowledge and exploration. Similarly, Aries is ruled by Mars, the warrior planet, meaning they aren’t likely to back down about topics that are important to them.

Sagittarius is a mutable sign and open to change, while Aries is a cardinal sign, meaning they’re a little more set in their ways. The couple needs to be careful to respect each other’s opinions during debates and not take their words too seriously."
