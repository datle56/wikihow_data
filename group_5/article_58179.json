And I have a notion that I'd take to bleeding inwardly.” (Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre ) “The practice of love offers no place of safety. We risk loss, hurt, pain. We risk being acted upon by forces outside our control.” (bell hooks, All About Love )"

Whether you’ve only just begun chatting or you’re tiptoeing towards relationship territory, everyone likes to get a friendly, encouraging text message, but the depth and vulnerability you display in your text message will depend on how close you are to your crush. If your crush gave you their number yesterday, it’s probably best not to send them a block of text about how you’re both soulmates. Take it slow! Start with a cheerful, lowkey good morning text instead that makes it clear you like them, but that doesn’t come on too strongly. Dole out sincere but lighthearted compliments , or grab their attention by letting them know you’re thinking about them. Maybe include a meme you think they’ll love."

If you’ve built a solid foundation with your crush and you think they might have feelings for you too, you can be a bit more vulnerable with your message. A raw, honest message about how much your crush means to you is sure to create a stronger connection between you both. [1] X Research source A sincere text to let them know how much joy and peace they bring to your life is sure to make them smile —and draw them closer to you. [2] X Research source If you haven’t shared your true feelings with your crush yet, a text or DM can be a great way to tell them you love them without the pressure of a face-to-face confession. When confessing your feelings, you can play it cool and practical and let them know you’d like to try going out on a date, or lay your feelings out on the table and tell them you’re head-over-heels in love. Regardless, be open and sincere—and then leave the ball in their court."
