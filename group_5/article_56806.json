      "content": "Yes, eyelid adhesive can make hooded eyes look bigger. To use eyelid adhesive, wash your eyelids and pat them dry with a towel. If you’re using tape, cut out a thin strip and press it against your upper eyelid along the crease you’d like to enhance. If you’re using eyelid glue, brush a small amount onto your crease and let it dry for about a minute. [1] X Research source The higher you place your adhesive, the bigger your lid will look. It can take some trial and error, so be prepared to take it off and redo it a few times. Both the tape and the glue are clear, so they shouldn’t be too noticeable in your everyday life. However, sweat and oil can make them come off, so you may have to reapply throughout the day."
