      "content": "Take a break from social media. If you're not as big a part of your friend's life anymore, social media can create feelings of distress. If you and the faded friend are still in contact online, seeing updates about his or her life can sting. It may be a good idea to take a social media vacation while you grieve.

      "content": "Avoid assigning blame for the relationship fading. If a friendship simply faded, most of the time no one is to blame. Even if the two of you did have a falling out, ruminating over blame only makes it more difficult to let go. Blame can also damage to future friendships, as it fails to resolve conflicts and only creates animosity. If you let yourself blame now, you may get into a bad cycle of blame in the future.

If you and your friend are growing in different directions and you want different things, it's natural to drift apart.

      "content": "Consider your contribution, if any, to the friendship's end. You may not have done anything. A lot of time, a faded friendship is due to external constraints like time and distance. You may simply not be as close to this person as you once were. However, a friend may be distancing his or herself for a reason. The loss of a friendship is an opportunity to consider the kind of friend you are and the kind of friendships you form. [6] X Research source Has this happened to you before? Have you had other friends simply fade away over time? If this happens to you frequently, you may be doing something to drive friends away. It's also possible you're choosing companions who are difficult to get along with or incompatible with you as a person. If the friend in question has had many failed friendships before, you may not be the problem. You may be choosing emotionally unavailable people as friends. Spend some time considering the quality of your past friendships, and whether your friends have always treated you in a way that makes you feel safe and comfortable. If the friend in question has many longterm friendships besides you, you may be part of the problem. Consider your interactions with this person. Can you think of anything you did wrong? Try to talk to other friends. Ask them for honest feedback on whether you're a good friend. Press them for ways you could improve."

      "content": "Do not take a friendship's fading personally. A faded friendship is usually not personal. Constraints, like distance and other obligations, can make maintaining friendships difficult. While humans have a tendency to internalize the events that occur in their lives, the faded friendship likely has nothing to do with you. Consider where your friend is in life. Did he or she just have a new baby, get married, start a job? Did this friend move away? While certain friendships may feel like they'll last a lifetime, circumstances can strain relationships. A friend may simply not have time to reach out. In the future, when your friend becomes less busy, you may rekindle the friendship. Chances are, if an external factor ended the relationship, your friend does not hold any animosity towards you."

      "content": "See how new forms of communication impact the relationship. Relationships fade for a variety of reasons. If you moved away from your college town, for example, you and your best friend may have talked on the phone every day for the first few weeks. After a year or two, you may not talk or visit as often. You may think your friend no longer needs you, or that the relationship has ceased to matter. However, it may just be that you're both busy. Finding new ways to communicate can help you both see how the relationship still matters. Text your friend. Engage with him or her on social media. You may be able to maintain the friendship, in a slightly different form, by switching up communication modes. Your friend may have an easier time getting back to you via social media and texting, allowing you to see that the friendship, while faded, still matters to both of you."

Many people lose friends throughout the course of a lifetime, and may be able to offer you their unique insight. However, keep in mind you should not gossip.

      "content": "Accept the relationship has changed. A faded friendship does not mean a friendship is ending. Friendships, especially long term friendships, change over time. Rather than abandoning the friendship, work on looking at the big picture. Do not think of the friendship as having faded so much as having evolved. [8] X Research source People change with time, and change can affect friendships. A friendship's former level of closeness may no longer be practical for a variety of reasons. If you're in your 30s, for example, you may still not be intensely close to your high school friends group. If you're approaching your 40s, certain college friendships may have faded. Even while a relationship has faded slightly, that does not make it less important. Try to accept that a dip in intimacy is common over time. You may not talk to certain close friends every day after a certain point. That's okay. You do not need to let go of faded friends. Instead, accept that the relationship has changed while continuing to think of the friendship as important."

      "content": "Reach out to your friend in the future. Remember, friendships often fade due to external circumstances. When things calm down for both and your friend, consider reaching out. Even if you have feelings of frustration about the lack of communication, let them go. You may be able to rekindle the relationship, to an extent, once things calm down. Many people do not want to reach out to a faded friend if they felt they were jilted or ignored. You may feel it's your friend's \"turn\" to make the first move. However, this feeling will not help the situation. You'll end up isolating yourself from someone unnecessarily. Try to forgive your friend for the lack of contact. Sometimes, a simple phone call or text message can rekindle a forgotten friendship. Friendships go through changes, like any relationship. There will be times when you and your friend share everything, and times when you are distant. A faded friendship may not stay faded forever. If this person is important to you, it may be worth your time to reach out. You could end up bringing someone special back into your life."
