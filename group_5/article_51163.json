      "content": "Warm oceans typically spawn near badlands and deserts. Their ocean water is a lighter blue/teal tone, and they often feature a lot of fun and colorful sites, like coral blocks, coral, coral fans, and sea grass. [2] X Research source As you dive down and explore, look for warm ocean ruins, which resemble arched sandstone structures. [3] X Research source You’ll need to make a Potion of Water Breathing to help you stay underwater for long periods of time without drowning. Warning: Unless you’re playing in Peaceful mode, there’s a chance that hostile mobs (like Drowned) could attack you while you’re exploring."

      "content": "Suspicious sand blocks have a darker tint to them than regular sand. These blocks won’t yield any sniffer eggs if you break them, so it’s important to inspect them with a brush. Each suspicious sand block has a 6.7% chance of yielding a sniffer egg, so it may take several tries (or even several warm ocean ruins) before you find 2. [4] X Research source Don’t have a brush? Craft one using a feather, a copper ingot, and a wooden stick. [5] X Research source"

It’ll just take the eggs about 20 minutes to hatch when they aren’t set on moss blocks. [6] X Research source When the sniffers hatch, they’ll be baby sniffers (also known as snifflets)."
