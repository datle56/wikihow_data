More options: Gives you more items to choose from, like creating the post yourself (similar to Share now, but you have the option to change the audience), sharing it to a friend's profile, sharing to a group, or posting it on a page. Copy link: This lets you copy the link to your clipboard and paste the link to that post outside of Facebook, like if you're in a Discord community where you want to share the Facebook post. The link will post to the channel, but others will need to be signed into Facebook to see your linked content. Embed: This is useful if you have your own website that allows you to embed outside code. Using this, you can post the Facebook post on your website. Share via: This isn't always available for every post, but you can also share it to Twitter or WhatsApp when you choose this option."
