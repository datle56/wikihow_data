      "content": "Latex paint: 2–4 hours Latex paints are water-based, so the moisture evaporates a bit quicker after you apply them and you can do multiple coats on the same day. Latex paints might feel dry to the touch within 30–60 minutes, but they need just a little longer to fully dry before you touch them up or apply another coat. Different finishes have slightly varying drying times, so always be sure to check the paint can to see what it recommends.

      "content": "Oil-based paint: 24 hours Oil-based paints are great for getting a smooth finish that’s more resistant to damage, but they take a lot longer to dry in between coats. [8] X Research source Even though oil-based might feel dry to the touch after a few hours, let it dry completely overnight to ensure that your next coat adheres properly. [9] X Research source Oil-based paints are usually used for exteriors, trim pieces, doors, and any other materials where you want to hide brushstrokes."

      "content": "Humidity When the humidity is higher than 50%, the moisture in the air could prevent your coat of paint from drying. Always check the weather in your area for the few days that you plan on painting so it doesn’t get too humid. If you’re painting indoors, try running a dehumidifier to help pull the moisture out of the air and speed up your drying time. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Temperature",
      "content": "Temperature Most paints dry best when they’re around 70–80 °F (21–27 °C), so temperatures that are any colder could make you wait longer between coats. If you’re painting interior walls, check the recommended drying temperature on the paint can and set your thermostat. If you’re painting outside , then wait for a few days of warm weather without any rain. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Ventilation If there isn’t a lot of airflow in the space where you’re painting, then the moisture in the paint doesn’t have anywhere to go. Increase the airflow in the room by opening doors and windows or turning on a fan so you can speed up the drying time. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Application method",
      "content": "Application method Different application methods can apply the paint in a thicker coat that can increase your drying time. If you use a paint roller , the paint will spread out more evenly into a thin layer on your walls than if you applied it with a brush. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "The topcoat of paint could peel or crack if you put it on a wet surface. When you touch up or put another coat of paint onto a surface that hasn't had time to fully dry, it could have a splotchy or uneven appearance. The moisture gets caught in between the layers, which could eventually lead to bubbling or sections peeling away. When the bottom coat is totally dry before you apply more paint, then it will be able to adhere properly. [15] X Research source If you’re ever unsure about how long to let paint dry, just wait until the next day to apply the next coat."

Just know that the longer you wait, dust can build up on the first coat and make the next coat look uneven or splotchy. UV rays from the sun can also affect the color or finish of paint in direct light, so be sure to apply the second coat within the week. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Leave latex paint for about 4 weeks to fully cure after applying it. Curing is when the paint completely hardens so it’s even more protected from damage or regular wear and tear. Avoid scrubbing any painted surfaces and be careful not to scuff up the paint while it’s still hardening. After about 4 weeks, your paint will have fully bonded and is less likely to get damaged.

      "content": "Let oil-based paint cure for 7 days. Even though oil paint has a longer time in between coats, it actually cures a bit faster than latex paint. Just be careful not to brush up against or scrub at the paint until it’s gone through its full cure time. [18] X Research source Always double-check the cure time on the paint packaging since it may recommend a longer time."
