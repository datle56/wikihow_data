A durable power of attorney allows you to act on behalf of another person for all day-to-day financial decision making. This is the most flexible and permissive form of a power of attorney. A durable power of attorney survives even if the principal becomes incapacitated. In California, in order to create a durable power of attorney, you must include the following language: \"This Power of Attorney shall not be affected by subsequent incapacity of the principal\"; or \"This Power of Attorney shall become effective upon the incapacity of the principal\"; or Any other language that shows you want the power of attorney to remain in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated. A durable power of attorney can become effective whenever the principal so chooses. You can make it go into effect immediately or you can choose a time to make the power of attorney effective. A durable power of attorney terminates upon the death of the principal, or when the principal cancels it. Under California law, unless a durable power of attorney is explicitly revoked or has specific termination language, it remains valid until the death of the principal."

The subjects included in the form are: real property transactions; tangible personal property transactions; stock and bond transactions; commodity and option transactions; banking and other financial institution transactions; business operating transactions; insurance and annuity transactions; estate, trust, and other beneficiary transactions; claims and litigation; personal and family maintenance; benefits from social security, medicare, medicaid, or other governmental programs, or civil or military service; retirement plan transactions; and tax matters. In the health care form, the agent will be authorized to make all health care decisions unless exceptions are explicitly provided. With the different types of powers of attorney in mind, you need to determine exactly what needs to be accomplished. Durable powers of attorney are often appropriate for long-term care of someone experiencing serious medical issues who is in danger of becoming incapacitated. Durable powers of attorney are also often granted to trust administrators and conservators so the trustee can manage the estate without having to seek signatures on every document. For most other situations, a general or limited power of attorney will suffice. Even if the power of attorney will be valid for a long period, such as a period of incarceration or until a child turns 18, you should only take or delegate as much authority as necessary."
