While this isn’t true for all friendships between men and women, media like When Harry Met Sally and other rom-coms of its nature have helped solidify the myth that male-female friendships can’t ever be purely platonic. However, the opposite is often true. Many people in platonic friendships with the opposite sex report that their friend feels like a sibling, and that they would never even consider sleeping with them. [3] X Research source If you’re worried that your friend might get the wrong idea, have a conversation with them. Make sure you’re both on the same page and that neither of you wants to pursue a romantic relationship, either now or in the future. Say something like, “I just want to make it clear that we’re just friends, okay? I don’t want to make my partner uncomfortable, so I’d like this to be a completely platonic relationship.”"

In 2012, researchers released a study that did a deep dive into the platonic nature of friendships between men and women. The scientists found that while it was possible to have male-female friendships, men were slightly more likely to be attracted to their female friends than women are attracted to their male friends. [4] X Research source The same study also reported that men were less likely to respect the relationship status of their female friends (meaning they’d still consider sleeping with their female friends even if those friends are in a relationship)."

You might establish rules like: [5] X Research source Never prioritize your friendships over your partner. Never hide any activity or communication with your friends from your partner. Never flirt with your friend, even when your partner isn’t around. Never call your partner “jealous” or “crazy” for expressing their concerns."

If you notice that you’re treating your opposite-sex friend differently in any way, it’s likely that you’re crossing a boundary that your partner wouldn’t be comfortable with. Keep this in mind as you interact with your friend to avoid any jealousy issues. [6] X Research source Grab a beer, get a cup of coffee together, or watch a movie. Do normal friend things without flirting or complimenting your friend about their physical appearance. If you’re not sure, try asking yourself, “Would my partner be upset if they saw this message or behavior right now?” If the answer is yes, you are crossing a boundary."
