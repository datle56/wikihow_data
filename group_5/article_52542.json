The basa will absorb the flavors of the salt, pepper, and lemon juice as it marinates. [2] X Research source Since the fish is marinating briefly, it’s safe to leave it at room temperature."

You can also insert an instant-read thermometer into the center to see if the fish has reached 145 °F (63 °C). Fish (and most other seafood) is safe to eat once the internal temperature of the thickest part of the fillet reaches 145 °F (63 °C).

If you drag the tines of a fork through the flesh, it should flake easily. [10] X Research source Let the oil heat back up before you add the remaining basa fillets.

[12] X Research source Choosing fillets that are about the same size, weight, and thickness ensures they’ll all finish cooking at the same time.

Finish prepping your basa by placing a fresh herb sprig of your choice on top of the lemon. [13] X Research source Use your favorite fresh herbs, such as parsley, rosemary, dill, or oregano.
