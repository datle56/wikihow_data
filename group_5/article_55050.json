Cover your hands with oil and rub it into your skin to start loosening the paint. Any natural oil will be effective. You could use coconut, avocado, or even soybean oil to help loosen the paint."

      "content": "Scrub off stubborn bits of paint after you wash your hands. Smaller areas, such as around your fingertips, under your fingernails, and in the creases of your hands, can be especially difficult to get paint off of. Take a clean toothbrush and scrub the paint off manually once you’ve washed it off from the rest of your hands. Soaking the toothbrush in warm water can make the bristles a little softer and gentler. You can also use a toothbrush to scrub any stubborn spots of paint off of your hands."
