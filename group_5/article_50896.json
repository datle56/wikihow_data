      "content": "Take advantage of social groups. You don't have to start by striking out on your own and spending time with a girl 1 on 1. You can meet and spend time with girls in groups of mutual friends. Make a decision to interact individually with girls when given the opportunity in this situation. You automatically have the safety net of a group for both parties to hang out with if things get awkward or you start to become nervous. You can also use a social group as a low pressure opportunity to invite a girl to spend time with you when she perhaps she wouldn't have otherwise. Example: \"Hey Becky, my friends and I were going to see the new movie. Have you seen it yet? We thought you might like to come.\""

Use these observations to strike up conversations with girls. More often then not, they'll be happy to talk about the subject, giving you a low stress opportunity to listen and have them drive the majority of the conversation. For example: Compliment a girl on her new hairstyle and ask why she decided to change it. See that a girl is wearing school or community sports apparel, mention that you like the sport, and ask how long she has been playing. Notice a girl's tan and ask if she has been to the beach recently. Observe palm calluses or scraped shins and ask when she got into weightlifting."

[10] X Research source Your words might sound comfortable and engaging, but if your body language is off, they'll be as nervous as you are and the interaction will be awkward. A smile works wonders!

You'll appear more engaging, plus the physical movement is an outlet for stress, relaxing and soothing you.

By having your attention focused on a particular task or activity, nervousness is less likely to creep in. It is a much more low pressure way of building comfort and getting to know one another than an extended 1-on-1 conversation or date. Find activities that involve common interests or responsibilities. Walk your dogs or do your homework together. Suggest new adventures that you both might be interested in. If you both do something new, you'll be more nervous about and focused on the new activity, rather than your nervousness about being around a girl. [16] X Research source"
