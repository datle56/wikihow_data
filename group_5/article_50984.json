      "content": "Keep things light with a fun and silly birthday wish. A joke or funny message is a great way to focus on the positives. Even though your card or message may be coming late, it’s a nice surprise for the other person (though they're best saved for people you know well, like a friend, partner, or loved one). Here are ideas to get you started: \"The bad news is that I forgot it was your birthday. But the good news is that I also forgot your age. Happy belated birthday!\" \"Wishing you a happy birthday on your actual birthday is so last year. I’m just starting a new trend by being fashionably late. Sending you all the best on your (belated) birthday!\" \"I didn’t forget your birthday. I just wanted to make sure you saved some of your birthday wishes for other days. You’re welcome! 😘\" \"Don’t think of this as a belated birthday card. Instead, think of it as me being the very first one to wish you a happy birthday for next year! Happy birthday!\" \"This birthday card isn’t late. I think it’s old age making you a bit confused!\" \"Happy belated birthday. Consider yourself off the hook if you happen to forget my birthday next year 😉\" \"You know what they say—birthday wishes are like a fine wine. They get better the longer they age 🍷\" \"Did you think I forgot your special day? I would never do that to you! This card is coming late because my dog ate the first one. Happy belated birthday!\""

      "title": "A touching message is a great way to remind the recipient that you care.",
      "content": "A touching message is a great way to remind the recipient that you care. Apologizing and acknowledging your lateness can your message sound more sincere and honest. However, avoid writing out a long explanation for why your message is coming in late. Usually just a short “I’m sorry” will do. Try one of these messages: \"These birthday wishes may be late, but that doesn’t mean I love you any less. You’re such an amazing and kind person. You’ve truly blessed my life and changed it for the better, and I can’t imagine a single day without you by my side. I love you, and happy belated birthday.\" [2] X Research source \"Happy belated birthday! Even though I’m late, I would never miss the opportunity to express how grateful I am to know such an amazing person like you. I’m sorry these words couldn’t reach you on your actual birthday but know that I was thinking of you and sending you lots of love.\" \"You deserve all of the happiness and good things in the world, regardless of whether it’s your birthday or not. Even though it’s not your birthday today, don’t let that hold you back from having a lovely day filled with smiles and laughter. Happy belated birthday! ❤️❤️\" \"Thank you for being so understanding even though I couldn’t wish you a happy birthday on your special day. I couldn’t ask for a more beautiful and amazing friend. Here’s to another year of wishes coming true and happiness and laughter every single day.\" \"I may have forgotten your birthday, but I could never forget someone as spectacular as you. You light up my life and make every day an adventure. I’ll always be thankful that you came into my life.\" \"I’m so sorry that I missed your birthday. But that doesn’t mean I love you any less. If anything, this gave me even more time to think about just how much you mean to me and how wonderful my life has become ever since you came into it. Happy belated birthday to a truly amazing person!\" \"You deserve the biggest celebration for all the joy and happiness you bring into everyone’s lives. Sorry I wasn’t there to celebrate with you on your special day, but having a friend like you makes every single day special for me. Happy belated birthday!\" \"Even though it’s technically not your birthday anymore, I want to thank you for all of the wonderful, funny, and sweet memories we’ve made together. You’re truly one of a kind, and I’m so blessed to have you by my side. Happy belated birthday!\""

      "content": "Text, call, send a card, or tell them in person. There are countless ways you can send a belated birthday message. Depending on your relationship with the other person, pick the method that fits your relationship best. For example, you might want to call a close family member to wish them a happy belated birthday. On the other hand, giving a card to a co-worker you don’t know as well is totally acceptable.

      "title": "Be sincere and apologetic.",
      "content": "Be sincere and apologetic. If you think someone’s feelings might be hurt because you’re late in wishing them a happy birthday, make sure your true feelings shine through and that you include some sort of apology for the tardiness. Depending on your relationship with the other person, you can make this a bit funny or stick to a heartfelt message. For example: “Sorry this card is getting to you so late. But, hey, now you don’t have to wait another whole year to receive more birthday wishes.” “I’m so sorry I wasn’t able to wish you a happy birthday on your actual birthday. I hope you have a wonderful day and can forgive me for my lateness!” While it’s good to include an apology, don’t feel like you need to include a long explanation about why your birthday wishes are coming in late. Chances are the other person will understand that things happen, and sometimes we forget even the most important dates."

      "title": "Include a gift to make up for the late wishes.",
      "content": "Include a gift to make up for the late wishes. If you’re feeling a bit bad about being late, it never hurts to get a gift that you know the other person will appreciate. Think about what kinds of things the other person is interested in and buy them a gift that you think they’ll find useful. Or, gift them an experience if they’re more into that, like a trip to a city they’ve never been to. Whether you buy a gift or not completely depends on your relationship with the other person. For example, you might want to get your best friend a really nice gift to accompany your belated birthday message. On the other hand, it’s okay to just get a card for a co-worker you don’t know that well."
