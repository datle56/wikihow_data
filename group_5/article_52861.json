      "content": "Be clear about how you want to use the crystals’ energy. You can ask for any outcome, but you can’t use a crystal grid to wish harm on someone or stop an inevitable event, like death or birth. People often use crystal grids to wish for healing, luck, love, or abundance. The more specific your intention , the more likely that the metaphysical world will respond. [1] X Research source For example, instead of saying, “I want abundance,” try to be specific and say “I want an abundance of consistent profit in my business this month.” Some people choose to write down their intention on a piece of paper. This is optional. Your intentions will work just as well as if you concentrate on and think about them clearly."

      "content": "Ideally, crystal grids are placed somewhere significant to you. But if you don’t have a significant spot, any small area that you will look at often works too. Choose a solid surface, like a dresser, desk, table, or even the ground. If your intention is connected to a certain space, like your office for productivity, plan to make your crystal grid there. If your intention involves tranquility and rejuvenation, the living room is a great place for your crystal grid. [2] X Research source Your crystal grid doesn’t need much space. It will look like a small circle or square only a foot or two in diameter."

      "title": "You need an even number of crystals that give you positive energy.",
      "content": "You need an even number of crystals that give you positive energy. Start with 4-10 crystals for a small grid, or use up to 40 to make a more complex design. Use an even number of crystals to maintain symmetry. Depending on your intention, certain stones are more powerful for some purposes. Pick crystals with qualities that align with your intentions or resonate with your spirit. If your intentions involve love, you can include rose quartz. To manifest health, use jade or moonstone. Green aventurine is good for inspiring creativity and success, and hematoid will help bring you peace when you’re anxious. [3] X Research source Beyond crystals, you can also include other elements of nature, like flowers, leaves, or pieces of tree bark."

      "title": "You don’t want to use crystals with previous intentions.",
      "content": "You don’t want to use crystals with previous intentions. Otherwise, you might obstruct the energy of your current intention. To cleanse crystals quickly, wash them with salt water. If you have a little more time, leave crystals in direct moonlight and sunlight for 24 hours to cleanse them. Earth crystals are best cleansed if you leave them buried in dirt for 24 hours.

      "title": "The center stone is usually the largest crystal in your grid.",
      "content": "The center stone is usually the largest crystal in your grid. Also sometimes called the focus stone or master stone, the center of your crystal grid is what holds the energy of the surrounding stones together. Imagine it as the spoke of your crystal grid wheel! You can use any type of crystal, but ideally, the center stone’s character relates to the overall intention of your grid. [5] X Research source If you chose to write your intention down on paper, place the paper beneath your center stone."

      "title": "Follow a pattern or be creative and make your own design.",
      "content": "Follow a pattern or be creative and make your own design. If you use a crystal grid cloth to follow a pattern, lay the cloth down first and then assemble crystals on top, starting with the center stone and then placing smaller stones where the lines of the pattern intersect. You can also design your own grid by following what feels right to you. A typical crystal grid has 2-3 layers of crystals surrounding the center stone. [6] X Research source Crystal grids get their power from sacred geometry, so arrange your crystals in a balanced, symmetrical pattern. Your crystals can face any direction you like. A popular crystal grid pattern is called The Seed of Life, which has been used by many religions as a symbol of protection. It consists of seven circles which intersect and overlap to look like a single flower. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "You’ll need to “turn on” the powers of your grid.",
      "content": "You’ll need to “turn on” the powers of your grid. Use a quartz point for best results, although pointing with your finger works as well. Raise your point and imagine that energy is shooting out through the tip like a beam of light. While thinking about your intention or speaking it out loud, imagine you’re drawing a line with the beam of light to connect each and every crystal to the other. Repeat the same tracing pattern 3 times or until it feels right to you. Once you’re done, tell your grid, “You are activated.”"

      "content": "Your intentions should gradually begin to show up in your life. Sometimes this takes a while, as crystal grids might not work until a few weeks or months after they were activated. Be patient with them. If your crystal grid still doesn’t work, make sure to cleanse the space around the grid. Move clutter away from your grid, especially electromagnetics objects like TVs or computers. Always assist the process by continuing to focus on your intention daily. Reduce any negative thought patterns that relate to your intention. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Crystal grids are meant to be temporary. They usually only last for 2-3 months. Once your grid has channeled sacred energy into your life, it’s time for your crystals to take on their next purpose. Say “thank you” to your crystals and then remove one crystal at a time from the grid. Cleanse your crystals for their next intention. [9] X Research source To cleanse your crystal grid’s former space, you can burn sage or incense where the crystal grid once was."
