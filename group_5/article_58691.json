In other words, the use of your music can’t be “fair use.” You need to decide whether the use of your music is “fair use” before sending a takedown notice. [16] X Research source Fair use is a vague concept which essentially means that some people can copy certain portions of your music in some situations. The court will look at multiple factors, such as how much of your music was sampled and whether the person sampling it “transformed” the sample. The court will also consider why the person sampled your music—for example, for educational purposes or to make money—and whether the sampling had a negative effect on your ability to make money from the song. [17] X Research source Generally, you will be justified in sending a takedown notice in most situations. For example, if someone uses an entire song or a large portion of the song, then you are justified in sending a takedown notice. However, in some situations, the use might be fair use. For example, someone who samples a few seconds of a song to use in a non-profit, educational video, might actually have a fair use defense. If you are unsure whether the sampling is fair use, contact an attorney for advice."
