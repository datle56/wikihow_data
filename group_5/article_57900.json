      "content": "Narcissistic discard refers to someone who abruptly cuts ties without explanation. This behavior is part of the narcissistic relationship cycle. At first, someone with narcissistic tendencies may idealize or love-bomb you to win you over. Then, after some time, they could decide that they’re no longer getting what they need from the relationship, so they might “discard” you and move on to the next person. [1] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Keep in mind that narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) requires a diagnosis by a medical professional. It’s important not to assume that someone has NPD. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Narcissism also exists on a spectrum, so it’s possible to have some narcissistic traits without qualifying for a formal NPD diagnosis. [3] X Research source If you’ve been “discarded” by a friend or partner who has NPD or narcissistic tendencies, it can be very distressing. Remember, you didn’t do anything wrong, and it’s not a reflection on you!"

      "content": "Discard is one of the three stages of narcissistic relationships. Many narcissistic relationships occur in 3 stages: idealization, devaluation, then discard. (It’s important to note, however, that this is certainly not true of all relationships involving someone with NPD.) Here are the three stages fleshed out in more detail: Idealization : At the start of a relationship, someone with NPD or narcissistic tendencies may shower you with compliments, gifts, and declarations of love. They may be very charming, saying all the right things and putting you up on a pedestal. Devaluation : As time goes on, tensions can start to build. They might become less loving or admiring of you, and they may even start to unfairly criticize or belittle you. Discard : Finally, they may decide that they are no longer satisfied with the relationship, so they suddenly cut ties, leaving you distressed and confused.

      "content": "They feel like they aren’t receiving enough praise or attention from you. As Los Angeles-based psychotherapist Kelli Miller explains, “Narcissists seek admiration all the time.” If your friend or partner feels like they are no longer receiving enough of this \"narcissistic supply,\" they may start “seeking out other partners to get that validation and admiration.” For example, if you become disillusioned by their behavior and start to praise them less, they may start to feel dissatisfied with your relationship. Instead of being honest about their feelings or trying to work things out, they may abruptly cut ties and look for a new friend or romantic partner to start over with. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "They feel like they’re losing control of you. Some people with narcissistic tendencies feel the need to control others. This sense of power can boost their self-esteem, which may be fragile. If they start to feel like they’re losing this power over you, it could push them to cut ties and look for a new person, who might be more susceptible to controlling behaviors. [6] X Research source Say, for example, that you used to go along with this person’s opinions or acquiesce to their requests because you trusted and admired them. Then, over time, you started to see their true colors, so you challenged them a bit more, or pushed back when they made unfair demands of you. They may see these changes as proof that they’re losing their grip on you. As a result, they could decide to cut their losses and end things."

People with narcissistic traits often portray themselves as overly self-confident, but underneath this showy exterior, they tend to have very fragile egos. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As clinical psychologist Dr. Asa Don Brown explains, “the narcissist is commonly hypersensitive to criticism or disparaging comments.” When faced with the truth about their own behavior, they may even experience a complete collapse of their sense of self . If you happen to see someone with narcissistic tendencies in a vulnerable moment, they may be unable to accept their flaws.

      "content": "It’s a power play. If someone with narcissistic tendencies starts to feel like they're losing power over you, they may “discard” you to reassert control. The shocking and unexpected ending leaves you reeling, which makes you more likely to have an emotional reaction and beg them to stay. This puts them firmly back in the position of power. [12] X Research source It’s important to remember that the cycle of narcissistic relationships is just that—a cycle. When someone with NPD or narcissistic tendencies discards you, they might not truly intend to leave. They may just be trying to re-start the cycle over again."

      "content": "They start “devaluing” you. One sign that discard is coming is a shift toward devaluing you, rather than putting you on a pedestal like they did at the beginning of the relationship. “Once the bond has been established, a gradual and subtle campaign of criticism and derision can occur,” says Jay Reid, a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor who specializes in helping clients who have survived a narcissistic parent or partner. This indicates that you have moved from the first stage of a narcissistic relationship (idealization) to the second stage (devaluation), which comes just before the third and final stage (discard). [13] X Research source Tell-tale behaviors to look out for include mocking or belittling you, questioning your intelligence, dismissing your opinion, or humiliating you in front of others. Remember, this complete 180 has nothing to do with who you truly are. Some people with NPD or narcissistic traits think in a black-and-white way—you’re either the best person in the world, or a completely inferior person who isn’t worth their time.

As Kelli Miller explains, “There’s this idea that they’re allowed to cheat because they have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. In their mind, the rules just do not apply to them.” If your partner is starting to engage in emotional or physical infidelity, it could be another sign that they’re looking for a new source of narcissistic supply."

As the relationship continues to shift from idealization to devaluation, they may start to be colder and harsher toward you. [16] X Research source Over time, this behavior can even escalate to gaslighting, manipulation, or emotional abuse. [17] X Research source If your friend or partner is starting to treat you more and more poorly, it could be a sign that the discard phase is imminent. It's important to note, however, that although some people with NPD may display emotionally abusive behavior, this is absolutely not true of all people with NPD. NPD itself is not a character flaw or something to be ashamed of—it’s simply a mental health condition. [18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Many people with NPD are receiving treatment to manage their symptoms and working to build healthy relationships in their lives. They deserve patience, understanding, and acceptance, just like everyone else! Of course, if someone with NPD or narcissistic behavior is treating you poorly or emotionally abusing you, there is no excuse for that behavior, and the most important thing is to protect yourself and ensure your safety."

After a period of time, “They may re-instantiate that same cycle again, with something called hoovering,” Jay Reid explains. “They try to suck the partner back in by doing a little more idealization. It’s the bait that gets put on the hook, and the cycle recommences.” Because narcissistic discard can do a number on your self-esteem, you may feel vulnerable and tempted to let them back in. Remember, fully closing the door is a necessary step if you truly want to heal and move on .
