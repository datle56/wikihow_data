      "title": "Thread each end of the lace down through the bottom eyelets.",
      "content": "Thread each end of the lace down through the bottom eyelets. Hold the lace at the end, or the “aglet.” Thread one end down (away from you) through one of the bottom holes, or “eyelets.” Pull the lace until it’s about halfway through. Then, thread the other end down through the matching eyelet on the other side. [1] X Research source Once the ends are through, tug on both ends of the laces, adjusting them until both sides of the lace are the same length. This style of lacing gives your shoes a more traditional look and a loose, casual fit."

      "title": "Cross the right lace down through the next eyelet on the left.",
      "content": "Cross the right lace down through the next eyelet on the left. With the toe of the shoe facing you, grab the lace on the right-hand side. Bring it to the left-hand row of eyelets and thread it down through the eyelet that’s second to the bottom. [2] X Research source If you like, you might also choose to thread the aglets up toward you while you lace. It won’t make a huge difference in the fit, but it will slightly change the look."

      "title": "Cross the left-hand lace over and down through the right eyelet.",
      "content": "Cross the left-hand lace over and down through the right eyelet. Now, cross the lace that’s on the bottom left side over the lace you just threaded toward the right-hand side of the shoe. Thread it down through the right-hand eyelet that’s second from the bottom. [3] X Research source Or, bring this lace under the right-hand lace, if you like. Again, it’s just a small visual difference. If you do, though, make sure to follow this pattern all the way up the shoe."

      "title": "Continue lacing up the shoe to the top eyelets.",
      "content": "Continue lacing up the shoe to the top eyelets. Work your way up the shoe this way. Take the lace on the right-hand side and thread it down through the next available eyelet on the opposite side of the shoe. Then, take the lace on the left-hand side and bring it over the lace you just crossed, then thread it down into the next available eyelet on the other side. [4] X Research source This makes a criss-cross pattern all the way up the shoe. Near the midpoint, thread the laces through the loop in the center of the tongue, if your Sambas have this. Make sure the laces follow this pattern the whole way! The lace going up and to the right will always cross over the lace going up and to the left."

Hold the lace at one end, known as the “aglet.” Thread that end down (away from you) through one of the bottom holes, or “eyelets.” Pull the lace until it’s about halfway through. Then, thread the other end down through the matching eyelet on the other side. [5] X Research source Once the ends are through, tug on both ends of the laces, adjusting them until both sides of the lace are the same length. This method makes for an even looser, but less secure, fit. It’s also known as straight lacing . This style works best for shoes with an even number of eyelets on each side. Many Sambas have an odd number of eyelets, so just stop lacing before the top eyelet."
