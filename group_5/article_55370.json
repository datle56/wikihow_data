Look at your basil plant and select a stem that’s at least {convert|3-4|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and doesn’t have any seed pods or flowers growing from it. Once you find a suitable stem, check to make sure it isn’t starting to grow a seed stalk at the crown as well. [1] X Research source"

Make sure the stem is still 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) long after you cut it.

If it is, it’s safe to transplant the young basil to an outdoor garden if desired. However, it’s totally fine to leave the basil in the pot indoors as long as you want! [12] X Research source You can pick leaves off the basil whenever you want to use some fresh basil in the kitchen. In fact, regularly picking off some leaves encourages healthy new growth! Just be sure to pick leaves from the top of the plant—that will help the plant grow bushier, rather than long and lanky.
