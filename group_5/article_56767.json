      "content": "Lycanthropy is a curse that can affect humanoid player characters. A character inherits the curse of lycanthropy from their parents or becomes stricken with it after being bitten by a werewolf (or other werebeast) during gameplay. The character changes into a hybrid shapeshifter, temporarily loses control during their transformation, and must battle their ongoing bestial urges as long as the curse is active. [1] X Research source A lycanthrope has three forms: a humanoid state, a hybrid state (when they have both humanoid and animal traits), and a pure animal form (fully transformed). The character retains their traits when in humanoid form. When they shift into their animal form, they gain powerful new traits, including speed, damage immunities, and non-equipment actions, depending on the type of werebeast that infected them. The Monster Manual doesn't include a lot of detail about lycanthropy other than what's stated above. Major decisions are in the hands of the DM."

      "content": "The DM has complete control over how the curse presents itself. If you're fully incorporating lycanthropy into a campaign, the DM engineers all of the rules. This includes the transformation process, presentation of symptoms, and whether there's a cure or not. To maintain control and create balance, the DM will need to come up with a solid plan and system for gameplay before the player character is cursed so that everyone is on the same page. If the DM doesn't want to incorporate lycanthropy into more complex gameplay , follow these rules: lycanthropy caused by injury can be dispelled by Remove Curse . A lycanthrope who genetically inherits the condition can only be cured via Wish . See our \"Advice for DMs Running Lycanthropy\" section for helpful suggestions that will keep the campaign fair and fun for everyone."

      "content": "Lycanthropy causes issues because it makes characters too strong. Lycanthropy is supposed to be a curse, but the “affliction” mostly just provides massive benefits that give the cursed character an unfair advantage. This kind of power imbalance can sour the whole campaign, especially for the rest of the group. The Monster Manual includes little detail about playing lycanthrope characters, so it’s up to the DM to enforce restrictions and rules that make gameplay fun, balanced, and fair for everyone."

Being born with the curse of lycanthropy is a totally different vibe than being infected with it through a traumatic injury. Some were-creatures may even give the “curse” of lycanthropy to a player character as a gift. Keep the circumstances in mind as your character reacts to the curse and copes with their new compulsions. [9] X Research source Remember: Werebeasts as villains is mostly a fantasy trope.

In this scenario, seeking a cure becomes a plot point for the story. The character could opt to make the curse permanent, however, and never seek out a cure. In this scenario, the DM needs to carefully control over how this plays out so the player isn’t overpowered. [11] X Research source If you decide to go permanent, really flesh out your character’s different personalities and tendencies when in all three forms: humanoid, hybrid, and wereform."

Since the DM has total control over rules and gameplay, you can use whatever strategies you see fit to create more balance. [12] X Research source For example, one drawback could be that a lycanthrope must go berserk and lose control when in hybrid or animal form or if they fail on a saving throw under certain circumstances. Or, you could create a task that must be done whenever the moon is high in the night sky, or require that the other characters chain them up when there’s a full moon so they won’t hurt or infect anyone. Pick drawbacks that are fair but still fun for everyone in the campaign. Your goal is to make sure that the curse comes with a cost."

Choose benefits that feel balanced with the drawbacks you decide on. The damage immunity to physical attacks is the main culprit, so you could cut that benefit entirely or substantially reduce it. [13] X Research source For example, you could reduce damage immunity to specific circumstances, like the lycanthrope has resistance against non-magical weapons only."

Leave the player character in the dark about whether they were infected or not after being bitten or scratched by a werebeast. Allow some time to pass before symptoms start appearing. If you wait several sessions before revealing the affliction, it’ll be a fun surprise that really plays up the horror and mystery of lycanthropy. [14] X Research source Allow the symptoms to ebb and flow with the moon and give the player a chance to explore this new aspect of their character before their first transformation."

      "content": "Come up with a plan or system that outlines how the curse works. This will help you control how gameplay progresses and give the afflicted character a chance to use the curse as a springboard for important character development (rather than just a free boost of benefits during combat). Here are a few systems you could consider for your campaign: A monthly cycle: create 3 stages of the transformation that the character must go through. In stage 1, nothing much will change for the character aside from some mental changes. In stage 2 (about 10 days before the full moon), symptoms start to increase dramatically. The character starts gaining lycanthropic resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities. Stage 3 is the full moon and transformation into their beast form. This stage lasts until the moon begins to wane, and then the cycle begins again starting with stage 1. A challenging cure: after the player goes through the initial transformation, they will begin a side quest to seek out a cure for their affliction. This cure quest should be more challenging than just casting a spell. During this quest, they will have to struggle to control their new urges and if they slip up and kill in their transformed state, the curse becomes permanent. If the curse becomes permanent, make lycanthropy a class that the player can choose to multi-class into. [15] X Research source"

Her advice: \"If you want to give lycanthropy more stakes in your campaign, try making it a little harder to cure—or impose consequences on lycanthrope PCs to counterbalance all the perks they get from it. Maybe they shapeshift and have episodes where they aren't in control, or maybe the cure for lycanthropy now requires rare herbs or spell components, like the blood of a hard-to-kill monster or even another lycanthrope. Don't be afraid to get creative and experiment a little.\""
