Dietitians call foods with a lot of calories per bite \"calorie-dense.\" These foods will allow you to take in more calories without feeling too stuffed. To stay healthy, focus on calorie-dense foods that also provide a lot of nutritional value.

      "content": "Drink your calories. Eating isn't the only way to increase your calorie intake. If you are having trouble maintaining your weight — that is, losing weight despite drinking enough water and getting plenty of calories in solid form — consider high-calorie beverages. Remember, just having high caloric content isn't the only goal; try to drink calorie-dense beverages that also offer high nutrient content. . Replace water in your diet with high-calorie fruit juices like apple, grape, or orange juice. Each of them are great options that won't leave you feeling too full. Smoothies are great ways to drink a large number of calories in a healthy fashion. If you can make your own, add protein powder, dense fruits, cream-based liquids and yogurt. Smoothies will move through the stomach quickly and allow you to fuel up prior to exercise. Try to limit your beverage intake during meals to leave more room for calorie-dense foods, but ensure you maintain healthy hydration levels."

      "content": "Plan your diet to match your goals. It's important to know what your goals are before you begin transitioning to a 9,000 calorie per day diet. Different types of athletes require different types of nutrients to maximize their performance. If you are training to be an endurance athlete, you should incorporate between 0.5 and 0.7 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.4 g/kg of bodyweight) each day to help your body rebuild the muscle you break down through training. If you are doing heavy weight training, your protein intake should be more like 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.7 g/kg of bodyweight) every day. This will provide your body with the amino acids it needs to not only restore your damaged muscle, but help your body build new muscle through training. [3] X Research source Don't increase your protein intake at the cost of other important elements of your diet. Developing and maintaining healthy muscle also requires that you take in carbohydrates and healthy fats each day. Ignoring them for the sake of protein can cause your body to use that protein for energy instead of muscle development and retention. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source It is possible to eat too much protein and some clinicians believe it may cause irreversible damage to your kidneys. The Institute of Medicine recommends that you do not consume greater than 35% of total calories in protein. Additionally, increased dietary protein can result in elevated urinary calcium, which may contribute to bone loss and the subsequent development of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

It may seem like the easiest way to increase your calorie intake is to pile on the ice cream and greasy pizza, but eating unhealthy foods in large quantities can lead to other health problems. Calories aren't the only things that matter. Nutritional value in your foods is just as important. Make sure your diet provides the nutrients you need to be healthy. [6] X Research source Junk food and greasy treats can raise your cholesterol and blood pressure. Too much saturated fat can even lead to cardiovascular problems that include heart attack and strokes. Recent studies also suggest saturated fats can affect insulin production in your body and lead to other health problems like diabetes."

      "content": "Eat a good breakfast. In order to get all the calories and nutrients you'll need in a 9,000 calorie a day diet, you've got to start early. Plan for seven or eight meals a day, starting right when you get up. Use lots of eggs — they're a healthy source of calories and a huge boost to your protein intake. Add a steak to bolster your protein and fats. Include oatmeal or another good source of fiber like granola. Couple your breakfast with whole milk to add calories and fat."

If you feel up to another meal-sized helping, go for it, but if you're still feeling pretty full from breakfast, try calorie- and nutrient-rich nuts. Five ounces of walnuts alone can account for nearly 1,000 calories of your daily diet. One serving of oil roasted pecans has nearly 800 calories.

[9] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source When choosing foods, remember that your body can only absorb a certain amount of nutrients at once. While three to four chicken breasts might provide up to 1,000 calories, you will only be able to absorb 20 to 30 g of protein, or about the amount of protein in one chicken breast. Don't let focusing only on calories cause you to lose sight of the bigger picture — this amount of chicken is simply too much protein to eat at once."

Couple your main course with a calorie-dense carbohydrate like beans, potatoes, or biscuits.

      "content": "Eat more, and more often. The first step toward eating 9,000 calories a day is eating more often than most people do and finding ways to increase the amount of healthy food you can take in per meal. Don't let more than four hours go by without eating a meal (unless you are sleeping). Eating often will provide you with an opportunity to increase your caloric intake. Drink healthy beverages that have a high caloric content between and with your meals. Fruit juices like apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, and grape juice are high in calories and nutrients. Buy bigger plates so meals seem smaller. Silly as it may seem, bigger plates can make it easier to add more food to your plate (and your diet) without it seeming like too much."

Sleep is when your body does most of its healing and repairing of bodily tissues, so eating right before bed will ensure your body has fresh nutrients available to maximize tissue production. Your metabolism doesn't actually slow down while you're sleeping, but your body is much less active. A meal before you go to sleep will ensure you use as many calories as you can out of your late night snacks for recovery and regeneration. [12] X Research source"

Adopting a 9,000 calorie daily diet means you're burning at least that many through your metabolism and training, so don't waste some of them on just keeping warm. When you're cold, your body burns calories to create body heat. Avoid the caloric cost keeping you warm by staying that way to begin with. Stay warm to inhibit the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones aid in uncoupling proteins to create body heat and are also known as one of the stronger metabolism regulating hormones.
