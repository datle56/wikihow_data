      "title": "Bad Battery",
      "content": "Bad Battery If your car isn’t making any noise when you turn the key and there’s no power anywhere, your vehicle’s battery is almost positively to blame. Either you accidentally left a light on the last time you turned the car off and the battery died, or your battery is completely done and it needs to be replaced with a new one . [1] X Research source Here’s how to fix the problem. How to check: If you want to test the battery before bothering to jump it, our expert, mechanic Jason Shackleford, says to remove it and take it to the mechanic. He notes, “Most auto parts stores and some repair shops will usually test your battery at no charge.” If you don’t want to test the battery, jump it using a working vehicle and jumper cables. The battery will be able to make a short trip even if it’s dead. How to fix it: If the battery dies again within the next day or two of driving, the battery is done. Change the battery or visit the mechanic and ask them to do it for you. Car batteries need to be replaced every 4-5 years, so it’s likely just time for a new battery if yours was on the older side."

      "title": "Bad Starter Solenoid",
      "content": "Bad Starter Solenoid The starter solenoid is an electromagnet that sits in between the ignition and the motor. They basically help transfer electrical current to the motor. Jason Shackleford, an expert with over two decades repairing cars says, “When turning the key to crank the engine a bad solenoid may just make a click sound. Other times, it can prevent the vehicle from having any power at all.” How to check: Try starting the car 5-10 times. If you’re lucky, the solenoid may send enough juice to start the engine. If you do get the car started, drive it to the mechanic. You can’t repair the solenoid at home, so go see a pro. How to fix it: You can’t wire a new solenoid yourself. If you can’t get the vehicle to start, contact a tow truck to get your car hauled to the mechanic."

      "title": "Bad Ignition Switch",
      "content": "Bad Ignition Switch The ignition switch generates the voltage that gets sent to the solenoid. Without that voltage, there won’t be any juice to start the motor. Our expert, Jason Shackleford, says, “There are several signs of a bad ignition switch. The key won’t turn in the ignition and the vehicle won’t try to turn over when engaging the key to the crank position.” How to check: There aren’t any good tests for the ignition switch, but if you can’t turn the key, the switch is almost positively the issue. How to fix it: If the key isn’t turning and nothing happens when you crank the engine, get the car towed to a mechanic to have them replace the switch and rewire the ignition."

      "title": "Parasitic Drain",
      "content": "Parasitic Drain A parasitic drain refers to something in your vehicle that’s drawing power when the car is turned off. This is a problem because it will cause your battery to die over and over again regardless of how often you replace it or jump it. [2] X Research source Finding a parasitic drain can be difficult, so see a mechanic if you’re in a rush to get this issue repaired. How to check: If you do want to find the drain yourself, use a multimeter to test the fuses in the fuse box, the individual cables in the engine bay, and the dash light connections. How to fix it: Either repair the underlying issue yourself or see a mechanic to have the issue repaired."

      "title": "Brake Light Switch",
      "content": "Brake Light Switch The brake light switch is a small button under the brake pedal that turns on the brake lights. If that switch is stuck or has gone bad, then the light may brake lights may stay on after you shut the car off. This will cause the battery to continue to die over and over again. [3] X Research source This is a more common issue with push-to-start vehicles. How to check: Check your brake lights after you turn the car off. If the brake lights are on, your switch is bad. See a mechanic to have that switch replaced. How to fix it: See a mechanic to have the brake light repaired."
