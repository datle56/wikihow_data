      "content": "An Elf Bar takes an average of 2 hours to charge fully. There are a lot of factors that go into determining just how long your specific vape will take to charge, including the type of battery, how much charge is left in the battery, and what kind of power source you’re using. The battery capacity of each Elf Bar device is measured in milliamp-hours (mAh). The higher the mAh value, the more charge a device can hold. This also means that vapes with higher mAh values will take longer to charge. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Plug the charger cable into the port on the bottom of the device. Most Elf Bar devices use a USB to Type C cable to charge. Many Elf Bar vapes don’t come with a charging cable, so purchase one online or at your local electronics store to use. Plug the Type C side (the smaller side) into the bottom of the vape and the USB into an AC adapter that plugs into the wall. Elf Bar suggests using a 5v1a (5-watt) adapter . When buying a charging cable, look for a certification logo from USB-IF to make sure you’re buying a quality and safe cable. USB-IF is a nonprofit comprised of companies that created the specifications for USBs. [2] X Research source Using an adapter that has a higher output puts your device at risk of overheating, catching fire, or even exploding. Never plug your Elf Bar into a computer or any other device that could be damaged if a power shortage or surge were to happen."

      "title": "Unplug your Elf Bar when the indicator light turns green or off.",
      "content": "Unplug your Elf Bar when the indicator light turns green or off. Most Elf Bar vapes will have a light that turns on when you plug the device into the charger. Once your Elf Bar is fully charged, this light will turn off. Other models have indicator lights that are red when charging and turn green when fully charged. Take your Elf Bar off the charger as soon as it’s done charging. Overcharging the battery can cause it to lose its charge a lot faster when in use and can lead to the battery overheating and even exploding. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Rechargeable Elf Bars have 4 different battery capacities. The milliamp-hour (mAh) for Elf Bar devices ranges from 500 to 850. Vapes with an 850 mAh battery will likely take closer to 2 hours to fully charge, while a vape that’s only 500 mAh will charge faster. [4] X Research source Rechargeable devices: BC1600, BC5000 ULTRA, BC3000/3500/4000/5000, BB3000/3500, LB5000, CR5000, Elf Bar 3600/5000, TE5000 The mAh values for each rechargeable Elf Bar model are as follows: [5] X Research source 850 mAh - BC1600 650 mAh - BC5000 ULTRA, BC3000/3500/4000/5000, BB3000/3500, LB5000, CR5000 550 mAh - TE5000 500 mAh - Elf Bar 3600/5000"

      "content": "Disposable Elf Bars can't be recharged. You use a non-rechargeable vape, also called a “disposable vape,” until the battery or e-liquid runs out. Then you throw it away and buy a new one. The batteries in these disposable vapes are not meant to be charged, and you can sustain serious injuries caused by electric shocks, overheating, and battery explosions.

      "content": "Use a different cable or AC adapter. Any damages on either of these parts can cause your Elf Bar not to charge even when it’s plugged in. If you have another cable and/or AC adapter, change them out one at a time to see if that fixes the problem. It could also be that there’s a problem with the outlet you’re plugging the charger into, so find a different outlet and see if that works. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your charger is plugged into a wall outlet. Technically, you can plug your Elf Bar into your computer, but it’s not a recommended method of charging. A computer usually won’t have a large enough output to quickly charge your device, and you might be waiting a couple of hours for the battery to fill up completely. [8] X Research source Plugging your vape into your computer also puts the computer at risk of being damaged if there’s a shortage or power surge."

Gently insert something thin and sharp into the vape’s charging port, such as a toothpick, and clear out any dirt or dust . Then, shake the Elf Bar gently to dislodge the debris.

      "content": "Check your charger cable for any bent pieces. If the part of the charger cable that sticks into your Elf Bar is bent in any way, it may not plug in fully to start charging your device. Any bends or kinks in the cable can also disrupt the flow of charge. Straighten out any of these warped spots as best as you can and see if that helps with charging. If not, you might just have to replace the cable altogether. [10] X Research source"

If you try charging your Elf Bar in a place that’s hotter or colder than this range, the battery will have a harder time filling up. Cold temperatures can also cause your battery to drain faster, while extremely hot temperatures can cause the battery to lose capacity and not hold as much charge in the future.
