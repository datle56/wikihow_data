      "content": "Pick the right watermelon. Make sure to pick a large, ripe watermelon. To check ripeness, knock on the watermelon. If the knock sounds like a dull thud, it is underripe. If the knock makes an almost hollow-sounding noise, the watermelon should be ripe. [1] X Research source Make sure that the watermelon has a round, regular size and feels heavy. When fruit feels heavy for its size, it means that it has a lot of water inside and is ripe."

      "content": "Remove the rind from the watermelon. Wash the watermelon, then lay it on a cutting board. With a large knife, Peel a Watermelon by first cutting off the very top and bottom, then placing the watermelon upright and slicing downward to remove the rind. [2] X Research source Make sure to keep your fingers clear of the area of the watermelon you are cutting. Also use a sharp knife so that you don't run the risk of having to use excessive force and accidentally nicking yourself with the knife. After cutting off the rind, slice off any white strips on the watermelon until you’re left with only the red fruit."

      "content": "Stir and mash the watermelon until it’s liquefied. As the watermelon heats, it should begin breaking down. Help to speed up the process by mashing the fruit with a large spoon and stirring the watermelon frequently. Stop when most of the fruit has broken down, about a half hour, and remove the pot from heat. [5] X Research source"

Carefully pour out 14 cups (3.5 liters) of the watermelon juice through a fine mesh strainer to catch any of the watermelon seeds or large chunks of the fruit. [6] X Research source If you have leftover juice after you pour out the 14 cups (3.5 liters), you can reserve it to drink cooled or to use in cocktails. Store the leftover juice in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to three days."

Then cover the top of the container with a cloth and let it sit for 24 hours. Fermentation containers include heavy-seal plastic bins, glass or plastic carboys, and stainless steel kegs and tanks. The most important aspect of a fermentation container is its ability to seal completely and keep out oxygen. Before the using the fermentation container and other fermentation equipment, sanitize them by soaking them in a mixture of water and bleach, with 1 tablespoon of bleach to each gallon of water, for at least twenty minutes."

      "content": "Rack the wine and leave it for three months after fermentation begins. After you have set your wine aside for one day, you should notice that the surface of the liquid has become bubbly and foamy, and bubbles have formed in the airlock. This means that the juice is starting to ferment into wine. To rack the wine, place the end of a siphon hose into your fermentation container about an inch from the bottom. Then suck the hose to start the siphoning process. The wine will start to move through the tube once you get it started. Place the other end of your tube in the other fermentation container, then seal the lid when all the wine has transferred. You will notice that some wine sediment has been left behind in the first fermentation container. After you notice the bubbles and foam, Rack Wine into another 1 gallon fermentation container to leave behind the sediment. Cap the container and let it sit for two months."
