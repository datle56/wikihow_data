      "title": "Define exactly what you want.",
      "content": "Define exactly what you want. Explain what you like about your ideal partner and why you think you’d be a great couple. Add lots of details because it helps the Law of Attraction work. [1] X Research source Read over your list a few times to make sure you’re sending the right message to the universe. Is it okay to manifest a specific person? Some people think it’s a bad idea to go after someone specific because you don’t really know what they’ll be like in a relationship. Sometimes you get the person you want only to find out that they’re toxic or just not the right match for you. How can you tell if someone is right for you? Instead of writing their name, write down the traits that you like about them. If the person you like is a good match for you, you’ll be manifesting them because they match your list. At the same time, you’ll draw another much better person to you if this person isn’t the right one for you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Negative language can accidentally attract the wrong thing. Saying things like “I don’t want” or “no” can send the wrong signals. Always focus on what you do want, not on what you’re trying to avoid. Here are some examples on how to do that: Say, “I want a partner who’s honest” not “No liars.” Write, “Puts effort into our relationship” instead of “Not lazy” Say, “Responds to my texts quickly” rather than “Doesn’t take forever to text back.”"

      "content": "Hand write your script to give it more power. Date your entry, then describe your future relationship with your ideal partner as if you’re writing in a journal.

Tonight we’re going to snuggle up and watch a movie. He knows me better than anyone and I’m so happy we’re together.” “Bree and I have the perfect relationship. Today she surprised me with cookies she baked. She’s just so thoughtful! We have so much fun together, and I can’t wait for our next date. We’re going bowling this weekend.” “Ling is the partner I’ve always wanted. Every date with them is special, and they make me so happy. We’re going to a concert tomorrow, and then we’ll hang out at my house. They are so funny and smart.”"
