      "title": "Take your reading from the bottom of the liquid’s meniscus.",
      "content": "Take your reading from the bottom of the liquid’s meniscus. Notice how the surface of the liquid in your burette isn’t a flat line. Instead, it dips in the middle to form a shallow “U” shape, or a “meniscus.” When you read a burette, imagine a line that connects the bottom of this U horizontally to the buret’s measurement marks (or “graduations”), and take that as your reading. [1] X Research source Ensure your eye is level with the bottom of the meniscus. If you read the burette from above or below the surface of the liquid inside, you’ll get an inaccurate reading. If it helps, use a ruler to draw a straight line on a white index card, then hold this card behind the burette as you read it. Line up the line with the bottom of the meniscus to clearly indicate its position."

      "title": "Count the burette’s markings from the top down.",
      "content": "Count the burette’s markings from the top down. Most burettes start with the “0” measurement at the very top, and the maximum measurement at the bottom. So when you read a burette, find the nearest marked measurement above the liquid, then count the increments down to the level of the meniscus, rather than counting upward. [2] X Research source For example, if the liquid in your burette rests with the 15 mL mark above it and the 20 mL mark below it, the reading is something like 17.05 mL, not 20 mL or more. This is because a burette measures how much liquid you dispense out of it, not how much liquid is currently in the buret. In fact, a full burette will read “0.00.” Most burettes give markings to the nearest 0.10 mL, but the most accurate measurements are to the nearest 0.05 mL."

      "content": "Mount and fill the burette with your liquid. In titration experiments, this liquid is the titrant, which you’ll be adding to the beaker. Place your clean burette on its stand and fill it with as much titrant as the experiment requires. [3] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source To do this, use a clean funnel, or a squeeze bottle filled with the titrant. Note that not every experiment requires a full burette. In fact, most will not."

      "title": "Remove any air bubbles in the tip by opening the stopcock.",
      "content": "Remove any air bubbles in the tip by opening the stopcock. Most burettes operate via a stopcock at the bottom that opens and closes to allow the titrant to flow. Slowly and carefully open the stopcock, turning the handle counterclockwise, until fluid flows through the tip into a waste container, removing any air bubbles. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source Close the stopcock by turning it the opposite direction, until the handle is perpendicular to the burette."

      "content": "Subtract your initial reading from your second to find apparent volume. Subtract the first reading from the second reading to find how much liquid was dispensed. [7] X Research source This is known as the apparent volume, or “titer” in titration experiments. For example, if your first reading was 10.00 mL, and your second reading was 21.05 mL, then the amount of liquid dispensed is 21.05 - 10.00, which is 11.05 mL."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the scale increment of the burette.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the scale increment of the burette. Before you take a reading, examine the measurement markings on the burette. Some are labeled, but the smaller increments are not. To find how much volume the smaller markings measure, subtract 2 adjacent numbered markings, then divide the answer by how many smaller markings are between them. [8] X Research source For example, if a burette is numbered “0, 1, 2, 3…” with 10 markings between each number, then 3 - 2 = 1, and 1 / 10 = 0.10, so each small marking measures 0.10 mL of liquid. Also, most burettes measure in milliliters, but not all. Consult the “0” at the top, which should be labeled with the burette’s measurement system."

      "content": "Ensure the burette is level and stable. Make sure your burette is clamped securely into its stand, and that it stands as upright as possible for the most accurate reading. [9] X Research source Let the liquid settle for 10-20 seconds after moving the buret, to make sure all the liquid has settled at the bottom and isn’t clinging to the sides."

      "title": "Clean the burette thoroughly before and after each use.",
      "content": "Clean the burette thoroughly before and after each use. To clean a burette, rinse it 3 times with deionized water to flush out any contaminants. As you do, hold and roll the burette horizontally to ensure the inside is entirely rinsed. [10] X Research source Then, place the burette back onto its stand and open the stopcock. Let the deionized water rinse into a waste container for 1-2 minutes before using the burette. Also disassemble the stopcock, or any other pouring mechanism, and rinse it 3 times with deionized water. Never use a bristled brush on a burette, which may scratch the glass."

      "content": "Fill the burette to the top, then drain it to the 0.00 mark. Fill your burette with distilled water up to or just below its rim. Then, mount it on its stand and carefully open the stopcock to drain the water so that the meniscus reads “0.00.” Close the stopcock, then gently touch the burette’s spout to the side of the beaker beneath it to dispense any clinging drops. [11] X Research source Also, take a temperature reading of the water with a thermometer, which will come in handy in the next steps."

If it’s still draining during the 5 minutes, you may have either a faulty stopcock or burette. Replace both and repeat the first step to ensure the stopcock and burette are functioning.

[16] X Research source For a Class A burette, the correction value shouldn’t exceed ±0.05 mL. If it does, the burette may be faulty and unreliable.
