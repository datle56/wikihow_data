If your printer does not appear on the screen menu, you should find and install the proper driver for the printer, but usually, the Macbook Pro does not have to install any software from the printer if it is your first time connecting them. To install the driver, just put in the CD driver (which usually comes with the printer) in your CD ROM to initiate installation. You can also install the driver by connecting to the Internet and look for the printer manufacturer. To know the name and model of the printer, please check the printer’s box or at the side of the printer."
