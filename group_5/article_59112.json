[1] X Research source Soak a soft, clean cloth rag in warm water. Wring out some of the excess water to prevent the rag from dripping over unaffected areas. Scrape the paint away Wipe away the spot of paint. You may need to rinse and re-soak the rag several times to get all of the paint up. Wipe the wood dry with a separate, dry rag."

[2] X Research source If you have a latex paint splatter on your wood that you cannot wipe away with plain water, wipe it away with denatured alcohol, instead. [3] X Research source Apply enough alcohol to a clean rag to dampen it without making it dripping wet. Pass the alcohol-soaked rag over the paint spot to remove it. Rinse, resoak, and repeat as needed. Dry the spot with a clean, dry rag when finished."

Oil-based paint will continue clinging to the wood if you use plain water, so wipe it away with a soft rag dabbed in mineral spirits. [4] X Research source Dip a soft, clean rag into a small dish of mineral spirits. Instead of soaking the entire rag, only soak the area you plan on bringing into contact with the paint splatter. Wipe up the paint by passing the mineral spirit over the splatter. Rinse and resoak as needed until all the paint has been removed. Dry the area with a separate dry rag."

[5] X Research source Soak a clean rag in boiled linseed oil. Press the linseed oil rag against the paint spot and hold in place for 30 to 60 seconds. This permits the oil to soak into the paint. Wipe away the softened paint with your linseed oil soaked rag. Dry the area with a separate dry rag."

      "content": "Strip residue with a linseed oil paste. Any dried paint residue that remains can be removed by rubbing it with a paste made of boiled linseed oil and rottenstone. [7] X Research source Combine enough boiled linseed oil and rottenstone in a small disposable dish to form a thick paste. Use a disposable wooden chopstick to stir the ingredients together. Scoop some of the paste onto a clean rag and rub the paste into the wood along the grain. Wipe away the grain using another clean rag."

      "content": "Hold a heat gun near the surface of the wood. Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on. Use an electric heat gun or electric paint remover. A blowtorch will also provide the necessary amount of heat, but blowtorches come with a greater risk of scorching or setting the wood on fire, so they are not recommended. Wear protective gloves and goggles as you work with the heat gun. Do not let the heat gun come into contact with the wood or come too close to the wood. Doing so may result in scorch marks or fire."

Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing. [8] X Research source Do not let the heat gun linger in one spot for a prolonged period. Doing so will cause the wood to burn and potentially catch on fire."

[9] X Research source If possible, continue to heat the paint with the heat gun in one hand as you scrape up bubbling paint with your other hand. If you have difficulty balancing both tasks, though, switch the heat gun off temporarily and scrape up any heated paint immediately."

      "content": "Stay calm if a fire starts. Even though it is possible for the wood to catch fire, these fires are usually small at the start and can be put out safely as long as you think clearly. A small flame can usually be put out by smothering it with the flat side of your paint scraper. Keep a bucket of water nearby as you work. If a fire starts to catch and cannot be smothered out, quickly soak it with the water."

      "title": "Sand the paint off by hand when possible.",
      "content": "Sand the paint off by hand when possible. When removing paint from a crack or crevice or stripping it from a small, delicate wooden object, you should sand the paint off by hand. [11] X Research source Mechanical sanders use considerable force and can damage delicate pieces. Moreover, they can be difficult to use on small, confined spaces. [12] X Expert Source Sarah Fogle DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper since other types may clog with paint and wood dust too quickly. Sand with the grain of the wood instead of against it. Decrease to a medium grit paper once you can see the grain of the wood peeking through the paint. Decrease to a fine grit when small bits of paint are all that remain."

For larger areas of painted wood, including large pieces of wood furniture, large wooden chests, or wood trim, rely on a mechanical sander to save time. [14] X Research source Choose between a mechanical hand sander and a power sander. A hand sander will be a little gentler and makes a good option if you want to preserve more of the wood beneath the paint. A power sander will finish the job faster, though, making it a good choice for especially large projects. Belt, disk, and drum sanders are all good options worth considering when picking a power sander. Use coarse, open-coat sandpaper on your mechanical sander since less coarse options tend to clog up with paint and wood dust too easily. Always sand with the grain of the wood rather than against it to minimize the amount of damage to the wood. Switch to a fine grain sandpaper, if desired, once the majority of the paint has been sanded off and only a few small specks remain."

      "content": "Choose the right type of paint stripper. [15] X Research source Look for a paint stripper labeled for use with the type of paint you want to remove. Also choose between a liquid or paste paint stripper. Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers. Paste chemicals are brushed on and are used to strip many layers of paint. If you need to remove 10 layers or more, choose a paste. Read the instructions thoroughly before use. While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary. Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper."
