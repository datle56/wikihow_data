Write down this measurement—it's your band size. Then, wrap the band around the widest part of your bust. Subtract this measurement and use the difference to find your cup size. [4] X Research source If your band size is an odd number, just round up to the nearest even number. For instance, if you measure 37 inches (94 cm), your band size is a 38. For example, if your band size measures 36 inches (91 cm) and your bust size measures 40 inches (100 cm), your Spanx bra size is a 36D."

If you're in a hurry, you might not have time to pull out a measuring tape and find your exact measurements. Don't worry! Several Spanx products have standard sizing that you can use if you don't know things like your waist or bust size. For example, you can buy a Spanx top in small if you usually wear a small, or get large leggings if you usually wear a size large in pants."
