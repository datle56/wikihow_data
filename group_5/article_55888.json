[1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Because one of the main causes of an ear infection is through your ear being exposed to water, pay particular attention to itching that arises in the days soon after you have gone swimming. Infections due to fungi cause greater itchiness than those due to bacteria."

Pinna and tragus-induced irritations are considered classic findings in swimmer’s ear."

      "content": "See your doctor. At the first signs of an ear infection, go see your doctor. Although this is not an urgent medical issue, the infection can progress to the point of significant pain, chronic ear infection damage, and widespread infection. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There is a difference between swimmers ear, an infection in the ear canal usually due to water exposure, and a middle ear infection (otitis media). Otitis media usually occurs during or after an upper respiratory infection or with allergies. Your doctor can help determine which type of infection you may have and the proper treatment. Do not rely on over-the-counter ear drops. These drops usually do not have effective medication in them to clear the infection and you will need a prescription from your doctor for antibiotic or antifungal ear drops. Your doctor will examine your ear using an otoscope, which she gently inserts into the beginning of your ear canal. The otoscope helps her see the condition of the ear canal as well as the ear drum (tympanic membrane), which are not visible to you. Your doctor may also take a swab of your ear to determine the nature of the discharge. This is how the doctor will be able to confirm whether you need antibiotic or antifungal medication. The swab will need to be sent to a lab, but your doctor will start you on drops in the meantime. Your doctor will usually prescribe antibiotic ear drops to treat swimmers ear. The drops may also contain a steroid medicine to reduce inflammation and pain. She will also give you recommendations to help treat the pain until the infection has cleared."

There are different ways to monitor a fever, including using tympanic, or ear, thermometers. If you have an ear infection, be sure to take your temperature in the opposite ear. The infection will naturally increase the temperature in the affected ear so you want to be sure you get a true reading of your body temperature."
