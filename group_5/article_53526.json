      "title": "Practice on dry land.",
      "content": "Practice on dry land. Before you hit the water, it's useful to connect with your body on land, where you're probably most comfortable moving. Begin by standing upright, feet hip-distance apart. Close your eyes, and focus only on your breath. It can be useful to engage the back of your throat when you exhale (produces a throaty sound). Take about ten breath cycles."

      "content": "Gently warm up your core. If you really want to master the Dolphin Kick, you can't afford to neglect your core. While it might seem as if all of the generated power comes from the quads and legs in general, your core is a crucial part of it. [1] X Research source After all, your legs are connected to your core and work with it while swimming, and in this movement you're using your entire body and stressing your chest down. Consider the following exercise-sequence: Start by standing upright with your feet hip-distance apart. Roll your shoulders back a couple of times. Draw your upper ribs in. Make sure your tailbone is pointing straight down."
