If the company has asked whether you're interested in the job, thank them for their message, state that the position does sound interesting, and then add \"May I ask what the salary range is?\" [2] X Expert Source Shannon O'Brien, MA, EdM Life & Career Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021.

      "title": "Don't feel obliged to reveal your current salary.",
      "content": "Don't feel obliged to reveal your current salary. The company recruiter or hiring manager may ask what salary you're making at your current job rather than answer your inquiry about their salary offering directly. This is a lowballing tactic. They're hopeful that you'll disclose a salary lower than the amount they are willing to pay just so they can then offer you this same figure rather than the higher one they might otherwise have given. [5] X Research source It is unethical—and in some cases illegal—for a company to ask about candidates' confidential information like current salary. This is a privacy violation. [6] X Research source If a recruiter asks about your current salary, reply by stating the salary range you are focusing on in your job hunt and ask if this position falls in that range. [7] X Research source If the company insists on knowing your current salary, you’re better off walking away from the job. They will likely not be good employers since they are behaving unethically.

      "content": "Determine your personal salary range. It’s important to know both what your ideal target salary is and what your minimum acceptable salary is before learning the starting salary of the job. If the starting salary does not meet this minimum standard, consider not continuing with the interview process for this particular job. You might be asked what your target salary is before the starting salary is disclosed, which is another good reason to have your salary range prepared. Research will help you to determine your salary range. You can use websites like Glassdoor and Payscale to get a sense of what professionals with similar experience and education make in your field and region. [9] X Research source Special skills, such as knowledge of specific computer programs, years of experience, and degree of education can make you a desirable candidate and might help you command a higher salary than average in your field.

      "content": "Determine the starting salary before a second interview. If the starting salary is not advertised, you do not necessarily have to inquire what it is before deciding whether or not you might like the job. It’s perfectly acceptable to participate in an initial interview without knowing the salary. However, don't accept a second interview before determining what the starting salary is. [11] X Research source Many companies don't disclose their salary range in job advertisements because they are hoping to find a candidate who is unaware of their own market worth and the average salary range in the field. That's why it's helpful to do your research before asking about salary. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask about starting salary in a reply email rather than a new one. When a company recruiter or the hiring manager emails you to ask about your interest in the position or to schedule a second interview, take this opportunity in your reply message to ask what the salary is. [13] X Research source Another advantage to asking about salary in a reply message is that you don't have to think of a subject line of your own for the email."

Doing this via email is acceptable if you and your potential employer have previously been interacting through this medium, especially if the job offer itself was extended in an email. Using email gives you time to craft a coherent case for your counteroffer without becoming stressed and flustered. [14] X Research source There are some disadvantages to negotiating salary via email. Some experts believe that negotiation is better done face-to-face, and that an email can read more like a list of demands than a dialogue between employer and employee. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid mentioning the word \"salary\" in your email subject line. A subject line such as “Salary negotiation” can come off as a bit blunt and pushy. One way to work around this is to use the word “offer” instead, since your goal is to negotiate your salary. Include your name and the role you’re applying for in the subject line as well.

For example, instead of saying “I would like a starting salary of $60,000 a year,” say something like “I think $60,000 is a good amount to settle on.” [22] X Research source Don't use phrases like \"Are you sure you can't do any better?\" This leaves the company room to simply reply no. When you give an actual counteroffer, you're making the company respond to that specific amount and making it more difficult for them to say no outright. [23] X Research source Avoid using an argumentative or pushy tone. Making an aggressive statement like \"I will not accept anything less than $60,000\" is ineffective. [24] X Research source"

If possible, I would like to discuss moving the proposed salary closer to that figure.” [26] X Research source Base your justification for your desired salary on your skills and the average salary range for this position.
