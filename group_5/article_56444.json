      "title": "Tap the conversation with the person you think has blocked you.",
      "content": "Tap the conversation with the person you think has blocked you. This opens a conversation with that user on WhatsApp . Being able to view the conversation and send messages to another user doesn't mean they haven't blocked you."

      "title": "Check if the user is Online.",
      "content": "Check if the user is Online. If the user has WhatsApp open right now and you are not blocked, you'll see the word \"Online\" at the top of the conversation. [1] X Research source If you don't see \"Online,\" it can mean one of two things: The person doesn't have WhatsApp open on their screen, or they have blocked you. Just because you don't see the person's online status doesn't mean they've blocked you. Remember, WhatsApp keeps the signs of blocking pretty ambiguous to protect user privacy."

    {
      "title": "Look for the Last Seen timestamp.",
      "content": "Look for the Last Seen timestamp. If the user is not currently \"Online,\" you'd usually see \"Last Seen\" at the top of the chat, along with the date and time they last opened the app. If you don't see their Last Seen , it could be because the user has disabled this feature for privacy purposes, or because they've blocked you. [2] X Research source If you have a mutual friend in common with this person, ask them whether they can see this person's Last Seen status (if you feel comfortable doing so). If the mutual friend can confirm that this user hasn't turned off the Last Seen feature, you're probably blocked ."

      "title": "Look for two checkmarks next to a sent message.",
      "content": "Look for two checkmarks next to a sent message. When you send a message to a contact who has not blocked you, you will see two checkmarks to the right of the timestamp. One checkmark means the message has been sent, and the other means it has been delivered. [3] X Research source If the second checkmark isn't there, you may have been blocked. However, you'd also only see one checkmark if the recipient's phone is out of service or if they've uninstalled WhatsApp."

    {
      "title": "Look for profile changes.",
      "content": "Look for profile changes . Tap the person's name at the conversation to view their profile . When you are blocked on WhatsApp, a user's profile will never change to you. If you have reason to believe that this user has changed their status or profile photo and you can't see the changes, you may have been blocked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try calling them in WhatsApp.",
      "content": "Try calling them in WhatsApp. Tapping the phone receiver icon at the top of a chat makes a voice call to that user. If the call does not start ringing the user, it could mean they've blocked you. However, it could also mean that they've disabled voice calls in their privacy settings."
