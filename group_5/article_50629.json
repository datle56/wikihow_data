      "title": "A Libra guy is likely to be more interested if you keep things casual.",
      "content": "A Libra guy is likely to be more interested if you keep things casual. Librans tend to have some pretty idealistic notions about love and romance, but they'll enter a friendship easily. This should suit you just fine since Cancer women are known to be cautious, particularly when it comes to love. If you come on too strong, especially at first, you're likely to scare him away. Remember that Librans value harmony and balance—a platonic relationship builds a solid foundation for a future romance."

      "title": "Librans are thinkers who love to talk about anything under the sun.",
      "content": "Librans are thinkers who love to talk about anything under the sun. A chat with a Libra guy will certainly keep you on your toes, especially if he's the type to flit from topic to topic. Use your Cancerian intuition to figure out what will interest him and he'll quickly warm up to you. For example, if you notice that he's wearing a Star Wars T-shirt, you might talk about your favorite characters in the series or ask if he's seen the most recent spin-offs. Just don't be surprised if you end up talking about space travel or the possibility of life on other planets."

      "title": "Your Libra guy really loves sharing details about his life.",
      "content": "Your Libra guy really loves sharing details about his life. Most guys love talking about themselves, but Librans take it to the next level. Encouraging him to talk about himself also gives you the opportunity to show off your stellar Cancerian listening skills. Pay attention when he's talking and ask follow-up questions based on what he's said. He'll adore that you're really listening to him and care about what he's saying. You'll also learn things about him that you can bring up later. For example, if he mentions that his intramural basketball team has a game on Friday, when you see him on Saturday you can ask how the game went. He'll love that you've taken an interest in his life."

      "title": "Making a positive impression is important to a Libra guy.",
      "content": "Making a positive impression is important to a Libra guy. He puts a lot of effort into everything he does and a compliment tells him his efforts are successful. For more impact, draw on your keen Cancerian powers of observation to point out something unique about him that most people wouldn't notice. Make your compliment about some action on his part rather than something he has no control over—say, his taste in clothing or style rather than his looks. Focus on something you know he's proud of to deliver a compliment that'll be sure to make him glow. For example, if he's a dedicated member of his soccer team, you might praise his ball-handling skills."

      "title": "Symbolized by the scales, Libra values justice and fairness.",
      "content": "Symbolized by the scales, Libra values justice and fairness. If you're a typical Cancer, you're devoted to helping others, so you've probably got a couple of pet causes. [1] X Research source Talking them up to your Libra interest will help him see that you're just as committed to lifting up others as he is. For example, if you volunteer at an animal shelter, you might tell him about the compassion you feel for all the abandoned dogs and cats you care for. Talking about social causes is always a good topic too—trust that no matter the issue, an intellectual Libra guy will have a well-thought-out opinion on it that he won't be shy about sharing."

      "title": "Your Libra crush will be drawn to your classic Cancerian femininity.",
      "content": "Your Libra crush will be drawn to your classic Cancerian femininity. As a soft, sensitive Crab, you're fond of fluttering fabrics and classic lines that accentuate your figure. If you show up in a beautiful, flowing dress or gauzy blouse and slim pants, he won't be able to take his eyes off of you. Libras do tend to be more attracted to a neat, orderly appearance. Even if you're just running errands, make an effort to look put together if you know you're likely to run into him—he'll definitely notice. Libra is an air sign, so they are fond of intellectuals. But it is a Venus-based sun sign. So they want a woman who is intelligent and attractive."

      "title": "This is the perfect opportunity to share your mutual love of beauty and creativity.",
      "content": "This is the perfect opportunity to share your mutual love of beauty and creativity. Libra guys tend to be drawn to things that make them think. As a Cancer, you're usually more interested in things that stir your emotions. [2] X Research source Look for art that combines the powers of intellect and emotion for a truly sizzling outing. For example, you might take in a symphony or opera, then go out for coffee afterward and discuss it together. Visiting an art museum to take in classic works of art will always appeal to a Libra. You might even do a little research on the artists so you can share facts about their lives as you look at their works."

      "content": "Your Libra will likely be attracted to your nurturing Cancerian nature. Deep down, a Libra guy wants to be taken care of, and no one knows how to do that better than you. Invite him over and cook his favorite comfort foods and he'll be smitten. You might even track down his favorite family recipe for a thoughtful, personal touch. Whatever you do, don't leave the kitchen in a mess. Libra guys tend to value order and neatness, so he'll really appreciate your efforts to clean as you go and keep things tidy.

      "content": "The typical Libra guy is a hopeless romantic. He won't be able to resist the pull of a picture-perfect romantic evening—whether you're laying on a blanket outside gazing at the stars or cozied up at home eating dinner by candlelight. Cancer women are known for being in touch with their emotions, so you're sure to know just how to make him melt. [4] X Research source Any relationship with a Libra typically starts as a friendship—the struggle is getting him to take the relationship to the next level. Take the lead and make your feelings known through an unmistakable romantic gesture."

      "title": "A Libra guy's ideal woman has her own life and interests.",
      "content": "A Libra guy's ideal woman has her own life and interests. He likes to go out and do his own thing from time to time and he doesn't like to think that you'll be bored and alone if you're not out with him. Make time regularly to spend with your friends and cultivate hobbies that keep you busy. If you're not very social (and many Cancers aren't), that's fine—just make it clear that you're sitting at home because you want to, not because you don't have anything to do when he's not around. Scheduling regular activities is a good way to signal that you're independent and have your own interests. If you have soccer games on Thursdays and Saturdays, pottery class on Tuesdays, and book club on Sunday afternoons, he'll know that you're living your best life."

      "title": "Given that he values fairness, a Libran is committed to honesty.",
      "content": "Given that he values fairness, a Libran is committed to honesty. This shouldn't be too difficult for you, Cancer, since you believe in honesty above all else. But if you're ever tempted to bend the truth a little to spare his feelings, remember that it will hurt him more to find out you weren't completely honest. Remember that having a lot of freedom in a relationship requires a lot of trust—and trust requires honesty. He'll stick by your side for a long time if he knows he can rely on you."

      "title": "Like Cancers, Libras need time alone to recharge.",
      "content": "Like Cancers, Libras need time alone to recharge. This shouldn't be a problem for you, Cancer, since you likely understand this need all too well. It might seem surprising coming from someone who seems like such a social butterfly, but he really does need time and space to think. Unfortunately, Cancers have a reputation for being a bit clingy. If you have this tendency, try to be aware of it and make a conscious effort to pull back occasionally and leave him alone. He'll be grateful for it and appreciate the effort you're making."
