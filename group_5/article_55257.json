    {
      "title": "Make your way to Megaton.",
      "content": "Make your way to Megaton. Once you leave Vault 101 for the first time, head southeast from the vault towards Megaton. You can see Megaton in the distance after you leave the vault at the beginning of the game. It is a large structure with nothing around it, so it sticks out very well. You will not come across any enemies when you make this small trip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Locate Super-Duper Mart east of Megaton.",
      "content": "Locate Super-Duper Mart east of Megaton. Once you have located Megaton, head east towards the D.C. area. You will come across the Super-Duper Mart. You will see the backside of the store when walking towards it. Just beyond the Super-Duper Mart is a major river flowing through the D.C area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the river at the closest bridge or by swimming.",
      "content": "Cross the river at the closest bridge or by swimming. Continue heading east until you reach the river. You will need to find a way to cross this river, either by bridge or by simply swimming across. If you cross by bridge, keep an eye out for landmines, as they can deal a ton of damage. Swimming across the river will inflict radiation. Be as quick as you can to reduce the risk of radiation poisoning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head south along the river.",
      "content": "Head south along the river. Once you have crossed the river, follow it south until you reach the southern part of the D.C. area. Eventually youâ€™ll see the Jefferson Memorial in the distance. You may encounter strong enemies such as Super Mutants or raiders along the river during this trip. It is recommended that you are well-equipped before venturing to this part of the ruins in D.C. Being equipped with leather armor and some sort of ranged weapon such as a plasma pistol will protect you in the Wasteland."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head east before reaching the Jefferson Memorial.",
      "content": "Head east before reaching the Jefferson Memorial. Follow the water until you begin to see a large ship. Avoid approaching the Memorial itself, as it is crawling with Super Mutants."

    {
      "title": "Locate a beached aircraft carrier and a metal structure to its left.",
      "content": "Locate a beached aircraft carrier and a metal structure to its left. This is the only massive ship which is beached. The ship is split in two and the back end is where Rivet City is located."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the drawbridge.",
      "content": "Find the drawbridge. As you come closer to Rivet City, you will need to locate the bridge on the right side that allows you to cross onto the beached ship. The only way to board the ship is by a small structure with stairs leading up to the bridge platform."

    {
      "title": "Ask for permission to enter.",
      "content": "Ask for permission to enter. Once you are at the top of this metal structure, click on the Intercom at the top of the platform. A bridge located on the aircraft carrier will swing over to the platform you are on. Cross this bridge to enter Rivet City."

    {
      "title": "Explore the city.",
      "content": "Explore the city. You can either go through the door directly facing you which leads to the market, or enter the door on your left which will lead to the inner city. The inner city features the bar, the science lab, houses, and the ship church. From time to time, you will see a trading caravan with a trader and a guard at the base of the metal structure leading up to the bridge. [1] X Research source"
