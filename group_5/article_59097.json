Since the gasket is the rubber seal inside the washer that prevents water from leaking out when a load is washing, cleaning the gasket is very important to eliminating mildew smells coming from the washer. Wipe down the gasket with a rag dunked in soapy water, or sprayed with a mild mildew cleanser. You could also use a cleaning solution of 50% water 50% bleach. Consider using an old toothbrush to get hard to reach places of the gasket. Make sure to get all areas of the gasket. You may need to pull back sections of the gasket to get into small rubber folds.

You might want to consider: Airing out the washing machine . Leave the washing machine door open between washing uses. However, be aware that pets and young children could become trapped in the machine. [8] X Research source Using detergent wisely . Use detergents that create a small amount of suds, and are specifically made for highly efficient machines. Powder detergents usually tend to be less sudsy than liquid detergents. Also, don't exceed the recommended amount of detergent. Sometimes, even less detergent works better for cleaning your clothes. [9] X Research source Avoiding fabric softener . Fabric softeners that come in liquid form tend to leave a residue that supports mold growth. Instead of using liquid fabric softener, consider using dryer sheets or dryer balls to give your clothes a softer feel. [10] X Research source Drying the gasket . Use a rag to wipe everywhere surround the gasket, and inside the grooves of the rubber gasket. Ideally, you should try to wipe the gasket after every washing cycle. If you’re not going to wipe and clean the gasket after every wash, you should try to regularly wipe the gasket every week or so to remove trapped mold. [11] X Research source Doing a bleach cycle . Run a hot water and bleach cycle once a month. This is a good opportunity to disinfect your washer, but also to wash heavily soiled items like work cloths and grimy towels. [12] X Research source"
