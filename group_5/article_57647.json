There are a few ways you can go about this: [1] X Research source At Foraging level 1, cutting down or shaking a Maple Tree can give you a Maple Seed. If you see a buried item next to a Maple Tree, it is likely a seed, and you can dig it up with an Axe or Pickaxe. Maple Seeds can sometimes be found by searching through garbage cans. The Traveling Cart will sometimes sell Maple Seeds for 100 to 1,000 gold, but this is not a recommended method as Maple Seeds are relatively easy to find."

      "content": "Plant the Maple Seed. You must plant the tree in Spring, Summer, or Fall—trees will not grow in Winter unless you have Tree Fertilizer. Maple Trees are a common (or wild) tree, and they follow different rules than Fruit Trees. Unlike Fruit Trees, you can plant a Maple Seed anywhere—even next to other objects or outside the confines of your farm. [2] X Research source The only caveat to this is that a wild tree will not grow to maturity if it is planted directly next to another tree. As long as there are no other trees in the 8 immediately adjacent tiles, the tree will grow to maturity."

      "content": "Wait for the tree to grow. If you use Tree Fertilizer, your Maple Tree will grow 1 stage every day, except for Stage 4 which takes 2 days, leaving you with a fully grown tree in 5 days. If you do not have Tree Fertilizer, there is a 20% chance per day that your tree will grow. On average, unfertilized Maple Trees will grow to maturity in 24 in-game days. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Maple Trees differ from Oak Trees in a few ways. Out of all the common trees, Maple Trees and Oak Trees may be the most difficult to differentiate. Below is how you can differentiate a Maple Tree from an Oak Tree based on stage or season: Stage 1: A Stage 1 Maple Tree is darker than a Stage 1 Oak Tree, and points straight up instead of curling. Stage 2: A Stage 2 Maple Tree has three forked leaves, while a Stage 1 Oak Tree has three small petal-shaped leaves. Stage 3: A Stage 3 Maple Tree has forked leaves, while the Oak Tree has smaller, pointier leaves. Stage 4: A Stage 4 Maple Tree is less bushy than a Stage 4 Oak Tree, and has a more yellow-toned trunk. Spring: A fully grown Maple Tree in Spring has larger leaves and looks less \"full\" compared to a fully grown Oak. It also has a more yellow-toned trunk. Summer: The easiest way to differentiate a Maple Tree and Oak Tree in Summer is that a Maple Tree is covered in little yellow Maple Seeds. Fall: Fall is the easiest time to differentiate a Maple Tree and an Oak Tree: Maple Trees turn a purplish red color, and Oak Trees turn orange. Winter: In Winter, a Maple Tree will appear to have sparser branches than an Oak Tree, and overall has a slimmer appearance."
