      "title": "Fold the crotch of the panty up toward the waistband.",

      "title": "Roll the fabric horizontally across the panty.",
      "content": "Roll the fabric horizontally across the panty. Start with the side that is closest to you and roll the fabric away from your body to make a tight cylinder. This will create a small, easily storable scroll. [3] X Research source This method works with thongs, but the size of the scroll will be much smaller than briefs and cheeky underwear once you finish folding it."

      "title": "Store the panty scrolls in a drawer or storage compartment.",
      "content": "Store the panty scrolls in a drawer or storage compartment. Pack the scrolls side by side and position them vertically to save storage space. Organize them into a single layer so you can easily find what you’re looking for. If you don’t have much space, feel free to stack the pantry scrolls on top of each other."

      "content": "Fold each side of the waistband inward to make a square. Fold the left side of the panty into the center, then fold the right side on top of the left side to make a square shape. The panty will be folded into thirds. [6] X Research source This is the simplest and most compact method."

      "content": "Stack the panties vertically to store them. Place them side by side and vertically inside your dresser or storage compartment. They will look like tiny files in a filing cabinet. If you want to organize them further, stack them by color, type, or occasion. You can now choose the pair you want without messing up the rest of them!"

      "content": "Roll the top of the panty toward you until it hits the crotch area. For larger types of panties, like briefs and boyshorts, fold the top twice on the way up. [10] X Research source This will create a distinct pocket inside the center of the folded panty. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Flip the bundle inside out 3 times.",
      "content": "Flip the bundle inside out 3 times. Place your thumbs inside the pocket and the rest of your fingers around the edges of the opening. Use your middle and index fingers to push the fabric along the back of the pocket up through the front opening, while folding the outside edges back with your thumbs. Repeat this until the bundle is rolled into itself 3 times. [12] X Research source You are essentially reversing the narrow waistband folds you made earlier in the process. Use this method if you don’t want your panties to unfold inside your drawer. This folding technique might look a little tricky, but think of it like you’re rolling a pair of crew socks into a ball."
