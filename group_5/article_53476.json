[1] X Research source If they aren’t already in this position, roll them onto their back if you can do so safely. This carry is easiest if the person you’re rescuing is conscious, but you can also do it with an unconscious person if you need to quickly and easily drag them out of harm’s way."

When you’re both in position, crouch or kneel down next to the injured person. [2] X Research source You will need to be facing each other, rather than straight ahead, in order to pick up the person properly."

      "content": "Grab the injured person’s wrist and shoulder. With the hand that’s closest to the person’s feet, grab hold of their wrist. Use your other hand to grab onto their shirt at the shoulder. Have your partner on the opposite side do the same thing. [3] X Research source If you can’t grab onto their clothing at the shoulder, place a hand behind their shoulder or grab them under the arm."

From there, help them stand up. [4] X Research source If the person is unconscious, sit them up, but don’t pull them into a standing position yet."

Wrap your other arm around their waist. Have your partner do the same thing on the other side. As you do this, bend your knees and crouch down slightly, then straighten up into a standing position. If the person is unconscious, put their arm around your shoulders and grab their waist before pulling them up into a standing position."

Make sure you are all facing the same direction. [5] X Research source If the injured person is conscious, they may be able to walk with your assistance. If they are unconscious, you’ll need to pull them along while their legs drag slightly behind them. In this case, hold onto the person’s belt or waistband for extra support. You can also provide extra support by holding the person’s wrist with your outer hand."

      "title": "Position the injured person on their back.",
      "content": "Position the injured person on their back. This helps get the injured person in the correct position to be carried. You should carry someone from the side if they’re unresponsive or unable to move. It's usually safer to carry someone in a sitting position, but this is not always possible if the person is unable to change positions. It's safer, in this case, to carry the injured person from the side. [6] X Research source Go slowly to avoid further injury. If the injured person is able to talk, check in frequently to make sure they are comfortable throughout the process. In the event the injured person is unconscious, you may want to tie their hands loosely together at the wrists. This can make the carrying process easier. If you have something that can be used to tie the injured person's hands, like thick rope or a bandana, you can use this. Do not use anything thin or sharp to tie the person's hands—this could cut their wrists."

Regardless of the position you're using, you start in the same position. Get the injured person on their back. If they are able to lean forward slightly in a seated position, ask them to do so.

Then, grab your partner's right wrist with your left hand. Your partner will grab your right wrist with their left hand. This creates a square-shaped seat with your arms. Have the injured person shift to the sitting position. You and your partner should lower your bodies, bringing the seat you've created down near the injured person's bottom. Have the injured person sit on your forearms. Then, ask them to place their arms on your and your partner's shoulders for balance. Again, lift slowly and in unison.

      "content": "Get professional training before attempting an actual rescue. While it can be fun to practice various carrying techniques with a friend, you should not attempt to perform them on an injured person without professional training. Enroll in a first aid course, nursing course, or a course on emergency or disability services if you want to be able to perform these techniques on someone who's injured or incapacitated. You should have some kind of professional certification before attempting any of these techniques. Without professional training, it can be hard to assess the extent of someone's injuries. You may be unsure which carry to use if you're unable to tell if it's safe to move someone in a particular position. Carrying someone safely requires a great deal of practice and guidance. Practice carrying someone with the supervision of a professional, who can correct your form and provide tips. Professional training can help you learn how to conduct yourself safely during an emergency. However, if you think the person is in immediate danger—for example, if they’ve collapsed in the middle of a busy street—you may have to move them in order to get them out of harm’s way.

If the person is conscious, ask them how they should be moved, and check if they have any special needs or considerations you should keep in mind. An injured or disabled person may also be waiting on professional services, and may not need the help of you and your partner. It's always better to ask first, if possible."
