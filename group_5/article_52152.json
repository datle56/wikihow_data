It might sputter out before the time's up, which means the pressure is relieved. [1] X Research source While the engine might sputter out, this isn't necessary to relieve the pressure. Running it for 1 to 2 minutes will do the trick. Make sure your car is parked in a level, well-ventilated area."

      "content": "Disconnect the negative terminal on your battery. Turn your car off, then open the hood. Find the negative terminal on your battery, and use a wrench to remove the cable. Tuck the cable on the side of the battery so it doesn't accidentally come into contact with its terminal. [2] X Research source The negative terminal is marked with a minus sign (-), and the positive terminal with a plus sign (+). If your terminals are colored red and black, the negative terminal is the black one. If you don't disconnect the battery, sparks could ignite gas fumes and residue that drips from the fuel lines."

Since the fuel system's pressure needs to be reestablished, it might take a few tries before it starts. While it runs, check under your car for fuel leaks. [16] X Research source If you spot leaks, you'll need to disconnect the battery, jack the car up (if necessary), and tighten the fuel lines. If your engine won't start after a few minutes, double check your fuses. If your dashboard and dome lights are dim or won't turn on, your battery might need to be jumped . If the fuses and battery are fine, make sure you reinstalled the filter correctly and that the fuel lines are tight. Contact your mechanic if none of these troubleshooting methods work."

If the gasoline you've collected from your fuel lines and filter isn't badly contaminated with debris, you could use it in a lawn mower or other gas-fueled equipment. If it's loaded with debris and unusable, transfer it to a gasoline container and bring it to a disposal center. [17] X Research source To find a disposal center, contact your city or county waste management authority or your local fire department. You could also call a nearby automotive shop and ask if they dispose of gas for free. It's illegal to throw away gas in the trash or to pour it down a drain, even in small amounts. Keep the container sealed during transport and never smoke or light a flame near gasoline."
