      "content": "“Work has been great, thanks for asking!” If you’re enjoying your work and things are going well, then use a positive response to express your enthusiasm. Keep it brief if you don’t want to get into the details, or give a short explanation on what’s making your work days go well. “Work has been good.” “Work’s been really nice lately.” “It’s been fantastic! I really love what I do.” “Work is amazing. I have the best coworkers.” “Work is exciting recently! I’m starting a new project, and I’m learning a lot.”"

      "content": "“Work is okay. I'm doing the same things as usual.” If you’re having neutral feelings about work or if there haven’t been any major changes in your job, then just let the person know you’re doing okay. “Work’s fine, nothing too exciting is happening.” “It’s okay. Not much has changed.” “Work’s been same-old, same-old.” “Work is decent. I can’t complain too much.”"

      "title": "“It’s been tough recently, but I’m managing.”",
      "content": "“It’s been tough recently, but I’m managing.” When work isn’t going too well, try to stay professional and avoid being too negative. Let them know your job has been hard but that you’re still trying to stay positive. If you’re talking to close friends outside of the workplace, then it’s okay to explain what’s stressing you out. “Work is a bit stressful lately, but I’m getting through it.” “I have a big project that’s taking up a lot of time, but I’m nearly finished.” “I’ve been struggling a little recently, but things are starting to get better.” “Work has been a lot lately, but I’m keeping my head up.” “Work has been hard the past few weeks. We have a lot of new employees so it’s been extra work to train them.”"

      "title": "“It’s a living!”",
      "content": "“It’s a living!” If you’re chatting with close friends, then it’s okay to loosen up and give casual, funny responses. Just avoid using a jokey reply when you’re around your boss or in your workplace because it can sound unprofessional. “Just another day!” “It’s work.” “I’m living the dream!”"

      "title": "The person asking wants to know how your job is going.",
      "content": "The person asking wants to know how your job is going. When someone asks you “How was work?” or “How was work today?”, then they’re wondering how things are going with your job. They may be curious about the tasks you worked on or how work has made you feel recently."

    {
      "title": "“What did you do at work today?”",
      "content": "“What did you do at work today?” Rather than simply asking how work is for someone, ask about what they did so you can have a deeper conversation. That way, it shows that you care about what the person is doing and they’ll be more likely to open up. “What happened at work this week?” “What was the best part of your day at work?” “Who were you working with today?” “Was it a productive day for you at work today?”"

      "title": "“How did your day feel?”",
      "content": "“How did your day feel?” If you want to know how someone is feeling about their job, then ask a more personal question to connect with them. Asking someone an open-ended question like this shows that you’re sincerely interested in the person and what they have to say.

      "content": "“How’s your work” is asking about a specific task you’re working on. When someone asks you “How is work?” they’re usually wondering about your work life, so a general answer about how you’re feeling is appropriate. “How is your work?” implies they’re curious about your current workload and duties, so you can give more specific answers about projects."

      "content": "“How is the work coming along” is asking about your progress on a task. When someone says, “How is the work going?” or “How is the work coming?” they want to know how far you’ve gotten on a project. They may be curious about how close you are to completing the task and how you’re feeling about your work on it. Depending on how far along you are on a task, you may answer like, “I’m about halfway done, and it’s been a little challenging,” or “I’m just about finished!”"
