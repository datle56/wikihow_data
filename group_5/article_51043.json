      "content": "Layer your colors to create a blending effect. By layering one color on top of another, you can lighten or darken it to accomplish the hue you have in mind. This should be done lightly and with as few strokes as possible. You can always add more of your layer color, but once added, it'll be difficult, if not impossible, to remove. You can lighten dark colors with a layer of a lighter color, like white, over top. This can also help with softening colors, like the one found in skin tones. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Utilize a blender pencil. This tool looks like a clear colored pencil and it is intended specifically for blending colored pencils. [2] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. It is sometimes referred to as a colorless blender. Rub this tool firmly upon the colors you are trying to blend and pass it back and forth until the desired level of blending is reached. By spreading a thick layer-color over a base-color with your blender pencil, you can create a glaze effect over top the base. This will also impart a blended effect to your artwork. Make sure to use a pencil that is not sharp so that the lines are softer. [3] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022."

      "content": "Spread colored pencil with a bristle brush. With a moderately stiff bristle brush, you can drag colors you've already applied to the page around it. Thin coverage will give your colors a lighter tone; thick concentration will intensify the color. Colors spread together will blend. You may have to experiment with this and get some experience before you become fully comfortable with the technique. You should choose your brush with regard to the paper you have used. Thicker paper may allow you to use stiffer brushes for easier blending. Thinner paper might require a soft bristle brush and gentle blending over time. You should also be able to use a tortillion to push colors around the page to create either increased or decreased brightness. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Smudge colors to imitate blending. Though paper and tortillions won't be effective for blending, a cloth can be used to smudge colors together to attain this look. You may want to start by smudging a small, inconspicuous area with a tiny piece of cloth to see how the colors blend before attempting to blend the main parts of your art. Some cloth might blend differently than others or create a unique effect in your drawing. Testing your cloth beforehand can prevent unintended effects when blending. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Add your colored pencil to the image. You're going to be breaking down the lead of your Prismacolors to blend the colors together, so you'll first need all your color on the page. Start with your base and add strokes of other color. These accent colors will blend with the base once the solvent is added. Sometimes after drawing with Prismacolors you might notice a waxy buildup on the colored areas. If this makes your blending more difficult, you can wipe away the waxy film with a soft, dry cloth."

      "title": "Choose your solvent for blending.",
      "content": "Choose your solvent for blending. In most cases, mineral spirits should be sufficient for your blending efforts, though there are specific brands intended for this purpose, like Gamblin Gamsol Odorless and Weber Terpinoid natural. Pour a small amount of this solvent in a small, resealable glass container. These kind of solvents can break down certain common plastics over time. Due to this effect, you should avoid using a plastic container for your solvent. You won't need much solvent for blending. A little bit goes a long way, so a small container will likely serve your purposes best. A resealable container is especially helpful when you are drawing often with Prismacolors. This way you can reuse your solvent easily."

      "content": "Brush on your solvent to blend the Prismacolors. Using too much solvent can cause your colors to become runny. It may take some time and practice before you get the knack for adding the right amount of solvent. Generally, you should: Dip an inexpensive synthetic brush into your solvent. Remove the brush, then blot excess solvent from it with a paper towel. Brush your solvent lightly onto the area you are blending with your brush. Continue blending, little by little, until you achieve the desired effect."

      "content": "Allow your blended Prismacolors time to dry. Eventually, the solvent will evaporate and your blended Prismacolor lead will return to its original consistency. Keep your artwork level to prevent colors from accidentally running. Depending on how much solvent you needed to use while blending, your solvent blended art may be dry in less than an hour. In some cases, this may take up to a day to completely dry."

To prevent this, you might cover the areas you don't want blending with removable tape.

This can be removed without harming your artwork by wiping it away firmly with a clean, dry cloth or moderately stiff bristle brush. You'll often find that wax buildup occurs in areas you have heavily applied your colored pencil to a specific area. Keep an eye on these areas for buildup. [8] X Research source"

However, it's likely you'll have the best success with an electric eraser. You can also lift unwanted marks by applying and peeling free adhesive putty, like the kind used to hang posters and artwork. [9] X Research source Even with an electric eraser, it's likely some remnant of the Prismacolor will remain. Avoid erasing too much to try and completely erase the mark. Doing so could result in a ripped page. [10] X Research source"
