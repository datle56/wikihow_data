      "content": "Heat 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of vegetable oil in a skillet to 375 °F (191 °C). Set a deep skillet on the stove and pour in the vegetable oil. Clip a deep-fry thermometer to the side of the skillet and turn the burner to medium-high heat. Heat the oil until it reaches 375 °F (191 °C). [2] X Research source If the oil continues to heat past 375 °F (191 °C), turn the burner down a little. If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, heat the oil until it shimmers. When you think it's ready, lower 1 piece of plantain into the oil. If the oil is hot enough, it will immediately begin to bubble and fry. If it doesn't, wait another minute and check again."

Use your hands to slowly lower 4 or 5 of these pieces into the oil, taking care not to drop them or the oil could splash you. [3] X Research source If you're concerned that the oil will burn you, place the plantain pieces on a slotted spoon and lower it directly into the oil. It's important to fry the plantains in batches so the temperature of the oil doesn't drop quickly."

Use a slotted spatula or spoon to carefully flip them over halfway through the frying time. This ensures that they become crispy and brown on both sides.

Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter or oil, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, and 1 pinch of salt. Then, use a spoon to toss the mixture gently until the plantains are coated. If you prefer, use your favorite vegetable oil instead of butter. If you don't want the plantains to be sweet, you can leave the sugar out."

Ensure that there's at least 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) of space between each piece so they roast evenly. There's no need to grease the parchment since it contains silicone. This prevents the plantains from sticking."

These are the ripest, so they're the sweetest. If you prefer them less sweet, look for a plantain that's mostly yellow with some black spots. Green plantains are the firmest and least sweet, so you might choose these if you want a more savory dish. [15] X Research source You can usually find plantains near the bananas at the grocery store. Although plantains are similar, they contain more starch and less sugar than bananas."

Most recipes recommend that you cut across the plantain to make lots of 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) or 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. [19] X Research source If you like, slice the plantain diagonally. This increases the surface area of the plantains so they become crispier and more flavorful."
