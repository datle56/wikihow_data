      "content": "Say 어머니 (eomeoni) when talking about your mom or someone else’s mom. This is the most common way to say “mother” among adults. [1] X Research source You can use the standard form when talking about your mother to someone else, or when referring to someone else’s mother. Older and middle-aged generations use this form when talking with their parents, but newer generations use both the standard and informal forms. Pronunciation: uh-muh-ni Example: 어머니는 어떻게 지내세요? / eomeonineun eotteohge jinaeseyo? / How is your mother doing? If you’re talking about your own mother, preface 어머니 (eomeoni) with the word 우리 (uri), meaning “our” in English. Korean people use “our” when talking about a group that they’re a part of, or a person or object they’re strongly attached to. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Say 어머님 (eomeonim) when addressing a mother in a formal situation. Korean people add the honorific 님 (nim) to the end of kinship terms, titles, and names to show respect. It is reserved for people who are older or of higher status, especially if you are meeting them for the first time.

Pronunciation: um-ma Example: 우리 남자친구 어머님이 김치를 맛있게 만드시네요. / uri namjachingu eomeonim-i gimchileul mas-issge mandeusineyo. / My boyfriend’s mother makes really good kimchi.

      "content": "Listen to Koreans pronounce the word. If you know Korean people, ask them to say “mother” to you and coach you on the right inflection. Otherwise, look for YouTube videos, voice recordings, and other speaking samples on the Internet. There are tons of tutorials that can help you get the pronunciation down, and you may find that it is much easier to imitate the language if you hear it aloud. [5] X Research source Watch K-dramas to improve your overall pronunciation. While you may not hear the word \"mother\" often, you might find that it's easier to say the word if you understand the context. [6] X Research source"

String the syllables together once you can confidently and correctly pronounce each of them, then say it quickly.

You can call your mother \"eomma\" out of context, whether or not you’re a fluent Korean speaker, but you will be able to use the word more effectively if you can speak more of the language. Learn the Korean alphabet (Hangul), explore online resources, buy a guide to learn basic Korean, and try to practice the language whenever you have the opportunity. [8] X Research source Popular language-learning apps like Duolingo and Busuu may be a great place to start learning Korean."
