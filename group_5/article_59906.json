      "content": "Pull on the crown of the watch to see if it is pendant-set. The crown is a rotating button at the top of the watch above the number 12. Unlike other watches, the crown on a pendant-set watch will press in and pull out. If the crown moves up and down, it is a pendant-set watch. [1] X Research source Use gentle force to pull up on the crown. A pendant set watch should move fairly easily from 1 setting to another. If you have a rotating crown and there is no lever or pin button, you can assume you have a pendant watch. This is the most common setting in modern pocket watches."

      "content": "Look for a lever to identify a lever-set watch. Look for a small metal tab sticking out from under the dial. This may be hidden under the case over the dial, so you may need to remove the front case to find the lever. A lever-set watch will also have a rotating crown. [2] X Research source Lever-set watches are also known as railroad watches. They are more common in antique watches, but they may also appear in some modern watches."

      "content": "Identify a key-set watch by the lack of a rotating crown. The easiest way to tell a key-set watch is to try to turn the crown at the top of the watch. If it won’t turn, you have a key-set watch. Furthermore, if your watch comes with a key, you can assume it is a key-set watch. [3] X Research source While modern watches may have a key, key setting is the oldest form of pocket watch. If your watch comes from before the late 19th century, you most likely have a key-set watch."

A pin-set watch will also have a rotating crown at the top of the watch.

If you see a hole directly in the center of the back of clock, set the watch from the back.
