[3] X Expert Source Karen Litzy, PT, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 August 2020. But in some cases, the pain experienced with a bulging disc can be severe. Your doctor can provide prescriptions for pain medications, for short-term use, that can help to provide some relief. Just be sure to closely follow your doctor's instructions for dosage and other considerations, like whether to take the medication with a meal. Examples of medications that may be prescribed include opiate pain relievers such as hydrocodone or oxycodone, pain patches such as lidocaine or fentanyl, prescription strength anti-inflammatory agents, such as high dose ibuprofen, and muscle relaxers such as cyclobenzaprine or Metaxalone."

      "content": "Consider injections. If the symptoms are slow to respond and the pain is severe, you may want to consider injections to the site. The most common type of injection for treating bulging discs is a spinal injection, also known as a nerve block injection or epidural. This type of injection uses steroid-like medication injected directly into the area to reduce inflammation and relieve the pain."

Keeping your head level, push it back until the back of your head touches the wall. Most people find they must tilt their chin up to get their head to touch the wall, which indicates poor posture. Push your head back as far as you can while keeping it level. Hold this position for 20 seconds. Eventually, your head should reach the wall, without the unwanted tilt. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a chair that provides support. Regular seating causes a pelvic tilt that puts extra pressure on your discs. Sitting in this position for extended periods can contribute to back problems, like bulging discs. Many experts are now recommending seating options called “active chairs”. An active chair is designed to help you maintain spinal integrity, engage your muscles, and work on your posture, all while you are seated. [17] X Research source Several types of active chairs are available. A few examples include a Zenergy Ball Chair, Swopper Stool, Wobble Stool, Rockin’ Roller Desk Chair, and Humanscale Freedom Saddle Seat. Although these chairs may be beneficial, keep in mind that it is also important to get up and move around now and then. Try setting a timer to remind yourself to get up for a couple of minutes for every hour that you sit."
