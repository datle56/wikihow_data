      "title": "Dig your pool as deep as you want.",
      "content": "Dig your pool as deep as you want. Filling pools can be difficult, but with this method you can quickly fill a pool of any depth, as long as it is all the same depth. The bottom of the pool will need to be level, but the shape of the pool can be anything you'd like."
    },

      "title": "Add a layer one block deep.",
      "content": "Add a layer one block deep. After the pool has been dug, add a layer across the entire surface one block deep into the pool. Make this new layer out of something easy to break such as dirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add water to the top layer.",
      "content": "Add water to the top layer. Use your bucket and start filling in the top layer with water. Water will flow from the source blocks you place, so you won't need to fill in each block. As you fill, you might notice some currents appearing. These are caused by the lack of water source blocks nearby, and can be fixed by placing a water source on the block the current is originating from."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dig out the layer of dirt.",
      "content": "Dig out the layer of dirt. Once the top layer has been filled with water and there are no currents, you can dig out the layer of dirt. The water will begin filling the lower part of the pool, and you won't have to worry about it flowing correctly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the finishing touches.",
      "content": "Add the finishing touches. Once your pool is complete, you can add the finishing touches to make it a truly relaxing place. Add a cobblestone border around it to give it a professional look. Place some trees for shade, torches for light, and maybe even build a diving board!"
