      "content": "Check your state’s laws to be sure it’s legal. The laws vary from state to state, but most states won’t let you adopt a monkey or ape without a permit and proof of an enclosure big enough for the animal to live happily. You'll probably have to be running a rescue or research center of some sort; you're unlikely to be able to buy a monkey as a pet. Check out animal rights nonprofit Born Free USA’s website for an overview of different states’ laws regarding the adoption of exotic animals, including monkeys and apes. [1] X Research source (Tl;dr: you probably can’t buy a monkey.) Most states that allow the adoption of monkeys and apes will require a permit, which can be pricey. You may also need a certain level of experience with the animal you wish to adopt before you’re granted a permit. For instance, if you want to adopt certain wild animals in Florida (including a variety of primates, such as chimps, baboons, and gibbons), you need to log 1000+ hours of caretaking work with the species you’re looking to adopt. [2] X Research source Some states may outlaw specific primates—e.g., Arkansas does not permit the possession of apes, baboons, and macaques as pets. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Research the type of monkey you want. There are over 300 different types of monkeys, and they differ widely from one another. Do as much research as possible on the type of monkey you’re interested in adopting—including whether it’s legal to own such a monkey in your state. [4] X Research source Monkeys differ by size, cost, social habits, and more. Understand the needs of the monkey you’re looking to adopt and make sure you’re equipped to care for your new pet."

      "content": "Find a reputable breeder. Way easier said than done. The internet is full of black market and scammy breeder websites, so try asking a professional monkey handler or exotic veterinarian what they recommend. They’re sure to have a better understanding of the ins and outs of monkey ownership. Send an email to the primate handlers at your local zoo for their advice. Search for exotic veterinarians in your area and ask them what they recommend. (If there are no exotic vets in your area, you probably shouldn’t get a monkey.) Just be prepared for whoever you reach out to to disapprove of your decision to own a monkey. They may or may not be willing to help you, even if you have the proper licensing. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Monkeys are very social, cute, and entertaining. If you’re looking for a pet to spend a lot of time with, a monkey may fit the bill. Monkeys are social creatures by nature, and once your monkey bonds with you, it will want to follow you everywhere. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Monkeys can be a challenge to train, but they’re very intelligent creatures capable of doing complex tricks. [7] X Research source They’re endlessly fun to watch and hang out with. As a bonus, they live a long time compared to more traditional pets. It’s incredibly hard to lose a pet, but the typical monkey lives anywhere from 20 to 40 years, meaning you probably won’t have to say goodbye to your buddy for a while. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Monkeys are expensive to buy and take care of. The cost likely varies depending on the type of monkey you’re looking for. A smaller monkey, like a capuchin, might cost under $10,000, while a larger ape, like a chimp, might cost upwards of $50,000. And, of course, you’ll likely need that permit, which will cost money. [11] X Research source Even after buying your monkey, they’re costly to care for . Plus, your home insurance company may require an addendum for exotic animals, which can increase your policy limits."

      "content": "It’s difficult to adopt a monkey legally. It’s illegal to adopt a potentially dangerous animal in most states, but exactly what that means shifts depending on the state. Even if your state allows the adoption of monkeys, the necessary permits may be difficult to attain and expensive. Since you need a permit to handle a monkey, this could make getting someone to pet-sit for you a bit of a nightmare, as they’d need to be an experienced monkey handler, too. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Monkeys require a lot of care. Monkeys are a lot like children, so if you’re not prepared to have a baby, you’re probably not prepared to have a monkey. They require lots of attention, as well as exercise and toys to keep them active and entertained. They also need regular time outdoors. They also require lots of space, which most houses aren't big enough to afford. [13] X Research source Unlike with a cat or dog, you can’t just leave a monkey unattended for hours on end, and they can’t be left home alone for extended periods of time. Also, unlike a cat or dog, you can't let a monkey roam free in your house. For that matter, most houses are too small to comfortably contain an adequate monkey enclosure, so unless you're running a monkey rescue, you probably don't have the space to care for a monkey. Guidelines look a little different for different species, but essentially, you’ll need to make sure your enclosure is safe, clean, and large enough for your monkey to have plenty of space to move about it. [14] X Research source You’ll need to find an exotic animal veterinarian before adopting your monkey, which can be a challenge if there’s not one in your area."

      "title": "Monkeys can sometimes pose health risks.",
      "content": "Monkeys can sometimes pose health risks. Because monkeys and people are so closely related, disease-causing organisms, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, are easily passed between them. For example, one of the most serious diseases monkeys may pass to humans is herpesvirus B. [15] X Research source This isn't much of a risk when it comes to monkeys bred in the United States, so if you're trying to open a monkey sanctuary, you may not have to worry about it. However, since monkeys are rarely permitted as pets in the country, it's likely you'd have to acquire your monkey through illegal means, usually by having it smuggled into the country, meaning your monkey is far more likely to carry diseases."

Monkeys are smart, complicated creatures, which can make it difficult to train them if you don’t have a thorough understanding of primate behavior. [16] X Research source They can be stubborn and towheaded, making taming them a challenge. [17] X Research source Not only are they hard to train, but they’re also pretty messy, and it can be hard to train them to be neater. When it comes down to it, monkeys are wild animals, and they aren't really meant to live in a house."

An undersocialized monkey may be more prone to biting and screaming—behaviors that are difficult to manage. Some monkeys need to be a part of a hierarchy, meaning you may need to adopt 5 or 6 monkeys. You’ll also likely need to understand the politics of that hierarchy yourself and treat the monkeys accordingly."

      "content": "Domesticated monkeys often suffer psychological trauma. When it comes to monkeys, \"taming\" is often code for \"breaking.\" Many domesticated monkeys suffer extreme trauma from being taken from their mothers at very young ages or from being trained by people with no experience with the animal. [21] X Research source As \"cute\" as a monkey in a sweater is, clothing can restrict a monkey's natural movements. Without freedom of movement, monkeys may become anxious and aggressive. Traumatized monkeys often develop anxious behaviors such as rocking, pacing, and overgrooming. While you might think a smiling monkey is a happy one, smiling is actually a defensive gesture for monkeys, indicating distress."

      "content": "“Adopt” a monkey at the zoo or another animal organization. Born Free USA and Wild Futures are two of many organizations that allow you to sponsor a monkey in a sanctuary. While it’s not the same as having the monkey yourself, a sanctuary surrounded by trained handlers and other primates is likely to be a safer, more fulfilling environment for the monkey, and your sponsorship will do long-term good for the protection of endangered or at-risk species. Adopting a sanctuary monkey often includes a personalized certificate of your adoption, a photo of “your” monkey, information about “your” monkey’s history, and regular news about your monkey’s well-being. You may also be able to see the monkey when the sanctuary is open to visitors, if you live near it. If you don't live nearby, you may have virtual access to your monkey online."

There are loads of other animals who will be just as fun and affectionate (if not more so) as a monkey—and they’d likely be lower-maintenance and easier to obtain.

In conclusion, monkeys are not only difficult to acquire legally, they're best left where they belong: in the wild—or, barring that, in a big sanctuary run by monkey experts, where they have plenty of space to play and hang out with other monkeys. Monkeys are so cute and special, and it would be so great to have one to hang out with whenever you want, but unfortunately, it's just not in the monkey's best interest the vast majority of the time—and it's probably not in your best interest, either!"
