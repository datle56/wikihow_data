      "content": "Push the red button on the dustbin to empty it. The dustbin is the clear cylindrical container that captures debris you vacuum up which is attached to the vacuum's handle. Simply hold the bin over a trashcan and press the red button on the vacuum’s handle to release the debris into the trash. [1] X Research source Note : Make sure your vacuum is turned off and disconnected from the charger before cleaning it. Shake the vacuum over the trashcan to knock loose as much dust and debris inside the dustbin as possible. Make sure to position the dustbin over a trashcan or empty bag. If you don’t, you’ll likely end up with a mess on the floor!"

Just grab the container and gently wiggle and pull it to completely take it off of the colorful cyclone piece. [2] X Research source Empty out any dust still left in the bin. Turn it over inside a trash can or garbage bag and shake out as much as you can."

      "content": "Wipe the bin with a damp microfiber cloth . Wet a clean, soft microfiber cloth with lukewarm water. Then, squeeze out the excess moisture so the cloth is damp and not dripping wet. Simply wipe the interior and exterior of the dustbin with the cloth to remove stubborn, leftover debris. [3] X Research source Do not clean the bin in the dishwasher, as the water is too hot and rough. Always clean the bin by hand. If the bin is full of loose dust and debris, you might only need a dry cloth to wipe it out. Dyson does not recommend using any soaps or cleaners to clean the dustbin."

      "content": "Clear dust off of the cyclone shroud with a dust brush. Find the combination brush tool that came with your vacuum, which is half-brush and half-vacuum nozzle. Then, hold the vacuum over a trash can. Simply sweep the brush over the shroud to loosen stuck-on dirt and debris. [4] X Research source The cyclone and shroud are the colorful pieces attached to the vacuum handle that the dustbin hangs from. If you can’t find the combination brush tool, use any soft brush to remove dust and dirt on the cyclone and shroud, like an old paintbrush or toothbrush. Only use a dry brush to avoid getting any moisture inside the cyclone and the motor."

Then, push a flathead screwdriver into the clip and work it back and forth to separate the shroud from the cyclone. Keep inserting the screwdriver at different points between the shroud and cyclone to fully remove the shroud. [5] X Research source Take off the shroud outside or over a trash can or bag, as the inside of the shroud and cyclone are likely full of dust. If you don’t have a screwdriver, use a butter knife or another sturdy, flat tool."

Then, grab the shroud piece and brush the inside free of debris. [6] X Research source Use a dry cotton swab or compressed air to clean out any tiny crevices on each part. As an extra cleaning step , use a Torx T8 screwdriver to remove the screws on the cyclone and pull it off of the vacuum. Then, brush the inside of the cyclone and the piece it covered free of dust.

[9] X Research source To put the bin back on, look for a small tab on the front of the cyclone and near the bottom edge. The bin has a slot on its front edge that fits on that tab. Just line up the slot and raise the bin until it clicks in place. [10] X Research source Tilt the bin slightly and attach the vacuum end first to make reassembly easier. Make sure the bin is completely dry before reinstalling it or else moisture could get into the vacuum and damage it."

Look for a plastic cap colored purple or blue on the very top of the cyclone that has a little tab in the center of it. Just pull on the tab to slide the stick-shaped filter out of its chamber. [11] X Research source Note : Turn your vacuum off and disconnect it from the charger before cleaning the filter. Check the filter for damage. If it looks worn out, it might be time to replace it. Look for a new filter on Dyson’s website or at your local general or hardware store. Dyson recommends cleaning the filter at least once a month. You may need to wash it more frequently if you vacuum up heavy amounts of debris or your machine isn’t working as usual."

Simply turn the filter clockwise to detach it from the vacuum. [12] X Research source If you’re unsure whether or not your vacuum has a second filter, check the owner’s manual. It will show you where the filters are located."

      "content": "Rinse the filter with cold running water. Cleaning specialist Alessandra Mendes says “the best way to clean dust out of a Dyson filter is to rinse it with cold water until the water runs clear.” Just hold your filter under the running water and gently squeeze it to force out trapped dust and debris. Keep rinsing and squeezing the filter until you see nothing but clear water coming out of it. If you have a HEPA filter, clean it under cold running water, too. [13] X Research source Do not use soap and other cleaners to clean your filters, as they can damage them. The filters are too delicate to wash in a dishwasher or washing machine."

Lay your filter on a cloth or paper towel to help absorb excess moisture and set it in a spot that’s away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Then, leave the filter to dry for about 24 hours. If it still feels wet after 24 hours, give it more time to dry. [14] X Research source Do not put a wet filter back in the vacuum, as this can damage it. Let the filter dry naturally in open air. If you try to speed up the process, such as by using a dryer, microwave, or flame, you might damage it."

Just look for the fastener at the end of the brush and on the side. Then, insert a coin into the slot and twist it counterclockwise to unlock the brush. [17] X Research source Note : Unplug and turn off your vacuum before cleaning the brush bars and attachment.

[18] X Research source Wiggle and rotate the bar as you pull it out to help prevent it from getting stuck. Use scissors or a razor to cut any hair tightly wound around the brush. Clean the brush bar about once a month to prevent clogs from forming. If you pick up a lot of hair, you may need to clean it out more often."
