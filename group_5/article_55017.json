Close drawers, have kitchen timers go off at random times to spook the squirrels, or lay out aluminum foil to freak the squirrels out when they step on it. By removing comfort spots, the squirrel will be incentivized to leave.

      "content": "Remove all food sources. Especially in inhospitable weather, like in winter or during a drought, a squirrel may be especially hard to remove if it has a lot of food available. Squirrels, like other rodents, have sharp teeth that can gnaw through even the thickest of food bags. If the food isn’t in safe storage, remove it. They’ll eat basically any veggie, nut, fruit, or meat scrap, so don’t leave any food or garbage out.

If so, the squirrel may be going in and out of your home to the garbage can for food. Move the can away from the building."

      "content": "Use lights, noise, and scents to make your home less hospitable. Squirrels, like any animal, are sensitive to certain scents, sounds, and sights. In particular, squirrels might dislike the smell of cider vinegar, so try soaking some rags in the stuff and put them in the squirrel’s area. [5] X Research source If you can, sprinkle some predator urine in the area—that will 100% work. [6] X Research source You might also leave a radio playing constantly in the room the squirrel is in to drive it out. A bright light left on throughout the day and night can also make your house less appealing to squirrels. You can buy predator urine from farm supply stores or sporting good centers. Soaking rags in a predator’s urine (like a fox or coyote) could lead to your squirrel invader beating a hasty retreat.

Squirrels in your attic or other narrow spaces, like a wall or crawlspace, can be difficult to get at without close contact. In this case, bang on the rafters and walls. You can also set alarms on spare phones or alarm clocks to go off periodically to freak the squirrels out. [8] X Research source Even entering your attic and speaking in a loud voice may be enough to chase your squirrels out of your home. These loud noises will often provoke a squirrel’s flight response, making it flee through the escape path you’ve provided."

As soon as the squirrel realizes that no one else is in the house, it should leave through the escape route you’ve left open if you’ve been sufficiently annoying.

To prevent more squirrels from making your house their home, close off any entrances the squirrels might use to get back inside. This will require some investigation on your part.

Use spray foam to fill in any minor gaps in siding or brickwork that you don’t want to fully fix immediately.

In fact, squirrels are especially not tough—this squirrel is likely horrified. As much as you want the squirrel out of your home, the squirrel's primary goal is also to get out of your house and back to a familiar environment. [18] X Research source Animals have a similar anxiety response to humans and respond aggressively to perceived threats to safety. By staying calm, you will prevent the trapped squirrel from having a severe aggressive response. The squirrel is likely to be erratic since it is unsure what to do in the foreign environment of your home. Additionally, a squirrel, on very rare occasions, can be rabid, so avoid getting closer than you have to.
