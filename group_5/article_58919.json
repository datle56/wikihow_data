If you think you’ve been roofied, head to the emergency room and let the doctors know. [1] X Trustworthy Source Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network Largest anti-sexual assault organization in the US providing support and advocacy for survivors Go to source While Rohypnol is common, other drugs like ketamine and GHB are also sometimes used as date rape drugs.

We know this can be scary, but the police may want to take swabs or use your clothing as evidence of the crime. It’s up to you whether or not you’d like to report sexual assault or being roofied. Even if you don’t end up reporting it, it’s a good idea to keep evidence on file, just in case you change your mind later on."
