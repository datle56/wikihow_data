      "content": "Understand latitude. Latitude measures how far a point is north or south of the equator. Since the earth is round, distance from the equator is measured in angular degrees with the equator being 0 degrees and the northernmost point -- the North Pole -- being at 90 degrees. The southernmost point -- the South Pole -- is also at 90 degrees. [1] X Research source Latitude is measured in degrees north when in the northern hemisphere and degrees south when in the southern hemisphere."

      "content": "Understand longitude. Longitude measures how far a point is east or west of the prime meridian -- arbitrarily set as Greenwich, England. Since the Earth is round, distance from the prime meridian is measured in angular degrees with the prime meridian being at 0 degrees longitude. As you move east or west, the longitude measures up to 180 degrees of the prime meridian. [2] X Research source 180 degrees longitude is known as the international dateline. Longitude is given as degrees east when in the eastern hemisphere and west when in the western hemisphere."

      "content": "Know the accuracy of your readings. Degrees are a large unit of measurement so to get an accurate location, longitude and latitude are divided to the decimal point referred to as decimal degrees. For example, you may see latitude as 35.789 degrees North. Global Position Systems (GPS) often show decimal degrees but printed maps do not. [3] X Research source Online topographic maps express longitude and latitude decimal degrees in degrees, minutes and seconds. Each degree equals 60 minutes, while each minute equals 60 seconds. The comparison to time allows for easier subdivision."

Note the city, town, or specific point on the map that denotes your current position. Once found, mark your location. The map legend will tell you the scale of the map so that you may quickly estimate distance relative to known landmarks if you do not know the name of your city. This may help you find your location more quickly. Depending on what you’re trying to locate, make sure you’re using a map with an appropriate scale. If you want to find how far a state is from your own, you would want to use a map of the United States rather than one of the world."

      "content": "Use a map ruler to check the degrees. Measure from your location outwards from the map to the straightest numbered line of latitude or longitude. The map will be divided into both vertical and horizontal lines to represent the measurements of longitude and latitude. The 4 corners of your map will display the coordinates of both the longitude and latitude fully written out. Only the final two digits will be shown for all other points in between. [8] X Research source Your map should have the lines of latitude and longitude forming a grid and dividing it into cross sections. A map ruler is easy to use and can be purchased at an outdoor supply store or online. Make sure that your map ruler corresponds to your USGS 1:24,000 scale map series. [9] X Research source Measure latitude first. The lines of latitude will be north and south parallels to your location. Place the zero end of your map ruler on the southern parallel. The next parallel to the north should be touched by the 2 ½ minute end. One edge of the ruler will be marked in minutes and seconds while the other edge is decimal minutes. Make sure to use the correct edge that corresponds to the coordinate format of your map. Slide the ruler to the right -- or to the west -- until it touches your location. Mark how much distance is between the southern parallel to your location. Add this to the latitude of the southern parallel to get the latitude of your location. [10] X Research source To measure the longitude you must place the ruler diagonally on the west and east meridians with the ends of the 2 ½ minute ruler touching both meridians. The lines of longitude on your map will be the east and west meridians of your location. You must measure diagonally because if you measure horizontally, the ruler extends past the grid because the meridians of longitude grow closer as they move from the equator. Move the ruler vertically until you find your location making sure to keep both ends of the ruler on the meridians at a diagonal. Record where your location is -- in minutes and seconds -- west of the eastern meridian. To find the longitude of your location, add your measurement to the longitude of the eastern meridian.

Check your watch or you may use the method of creating a quadrant and placing a stick in the ground, at the very southern end of a north-south line. It’s noon as soon as the shadow of the stick crosses the north-south line. [14] X Research source Use a plumb line to ensure that the stick is vertical. A plumb line is exactly as it sounds: a line with any type of plumb attached to it. Gravity will ensure that the plumb creates a vertical line."

There should be 2 nails at either end of the face of the cross and 2 nails at either end of the top of the hands of the cross. [15] X Research source Center a protractor at the pivot point.

      "content": "Understand that the time of year plays into the accuracy of your reading. Your reading will only be correct in both the spring and autumn equinoxes that fall on March and September 21 respectively. If you are taking measurements around December 21, or midwinter, subtract 23.45 degrees from your reading. In contrast, add 23.45 degrees if you are taking measurements around midsummer, June 21. [18] X Research source The measurements are not completely accurate, other than spring and autumn equinox, because of the way the Earth is tilted as it orbits around the sun. While there are complex tables that give you the correct factor to determine your exact latitude and longitude on any given day, accurately estimate based on the date relative to the spring and autumn equinox. For example, if you are measuring at the start of May, which is half-way between the spring -- when the sun is directly above the equator -- and summer equinox -- when the sun is above 23.45 degrees north of the Equator, you would just need to add half of 23.45 degrees -- 11.73 -- to your measurement."
