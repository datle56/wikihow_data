      "content": "Take cuttings when the tree is dormant. Cuttings from hardwood species are taken during the dormant season, which is when the tree doesn't have leaves. This is usually between mid-autumn and late winter. [1] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Keep a close eye on the tree once autumn begins, as the best time to take cuttings is just after the leaves fall."

      "content": "Choose healthy branches that have grown in the past year. Branches that have shown significant growth are ideal, as these are the most likely to give good, healthy cuttings. Pick a few branches that don’t have any disease or insects. The best thickness for cuttings is about a pencil-width. The branch will be woody, rather than soft or green. [2] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Generally, the healthier and more vigorous the shoots that you select are, the more likely that the cuttings will be successful."

      "title": "Cut through the branch where the current year’s growth starts.",
      "content": "Cut through the branch where the current year’s growth starts. This is where the current season’s growth joins the 2-year-old growth. This section will be mature and woody. [3] X Research source Sharp secateurs are the best to use to take cuttings. [4] X Research source Snip the unripe, softer, and greener wood, which is at the top of the branch, off the cutting. This part of the branch has the best potential for root development, which means that the cuttings are more likely to be successful. This is because this area has many dormant buds that give hormones to the developing roots."

      "title": "Cut below the lowest bud at the base on the branch.",
      "content": "Cut below the lowest bud at the base on the branch. The cut needs to be approximately ¼ inch (6 mm) below the lowest bud that you can find. Make sure that this cut is horizontal and straight. [5] X Research source Buds will look like slightly raised areas that are somewhat different in color from the rest of the branch. You will need to cut the branch in 2 different places to take a cutting. This first cut will be horizontal and closer to the base, and the next cut will be angled and closer to the top of the branch."

      "content": "Make an angled cut ¼ in (6 mm) above this bud. Make sure that the cut slopes away from, rather than towards the bud. This will leave behind the best mature wood of the current season’s growth. [7] X Research source The distance between the horizontal cut at the base, and the angled cut at the tip will be around 6 to 10 inches (15 to 20 cm), depending on the size of your tree or shrub. Make larger cuttings for larger trees, and smaller cuttings for smaller trees. Remove all the leaves from the cutting before you plant it."

      "title": "Remove a thin layer of wood from the base of the cutting.",
      "content": "Remove a thin layer of wood from the base of the cutting. Scrape off a thin sliver of bark at the base of the cutting using a knife or secateurs. This will wound the cutting, which makes it more likely to root. [8] X Research source This helps to remove a physical barrier which might get in the way when roots start to form."

Simply open the lid of the container, and dip the base of the cutting in. [9] X Research source Lightly tap the cutting after it has been dipped into the powder to shake off any excess."

      "content": "Fill a pot with the propagating medium. Moist, free-draining cutting compost is popular, but if you don't have any on hand, regular potting mix also works. Fill the pot to just below the top. [10] X Research source Coarse sand or coconut coir are more alternatives for propagating cuttings. Medium blends are also alternatives for propagating mediums, such as 1 part peat with 1 part perlite, or 1 part peat with 1 part sand."
