[1] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. But others have found it to be virtually ineffective at removing oils from anything but their scalp, even after spending several minutes washing their hair. [2] X Research source Since everyone’s hair and styling routine is different, there’s no way to guarantee whether it’ll work for you. Baking soda is pretty rough on the hair and skin. While some people might benefit from using it for an occasional deep cleanse, it’s not a good choice for regular hair-washing. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "It typically causes damage, like frizz and dryness. Baking soda is fairly alkaline, which makes it good for breaking down grease and grime—but there’s a risk that it’ll break down your hair, too. Some research has suggested that the more alkaline your hair product is, the more likely it is to give you rough, dry, frizzy hair. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In other words, it can cause some pretty serious damage that can take a long time to fix! Baking soda also risks irritating or damaging your skin, which is a concern if you have sensitive skin or any skin conditions (like eczema or psoriasis). [5] X Research source There’s some chemistry behind this: baking soda has a pH level of around 8 or 9, whereas your hair and skin average around 3.7 and 5.5, respectively. The high pH of the baking soda “clashes” with the low pH of your hair and scalp, which damages it.

      "content": "That will change the scent or texture, but it won’t prevent damage. There are tons of suggestions for “softening” baking soda shampoos with other ingredients, or rinsing your hair with something to neutralize the damage—such as water, apple cider vinegar, or tea tree oil. [7] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. But there’s no real way to prevent baking soda from causing mayhem on your hair. In fact, some of these combinations (like baking soda and apple cider vinegar) could actually cause more damage, because you’re “shocking” your hair with the sudden contrast in pH. [8] X Research source Mixing baking soda with water won’t reduce the pH, despite what you might have heard. Water's pH is 7, which is neutral, so adding baking soda just raises the pH of the water."

      "content": "Baking soda risks making your dandruff worse, not better. Some people tout baking soda as a permanent end to their scalp flakiness, but the alkalinity of baking soda dries out and breaks down the skin on your scalp. This can result in a stronger dandruff problem than before, because a dry scalp means more flakes. Scalp dryness and irritation alike can also mean more itchiness, meaning more scratching at your scalp!

[10] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. Since it also breaks down skin, though, you don’t want to use it regularly: there won’t be enough buildup for it to remove, and you risk earning a raw and sensitive scalp for your effort.

If you have thicker, oily hair and don't have sensitive skin, you can give it a shot. And it’s a good idea to dab a little bit of the mixture on your skin before you wash your hair with it, just to make sure you don’t have a reaction. [12] X Research source Avoid baking soda shampoos if you have thin or weak hair, sensitive or dry skin, or have reacted badly to other products based on baking soda. You should also not use baking soda shampoos if you’ve used any kind of bleach, dye, or relaxant on your hair. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Use it sparingly, and focus it on your scalp. The simplest way to make a baking soda shampoo is to combine baking soda with water; a common ratio is 1 part baking soda to 3 parts water. Then, use your fingers to massage the mixture into your scalp. [14] X Expert Source Mindy Nguyen Holistic Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. After one to two minutes, rinse it out with water, being sure to get all of the baking soda off your scalp and out of your hair. [15] X Research source Don't leave in the baking soda for longer than two minutes. It can irritate your scalp. Once you've rinsed out the baking soda, treat your hair and scalp with a moisturizing treatment, like conditioner, hair oils, or hair masks. (Baking soda wears down and dries your hair and scalp.)"

      "content": "Limit it to once or twice a month. You shouldn't replace your normal shampoo with a baking soda shampoo; since baking soda is much stronger than other cleansers, using it regularly will hurt your hair and scalp and give you dry, unhappy hair. It's better for removing excessive oils or product buildup. Depending on how oily your hair is and your typical hair routine, that could mean using it monthly, or every two or three weeks. [16] X Research source If your hair is weak or treated, you shouldn't use baking soda at all, because it can damage your hair and cause it to break. [17] X Research source"

Some hair-care resources claim that if you combine baking soda with a store-bought shampoo, it’ll do a better job of cleaning your hair. There isn’t research to back that up, though; it’s most likely to change the pH, which doesn’t mean it’s cleaning your hair any better. [18] X Research source But if you’re curious, you can give it a try! You can either add commercial shampoo to a homemade baking soda shampoo, or you can try adding a very small amount of baking soda to a bit of store-bought shampoo. Like with a baking soda shampoo, test a little bit on your skin before you wash your hair, to make sure you don’t react. Keep in mind that store-bought shampoos with high pH levels will still damage your hair. Consider testing the pH of the mixture before you try it."
