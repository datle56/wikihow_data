      "content": "Measure 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of whole milk with 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of light cream. This will give you 1 cup (240 ml) of half-and-half that's pretty much identical to what you can buy at the store. In fact, don't be surprised if you can't tell any difference at all! It should even have about the same fat content (10-12%), so it's perfect for using in coffee or any recipes that call for half-and-half. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Stir together 3⁄4 cup (180 ml) of whole milk and 1⁄4 cup (59 ml) of heavy cream.",
      "content": "Stir together 3 ⁄ 4 cup (180 ml) of whole milk and 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of heavy cream. This will give you a version of half-and-half that's a little creamier and richer than the original. It's a good substitute in a pinch, but you might want to use a little less in your coffee than you normally would. [2] X Research source This is an especially good substitute when you need half-and-half for baked goods or ice cream, since the extra richness won't be as noticeable."

    {
      "title": "Measure out 2⁄3 cup (160 ml) of skim, 1%, or 2% milk.",
      "content": "Measure out 2 ⁄ 3 cup (160 ml) of skim, 1%, or 2% milk. Then, add 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of heavy cream and stir well. The result will taste surprisingly close to the half-and-half you're used to getting from the store! [3] X Research source A little splash of this is perfect in your morning coffee, but it will replace half-and-half in any recipe, as well."

      "title": "Melt 2 tbsp (28 g) of butter and pour it into a 1 cup (240 ml) measuring cup.",
      "content": "Melt 2 tbsp (28 g) of butter and pour it into a 1 cup (240 ml) measuring cup. Then, fill the measuring cup the rest of the way full of milk. Whisk the mixture quickly to incorporate the butter, then add what you need to your recipe. [4] X Research source If the butter clumps when you add the milk, microwave the mixture for about 15 seconds, then stir it again. This won't taste much like commercial half-and-half, so it's not ideal for coffee or ice cream. However, it will give you the fat content that you need to replace half-and-half in something like a cake recipe. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of milk.",
      "content": "Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of milk. Then, whisk in about 1 tbsp (8 g) of flour or cornstarch. This will thicken the milk, giving it a consistency that's a little closer to half-and-half. However, keep in mind that the taste may not be exactly the same. [6] X Research source The fat content of this mixture will be lower than that of half-and-half, so it's not a perfect substitute for baked goods. However, if you just don't like the watery consistency of coffee mixed with plain milk, this can help get you through until you can get to the store."

      "content": "Mix equal parts coconut cream with plant-based milk to make vegan half-and-half. If you can't find coconut cream, refrigerate a can of whole-fat coconut milk. Open the can carefully—be sure you don't tilt it—then skim the thick cream off the top of the can. Then, mix that with an equal amount of almond milk, soy milk, or your favorite dairy-free milk alternative. [7] X Research source You could also just use the coconut milk in your coffee, but it will have a strong coconut taste. Keep in mind that coconut cream isn't the same thing as cream of coconut—cream of coconut has added sugar, while coconut cream does not. [8] X Research source"
