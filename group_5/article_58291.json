      "content": "Prepare the area where the work will be done. Heavy equipment may be used to clear the footprint of the building, plants and unsuitable material should be removed, and the subgrade should be inspected to determine if it will give adequate support for the slab and the structure that will be built on it. Have the site surveyed or layout the building lines yourself. Batterboards may be used, or corner stakes can be set to allow building lines to be pulled and grades to be established for clearing and grading. Grub out trees, bushes, and other plants, including their roots so they will not leave voids in the subgrade when they decay. Remove any mucky or otherwise unsuitable material from the subgrade. Proof roll or use another method to compact the disturbed subgrade soil material."

      "content": "Fill the slab area with a suitable material to finished grade. Capillary fill is used where moisture may create a problem. Crushed limestone or other aggregate base materials can be used for slabs with heavy loads like warehouse floors and aircraft hangars.

For wide spans, you will want to set grades or some type of screed guide to allow the screed operators to keep the concrete flat, or at the required slope. Pipe screeds are used in the placement shown in the photographs, but other techniques may be used, including grade stakes, or using a laser level and target to set wet screeds. [1] X Research source"

This should be done early in the process so that concrete trucks and other required equipment will be able to get into the area they will need access to during the concrete placement. Aerial pumps can place concrete to specific areas of the slab via an articulated boom and hose assembly up to 120 feet (36.6 m) from the concrete truck. They are often used for placing concrete on elevated decks or in inaccessible locations. Line pumps also use pipes and hoses to move the concrete from the truck to the placement location, but require a lot of labor to move the hoses around while in use. Concrete buckets can be used for placing the concrete in high locations or inaccessible areas using a crane or forklift. Georgia buckets are self-propelled wagons that can maneuver in tight locations to place concrete. Chuting or tailgating is discharging the concrete directly from the truck into the form."

Testing labs often perform the following tests: [3] X Research source Slump. This test determines the plasticity of the concrete material. A vertical cone shaped mold is filled with concrete and the amount the concrete slumps is measured, to make sure it is not too wet to meet specification for the job. [4] X Research source Temperature. Concrete suffers detrimental effects when it becomes too hot, so the temperature of the product is monitored during placement. Air entrainment. Chemicals are added to the concrete to ensure air is entrained in the mixture. These tiny voids will allow the concrete to expand and contract more before cracking when concrete is expected to be subjected to large temperature variations over time. A typical air entrainment requirement is 3-5%. Compressive strength. Concrete strength is measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), and special plastic molds are used to collect samples of the material which are later used in the testing lab's laboratory to determine the concrete's strength.

      "content": "Plan on beginning large slab placements as early as possible to allow time to complete the project successfully. Things to consider are these: Make sure you have sufficient manpower to perform the job. Check the weather conditions. These factors can contribute to concrete setting times: Temperature. The higher the temperature, the faster the concrete will set, and very hot conditions will affect the ability of the workers to perform. Humidity. Very low humidity will allow for the water in the concrete to evaporate more quickly. Wind. Wind can increase the speed the surface of the concrete will dry. Cold weather can greatly increase the setting time for concrete. Placing concrete at near freezing temperatures or when freezing conditions are expected during the next 48 hours is not recommended. Sunshine. Concrete will set more quickly in bright sunny conditions than it will in cloudy conditions."

Service troweling machines, including checking the controls, the blades, and making sure they are full of engine oil and gasoline. Check straight edges, screed boards, power screeds, and bull floats to make sure they are in good condition. Make sure concrete vibrators are in good condition if the slab requires their use.
