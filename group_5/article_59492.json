  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Even if you need more time, respond to her text quickly.",
      "content": "Even if you need more time, respond to her text quickly. It's pretty nerve-wracking to tell someone you like them, and she's probably anxiously waiting to see what you'll say. If you like her too, you're probably excited to give her an answer. Put some thought into it, but don't spend too much time thinking of the perfect response! [1] X Research source Things might be a little more complicated if you need to tell her you're not romantically interested in her or you need some time to think about how you feel. Avoid the temptation to drag it out though—go ahead and respond to her text as honestly as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find out if she likes you as a friend or something more.",
      "content": "Find out if she likes you as a friend or something more. If you're chatting with a girl and she says something like \"LOL I like you,\" you might be a little confused about her intention. Does she like talking to you as a friend? Does she want to be your girlfriend? If you have any questions about it, the best thing to do is to ask. [2] X Research source Try saying something like, \"Oh yeah? As a friend or...?\" You can do this even if you're pretty sure what she means as a playful way of getting her to tell you more about her feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Accept her invitation or ask her out yourself.",
      "content": "Accept her invitation or ask her out yourself. Once the cat is out of the bag and she’s told you that she likes you, you’ve got a great opportunity. If you like her, tell her and then ask if she’d like to go out sometime. She’s very likely to say yes! [3] X Research source For instance, you could say something like, “I like you, too! Let’s go grab some coffee or a drink this weekend. Are you free Saturday night?” She went out on a limb and took a risk to tell you how she feels, don’t let her down if you feel the same way. Ask her out! [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Thanking her is a great way to express gratitude.",
      "content": "Thanking her is a great way to express gratitude. It also a great introduction if you plan to say more. If you’re unsure of what to say, thanking them is polite and buys you some time to come up with a longer response if you want to. [5] X Research source For instance, you could text back, “Thank you!” and then follow up with something like, “I really like you too” or something like “You’re such a great friend” if you don’t have romantic feelings for them. Additionally, saying “Thank you” is a great response for a platonic relationship. If she’s just a friend or even a relative, thanking them is the polite thing to do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Profess your feelings with a genuine response.",
      "content": "Profess your feelings with a genuine response. Don’t leave her hanging! Tell her that you like her too so she knows that you feel the same way. [6] X Research source You could shoot back a simple, “I like you too” or something more energetic like, “Wow! I really like you too!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Memes can help when you can't find the right words.",
      "content": "Memes can help when you can't find the right words. Not sure how to say, \"I'm so excited I think I'm going to burst like a balloon?\" Well, there's probably a meme or gif that can say it for you. You could even make your own! [7] X Research source Just keep in mind that if you send a gif as a response, you'll probably still need to follow up with a message. You might send a gif of a cat with flashing heart eyes, or you could send a clip of Bashful, the shy dwarf from Snow White. Then, follow up with a simple, \"I like you too!\" Emojis can work, too, but gifs are more expressive. It's probably best not to send a gif to tell her you don't like her—it might seem callous and unkind."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about how you really feel before you respond.",
      "content": "Think about how you really feel before you respond. If you feel conflicted, or you’re surprised by her telling you that she likes you and you need some time to come up with a response, that’s totally okay. Be honest with her. That way, you don’t leave her hanging with no response at all. [8] X Research source Keep it simple. Something like, “Hey, I need a moment to think about this.” It may not be the response she wanted, but it’s better that you respond honestly. If you need some time to figure out how you feel, take it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Being honest is always a good practice.",
      "content": "Being honest is always a good practice. Even if it may make you feel uncomfortable, she deserves to know the truth. Just be gentle and kind and tell her that so she doesn’t have false hope. You could say something firm but considerate like, “I think you’re really great, but I like you as a friend.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tease her by pretending that you misunderstood her message.",
      "content": "Tease her by pretending that you misunderstood her message. It’ll frustrate her and bring in a little tension into the conversation. It could cause her to chase after you even harder. [9] X Research source For instance, if she says, “I like you,” you could say, “Thanks, I like me too” or “You like to do what to me?” A little playful flirting never hurt anybody, and it could make her like you more!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t assume anything if she doesn’t immediately text back.",
      "content": "Don’t assume anything if she doesn’t immediately text back. After you reply to her, whether you tell her that you like her too or you text something else, be patient while she considers her response. It may take her some time to process what you texted. Let her take her time and reply when she’s ready. [10] X Research source For example, if you say, “I like you too!” And 5 minutes later she hasn’t texted anything, don’t follow up with a question mark or something like, “well?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay confident and positive to keep her interested.",
      "content": "Stay confident and positive to keep her interested. She just told you she likes you! Whatever you respond with, keep up your confident energy through the rest of the conversation. Believe in yourself and she’ll be even more attracted to you and confident in her decision to tell you how she feels. [11] X Research source For example, don’t say things like, “Do you really like me?” or “Are you sure you like me?”"
