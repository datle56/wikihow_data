      "title": "Pay attention to recurrent appearances of a particular animal in your life.",
      "content": "Pay attention to recurrent appearances of a particular animal in your life. Have you ever had a day or week when the same animal symbol seemed to keep coming to the fore? Perhaps you saw a mural of a wolf painted on the side of a building, and later that day, you looked down to see a wolf tattoo on a woman's ankle in the coffee shop. [1] X Research source The recurrence of animal symbols can mean your spirit animal is trying to get in touch. Consider any animals that were important to you as a child. For example, maybe you had a beloved pet hamster or have a vivid childhood memory of seeing a fox in the woods."

      "content": "Take note of animals in your dreams. Spirit animals often appear to people at night in their dreams when the mind is at rest, and the subconscious is at work. If you tend to dismiss or forget your dreams, make a point of paying more attention and taking note of the animals you encounter. [2] X Research source Write down your dreams and pay attention to patterns over time. What message do the animals seem to be communicating? Keep an open mind and try to interpret them. Sometimes, the appearance of a spirit animal is not straightforward. You may dream of an animal in a painting on the wall or a conversation in which the other person mentions a certain animal. All references to animals are worth noting. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Be attentive to animals with unusual behavior. Many have reported encountering their spirit animal in physical form.

      "title": "Meditate and pray.",
      "content": "Meditate and pray. Finding your spirit animal is a spiritual and supernatural exercise. Perform a meditation or prayer session during which you concentrate on being open to communications from your spirit animal. [6] X Research source Meditate in a natural place like a meadow, beach, or park. Remember that this has to be a mutual connection; you cannot \"conjure\" the spirit animal at will. You gain the most by being open to all possibilities. If you want a concrete answer to a yes or no question, you probably will not find that in a spirit animal. It is not about getting what you want; it is about forging a deeper connection to nature, which will eventually lead you down the right path. If your meditations and prayers seem fruitless, do not force it. Try again during a different season or when your mind is in a different state. In the meantime, work on being more open and spiritually aware by spending even more time out with Mother Nature."

      "content": "Spend time in nature. The Earth is populated by innumerable animal species that all have something to teach us. If you are lucky enough to have a pet, you interact with animals often. But many people spend almost all of their time with other humans. Making the natural world a bigger part of your life opens you to the possibility of connecting with a spirit animal. Don't go out searching for a spirit animal—just be open to learning more about all non-human creatures. Look for inventive ways to spend more time in nature. If you don't live near the wilderness, go to a state or national park or a city park. When you spend time outside, remove your headphones and cut out any distractions. Become aware of your surroundings and notice things you might usually overlook: a bird peeking out of a bush or a caterpillar walking across the sidewalk. When time does not permit a long trek outside, make your inside space more open to the natural world. Turn off the air conditioner. Open the blinds and the windows. Listen to the wind and the crickets instead of playing music."

      "content": "Learn about your animal. Once you have identified your animal, learn everything you can about it. What does it eat, and where does it live? Read about its history, behaviors, and the way it is portrayed in literature and the media. What does this animal represent? If possible, spend time near your animal's habitat. Don't be disruptive, but try to learn as much as you can about how the animal exists in the wild."

      "content": "Incorporate your spirit animal into your daily life. If your spirit animal has been domesticated by humans, such as a cat or snake, adopt it as a pet. If it’s unrealistic or impossible to adopt your spirit animal, bring it into your home in a different way. Purchase a piece of artwork that depicts your animal, like a painting or statuette. [8] X Research source Many people also look for jewelry or charms that represent their animal spirit guide. Once you have a physical representation of your spirit animal in your home, speak to it as if it’s your close friend. This action may feel odd at first, but it will feel more natural over time and can help you better connect with your spirit animal."

      "content": "Be open to messages. Pay close attention each time your animal appears to you in any form. Do your best to interpret the messages the animal seems to be sending. [10] X Research source Remember, the messages will not be straightforward since animals do not communicate the same way humans do, so you will have to do some deep thinking to understand. Here are some questions to ask yourself: What emotions do you feel when the animal comes? Does the animal seem to be a sign of foreboding or comfort? Does the animal seem to be leading you in a certain direction?"

      "title": "Recognize the wisdom and intelligence of all animals.",
      "content": "Recognize the wisdom and intelligence of all animals. Spending more time in nature, especially around animals, will help you start to think of them differently. Notice their habits, how they communicate with one another, and the elements of their behavior that surprise you. Animals have intelligence of their own, different from but equal to that of humans. If that is difficult or impossible for you to see, it will be hard to find your spirit animal. Think about what type of intelligence different animals have. Migratory birds, for example, can fly thousands of miles to a pre-planned destination without a map. Do not anthropomorphize animals. They are not human, so do not expect them to express themselves the same way. It is important to respect animals for who they are rather than assuming they will communicate on your terms."

      "content": "Animals are sacred and honored spirits in Native American culture. Many indigenous tribes of North America use animals to represent their spiritual values and beliefs. Animals are an important part of Native creation stories, clan stories, and spiritual practices. However, the animals worshiped in Native American culture are not referred to as “spirit animals,” and the steps in this article are not authentic to indigenous practices. [11] X Research source Avoid using the term “spirit animal” in relation to Native traditions, as this trivializes the sacred relationship between indigenous tribes and the animal world. To avoid further cultural appropriation, refrain from referring to your spirit animal as a “totem” or copying images from sacred Native imagery, such as totem poles or pictographs. If you’d like to show respect to the animal world in the same way that Native Americans have throughout history, take steps to help the environment . Advocate for wild animals and the protection of their natural habitats."

They are believed to be divine creatures that were once part of the animal kingdom but now exist in the spiritual realm. In this modern-day interpretation of spirit animals, people typically pick animals that they feel reflect their personality, energy, and approach to life. [12] X Research source They may look to their spirit animal as a source of inspiration and guidance during difficult moments. For example, if someone is facing a crossroads in life and chooses one path over another, seeing their spirit animal shortly afterward may reassure them that they’re on the right track.
