      "content": "A job acceptance email or letter When you are offered a new job or you’re the one who just made the offer, it’s important to show enthusiasm for your upcoming addition to the company. This phrase is a common way to close an email or letter with a new employer or employee; in fact, you can even say this at the end of a phone call in the same scenario. Depending on the company and the overall vibe the other person gives off, you can choose to say this in a more formal manner by putting “I’m” or “we’re” at the beginning. Some examples include: Formal: “Thank you for your formal offering of the position. I am pleased to accept the role, and I’m looking forward to working with you.” Less formal: “I am thrilled to be given the opportunity of joining the team—looking forward to working with you!” Formal: “We’re so pleased you have decided to accept our offer for this position. We are looking forward to working with you.” Less formal: “We think you’ll make a great addition to the team. Looking forward to working with you!”"

      "content": "A new collaboration Whether it’s in the office or through an entrepreneurial endeavor, expressing excitement over a collab is appropriate, too.

You could say, “Your past designs are just beautiful—I’m looking forward to working with you!” In an office or other employment setting, an appropriate time to say this would be when you are teamed up with a colleague for a project. For example: “Tim, your knowledge of graphs and charts is unmatched; I’m really looking forward to working on this with you.”"

      "content": "Match the tone to the rest of your message. If you’re using this phrase in an email that’s extremely formal and uses a lot of business verbiage, you wouldn’t want to use a casual take on this phrase. For example, saying, “Looking forward to working with you! :)” would not be a professional way to approach this email. On the other hand, if the hiring manager has been emailing you with an informal, friendly tone and including smiley faces, it’s completely fine to match their style."

      "content": "Switch up the wording. Depending on the tone and expressions you’re using in the rest of the conversation, consider swapping out or replacing the words in this phrase for ones that are similar, but more fitting. For instance, saying, “I am looking forward to working with you” gives off a much more formal tone than “looking forward to working with you.” Adding in that simple “I am” can make a world of difference, and the key here is to gauge who you’re communicating with."
