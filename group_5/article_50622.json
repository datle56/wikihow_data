      "content": "Geminis are talkative and they love talking about themselves. You'll catch his interest if you ask thoughtful questions that show you're interested in him. If you already know him, you can ask more deeply personal questions. If he asks you lots of questions, it's a very good sign that he's interested in you. For instance, if you don't know him well, ask, \"So, what was the best thing that happened to you today?\" or \"What motivates you?\" If you know him pretty well, you could ask, \"Who are you closest to in your family?\" or, \"What relationships do you value the most?\""

      "content": "The color green appeals to Gemini qualities of creativity and growth. Virgos tend to reach for earthy shades of green, so finding something to wear shouldn't be a problem for you! Choose outfits that are modern and stylish since Geminis notice what's currently in fashion. [4] X Research source If your style never seems to change, check out the latest trends, so you can catch his eye. For example, swap out your usual blouse with slacks for an oversized green blazer, a skirt, and a fun floral top. As a Virgo, you're probably not into wearing bold red outfits very often, but definitely avoid wearing them around your guy. Red can make a Gemini feel restless or agitated."

      "content": "Geminis are known for their cool laid-back attitudes. Unfortunately, Virgos are often seen as particular—even a little controlling. To catch his interest, you'll have to show him that you can be fun and joyful. Try to go with the flow! [5] X Research source For instance, as a Virgo, you might feel like you need to plan every aspect of a date, down to the hour. Instead of doing this, just meet up and see where the evening takes you. Not sure what to do on a date? Put him in charge! Make a point of saying yes and go along for the ride. For example, he might take you dancing, to a cool new museum, or to a hip new food cart."

      "title": "Your Gemini man is constantly looking for new experiences.",
      "content": "Your Gemini man is constantly looking for new experiences. If you're routine-driven like most Virgos, this might make you feel uncomfortable. To keep your guy's attention, make a point of saying yes when he invites you to do fun new things that you've never done before. This shows him that you're adventurous and lighthearted. For example, if he's outdoorsy, he might offer to take you camping or out for a ride on his boat. Before you can second-guess yourself, just say yes! He might want to do something like take a martial arts class or pottery class for instance. Don't stress about committing to it for the long term—say yes and try at least a class or two. You might be pleasantly surprised."

      "title": "Act mysterious to appeal to your Gemini's sense of curiosity.",
      "content": "Act mysterious to appeal to your Gemini's sense of curiosity. Virgos are often portrayed as very grounded and practical, so he might make the mistake that he knows exactly who you are. Prove him wrong by letting him see that you can be wild, spontaneous, goofy, or unpredictable. You'll keep him guessing and he'll love it! To keep up your air of mystery, don't reveal all your secrets at once. He'll see getting to know you as a challenge that he wants to undertake. For example, you might be really sweet and affectionate one night and challenging or flirty the next. Keep him on his toes to catch his attention."

      "content": "Geminis are drawn to people who care deeply about something. He needs to see that you're excited and emotionally invested in something, especially if it requires learning or something intellectual. Geminis are drawn to people who are always thinking or questioning. For instance, tell him your goals, dreams, and plans. He'll probably be super impressed and supportive if you tell him that you're studying to get your dream job. Show him what you're working on whether it's a painting, something you're growing, or a story you're writing."

      "title": "Geminis like to be surprised, so show him that you can be unpredictable.",
      "content": "Geminis like to be surprised, so show him that you can be unpredictable. Virgos are known for their steady ways, but you can still show your Gemini guy a thing or two! Call him up and ask him to see a concert at the last minute or surprise him with tickets for laser tag for instance. If you're planning a date, don't take him out to just one place like dinner, drinks, or a movie. Instead, think of multiple places to go so he doesn't get bored. You might start with coffee at a cafe, play disc golf at a park, grab dinner from a food cart, and finish at a club for music and drinks. Ask him about things he's always wanted to do. Then, surprise him by suggesting that you two try a thing or two from his list."

      "title": "Accept that your Gemini man can be indecisive or flighty.",
      "content": "Accept that your Gemini man can be indecisive or flighty. Remind yourself that he's an air sign so he's not as grounded as you. To keep him interested, don't criticize or nag him. It might help you to see things from his perspective. Try to loosen up and enjoy just being around each other. The great thing about being with a Gemini is that he can challenge you to live in the moment. If you're starting to feel stressed out, take a deep breath and remind yourself to go with the flow. Give yourself permission to have fun!"

      "content": "Geminis love their independence, so trust him to be on his own. A Gemini man will probably feel stifled if you always want to spend time with him. This might be hard for you since Virgos are homebodies. To make him feel truly comfortable with you, you've got to have your own personal time. He'll love the freedom he has to socialize with other people in his life. Give him even more space than you think he needs. He'll notice that you're aware of his needs and he'll appreciate you even more! For instance, tell him, \"Sorry, I can't hang out tonight. Why don't we meet up tomorrow?\" You'll pique his interest and you'll actually get him to chase you."
