      "title": "Use a makeup remover designed for waterproof makeup.",
      "content": "Use a makeup remover designed for waterproof makeup. Dab the cleaner onto the dye stain with a cotton ball or pad—or use a color remover wipe, if you have one. [1] X Expert Source Angela Justice Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 5 November 2021. Wait about 5 minutes for the dye to dissolve, then rinse the whole area with clean water. [2] X Research source Waterproof makeup removers are usually stronger than the ones used for regular makeup, so they may be strong enough to break up dried hair dye. [3] X Research source These cleansers are gentle enough to use on any area or skin type. Because this is a gentle cleanser, it will probably work best on semi-permanent or light-colored dye, as opposed to bold or dark permanent colors."

      "title": "Oil can help dissolve the old dye.",
      "content": "Oil can help dissolve the old dye. Generously massage the stain with an oil of your choice. Let the oil sit as long as possible—a few hours is good, but overnight is even better. Then, wash the oil and dye away with soap and warm water. [4] X Research source Baby oil, coconut oil, and olive oil are all popular, but you could use anything from almond or jojoba oils to regular vegetable oil if that's all you have. If you'll be leaving the oil on overnight, you might want to cover the area with a bandage or some plastic wrap so you don't get oily dye on your bedsheets. [5] X Research source This will also probably work best on lighter or semi-permanent dyes."

      "title": "Opt for a non-gel toothpaste with baking soda.",
      "content": "Opt for a non-gel toothpaste with baking soda. Rub it into the stain with your fingers, a soft washcloth, or even a clean, soft-bristled toothbrush. Keep rubbing for about 30-60 seconds, wait about 5 minutes, then wash the area with warm water. [6] X Research source This approach can be a little abrasive, so you may want to skip it if you have sensitive skin. The grit in toothpaste can sometimes help it remove more stubborn or dark hair dye stains."

      "title": "Believe it or not, adding more hair dye may help.",
      "content": "Believe it or not, adding more hair dye may help. If you have leftover dye, apply it to a cotton ball and dab it onto the dried dye on your skin. This could reactivate the previous dye, making it easier to rinse off. Rub the fresh dye into the area in a circular motion, then immediately wash it away with soap and water. [7] X Research source If you let it sit too long, it could make the stain worse. [8] X Research source Since you won't be leaving the dye on very long, this is typically gentle enough to work on your face, ears, neck, and hands. However, if the dried dye is irritating your skin, it's probably best to use another approach for removing it. If you're applying the leftover dye around your hairline, wear gloves so you don't stain your hands!"

If you're trying to remove a dark or brightly colored dye stain, try this."

      "title": "Alcohol is great for breaking up tough dye stains.",
      "content": "Alcohol is great for breaking up tough dye stains. Dip a cotton ball in regular isopropyl alcohol, or use an alcohol pad if you prefer. Dab that gently onto the dry hair dye—some of the dye should transfer to the cotton ball. When you're finished, rinse the area with fresh water. [11] X Research source This can be a little drying or even irritating, so don't scrub your skin with the alcohol. Also, if your skin is naturally dry or sensitive, don't use alcohol on your face. If you do use alcohol on your face, be careful not to get it into your eyes. For more cleaning power, add a drop of dish soap to the cotton ball and work it into a lather before you wipe it onto your skin.

      "content": "Scrub dye off of your hands with this paste. In a small bowl, mix together equal parts of liquid dish soap and baking soda until they create a thick paste. Dip a cotton ball in the paste and rub it into the dried hair dye stain in small circles. As you scrub, the dye should start to break up and transfer to the cotton ball. When you're finished, just wash away the paste with warm water. [15] X Research source This gritty exfoliant can be harsh on your skin, so it's probably best to only use on your hands or the back of your neck, rather than your hairline, face, or ears. If you do use it on a more sensitive area, scrub very gently, and stop if you feel like your skin is getting inflamed or irritated."
