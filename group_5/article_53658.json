      "content": "Draw in the eyes, as seen in the image. These are in a sort of anime style, as they are much easier then drawing actual cat eyes. They also make the cat look much more cute."

      "content": "Add in the facial features such as the nose, mouth, whiskers, and color in the eyes black. Be creative! Maybe add little fangs to the mouth, or a fishtail? Or how about squiggly whiskers if you were drawing a tough cat or an alley cat?"

      "title": "Draw a collar, a body and legs.",
      "content": "Draw a collar, a body and legs. Once again, creativity is the key. Especially the collar. A tough kitty could have skulls and fish bones. A sweet kitty could have flowers and hearts. Finally, a fancy kitty could have lots and lots of diamonds!"

      "title": "Add the tail, back legs and more detail to the paws.",
      "content": "Add the tail, back legs and more detail to the paws. You could make the tail scruffy to give it an \"alley cat\" look or fluffy, as if it were a \"fancy kitty\"."

      "content": "Add color and you are done! But you don't have to be. Draw a garden in the background or a simple food bowl, or whatever you can think of."
