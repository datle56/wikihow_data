      "content": "Get a rekeying kit. Also called pinning kits, rekeying kits are available at most hardware stores and home centers, as well as online. Kits are available for most lock brands and come equipped to do multiple locks, but frequently work for only locks of the same brand. [1] X Research source Some kits include only lock pins, while others include special tools (cylinder follower, ring remover, plug follower) to remove the lock cylinder so you can replace the lock pins. You can order extra pins if you have more locks to re-key than the kit has pins for. If you have any old locks that are too corroded to keep, take the pins out and keep them before you throw the lock away."

      "content": "Take out the cylinder plug. Insert the key for the current lock into the cylinder and turn it to separate the upper and lower lock pins. Push the plug follower through the cylinder, using constant pressure to remove the plug. Keeping constant pressure will keep the upper lock pins and their retaining springs in place when you remove the cylinder plug. If you should let the springs fall out, you can still pick them up and reinsert them but you will need tweezers to put the springs and pins back in."

You'll need either a tweezers or small needle-nosed pliers to grip the pins and insert them. The new pins should align with the key when it is inserted in the lock. If the pins are not coded, you'll have to use trial and error, inserting and withdrawing the key to make sure it fits the lock with the new pins installed."
