      "title": "This can ground you in reality and snap you out of thinking about a dream.",
      "content": "This can ground you in reality and snap you out of thinking about a dream. Get out of bed and drink a glass of water in the kitchen or open your curtains and blinds and look outside for a while. Try to think about other stuff until you feel ready to go back to bed. [1] X Research source You could also read a book or listen to music in bed to distract your mind with something else until you get sleepy again. Whatever takes your mind off the nightmare is great!"

    {
      "title": "This can help you process and get over the dream.",
      "content": "This can help you process and get over the dream. Write down everything you can remember about the dream to face it head on and take its “power” over you away. Then, imagine an alternate ending that makes the dream less scary and disturbing. Any time you think about the nightmare, think about it with the alternate ending you created. [2] X Research source Sometimes a particularly fantastical or even humorous new ending can really take the power away from a nasty nightmare. It might take a while to totally forget the bad dream, but just keep rehearsing the imagined version in your mind until the intensity of the original dream decreases and it doesn’t bother you anymore."
    },
    {
      "title": "This is another way to take its “power” away.",
      "content": "This is another way to take its “power” away. Grab a piece of paper and something to draw or paint with. Sketch or paint whatever you remember from the dream or whatever was most scary to you about the dream. You might even laugh at the nightmare when you see the finished product! [3] X Research source After you’re finished with the picture, try tearing it up and throwing it away to symbolically get rid of the nightmare."

      "title": "Mindfulness is all about being in the present and can help you forget bad dreams.",
      "content": "Mindfulness is all about being in the present and can help you forget bad dreams. Try tightening all your muscles for a few seconds, then let go. Pay attention to how each muscle becomes soft and relaxed. Start with your toes and work your way up your body until you reach your face. Focus on how each muscle feels to take your mind of your nightmare. [4] X Research source You can also try breathing exercises. Simply focus on your breathing and how each breath feels when you inhale and exhale. Breathe slowly and deeply in and out and try to push thoughts about anything other than your breathing out of your mind. Try sitting meditation for another mindfulness exercise. Just sit somewhere comfortable with you back straight and your feet flat on the ground. Put your hands in your lap and breathe through your nose. Focus on each breath and how it feels going in and out."

      "title": "This can help you get back to sleep after a bad dream.",
      "content": "This can help you get back to sleep after a bad dream. Imagine that there’s a protective barrier around your room or around your bed and whatever happened in the dream can’t get past that. Picture yourself having a restful night’s sleep inside that barrier until you drift off again. [5] X Research source Another visualization exercise you can try is imagining yourself locking your bad dream away in a box. Then, imagine the box being transported far, far away out to sea and dropped into the water. Picture it sinking down all the way to the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean where it can’t escape from to come bother you!"

      "title": "It’s okay to ask for help to get back to sleep.",
      "content": "It’s okay to ask for help to get back to sleep. Wake your partner up and tell them you just had a bad dream. Talk to them about the dream and cuddle with them to comfort yourself and forget about it while you fall back asleep. You’re partner is there for you, so they won’t mind being woken up when you need some comforting! [6] X Research source If you don’t sleep with a partner, but you have a cool roommate who you feel comfortable waking up in the middle of the night, that’s an alternative."

      "title": "This can make you feel like a bad dream has less control over you.",
      "content": "This can make you feel like a bad dream has less control over you. Sit down with a trusted friend, family member, or counsellor and tell them about your dream. Tell them everything you remember about the dream and explain why it’s bothering you so much. Sometimes letting it all out by talking instead of keeping it in your mind helps you move past a bad dream. [7] X Research source If you’re having bad dreams about something that happened to you, consider seeing a therapist to talk with a professional about your dreams and the issue behind them."

      "content": "Recurring nightmares are often caused by external stressors. Think about whether something at work, school, or in your personal life is causing you anxiety that might be why you’re having bad dreams. Try to resolve any issues you can think of to stop having so many nightmares. [8] X Research source For example, maybe you’re stressed about starting a new job or moving to a new school. Try talking about your worries with someone you trust or journal about the things you're going through—if you can work through them while you're awake, you might not dream about them at night.

If you had a bad day, try your best to push negative thoughts out of your head before you go to sleep.
