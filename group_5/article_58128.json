      "title": "“Package Acceptance Pending” means USPS received the package, but hasn't sorted it.",
      "content": "“Package Acceptance Pending” means USPS received the package, but hasn't sorted it. This is a common occurrence when shipping packages with USPS. If you check your package’s shipping status and it says “Package Acceptance Pending,” it means that the package was taken by USPS but is waiting to be shipped out. This status update is typically the first one you’ll get after sending out a package as the sender. The status will change to “Accepted” once the package is sorted and scanned by a USPS facility and shipped out. [1] X Research source You may see this status if your package arrived in a larger bundle of mail, but hasn't been scanned or entered into the tracking system individually yet."

      "content": "In most cases, your package will still arrive on time. It's not uncommon for a package or piece of mail to get physically distributed, even if it hasn't been scanned individually by USPS yet. This means it may be well on its way to delivery, even with the \"package acceptance pending\" status. Monitor your package's tracking status for updates and contact USPS Customer Service if the status hasn't updated after 2 days. If you're worried about valuable or important outgoing mail going missing or getting damaged, consider purchasing shipping insurance. [2] X Research source"
