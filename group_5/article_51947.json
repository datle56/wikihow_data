      "content": "Your Chiron sign reveals your core wounds and is the key to healing them. Chiron is a comet with a distinct orbit, and its placement at the time of your birth determines what zodiac sign your Chiron falls under. Chiron uncovers the most profound spiritual wounds that take root and affect your life, but ultimately it's a hopeful sign: it also shows the efforts you can make to heal those wounds over time. [1] X Research source Chiron is named for a centaur in Greek mythology who was a powerful healer and teacher but could not heal himself. Because Chiron is a sign of healing, the wounds and fears it depicts aren't only your weak points. If you master those fears, you can be a guide for others and help them do the same."

      "content": "They feel like a failure despite their lofty goals. To the outside eye, it might seem like a Chiron in Capricorn is simply motivated and hardworking. However, the truth is that this sign's work ethic results from the pain they carry inside them.

Capricorn is the most ambitious zodiac sign. That's why Chiron in Capricorn's fear of failure is so great—they dread being unable to fulfill their many ambitions."

      "title": "Some Chiron in Capricorn wounds develop as early as childhood.",
      "content": "Some Chiron in Capricorn wounds develop as early as childhood. It's common for wounds to manifest in childhood because children feel like the adults around them don't notice or appreciate their ideas. Children often feel like their voice doesn't carry weight, or the adults around them disregard everything they say, which can cause a wound to develop for Chiron in Capricorn. Since Chiron in Capricorn is the wound of recognition and achievement, their greatest wounds arise when these achievements aren't acknowledged. Do you dream of praise and recognition but feel like you never seem to get it? Or do you ever feel invisible, like you're fading into the background? That could be your Chiron wound."

      "title": "Chiron wounds can also come from a past life.",
      "content": "Chiron wounds can also come from a past life. Astrologists believe that if one of your past lives had a strong desire to be successful or noticed, then that wound can also be passed on to you today. However, the wound has to be strong for it to transcend lives—so if your need for recognition comes from a past life, it was probably a matter of life or death. For example, you might have an ancestor who was ostracized by their village (or even killed) for being a misfit. Due to the impact of that experience in your past life, the underlying need for acceptance might pass to you."

      "content": "The Chiron scar reveals that this sign craves respect above all else. In astrology, a Chiron's \"scar tissue\" indicates an aspect of life that remains tender and can bring suffering when provoked. For Chiron in Capricorn, that tender spot is their wish to feel respected. The root of Chiron in Capricorn's ambition, drive for success, perfectionism, and need for praise is that yearning for true respect."
