Lumber dimensions refer to the unfinished boards, so 1-by-3-inch lumber actually measures 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) (19 mm) by 2-1/2 inches (64 mm). And, 1-by-4-inch lumber actually measures 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) (19 mm) by 3-1/2 inches (89 mm). If you're using 1-by-3-inch lumber, the stiles should be cut to 91 inches (230 cm) (2.31 m); if using 1-by-4-inch lumber, cut the stiles to 89 inches (230 cm) (2.26 m)."
