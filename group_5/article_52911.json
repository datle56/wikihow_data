Using a sharp, long chef’s knife, cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the bottom of the lettuce to remove the white core. [1] X Research source Alternatively, wash the lettuce after you cut it into wedges. For a more precise coring, use a paring knife to cut a circle around the stem and then pull the core out. Or, smack the stalk against your countertop so it detaches from the head of lettuce. Then, simply pull it out with your hand. [2] X Research source However, this may cause the leaves to bruise. Throw the core away, or compost it ."
