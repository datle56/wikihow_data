      "content": "The abbreviation “S4S” stands for “Shoutout for Shoutout.” On Instagram, “S4S” is a popular way to grow your account. Two users agree to give each other a “shoutout,” or a photo (or video) of the other person’s account that encourages their followers to follow them. If both users have highly engaged followers, it’s an effective strategy to boost their exposure and gain followers quickly. [1] X Research source People usually put their email address in their Instagram profile so other users can contact them for shoutout. Otherwise, they discuss the details via direct message or through the “Contact” button at the top of their profile. Sometimes, users will only agree to shoutout another account if they have a similar number of followers. For example, a popular account with 25,000 followers might put “S4S 25k+” to let others know that they only accept requests from those that have at least 25,000 followers."

So, look for accounts that post similar content as you and have a similar number of followers. If you have 10,000 followers, you’re more likely to get a response if you request a shoutout from users that have between 9,000-12,000 followers. [2] X Research source Know your audience. Users that already follow a fitness account, for instance, are more likely to follow you if you post workout-related content (rather than food or fashion)."

Once you find an account you want to promote yourself on, message the owner and ask them if they’d be interested in a “S4S.” You might want to send them a photo or video that they can use, along with a description of what they can say to promote you. That way, they don’t have to do any work besides post your content. [3] X Research source For example, you could message someone and say, “Hey! I just stumbled upon your account, and I noticed we have a similar theme and a similar number of followers. Would you be interested in a S4S to grow your account?”"
