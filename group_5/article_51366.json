Before you use the transfer rate equation, ensure you are using the same units for the size and speed. Don’t worry about the time units for now. [2] X Research source 8 bits (b) = 1 byte (B); turn bits into bytes by dividing by 8, or convert bytes to bits by multiplying by 8. 1,024 bytes = 1 Kilobyte (KB); convert bytes to Kilobytes by dividing by 1,024 or turn Kilobytes into bytes by multiplying by 1,024. 1,024 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte (MB); change Kilobytes into Megabytes by dividing by 1024 or convert Megabytes into Kilobytes by multiplying by 1,024. 1,024 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte (GB); convert Megabytes into Gigabytes by dividing by 1024 or turn Gigabytes into Megabytes by multiplying by 1,024. 1,024 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte (TB); change Gigabytes into Terabytes by dividing by 1024 or convert Terabytes into Gigabytes by multiplying by 1,024."

To convert from minutes to hours, divide by 60. To convert from hours to minutes, multiply by 60. To convert from minutes to seconds, multiply by 60. [3] X Research source To convert from seconds to hours, divide by 3,600 (60 x 60). Or, convert from hours to seconds by multiplying by 3,600. Generally, the speed is denoted in seconds. If you have very many seconds, though, such as for large files, you can convert to minutes or even hours."

      "content": "Calculate the transfer speed by dividing the amount of data by the transfer time. Plug the amount of data (A) and transfer time (T) to solve for the rate, or speed (S), into the equation S = A ÷ T. [4] X Research source For example, you might have transferred 25 MB in 2 minutes. First, convert 2 minutes to seconds by multiplying 2 by 60, which is 120. So, S = 25 MB ÷ 120 seconds. 25 ÷ 120 = 0.208. Therefore, the transfer speed is 0.208 MB/s. If you want to turn this into Kilobytes, multiply 0.208 by 1024. 0.208 x 1024 = 212.9. So, the transfer speed is also equal to 212.9 KB/s."

      "content": "Divide the amount of data by the transfer speed to find the transfer time. If you want to solve for the transfer time (T) instead, input the amount of data (A) and the rate or speed (S) of transfer into the equation T = A ÷ S. [5] X Research source For instance, say you transferred 134 GB at a rate of 7 MB/s. First, convert GB to MB so you’re working with the same units in each part of the equation. 134 x 1,024 = 137,217. So, you transferred 137,217 MB at a rate of 7 MB/s. To solve for T, divide 137,217 by 7, which is 19,602. Therefore, it took 19,602 seconds. To convert this to hours, divide by 3,600, which is 5.445. In other words, it took 5.445 hours to transfer 134 GB at a rate of 7 MB/s. If you want to use hours and minutes, separate out the whole number and decimal: you have 5 hours and 0.445 hours. To convert 0.445 hours to minutes, multiply by 60. 0.445 x 60 = 26.7. To convert the decimal into seconds, multiply it by 60. 0.7 x 60 = 42. Altogether, it took 5 hours, 26 minutes, and 42 seconds."

      "title": "Multiply the transfer time by the transfer speed to find the amount of data transferred.",
      "content": "Multiply the transfer time by the transfer speed to find the amount of data transferred. To figure out how much data was transferred, use the equation A = T x S, in which A is the amount of data, T is the transfer time, and S is the speed or rate of transfer. [6] X Research source For example, you can figure out how much data was transferred in 1.5 hours at a rate of 200 bps. First, convert hours to seconds by multiplying by 1.5 by 3,600, which is 5,400. So, A = 5,400 seconds x 200 bps. A = 1,080,000 bps. To convert to bytes, divide by 8. 1,080,000 ÷ 8 = 135,000. To convert to Kilobytes, divide by 1,024. 135,000 ÷ 1,024 = 131.84. Therefore, 131.84 KB of data was transferred in 1.5 hours at a rate of 200 bps."
