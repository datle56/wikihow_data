They may put on a show of acting like your friend, but subtle body language cues, insensitive comments, or unkind actions hint that their true feelings for you are negative. [1] X Research source Here are a few examples of what this might look like: A coworker who acts outwardly polite but makes subtly offensive comments, such as, “You’re so lucky the boss didn’t ask you to be on this big project. I’m so busy right now!” A friend who seems supportive, but then does things to steal your thunder, like throwing a party on the same night as you, or always buying the same clothing as you."

Maybe they’re laughing less at your jokes, their smile looks forced, or their tone of voice has lost its warmth. All of these things could be signs that they’re hiding more complicated feelings toward you. Another key example would be a lack of celebration for your successes. If they act dismissive or even annoyed when you achieve something, rather than cheering you on, this could be a sign of secret animosity. [7] X Research source"

[15] X Research source If they’re still stewing over an unresolved disagreement, they’ll be able to air out their feelings and maybe get some release. Or, if they’re struggling with feelings of jealousy toward you, this gives them a chance to be vulnerable and open up about it, which can do wonders! You might be tempted to wait things out in the hopes that the other person’s hostile feelings will pass, and this does happen sometimes. Other times, however, the tensions keep brewing until they bubble over and cause a big argument. Because of this, it’s often a good idea to approach them about the issue.
