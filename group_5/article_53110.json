If you are short, lean side on with one arm up leaning and stretching. Count to three seconds and then jump to block the shot. If you are tall, stretch both legs and arms while positioning your feet towards the attacker; make sure you do not touch the ball. As this will result in obstruction of play. While the other circle defender it marking the shot, the other should be prepared to retrieve the rebounds."
