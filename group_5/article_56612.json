These are two safety sensors next to your garage door on both sides, located inside your garage near the bottom of the door. Make sure no objects or obstructions are blocking the line of sight between the two sensors. Both sensors have a green LED that indicates a clear line of sight. If the green LED is not on or is flashing, there is an issue with the LED sensors."
