      "content": "Next you need to check whether or not you have the required slot open. There are like 6 different slots you can come across. Usually, the types are listed somewhere near the slots. The slots are the plastic bar-like looking things on the motherboard. The slots you want are PCI slots. Usually, they have a beige color though they may vary a bit. They will always be close to the back of your computer and always facing the same direction. If any of them is free this means you can install a WiFi card. (Note: If you do not want to void the warranty read the tips first then continue to read the guide)."
