Check your charging accessories for damage, and try a different one if possible. You can also try a different charging source, such as a different wall outlet or USB port on your computer. If you have another Apple device that is working and uses the same charging cable as your phone, try plugging it into that device to see if the cable still works. If you normally use a wireless charger, try a wired charger instead to rule out a malfunction with the wireless charger.

      "content": "Check your charging port for debris and clean it if it's dirty. Using a flashlight if necessary, check your phone's charging port for debris, dirt, or lint. Use compressed air to gently clean out the charging port , spraying short bursts of air instead of one continuous stream. If the charging port is dirty it won't charge and thus your phone won't turn on once the battery is dead, even if you plug it in. If using compressed air make sure to hold the can completely straight, as holding it at an angle can release the coolant inside which can damage your phone."
