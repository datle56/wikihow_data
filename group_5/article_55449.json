      "content": "Position the acrylic print on the wall and make sure it's level. Before you can start installing the acrylic print with standoff bolts, decide where you'd like to place it on the wall. If the acrylic print is large, have someone help you. Position the acrylic print on the wall where you'd like it to be placed and use a level to make sure all of the sides are even. [1] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. [2] X Research source For large prints, have the second person hold the acrylic print up against the wall while you use the level, or vice versa."

      "content": "Mark the 4 pre-drilled holes using a pencil. When you order an acrylic print from a company, they should have drilled holes into the acrylic print in each of the corners for you. After the print is positioned on the wall, use a pencil to trace the edges of each pre-drilled hole so that you'll know where to place the anchors. You should end up with 4 circles on the wall. [3] X Research source If you're installing a large acrylic print, have one person hold the print up against the wall while you trace the holes. You can put the acrylic print down once you've finished tracing the holes."

      "content": "Drill the anchors into the wall where the circles are drawn. The circles that you outlined are where you'll place each anchor. Use a drill to drill in each anchor, making sure they're flush against the wall. If your acrylic print didn't come with anchors, you can purchase drywall anchors at a home improvement store or online. [4] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020.

      "content": "Unscrew the standoff bolt and slide the wall screw through the base. Standoff bolts come in 2 main pieces. Unscrew the standoff cover and set it down for safe keeping â€” this is the smaller of the 2 main pieces. Take the base of the standoff bolt, or the larger piece, and put a wall screw through it so that it's ready to be installed into the wall. [6] X Research source Standoff bolts should come with your acrylic print if you ordered this type of installment."

      "content": "Use a drill to attach the standoff bolt to the wall. Position the base of the standoff against the wall, right on top of the anchor. Using the wall screw that you slid through the base, drill the base into the wall. Make sure that it's nice and tight against the wall so that it can support the weight of the acrylic print. [7] X Research source Repeat this process with all of the other standoff bases, making sure they're all drilled into the wall snugly."

      "content": "Measure the distance from the top of the print to the wire, if desired. If you'd like to be as exact as possible in your placement of the acrylic print, you'll need to measure it beforehand. Use a tape measure or ruler to measure the distance from the top of the acrylic print to the wire. Pull up on the wire so that it resembles how it will when it's hanging. This will help you get a more accurate measurement. [11] X Research source If you plan on using 1 piece of hardware to hold up the print, pull upwards in the middle of the wire. If you plan on using 2 pieces of hardware, position 2 fingers where the hardware would be installed and pull up on the wire to help your measurement."

For example, hooks are best for lighter prints while nails and screws are good for heavier prints. Use a hammer, screwdriver, or drill to install the hardware into the wall securely.

You can either draw a light, horizontal line to indicate where hooks should go, or draw little dots for each individual hook. Use a level to make sure you'll be hanging the print evenly with the hooks. [17] X Research source How many hooks you have will depend on how large and heavy your print is.
