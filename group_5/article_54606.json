You can give every place setting the same color, or alternate between two colors for more variety. There are many variations of the Christmas tree fold. The classic pleated Christmas tree fold can lie flat or stand. This standing Christmas tree fold results in a 3-dimensional standing Christmas tree. [1] X Research source"

Drag it towards the lower left corner. As you drag it over, the top right edge of the rectangle will drop down to reveal a triangle on top of the rectangle. The top right edge of the rectangle will become the center crease of the triangle.

Be careful not to disrupt the other folds in the process. Try gently lifting the upper layer at the center seam to expose the corners of the napkin. Don't pull up on the corners as you take them out as that might displace the other folds.
