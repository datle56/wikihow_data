      "content": "“I adore you” is used to express strong feelings of admiration. This phrase can be used romantically or platonically to say, “Hey, I care deeply about you” or “I respect you.” [1] X Research source For instance, a friend may use the phrase after you do something silly in a joking manner, or a significant other may say it while you’re on a date. Overall, “I adore you” means someone cares deeply for you and wants to show their admiration or love. Pay close attention to the context in which “I adore you” is used. If your crush says it with a wink, they’re likely hitting on you. If a friend says it after you do them a favor, they’re probably just saying thanks. Take a look at these examples: In a romantic context: I adore you more than words could ever describe. You mean the world to me. I adore everything about you. Your kind heart. Your mesmerizing eyes. Everything. Sally, I adore you. Let’s never leave each other’s sides. In a platonic context: I’m so grateful to have you in my life—I adore you! Sam, you’re a gem! I adore you for this! I adore my sister. She means the world to me."
