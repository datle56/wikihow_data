      "title": "Get approximately 2 yards (1.8 m) of a 3 inches (7.6 cm) ribbon.",
      "content": "Get approximately 2 yards (1.8 m) of a 3 inches (7.6 cm) ribbon. Wide ribbon makes a great sash and eliminates the need to sew as much. 2 yards (1.8 m) is enough ribbon for most adults, but you may need to adjust depending on the size of the person. Measure the ribbon on the person by wrapping it from their hip to their opposite shoulder and back down to their hip. You can always trim the ribbon if it's too long, so it's better to have more than you need than not enough. Choose ribbon in the color and texture of your choice. [1] X Research source Opt for a thicker, matte type of ribbon to ensure that the iron-on letters will adhere to the ribbon."

    {
      "title": "Choose some decorative trim.",
      "content": "Choose some decorative trim. You can accent your sash with some fringe, lace , or another type of trim if desired. Make sure to get enough to cover the entire edge of your ribbon. [2] X Research source For example, if you have a 2 yards (1.8 m) long piece of ribbon, then you will need the same amount of trim to cover one edge of the ribbon, or twice as much trim to cover both edges. Try contrasting a red ribbon with some black fringe, or contrast a pink satin ribbon with some white lace."

      "title": "Select your iron-on letters.",
      "content": "Select your iron-on letters. You can find iron-on letters in craft supply stores. Choose letters in the style and color of your choice. Make sure that the letters are the iron-on type and that they will fit onto the ribbon you have chosen. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose some sequins, crystals, and other embellishments.",
      "content": "Choose some sequins, crystals, and other embellishments. To add some extra color and sparkle to the sash, you can also glue on some sequins, crystals, and/or beads. Choose embellishments that have a flat side if possible. This will make it easier to glue them onto the ribbon. Try adding light pink crystals to the edges of a dark pink beauty pageant sash. Add some red sequins to a black bachelorette sash. Enhance a white sash with contrasting baby accessory beads (rattles, bottles, booties, etc.) for a baby shower."

      "title": "Pin the trim to the ribbon.",
      "content": "Pin the trim to the ribbon. To accent your sash, pin the trim to one edge of the ribbon or to both edges if desired. Make sure that the edges of the ribbon and trim are overlapping by at least 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Place a pin through the ribbon and trim every 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) to secure them.

    {
      "title": "Sew the trim in place.",
      "content": "Sew the trim in place. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the edge of the trim to secure it to the ribbon. Make sure that you sew through the ribbon and the trim. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Position the letters on the ribbon.",
      "content": "Position the letters on the ribbon. Fold the ribbon in half so that the two ends are matching up and lay the ribbon on a flat surface. Then, begin placing the letters so that they are centered on this section of ribbon. Start and finish placing the letters about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 6 inches (150 mm) from the fold and the end of the section. Space letters out evenly as well. [6] X Research source If the word you want on the sash is a longer one, then place the first letter closer to the edge. For example, if you are making a \"Bachelorette\" sash, then start pinning the \"B\" about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge and space them evenly so that the \"E\" is also about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge."

      "content": "Iron the letters in place. Follow the instructions for the iron-on letters to iron them onto the ribbon. You may need to cover the letters with a towel or t-shirt to protect them from the heat. Apply even heat to all of the letters."

      "title": "Glue on any other embellishments.",
      "content": "Glue on any other embellishments. Apply a dab of fabric glue to the ribbon where you want to place a sequin , crystal, or bead. Then, press the embellishment into the glue. Repeat until you have attached all of the embellishments. Then, let the glue dry overnight. For example, if you are making a sash for a bridal shower, then you could glue on some wedding accessory embellishments, such as a wedding cake, wedding dress, or a bouquet."

      "content": "Pin the ends of the sash together. Before you secure the ends of the sash, try it on. Position the sash how you want to wear it and adjust the ends so that they meet near your hip. The ends should be overlapping at a slight angle. When you are happy with the fit, place a pin through the 2 ends to secure them. [7] X Research source"
