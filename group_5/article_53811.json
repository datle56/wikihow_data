      "content": "Purchase blue hair dye that is specifically designed for dark hair. The majority of hair dyes are designed to darken light or medium hair; however, there are a few types of blue hair dye that will work on dark hair. Check the package for phrases like \"midnight blue,\" \"designed for dark hair\" or \"lightens dark hair\" when you choose your dye. Look on the back of the packet for before and after pictures to ensure that you've chosen the right type of dye. [1] X Research source If you have dark hair, you will only be able to achieve a dark blue colour without using bleach. If you have dry or coloured hair, it's best to visit a hair salon in order to achieve a quality result. This type of dye won't lighten coloured hair or damaged evenly, so you won't be able to get a quality finish. Avoid using hair chalk or spray-in color, as this won't show up on dark hair."

      "title": "Brush your hair.",
      "content": "Brush your hair. Use a hairbrush or a wide-tooth comb to remove any knots from your hair. This makes it easier to spread the dye over your hair and helps to ensure that the strands are evenly coated with dye. If your hair is really knotty, use a detangling spray to help loosen the knots. Make sure your hair is pretty clean and free of product before you dye it. If you haven't washed your hair in the last 48 hours, it may be best to shampoo it with a small amount of shampoo, then dry it before you get started. However, don't scrub your scalp, as you want to leave some of your natural oils in place to protect it from the chemicals."

      "content": "Protect your clothes and your skin from dye stains. Dyeing your hair tends to be quite a messy process, which means that you are likely to get dye on your shirt. Wear an old shirt or wrap a towel around your shoulders to protect them from the dye. Spread a thin layer of petroleum jelly or coconut oil around your neck, hairline, and ears to prevent them from being stained blue. Wear disposable latex gloves to keep your hands clean. [2] X Research source Don't worry too much if dye gets on your skin, as it will fade after a few washes. Never wear your favourite shirt when dyeing your hair, as the colour is nearly impossible to remove from fabric. Apply the dye in an area that is easy to clean, such as on tiles."

      "title": "Mix the dye and the developer together in the provided bottle.",
      "content": "Mix the dye and the developer together in the provided bottle. Open the dye box and remove the bottles or sachets of dye and the developer. Read the instructions to combine the packets together. Ensure that the lid is securely on the bottle and then shake it for 5 seconds or as directed in the instructions. Mix the dye over the sink to avoid accidental spills. If a mixing bottle isn't supplied in the box, mix the dye and the developer in a disposable bowl with a plastic spoon. If you have long hair, it may be easier to mix and apply your dye using a bowl and brush. Most packets will come with a brush. If there isn't a brush provided, purchase one from a pharmacy or hair salon."

      "title": "Saturate every strand of hair with dye.",
      "content": "Saturate every strand of hair with dye. Use the tip of your bottle applicator to make parallel lines from your hairline at your forehead to the nape of your neck. Space your lines about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) apart. Then, massage your roots to distribute the colour. Finish coating your hair by making zig-zag lines through the length of your hair and massaging to distribute the colour. Try your best to ensure that each strand has an even coating of dye, as this will help the colour to look even. Start at the front of your head and slowly work your way to the back of your head. Also, be sure to wear gloves so the dye doesn't get on your hands while you're massaging it into your hair. If you're using a brush, paint the dye onto your roots with a downward stroke and then slowly work your way down to the ends of your hair. Try to apply your dye as quickly as possible to create an even result. However, make sure you fully saturate your hair. When you are brushing the dye onto the hair at the back of your head, use a mirror to help you see or ask a friend to help you."

      "title": "Leave the dye to process for the directed time.",
      "content": "Leave the dye to process for the directed time. Follow the processing instructions on the back of the box, as the soaking time varies between brands. The majority of box-dyes require about 45 minutes to process. Avoid leaving the dye to soak for longer than the directed time, as it can damage your hair. Similarly, don't rinse the dye out before the soaking time is up, as this can give your hair an uneven colour. Put a plastic shower cap over your hair to prevent the dye from dripping onto the floor. Set a timer to help you keep track of time."

      "title": "Place your head under the shower head to rinse out the dye.",
      "content": "Place your head under the shower head to rinse out the dye. Remove your shower cap and get into the shower. Run the shower to warm or room temperature and then allow the pressure of the water to push the excess dye out of your hair. Keep rinsing your hair until there is no more colour dripping out of your hair. Don't worry if you notice blue dye going down the drain, as that is just the excess dye that hasn't been absorbed into your hair. Avoid using hot water, as this can damage your hair."

      "title": "Wash your hair with a mild, color-safe shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash your hair with a mild, color-safe shampoo. Apply a small amount of shampoo to your palm, then scrub it into your hair to remove any dye residue. Then, rinse out the shampoo with cool water to lock the colour inside the strands of hair. The shampoo will also help re-balance your hair's pH. Sulfate- and sodium-chloride free shampoos are good products to consider."

      "title": "Use the conditioner from the dye box to condition your hair.",
      "content": "Use the conditioner from the dye box to condition your hair. Open the sachet or box of conditioner and smooth it over the ends of your hair. This helps to make your hair feel soft and brings out the blue colour of the dye. Leave the conditioner to soak into your hair for 2 minutes (or as directed on the packet) and then rinse it out. If your box of dye doesn't have a sachet of conditioner, use a colour-safe conditioner instead."

      "content": "Use makeup remover to help get rid of any dye stains on your skin. Wet a cotton pad with makeup remover and gently rub it back and forth over the dye stains. If the dye doesn't come off initially, try rubbing more vigorously. [3] X Research source If you don't have any makeup remover, try using coconut oil instead. If you have a lot of dye on your skin, you can try applying shampoo over the dye before you wet your hair. This may help prevent the dye from staining your skin. Dye stains tend to fade over a couple of days."

      "content": "Wait 48 hours before shampooing your hair again so the dye can set. After you first dye your hair, give it 48 hours before you wash your hair again. This gives the colour time to set and allows your follicles time to heal so that the colour doesn't easily leave your hair."
