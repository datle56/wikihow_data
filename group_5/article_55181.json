You can access the largest job search websites, such as Indeed and Monster, no matter where in the world you currently live. [5] X Research source Set up an account on LinkedIn (if you don't already have one). Many employers use your LinkedIn profile as your résumé, especially if you're also applying online. If a company has hired people from your home country before, they're more likely to do so again. Network with colleagues from your country who now work in the US and find out what companies they work for. If you don't know people who meet this description personally, try searching for them on LinkedIn and send messages to people you find."

      "content": "Contact a recruiting agency if you're an experienced professional. Private recruiters, also known as \"headhunters,\" help companies find executive-level and other highly qualified employees, such as high-level managers and company officers. If you have 5-10 years experience in an executive or professional role (such as a lawyer or accountant), you might find it easier to work through a recruiter. [6] X Research source Watch out for scam employment agencies that claim they can find you a job in the US. Never pay an upfront fee to an employment agency."

      "content": "Edit your cover letter and résumé for each job you apply to. Read each job listing carefully and include specific skills mentioned in the listing in your résumé and cover letter. Remove skills or experience that isn't related to that particular job. [7] X Research source Look at your cover letter and résumé as marketing tools. You're essentially selling your services to the employer. Show them that they need you on their team. Research each employer thoroughly and use information from your research in your cover letter. This tells the employer that you have an understanding of their business."

      "title": "Follow up on your applications after a week or two.",
      "content": "Follow up on your applications after a week or two. Many employers in the US simply don't reply to applications. Be ready to call the company to follow up on your application — and you may have to call more than once! If you're persistent, the company might decide to interview you. [8] X Research source Schedule your follow-up calls or emails starting 1 week after you submit your application. After that, follow up again based on the response you got the first time you followed up. For example, if the employer tells you that someone will be in touch with you in 3 days and you don't hear anything in that time, call back on the 4th day. Even if you're not getting any responses to your attempts to follow up on your application, don't call or email an employer more than once a week. If you don't get anything after a month, it's usually best to quit pursuing them."

      "content": "Attend your interview in person or online. If you're outside the country, any potential employer will likely set up an interview online or over the phone. They're usually not going to fly you in for an in-person interview, unless you're applying for a high-level or executive position. [9] X Research source Even if you're interviewing online, dress as you would if you were meeting in person. Try to find a professional-looking place (even if it's just in front of a blank wall) where you can speak without interruption. Research the company before the interview and write down 2-3 questions to ask your interviewer about the company based on your research. If English isn't your first language, you might want to rehearse with someone before your interview so you have some statements prepared. Be ready to discuss your relevant skills and experiences and describe your professional accomplishments."
