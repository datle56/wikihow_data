Their business card will usually contain her name, in addition to other contact information. [2] X Research source Even asking for a person's email address often results in learning her name. Many people have their names as part of their email address. You can ask them to enter their phone number in your phone. They'll likely enter both first and last names, along with her number."

Take this opportunity to introduce someone whose name you know to your new friend. [3] X Research source When you introduce your friend to the person whose name you've forgotten, there's a good chance that the person will then introduce herself to the new person. Once you've heard the person's name, repeat it so that you'll be more likely to remember it. You might easily work this into conversation by saying, \"I'm sorry, (name), I'm sorry I forgot to introduce you.\""

They'll also be likely to appreciate your directness. If you ask what their name is, and don't want to admit that you've forgotten their name, you can say you meant to ask what their last name was. [4] X Research source The reason this works is because the person will rarely expect you to remember their last name, and they'll usually reply by saying their first name. Ask whether they go by their first or their middle name. People will often respond to this question by sharing both names, and even offering more information. For example, they might respond by saying, \"I was always Emily Jane to my grandmother, and when I was a kid, everyone called me Emily. But when I came to college, I decided to use the name Jane.\""

Asking them how their name is spelled is one way to do this, particularly if you recall that it might be an unusual name. Of course, if the name is Smith or Jones, you might have to be prepared with a diversion! You can also ask the meaning of the name, or about the geographical origins of the name. People are generally happy to talk about themselves in this way, and you'll have more details to help you remember their name should you forget again!"

Most people have sufficient information about themselves online that online search engines will often reveal someone's name by entering in the information about the person that you do have. Enter the information that you have about a person (the city in which they lives, their college or workplace, any other affiliations that you can think of).

After all, you know what the person looks like - particularly if you're still with them! Social media sites will use your shared information to find the person quickly, particularly if you have many shared friends. Facebook's \"People Search\" can often help, if you remember any part of their name. Search for him online by their phone number. Many sites, such as White Pages, 411, or AnyWho, will provide a person's profile through their phone number. Entering the person's phone number into an online search engine, such as Google, Bing or Yahoo, will result in lots of results. These are filtered by relevancy, so you'll only have to check out the most likely options, listed at the top."

In certain cultural settings, generic endearments may be appropriate. For example, some people choose to use the terms, \"sweetie,\" \"darling,\" or \"pal.\" [6] X Research source Be very careful before employing these, though, as they are culturally specific. If these terms aren't commonly used within a particular culture, they might be misunderstood."

Use a casual tone of voice when you ask what their name is. For example, you might say, \"Hang on, I've already forgotten your name. Would you mind saying it again?\" or \"I'm totally blanking on your name for some reason.\" The other person will likely appreciate your honesty. You might add, \"I'm not good at remembering names,\" so that the person will not assume that knowing their name isn't important to you. If this is a potential business contact, however, don't add this, as it will perhaps seem like a potential liability. Blame your forgetfulness on your age.
