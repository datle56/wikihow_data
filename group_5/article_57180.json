      "content": "Decide where to make your badminton court. If you have a small backyard, you don't have many options except putting it in the middle. But if you have a bigger space, you can put your badminton court anywhere. Here are some tips for wherever you choose: If you are on the grass, mow the lawn. It's easier to play on short grass than higher grass. Don't mow it too short, but be sure that it can even be played on. If you are on rubble, sand or dirt, make sure there aren't too many rocks to step on or anything. You don't want to be leaping the whole time. If you are on cement or hard ground, make sure that you are in a place where it won't get too hot from the sun."

      "content": "Know if it's appropriate to put there. If it is right next to the neighbor's house, there is a high chance of the shuttlecock going over the fence. If there is a jungle gym in the way, it probably would make sense not to put it there. Some things can just be moved out of the way. If there is a doghouse, for example, you might be able to just scoot it out of the way. If you think you can play around the obstacles, you can certainly do that."

      "title": "Set up the net.",
      "content": "Set up the net. Buy a net from the store and read the directions on setting it up. Get a good one that can withstand the rain and is strong enough to stay. Stand up one side of the net up on a pole and use two strings (with a hook at the bottom) to hold it down. Do the same to the other side, and this is the standard way of setting it up. Read the instructions if you are still confused."

      "title": "Make boundaries.",
      "content": "Make boundaries. The boundaries of the court are usually about 8 feet (2.4 m) up and 12 feet (3.7 m) across. Mark them by putting duct tape down or by using a stick/rock of some sort to mark it."

      "title": "Make the line in between the boxes.",
      "content": "Make the line in between the boxes. When the shuttlecock is served, it must go past a certain line in order to count. Around half-way through the width of the court, make a line that will show where the birdie needs to pass. Then, facing the badminton net, make another line half-way through the court so that it looks like a giant grid. This second line shows the first player's side of the court and the second player's side of the court."

      "title": "Adjust the net every few days.",
      "content": "Adjust the net every few days. After being up for a while, the net can begin to droop. Soon, the net won't be as high as it was, and it won't be the right height. Every few days, remember to take it down and then put it back up again, or just adjust it."
