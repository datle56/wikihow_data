      "title": "Generators are the driving force of the world.",
      "content": "Generators are the driving force of the world. They’re the builders, the creators, and the laborers. They aren’t the ones who come up with ideas, but they’re the ones who bring them to life. Generators are the people who create and sustain life force energy, or the energy that flows through all living things to keep us alive. [1] X Research source Life force energy is also known as prana life force energy or chi, and it is a concept that has been used in spiritual practices for thousands of years. Generators are the most common Human Design type. They’re one of the four primary types and make up 70% of the population. Sometimes, people separate the Human Design types into 5 categories instead of 4. In this case, Generators are split into regular Generators and Manifesting Generators. Regular Generators make up about 37% of the population, while Manifesting Generators make up about 33%."

      "title": "Generators’ primary characteristic is their defined Sacral center.",
      "content": "Generators’ primary characteristic is their defined Sacral center. The Sacral center is the center of life force and work capacity, and having a defined one gives Generators consistent access to their life force energy. Generators use their stamina to build, create, and keep the world running. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "The Sacral center is also Generators’ authority.",
      "content": "The Sacral center is also Generators’ authority. In Human Design, authority describes each type’s decision-making abilities. Sacral authority is often described as a gut feeling or intuition. Generators need to be in tune with their inner selves and trust their intuition to guide them when making decisions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generators' strategy is to respond.",
      "content": "Generators' strategy is to respond. Each Human Design type has a strategy, or a behavioral method that best allows them to succeed in life. Generators are meant to wait and respond to outside forces rather than forcing things to happen themselves. Responding means waiting for inspiration to strike before setting off to complete a task. [3] X Research source When Generators successfully follow their strategy, they’re able to dedicate their energy to projects they’re passionate about, which in turn causes them to feel fulfilled. When Generators fail to follow their authority by rushing into things, they can easily become frustrated and burnt out. In Human Design, your strategy and authority work together to help you make decisions and move through the world in a way that best aligns with your energy. You can learn more about Human Design strategies and authorities by reading your Human Design chart ."

      "title": "Generators’ role in society is to master their skills.",
      "content": "Generators’ role in society is to master their skills. When Generators are passionate about a skill or hobby, they won’t stop until they master it. Through this mastery, they give the gift of their work to the world. When their work is aligned with their true self, Generators play a vital role in the continuation of society."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generators are energetic.",
      "content": "Generators are energetic. Because Generators are so connected to their Sacral center, they often seem to have a never-ending source of energy. They’re often able to work longer and harder than other Human Design types. They’re excitable and always ready to get the ball rolling. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Generators are experts in their field.",
      "content": "Generators are experts in their field. Generators are here to master their skills and passions. With their consistent life force energy, they’re able to build knowledge and structure from beginning to end. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "They easily connect with others. Because Generators are so passionate, others are often drawn to their excitable personalities. They have a warm and enveloping aura that naturally attracts others. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "They’re committed to their goals.",
      "content": "They’re committed to their goals. Generators are doers. When they’re passionate about something, they won’t rest until they see it through. Their dedication uplifts the world and the people around them. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Generators often feel frustrated.",
      "content": "Generators often feel frustrated. When their work doesn’t bring them satisfaction, Generators can feel overwhelmed and disheartened. They may also feel frustrated when they don’t give themselves enough time to recharge their energy. [8] X Research source To avoid frustration , dedicate your time and energy to projects you’re truly passionate about. Make sure you also set aside time for rest and relaxation."
    },
    {
      "title": "They sometimes struggle to follow their strategy.",
      "content": "They sometimes struggle to follow their strategy. Generators are prone to ignoring their intuition and jumping into new tasks. This often leads to working on projects that don’t benefit them and drain their energy. Generators need to trust their Sacral center and wait for the right opportunities to come along. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine what is worth your time and energy.",
      "content": "Determine what is worth your time and energy. Although Generators are full of energy, you can still feel drained when you take on too much. To avoid a slump, put your energy where it matters most. Find work that aligns with your passion and interests so you’ll feel satisfied and energetic upon completion. If a task isn’t something you’re invested in, allow someone else to take over. [10] X Research source This can be accomplished by following your strategy and authority. Don’t rush into new tasks, and instead allow your Sacral authority to guide you via intuition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on self-awareness.",
      "content": "Focus on self-awareness. Self-awareness is particularly important for Generators because you need to understand what motivates you. Spend some time each day reflecting on your feelings and actions. Try meditation or journaling to deepen your understanding of your subconscious."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have patience for yourself and others.",
      "content": "Have patience for yourself and others. In a world that moves quickly, it can be difficult for you to wait and respond. Learn to pause and let the right opportunities come to you instead of jumping into things head first. Go about your daily life and trust your intuition to tell you when to act."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain your physical health.",
      "content": "Maintain your physical health. As a Generator, you’re very energetic, and your body needs to be able to keep up with you. Exercise and eat balanced meals to fuel your body and sustain your energy. Get enough rest each night so you wake up feeling recharged."

    {
      "title": "Manifesting Generators have traits of both Generators and Manifestors.",
      "content": "Manifesting Generators have traits of both Generators and Manifestors. Manifesting Generators differ from regular Generators because they’re multi-passionate. While Generators may need to focus their energy on one task or idea, Manifesting Generators can dedicate their energy to varying interests. They’re the only hybrid Human Design type. [11] X Research source Like Manifestors, Manifesting Generators have a motor center attached to their throat (in addition to their defined Sacral center). This center makes it easier for them to manifest and take action rather than having to wait and respond like Generators."
