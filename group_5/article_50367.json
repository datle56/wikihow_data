      "content": "Add 19 inches (48 cm) to the measurement you got for your neck. That's how long your bow tie needs to be, from end to end, when it's untied. The extra 19 inches (48 cm) will give you enough fabric to make the knot and bow. [6] X Research source For example, if the circumference of your neck is 15 inches (38 cm), you would want to adjust your bow tie so it's 34 inches (86 cm) long when it's untied."

If you're trying to make your bow tie longer, slide the slider in toward the center of your bow tie. To make things easier, lay your bow tie on a flat surface next to measuring tape so you can see how long it is as you're adjusting it. [7] X Research source Once your bow tie is the same length as the measurement you calculated, it's ready to be tied around your neck."

Now that the t-hook is hooked into the number that corresponds with your neck size, your bow tie should fit you when you tie it around your neck. [10] X Research source"
