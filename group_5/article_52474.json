Label this number \"feet\" or \"ft.\" [1] X Research source It's helpful to follow along with a real-world example to see how feet are converted to inches. Let's say that you want to know how long the wall of your room is in inches. If the wall is eight feet long, start by writing this measurement down, like this: 8 feet"

      "content": "Multiply the number of feet by 12. Next, multiply your number of feet by 12. Since there are 12 inches in every foot, this will give you your original foot measurement in inches. [2] X Research source In the example problem, you would continue by writing a \"× 12\" after the foot measurement, then multiplying to find the answer, like this: 8 feet × 12 = 96"

If you don't, your answer may be confusing to someone who reads it (and, if you're doing this for schoolwork, you may lose points.) [3] X Research source In the example problem, label your answer like this: 8 feet × 12 = 96 inches"

If you ever want to get your inch measurement back into feet, just do the reverse of the multiplication you did to get it in inches: in other words, divide it by 12. Don't forget to re-label your answer in feet. [4] X Research source To convert your answer in the example problem back into feet, divide it by 12 like this: 96 inches ÷ 12 = 8 feet"

Sometimes, especially for certain types of measurements like heights, measurements are given in feet and inches (like, for example, \"100 feet, six inches.) In this case, start by writing just the number of feet — leave the inches out for now. As another example problem, let's say that you are five feet, three inches tall and that you want to figure out exactly how tall you are in just inches. Start by writing just the number of feet, like this: 5 feet"

      "content": "Divide by 12 and use the remainder to get back to feet and inches. If you want to get back to the same type of feet-and-inches measurement as we had before, there is a little more work to do this time. To do this, divide by 12, then find the remainder. The answer for dividing by 12 is the number of feet and the remainder is the number of inches (for example, 4 R5 would be four feet, five inches.) [7] X Research source A remainder is just the number \"left over\" when two numbers don't divide evenly. For example, four goes into 12 exactly three times, but five doesn't fit into twelve perfectly — it goes in twice to make 10, then it only fits in partly the third time. 5 × 2 = 10, which is two less than twelve, so we say that we have a remainder of two (or R2 ). In other words, five goes into twelve twice, then we need to add an \"extra\" two to get to twelve. In the example problem, get back into feet and inches like this: 63 inches / 12 = 5 R3 → 5 feet 3 inches"
