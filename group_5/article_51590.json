      "content": "Be aware of their size. All snakes, including ball pythons, will grow quite a bit over the course of their lives. Ball pythons in particular will grow quite large and will require a proper living environment as they do. You should be prepared for this before you attempt to care for a ball python. [1] X Research source Female ball pythons will grow to around 3' to 5' in length, males to around 2' to 3'. You will need to provide enough space for a fully grown ball python. You will need to feed a snake of this size large rodents. If you are not sure about the appropriate size for your snake, you can see a rat size chart for that."

You will need to feed, clean and maintain the health of your ball python over the course of its entire life. Make sure you are ready for a long-term commitment before deciding to care for a ball python. [2] X Research source Ball pythons have lived up to 40 years. Generally, ball pythons will live between 20 to 30 years."

Thankfully, ball pythons are very popular amongst pet owners and they are easy to find in most pet stores. Start looking for a ball python that is right for you once you feel prepared to care for it. [3] X Research source Reptile breeders will likely have ball pythons available. Attending a reptile expo can also help you find your new ball python. Ball pythons should already be eating and well fed before you buy them."

      "content": "Know how to handle a ball python. Snakes aren't used to being held in the wild. As a result, you will need to know when it's acceptable to hold your snake and when it will only cause stress. Take a look at some of these key ideas when considering if it's the right time to interact with your snake: [4] X Research source Allow your snake to eat one meal in its new home before trying to handle it. Wait at least a week before handling new snakes. Don't be afraid to hold the snake after that week. Young snakes should be held no more than once a week. Adult snakes can be held around once a week. Don't interact with your ball python after it's eaten. Wait around two days after your snake eats to make sure it is comfortable."

      "content": "Be attentive. If you plan on caring for a ball python, you will need to be dedicated to maintaining and protecting its health. Keeping your snake healthy will require you to watch its behavior and actions for any changes or indications of illness. Keep an eye out for some of these common signs of illness: [5] X Research source A ball python should normally sit in a coil. Snakes that lay straight out or keep their head up may be ill. Ball pythons that spend a lot of time soaking may be ill or uncomfortable. In the case of respiratory issues, your snake may wheeze or have mucus come out from its nose. Runny or bloody stool can indicate a digestive issue. Snakes who don't void after ten days may be constipated. Refusal of food may indicate an infection."

      "content": "Ensure the python can stretch out in the cage. Ball pythons will need just the right amount of room to feel comfortable. Cages or enclosures that are too large or too small will stress the snake out and make its life uncomfortable. Keep these tips in mind when you are looking for a new home for your ball python to enjoy: [6] X Research source The container needs to be long enough that an snake can completely stretch out in it. Mesh cage lids can work. However, it can be difficult maintaining humidity levels in the cage. For younger snakes, you will need to find a smaller enclosure."

      "content": "Spot clean often. It's important to keep your snakes enclosure very clean. Keeping the cage clean will help keep your ball python happy and healthy. Part of your regular cleaning routine should include spot cleaning. Spot cleaning will allow you to keep up with any messes and require you to fully clean the cage less often.

It's generally recommended that you fully clean the cage and everything in it once a month. Totally cleaning the cage will help keep your snake healthy and prevent any health issues over time. [8] X Research source Take your snake out of the enclosure during the time you are cleaning. Remove everything in the cage for cleaning. Any sticks, hiding boxes, or other decorations will need to be cleaned. You can clean the cage with a water and bleach solution. Make sure the bleach content is only 5%.

      "content": "Keep a temperature gradient. In a natural environment, your snake will move between areas that have different temperatures. Snakes are cold-blooded and the temperature will change their level of activity. To replicate this, you will need to maintain your ball python's enclosure with a temperature gradient. [10] X Research source The basking area should be 88 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit. The overall temperature of the cage should be 78 to 80 Fahrenheit. Use two thermometers to monitor both the cool and warm areas of the cage. You can heat the cage with under-cage warming pads or heating lights."

If you want to use additional lighting, try using a full-spectrum UV light. Consider adding supplemental lighting to help make your enclosure feel even more natural and comfortable. [11] X Research source Use 12 hour cycles of lighting. Keep the light on for 12 hours during the day and off for 12 hours at night. Do not leave the light on at night.
