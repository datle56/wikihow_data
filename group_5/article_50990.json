      "title": "Drop an item on the ground.",
      "content": "Drop an item on the ground. This item can be anything at all—a pen, a piece of paper, your keys, etc. The only qualifiers are that the item needs to be something you can easily pick up that’s small enough to hold in one hand. [1] X Research source Ultimately, the best thing to drop is something that’s already in your hand. This way, it’ll seem accidental despite your flirtatious intentions. Don’t drop anything fragile or expensive; there’s no guarantee it won’t break or shatter."

      "title": "Bend over to retrieve the item.",
      "content": "Bend over to retrieve the item. Place one foot in front of the other. Hinge forward at the waist, sticking out your bottom while simultaneously sliding a hand down the leg furthest from you as you reach for the object. This movement draws attention to the length of your legs, showing off your physique. [2] X Research source Push your chest out as far as possible during the bend. If there’s writing on your shirt, someone looking at you should be able to read the words, even as you’re bent over. Be aware of what you’re wearing before you bend and snap. For instance, a flowy, low-cut blouse may reveal too much right away."

      "title": "Pick up the item you dropped.",
      "content": "Pick up the item you dropped. Take your time while doing this, letting your hand graze down your leg. The whole point of the maneuver is to keep your crush’s attention on you, so feel free to draw out the motion for as long as you’d like."

      "title": "Snap upwards once the item is in your hand.",
      "content": "Snap upwards once the item is in your hand. Grab the item and stand back up quickly, keeping your back straight and core tight. Hold your hands on either side of your chest, pushing your breasts together. Arch your back to stick your chest out toward your crush. [3] X Research source A woman sticking her chest out is considered a non-verbal invitation of intimacy or flirting. [4] X Research source Make sure you’re bending and snapping for someone you’re interested in; otherwise, you may give someone else the wrong idea."

      "content": "Smile to reel in your crush’s attention. Stick the landing of your bend and snap by making eye contact with your crush and giving them a genuine smile . [5] X Research source This lets them know that you did all of that just for them—they should totally talk to you!"

      "title": "Practice bending and snapping at home.",
      "content": "Practice bending and snapping at home. Before you share your bend and snap with the world, do a couple of test runs at home in front of the mirror. This can help boost your confidence and ensure the motion is perfect before you try it in public. If you’re still struggling, watch the bend and snap scene from Legally Blonde . Watching Elle Woods take you through the motions a few times may help you finesse your bend and snap."

      "title": "Engage in conversation with your crush.",
      "content": "Engage in conversation with your crush. When you’re ready to perform the move for real, find your crush and start chatting . Talk about the weather, their day, or something on TV. What you talk about doesn’t necessarily matter as long as they’re paying attention to you. Try asking them a question to open the conversation, like “How have you been?” or “Do you recommend the pizza?” [6] X Research source Stand somewhat close to your crush as you talk. This way, they’ll be front and center for the show when you bend and snap. Alternatively, skip this step and grab their attention with the bend and snap first. Then, strike up a conversation once you’ve caught their eye."

      "title": "Sell it with confidence.",
      "content": "Sell it with confidence. Confidence is key when flirting—if you believe in yourself, it’ll show! So, know your worth. You’re hot stuff, and your bend and snap is one killer crush magnet. Go into the move with a flirtatious smile and bold and confident attitude because your crush would be lucky to have you. [7] X Research source For example, when you snap back up, flip your hair over your shoulder and give your crush a wink. This is an excellent way to say, “Hey, you’re cute.”"

      "content": "Make eye contact with your crush, and keep talking. Don’t just finish the move and walk away. It doesn’t matter how good your bend and snap is if you can’t carry on a good conversation! Let the bend and snap help you attract your crush's attention, and once you have it, make the most of it. [8] X Research source Alternatively, walk away from your crush after you bend and snap with a swish of your hips. If their gaze follows you, they’re totally interested and may even chase after you to grab your number."
