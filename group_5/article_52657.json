      "content": "Try a deep side part to create the illusion of a smaller forehead. A deep side part creates a swoop in your hair that can hide the top of your forehead, making it look smaller. Use your fingers or the end of a fishtail comb to part your hair to one side. Arrange your curls until you’re happy with how your hair looks. [1] X Research source If your hair won’t stay, use a bobby pin to keep your part in place. It’s easiest to part your hair when it’s still wet. Use a comb to divide your hair into 2 parts after you apply your leave-in products. Then, apply a curl cream and let your hair air dry."
