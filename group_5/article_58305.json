      "title": "Plant the Java fern on driftwood or rocks instead of into a substrate.",
      "content": "Plant the Java fern on driftwood or rocks instead of into a substrate. In the case of the Java fern, “planting” does not mean burying the roots beneath a substrate like soil or pebbles. Instead, these unique plants like to keep their roots exposed and attach to textured surfaces like driftwood and lava rocks. If you bury the roots, they eventually rot away and kill the Java fern. [1] X Research source Smooth rocks and materials like glass aren’t suitable growing objects for Java ferns. As a Java fern grows and matures, it spreads its roots out and into the wood or rock to securely attach itself to it."

    {
      "title": "Secure the Java fern’s rhizome to wood or rock with super glue gel.",
      "content": "Secure the Java fern’s rhizome to wood or rock with super glue gel . Just place a dab of super glue gel on the rock, wood, or other object where you want the fern to grow. Then, press the Java fern’s rhizome, or the horizontal, stem-like structure below the leaves, onto the glue for 30 seconds. Let the glue dry for 15 to 20 minutes, then place it in your aquarium. [2] X Research source Java ferns are rhizome plants, which means that they have a horizontal base that roots grow out of. Aim to only attach the fern’s rhizome to the glue instead of the roots. However, it won’t hurt the plant if a few roots get glued down. Do not glue the leaves onto the rock or wood."

      "title": "Tie the fern’s rhizome to the object with fishing wire as an alternative.",
      "content": "Tie the fern’s rhizome to the object with fishing wire as an alternative. If you don’t want to use super glue, secure the Java fern to the rock, driftwood, or other object with fishing wire, thread, or zip ties. Just place your fern on the surface and loop the wire over the rhizome and object. Wrap the wire around the rhizome and surface several times, then tie the wire in a knot. [3] X Research source After you attach the rhizome to a rock or piece of wood, the roots secure the fern to the object with a strong bond. Remove the wire when the roots are growing across the rock or wood, which can take several weeks. Otherwise, the thread can stunt the fern’s growth. Or, find a Java fern at your local aquarium and pet store that’s pre-attached to a small piece of driftwood or lava rock. The fern is often attached with a thread that dissolves over time in the water."

      "title": "Place the Java fern in the middle or back of your tank.",
      "content": "Place the Java fern in the middle or back of your tank. While Java plants grow just fine in the front of your aquarium, they will likely block your view of your fish! Instead, set it towards the back of your aquarium to function as a background piece. Or, settle the Java fern in the middle of your tank to let your fish play and find safety in its beautiful leaves. [4] X Research source Java ferns typically grow about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 12 inches (30 cm) tall. Because of their size, Java ferns grow best in tanks that hold at least 10 gallons (38 L) of water."

    {
      "title": "Set the fern in the water if you don't want to attach it to anything.",
      "content": "Set the fern in the water if you don't want to attach it to anything. Java plants are super low maintenance. If you don’t want to choose a spot for your fern and attach it to a surface, simply drop it into the water. The Java fern will either find a surface to grow on or float freely in your tank."

      "title": "Provide the Java fern with low to medium light using a 5000 K bulb.",
      "content": "Provide the Java fern with low to medium light using a 5000 K bulb . Java ferns are hardy plants that can tolerate very dim conditions to bright, moderate light. They grow the best in low to medium lighting, so set a 5000 to 7000 K bulb over your aquarium. These ferns need about 1.5 watts of light for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water, so a 10-gallon (38 L) tank requires a 15-watt bulb. [5] X Research source Before adjusting your aquarium's lighting, pH, or temperature, ensure the changes are compatible with your fish's needs. Java ferns tolerate a wide range of conditions, so they might be happy in the environment you already have."

    {
      "title": "Keep the water’s pH between 6 and 8.",
      "content": "Keep the water’s pH between 6 and 8. Java ferns prefer slightly acidic water between 6 and 8 pH to grow in and thrive. However, they can tolerate a wide range of pH and still grow fine. Just check your water’s pH regularly with pH strips to ensure it stays within the optimum range. [6] X Research source If the water is too acidic, raise the pH by adding in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda per 5 gallons (19 L) of water. [7] X Research source If the water is too basic, lower the pH by adding several scoops of peat moss into a mesh bag and placing it inside your filter. [8] X Research source Remove any fish in your tank before adjusting the pH. Java ferns prefer slightly soft and alkaline water between 3 to 8 dKH (degrees of carbonate hardness), but they easily tolerate hard water, too."

      "content": "Regulate the temperature between 72 and 82 °F (22 and 28 °C). Java ferns are native to countries like the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia in Southeast Asia, so they like warm, tropical climates. Just use an aquarium thermometer to monitor the temperature and an aquarium heater to keep the water around 72 and 82 °F (22 and 28 °C)."

      "title": "Reduce the lighting if you see large, brown spots on the leaves.",
      "content": "Reduce the lighting if you see large, brown spots on the leaves. Java ferns can develop Java fern melt from too much intense, direct light. This disease forms large, brown spots on the leaves that grow mushy and eventually disintegrate. When you notice brown spots, turn off the light for 3 days to let your fern recover. Then, replace your light with a dimmer bulb. [9] X Research source Java fern melt can also develop from algae or not enough nutrients in the water. To keep your fern free from algae, clean your tank regularly and add several algae-eating critters into the water."

      "title": "Add a liquid plant fertilizer if your fern isn’t growing.",
      "content": "Add a liquid plant fertilizer if your fern isn’t growing. Java ferns are slow growers, but you’ll typically see new leaves within several weeks to 1 month after planting it. These plants typically get adequate nutrients from their surroundings and don’t need fertilizer to grow. However, if you see little to no signs of growth, add an iron-rich liquid fertilizer into the water. [10] X Research source Choose a liquid fertilizer that is compatible with your fish and other plants. Then, follow the instructions on the package to add it to the tank. The amount of fertilizer you add depends on the amount of water in your tank and the specific fertilizer you’re using. For example, some fertilizers instruct you to squeeze a dropper of liquid into the tank each week. The fish can typically remain in the tank while you add the fertilizer."

      "content": "Pluck off and relocate plantlets that grow from the leaves. Java ferns naturally propagate new plants all by themselves. As the fern grows, tiny black bumps appear along the leaves that eventually become baby Java ferns, or plantlets. When a plantlet has its own roots, simply pinch it off the leaf and attach it to a new piece of driftwood or stone. [11] X Research source Alternatively, leave the plantlets alone and let them fall off the leaves all by themselves. Either let the plantlets float in the tank, find their own anchor, or scoop them up and attach them to rocks or pieces of wood."

      "content": "Snip off a section of the rhizome as another propagation method. If you like the height of your Java fern but it’s growing too wide, simply divide the plant in half! Just use a small pair of clean, sharp scissors to snip the fern’s rhizome in two. Pull the sections apart and plant them onto separate pieces of driftwood or rock. [12] X Research source It’s OK to pull off or cut away some of the roots to separate the rhizome from the wood or stone. The roots will grow back."

      "content": "Prune off damaged leaves when you see them. Regularly check the leaves on your fern for signs of damage, like brown or discolored spots and wilting. Then, simply cut the leaf off as close to the rhizome as possible. [13] X Research source Java ferns are slow growers, so they generally don’t need regular pruning. If your plant is growing thicker or taller than you’d like, just snip off a few leaves close to the rhizome to help thin it out."
