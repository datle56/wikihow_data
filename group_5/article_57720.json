      "content": "Measure the inside diameter first. The O-ring needs to fit snugly to form a seal, so the inside diameter (ID) needs to be correct. To measure this without an O-ring sizing cone, put the O-ring on a completely flat, clean surface.

      "title": "It also helps to measure either the outside diameter or the cross-section.",
      "content": "It also helps to measure either the outside diameter or the cross-section. To get a perfectly sized O-ring, you also need to know how thick the material should be. There are two ways to measure this: Using calipers, measure the cross-section (CS), or thickness of the rubber ring (touching it as lightly as you can, without squeezing). [3] X Research source This is the second number found in O-ring listings. Or use a ruler to measure the outside diameter (OD), or distance from one outer edge to another across the center. Since this is the same as the inner diameter plus two cross-sections of the ring, you can calculate the cross section as (OD - ID)/2. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, you can use an O-ring sizing cone.",
      "content": "Yes, you can use an O-ring sizing cone. This is a cone with painted circles or grooves along its whole height. Drop the O-ring on the top, and find the largest circle it can fit over without stretching. Read the label on that circle to find out what size of O-ring you have. [5] X Research source The labels usually use a standard size system. If you need to convert this to actual measurements, you can look up an O-ring size chart online. [6] X Expert Source Audra Fordin Certified Automotive Technician Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. A chart for the global ISO 3601 standard should work for almost any O-ring worldwide.

      "title": "If you don't see measurements, look up the product code.",
      "content": "If you don't see measurements, look up the product code. No matter where you are in the world, this is usually a number beginning with a dash, between -001 and -999. You can look up this number on an O-ring sizing chart online to find the exact dimensions of the O-ring. [9] X Research source If the code doesn't seem to match this system, try visiting the manufacturer website. You can often find a sizing chart specifically for their products. (In many cases, this is just the standard numbering system with some extra numbers or letters tacked on.)"

Any O-ring with the same dash number has the exact same size and tolerance, so there should be no difference who manufactured it. [10] X Research source Almost all standards worldwide are compatible with each other, so two -240 O-rings should be the same even if they are made in different countries. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "You might see some O-rings that don't fit this system. If you have a user manual that asks for a specific O-ring size, but uses some other code besides the dash number system, it's probably one of the following: Some manufacturers add an extra number in front of the dash, for instance \"3-901.\" This is just a way to categorize their products, and doesn't affect sizing. If the code is a letter followed by a four-digit number (like D0425), this is a metric O-ring with no perfect match in the dash number system. You can find its exact size online with an ISO 3601 size chart. [12] X Research source If the code doesn't match any of these, it's probably a nonstandard size you can only buy from that one manufacturer. [13] X Research source"

[15] X Research source Now you have enough info to buy a replacement O-ring. The sizes are usually listed with the inner diameter first, then the cross-section. So if you measured an inner diameter of 7.6mm and a thickness of 1mm, look for a replacement labeled something pretty close to \"7.6 x 1.\""

The perfect O-ring for most uses is 1 or 2% smaller than the groove, and not more than 5% smaller. [17] X Research source For instance, if the groove is 5 mm, the O-ring should be at least 5 mm * 0.95 = 4.75 mm, and no more than 5 mm * 0.99 = 4.95 mm."

For basic home purposes, go with an O-ring with a cross-section barely larger than the groove, so you have to squeeze it slightly to fit it in. [18] X Research source If you're working with higher pressure or friction than a typical DIY project and need more precision, a good rule of thumb formula for the cross-section is 1.4 * ((BD - GD)/2), or 1.3 * ((BD - GD)/2) for O-rings that touch moving parts. GD is the groove diameter, and BD is the bore diameter, or diameter of the outer surface the groove is cut into. [19] X Research source"
