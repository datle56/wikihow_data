      "content": "Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions . To change 1 of the mixed fractions, multiply the denominator by the whole number. Then add the numerator. Place the result over the line and leave the denominator as-is. Repeat this for the other mixed fraction. [1] X Research source For example, if you start with 1 1/2 x 4 4/7, change them to improper fractions. 1 1/2 will become 3/2 and 4 4/7 will become 32/7. Your equation will now by 3/2 x 32/7."

Write the result and place a line below it. [2] X Research source The numerator is always the top number in a fraction. For example, with 3/2 x 32/7, multiply 3 by 32 to get 96."

      "title": "Turn the answer into a mixed fraction if possible.",
      "content": "Turn the answer into a mixed fraction if possible. If the numerator of your result is larger than the denominator, see how many times the denominator will go into the numerator. Then leave put the remainder over the denominator to give you a mixed fraction . [4] X Research source For example, if you got 96/14, see how many times 14 will go into 96. You'll get 6 with 12 left over. Place 12 over the denominator (14). Most instructors will want you to put the answer in the same form as the question. So if you started with mixed fractions, convert your answer to a mixed fraction."

      "title": "Simplify",
      "content": "Simplify further if possible. You'll probably end up with a whole number and a fraction. Look at the fraction and see if you can simplify it. For example, if you have 6 12/14, reduce 12/14 by 2 to get 6/7. [5] X Research source In this example, your final answer will be 6 6/7."

To rewrite a whole number as a fraction, simply place the whole number over 1. This will make an improper fraction. [7] X Research source For example, if you have 5 x 8/10, put the 5 over 1. You should now have 5/1 x 8/10."

Now you can multiply the numbers below the lines to get your denominator. You should now have an answer to your equation that's in fraction form. [11] X Research source For example, if you're multiplying 5/1 x 8/10, multiply 1 by 10 to get 10. Place this below the line to get an answer of 40/10."

Divide the numerator by the denominator to get a simplified result. [12] X Research source To reduce 40/10, divide 40 by 10 to get 4 as your new answer. In many cases, you'll get a mixed number since the answer will have a remainder."
