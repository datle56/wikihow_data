Since the Top Picks list is smaller and more unique to you, you’ll be more likely to find someone you match well with⁠, and swipe right on them.

Tinder then uses this information to group users into categories like “foodie” or “creative.” This makes it more likely that you’ll match with people who are similar to you.

      "content": "There’s no way to tell for sure. Tinder won’t notify you if you’re featured on someone’s Top Picks. However, it might be more likely that you’re a Top Pick if you’re getting more Super Likes and matches than usual. You can tell if someone Super Likes you if you see a blue star around their profile while swiping, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you’re being shown to that person as a Top Pick.

      "content": "Make your profile more personal and unique! Since Top Picks are based on your profile information, you’re more likely to show up as a Top Pick if your bio contains lots of details for the algorithm to work with. You can also use keywords to increase your chances of being organized into a certain group and shown to someone similar. With a little bit of work, you can definitely boost your chances . [8] X Research source For example, add in your college if you haven't already, and include “musician” somewhere in your bio. Visual impressions matter for a lot of people, so make sure your first picture is great. Above all, be very clear about why you're on Tinder to begin with.
