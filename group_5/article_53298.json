    {
      "title": "Punch them in the solar plexus with your fist or the base of your palm.",
      "content": "Punch them in the solar plexus with your fist or the base of your palm. Close your hand into a fist or keep it open and lead with the base of your palm. Quickly and forcefully strike your attacker in the soft spot just below their sternum (breastbone). [1] X Research source This move will most likely knock the wind out of your attacker, especially if they don’t tense their abdominal muscles beforehand. Turn and run away while they are temporarily disabled. Like all the single-move strikes described here, the goal is to stun your attacker long enough so that you can flee. Follow up with additional strikes only if you cannot run away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strike their armpit with the side of your open hand.",
      "content": "Strike their armpit with the side of your open hand. If your attacker raises up one of their arms, chop as hard as you can at their exposed armpit. Use the side of your hand below the pinky. This will cause their arm to go numb temporarily, and also causes quite a bit of short-term pain. [2] X Research source Depending on your positioning, you could also drive your elbow into their exposed armpit. You must strike as hard as you can for this to be effective."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chop or poke their neck above the collarbone.",
      "content": "Chop or poke their neck above the collarbone. Aim at the base of their neck, just above the collarbone and to one side of the windpipe. Strike them with the side of your open hand, just below your pinky. [3] X Research source This strike is always painful, and it may cause them to lose their breath or—if you hit their carotid artery forcefully—lose consciousness. If you’re unable to produce a full strike, even poking the area forcefully with your fingertips may stun your attacker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knee a man in the groin, or squeeze his testicles.",
      "content": "Knee a man in the groin, or squeeze his testicles. Drive your knee as hard as you can between a male attacker’s legs. Your goal is to crush their testicles with your kneecap. Run away while they are stunned. [4] X Research source Don’t kick with your foot, since your attacker may be able to grab your leg and knock you down. A knee strike is much quicker and harder to defend, especially if you are close to your attacker. If you can’t use your knee, squeeze your attacker’s testicles as hard as you can with your hand, then run. A knee to the groin may work on a female attacker as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slap their ear forcefully with a cupped hand.",
      "content": "Slap their ear forcefully with a cupped hand. Cup your hand slightly and strike your attacker in the side of their head, right over their ear. In addition to the pain it causes, this strike may rupture their eardrum, causing additional pain and disorientation. [5] X Research source You’re more likely to rupture their eardrum if they have their mouth open when you strike. You can use both your hands to strike both their ears at the same time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kick the side of their kneecap as hard as you can.",
      "content": "Kick the side of their kneecap as hard as you can. Kick quickly but forcefully so that the inner side of your foot, just below your ankle, strikes just to the outside of one of their kneecaps. Your goal is to buckle their knee and render them unable to follow as you run away. [6] X Research source It’s quite possible that you’ll rupture the ligaments in their knee with this move, so only use it on an attacker. But when you must use it, strike with all your might. If you can’t kick the side of their knee, a stomping kick with the bottom of your foot to the front of their kneecap may also buckle their knee."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drive the base of your palm into the underside of their nose.",
      "content": "Drive the base of your palm into the underside of their nose. Aim the base of your palm at their nostrils and strike as hard as you can in an upward motion. You’ll probably break their nose, causing searing pain, lots of bleeding, and watering eyes that will cloud their vision. Depending on your positioning, driving your elbow or knee into their nose this way can also produce the same effect. Done forcefully enough, it is possible for this move to do catastrophic, and potentially fatal, damage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Poke them in the eyes with your fingers.",
      "content": "Poke them in the eyes with your fingers. Extend your first two fingers and stab at their eyes like you’re one of the Three Stooges, but attack seriously and with all your might. Alternatively, focus your attack on one eye with your finger or thumb. [7] X Research source Don’t be squeamish or hesitant when you’re being attacked. Drive your fingers into their eye sockets. If they can’t see you, they can’t attack you. It’s possible you’ll cause permanent eye damage, but it was their choice to attack you. Even if they’re able to raise their hand to block your eye attack, that will give you a window of opportunity to either turn and run or to use a second attack (like a knee to the groin).

      "title": "Strike their windpipe with your fist, palm, hand, or elbow.",
      "content": "Strike their windpipe with your fist, palm, hand, or elbow. The windpipe is one of the most fragile and vulnerable spots on the human body. Any direct, forceful blow will leave your attacker unable to breathe, and a blow that crushes their windpipe can be fatal. [9] X Research source If your attacker has an Adam’s apple, aim directly for it. Squeezing an attacker’s windpipe forcefully enough between your fingers and thumb can also temporarily (or even permanently) crush it."

    {
      "title": "Rotate your arm and slap their hand away if they grab your wrist.",
      "content": "Rotate your arm and slap their hand away if they grab your wrist. If your attacker latches their hand around your wrist, swing that arm in a fast, tight circle that moves down and away from your body. Their grip will likely loosen somewhat as you come around, allowing you to slap their hand away as you complete the circle. [10] X Research source Ideally, you’ll be able to turn and run immediately upon slapping their hand away. If this isn’t possible, have an immediate follow-up strike—like using your other hand to hit the underside of their nose—ready to go."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squeeze their hand between yours if they grab the front of your shirt.",
      "content": "Squeeze their hand between yours if they grab the front of your shirt. Place your hands on either side of the hand that’s grabbing you and squeeze as hard and as quickly as you can. In the same motion, push downward and away from your body. Turn and run immediately, if possible. [11] X Research source If necessary, follow up with an immediate second move, such as a forceful knee to the groin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stomp forcefully on their toes or instep if they grab you from behind.",
      "content": "Stomp forcefully on their toes or instep if they grab you from behind. Stomp your heel straight down on the tops of their toes as hard as you can, or aim for the area between their big toe and ankle. They’ll almost certainly release their grip, and they won’t be able to run after you right away. [12] X Research source Make it your goal to break their toes—you have to be aggressive!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shout loudly and aggressively to attract attention.",
      "content": "Shout loudly and aggressively to attract attention. No matter where your attacker grabs or strikes you, make as much noise as you can while you fight back. Shouting will attract the attention of bystanders, and make it less likely that your opponent will continue the attack. [13] X Research source Your instinct will be to shout “Help!”, but go for something more aggressive like “Get away!” or “Let go!” Make sure you sound forceful and angry. You’ll still attract the attention of bystanders this way. If they cover your mouth, stomp on their foot, gouge their eye, bite their fingers as hard as you can, or do any other disabling move that you can."

    {
      "title": "Take self-defense classes to improve your skills and aggression.",
      "content": "Take self-defense classes to improve your skills and aggression. Taking a self-defense class is the best way to learn the proper techniques you’ll need to quickly disable an attacker. Additionally, you’ll be trained to access the aggressive, ruthless mindset you need to tap into when attacked. [14] X Research source The goal is to train until your response is instinctual—you need to be able to identify and attack your opponent’s weak spots before they can react. Self-defense classes are often offered at martial arts studios, fitness clubs, community centers, college campuses, and other locations."

      "title": "Avoid direct conflict whenever possible.",
      "content": "Avoid direct conflict whenever possible. If you can run away from a potential attacker, do it. If you have the chance to join a crowd of people or call the police, do those as well. Always avoid the physical confrontation whenever you can. [15] X Expert Source Ross Cascio Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 13 September 2019. However, also accept that physical conflict may be inevitable with an attacker. If this is the case, do not hesitate to use every means at your disposal to defend yourself."

    {
      "title": "Strike first and forcefully so you can run away.",
      "content": "Strike first and forcefully so you can run away. If you feel directly threatened and cannot escape, don’t wait for your attacker to make the first move. Hit them first with a disabling blow, then run away at the first opportunity you get. [16] X Expert Source Ross Cascio Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 13 September 2019. Strike without mercy in order to disable your attacker. Remember that they chose to attack you, and therefore deserve whatever damage you cause to them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use combination strikes if necessary.",
      "content": "Use combination strikes if necessary. Your goal should always be to temporarily disable your attacker with a single, quick strike so that you can run away. When this isn’t possible, though, quickly move from one strike to another until your do have a chance to flee or until your opponent is completely neutralized. [17] X Research source Self-defense training will help you to build effective combination attacks. You might, for instance, start with a poke to their eyes, follow with a knee to their groin, and then finish with a knee to their nose. Attack until you can run away, unless you can’t run away—in that case, strike your attacker until they are immobilized, unconscious, or (if there is no other option) deceased."
