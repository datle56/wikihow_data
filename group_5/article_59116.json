[1] X Research source Try to apply the rubbing alcohol only to the marker stain and wipe along the area. Reapply and repeat as necessary until the marker is completely gone. Read the label on the rubbing alcohol before using it and test it in a small hidden area before applying it to larger areas. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a damp sponge to wipe off the toothpaste.",
      "content": "Use a damp sponge to wipe off the toothpaste. If your tile is textured, use a toothbrush or a scrubbing brush to remove traces of the stain from smaller crevices in the tiles. Once the stain is gone, remove any toothpaste residue with the sponge, dish soap, and warm water. If the permanent marker still stays on the tile, try one of the other methods."

      "title": "Trace the area with a black dry-erase marker and wipe it away.",
      "content": "Trace the area with a black dry-erase marker and wipe it away. Trace a small part of the stain and wipe it away with a clean cloth or paper towel. If the stain isn’t completely removed the first time, re-trace the remaining spots with the dry-erase marker and wipe until the stain is removed. [4] X Research source This method might work best on smooth tiles. If you have textured tile, the toothpaste, rubbing alcohol, or homemade cleaning solution methods may be more effective. After the stain is gone, dip a cloth in warm water and dish soap to wash away any marker residue. If the permanent marker still stays on the tile, try one of the other methods."

      "content": "Use a melamine foam sponge for a quick option. Melamine foam sponges , or “Magic Erasers,” can quickly remove permanent marker from hard surfaces. [5] X Research source Wet the foam and scrub the stained area until all the marker is removed. If the permanent marker stain is fresh, try using a dry melamine foam sponge first.

      "title": "Dip a cloth in vinegar, dish soap, and hot water and wipe the stain.",
      "content": "Dip a cloth in vinegar, dish soap, and hot water and wipe the stain. Combine 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of white vinegar, ¼ cup (35 g) of washing soda , 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of liquid dish soap, and 2 gallons (7.6 L) of hot water in a bucket. Dip a rag or cloth into the solution and wipe the stain until it’s completely gone. [7] X Research source If this recipe produces too much solution, then half the recipe. Apply the product to a hidden spot and let it set for three seconds before applying it to a large area. If there are stains, discoloration, or residue left by the product, choose a different method. If the permanent marker still stays on the tile, try one of the other methods."

If it doesn’t damage the tile, apply a little nail polish remover to a cloth or cotton ball and rub the marker stain. [8] X Research source Use a damp rag to wipe away any remaining residue. Alternatively, squirt a little hand sanitizer on the mark and use a clean cloth to rub at the stain. Repeat until the stain is gone and use a damp rag to remove any residue. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source Let the hairspray sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then use a damp rag to scrub the stain away. Hairspray can be an effective cleaner because it contains alcohol, which can dissolve the marker ink. [11] X Research source"
