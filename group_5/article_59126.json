      "content": "Use aluminum foil for an easy, low-cost method for removing rust from chrome. Aluminum reacts with rust chemically, resulting in a material that can be easily wiped or scrubbed off. [1] X Research source Since aluminum is softer than most metals, it will not scratch the surface of the chrome or the metal underneath it."

    {
      "title": "Clean the chrome",
      "content": "Clean the chrome . Before you attempt to remove the rust on the chrome, clean dirt and debris from the metal using soapy water, or with car wash soap if cleaning painted car parts. This helps you locate and access rusty areas more easily. For very dirty or very rusty surfaces, use vinegar or another mild acid suggested below, then follow up with foil."

    {
      "title": "Dip aluminum foil into water.",
      "content": "Dip aluminum foil into water. You can use any water, but saltwater is best, since the electrolytes and salts will help speed up the chemical process. Tear off strips of aluminum convenient to use on the rusted area. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rub the aluminum foil over the rust spots.",
      "content": "Rub the aluminum foil over the rust spots. Rub the aluminum foil back and forth over the rust spots. You do not need to use much pressure, although heavily rusted areas may require slightly more effort and a longer rubbing time. Dip the aluminum foil in water again whenever it gets dry. If you are working on a severely pitted surface then try wadding up the piece of aluminum foil. The edges that this creates will help to smooth down the metal and will actually fill in the pitted rust areas."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop every so often to remove the rust residue.",
      "content": "Stop every so often to remove the rust residue. Whenever the rust residue gets too thick, stop and wipe the residue using a rag or towel. This way you can see the remaining rust and continue rubbing it with the aluminum foil."

      "title": "Dry the chrome completely.",
      "content": "Dry the chrome completely. Water spots show up very easily on chrome surfaces, and can cause further rust of the metal below. Use a paper towel or blow dryer to dry the surface. If necessary, consult the section on follow-up care to repair damage and prevent further rust. Be sure to apply a coat of polish or wax on your clean chrome to prevent more rust from forming."

      "title": "Use cola, lime juice, or other mild household acids.",
      "content": "Use cola, lime juice, or other mild household acids. Any cola or soda that includes phosphoric acid in the ingredients can be used to remove rust. [3] X Research source Other options include lime juice or vinegar. These mild acids can remove rust without significant risk to the surrounding metal. Diet cola does not have sugar in it, so the process will be less sticky. However, the sugar does help the acid to adhere to the rust. Avoid strong or concentrated acids, which can etch and weaken the underlying metal. If these household acids are ineffective, try again with phosphoric acid, but keep a fan on to blow corrosive fumes away from your face."
