      "content": "Downgrade your iOS/iPadOS version to a previous one. If Guided Access was working on an older version of iOS/iPadOS, you can potentially roll back to that version. Go to ipws.me and see if there is a signed download for the iOS/iPadOS version that you want. Unsigned versions can only be used to update jailbroken devices, and jailbreaking your device is not recommended. Make a backup of your device so you don't lose any data, then download the signed IPSW you want. You can then restore your device with that IPSW. For in-depth instructions on how to do this, check out this wikiHow."
