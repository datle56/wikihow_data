      "content": "Create a sentence that needs a citation. Your sentence will need a citation if you paraphrase or quote parts of the Constitution. You can use information from the Constitution to back up an argument, such as arguing for a certain freedom in an opinion paper. [1] X Research source For example, you might write the following: \"In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.\" You may also write the following example that quotes the Constitution: The U.S. Constitution notes that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\""

      "title": "Add an in-text citation.",
      "content": "Add an in-text citation. An in-text citation generally goes at the end of a sentence, though in some cases it follows an author's name or article in APA. Nonetheless, for the Constitution, it will often go at the end of the sentence. [2] X Research source Start with the open parenthesis, followed by \"U.S. Const.\" and the amendment or article number. For an amendment, use \"amend.\" and for an article, use \"art.\" and \"ยง\" for the section. Follow with a close parenthesis. The citation goes before the period but after any quotation marks. Use Roman numerals for amendments and articles, and Arabic numerals for sections and clauses. The first example would look this way: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion (U.S. Const. amend. I). In the second example, you could add the citation after the mention of the Constitution: The U.S. Constitution (amend. I) notes that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\""

The basic format for citing the Constitution is the same for both in-text citations and end references. [3] X Research source An end citation would look like the following example: U.S. Const. amend. I."

      "content": "Add a date as needed. If an amendment or clause is currently in use, you don't need to add a date. However, if you're referring to an out-of-date part of the Constitution, you should add a date stating when it was repealed. [4] X Research source The date will go after the citation: Prohibition was the law of the land in the 1920s and early 1930s (U.S. Const. amend. XVIII, repealed 1933). The end citation would look like this example: U.S. Const. amend. XVIII (repealed 1933)."

[5] X Research source For instance, you can use the same example from above: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion.

Basically, you tell your word processing software to add a footnote at the end of the sentence, after the period this time. It creates a number that connects to the same number at the bottom of the page. [10] X Research source For example, your sentence would look this way: In the United States, citizens are guaranteed the right to freedom of religion. 1 The number will be in superscript, as it is in the example. To add a footnote, put the cursor at the end of the sentence. Choose \"References\" and \"Insert Footnote.\" The word processing system will do the rest."

The main reason you don't need the citation is that these are common documents that are easy to find, and the point of the end reference is to point the reader to the source. [11] X Research source"
