      "content": "Dry fresh lavender or purchase dried lavender. If you’re growing lavender in your garden, cut the stems so they’re 6 inches (15 cm) or longer. You’ll be able to use the entire sprig, including the flowers, to infuse the oil. Avoid using the thick, woody stems near the base of the plant, though. Pick the flowers just before they’re about to open. [2] X Research source Alternatively, buy dried lavender to make your oil. You can use any kind of lavender to make infused oil, including English, French, or Spanish. To dry lavender , tie the sprigs with rubber bands or a string and let them hang upside down in a dry, warm area for up to 2 weeks. Keep them out of the sun, which will cause oxidation and decrease the potency."
