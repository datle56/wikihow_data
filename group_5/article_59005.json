Everybody has their own insecurities, so it’s completely normal if you’re feeling that way. Whether your insecurities are related to your relationship or not, it’s okay to express how you’re feeling to your girlfriend and ask for some support. [1] X Research source You can’t control how your girlfriend responds when you open up, but it’s better to address your concerns early on so they don’t build up and come out later in the relationship. Your insecurities are valid and you deserve someone who will help you work through them. If your girlfriend thinks less of you because of how you’re feeling, that's a reflection of her, not you. There's a stigma that men in particular shouldn't express their insecurities since it will make them less attractive, but that's not true. Everyone has insecurities, and expressing how you feel doesn't make you unattractive (it just makes you human). Remember—honesty and communication are important parts of a healthy, long-term relationship. [2] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020."

[14] X Research source “These thoughts are my inner critic and I won’t listen to what it has to say.” “My inner critic is wrong and needs to go away. I look and feel amazing just the way I am.” Give your inner critic a silly title to separate it from the rest of your thoughts. That way, it won’t influence how you’re feeling as much. Try saying, “I’m not going to listen to That Old Witch,” or “That Old Witch is lying to me. I am worthy of being in a relationship.”"
