      "content": "Choose which level of license you want to get. There are 3 classes, or levels, of amateur radio licensing offered by the FCC: technician, general, and amateur extra. [2] X Research source Before you set out, it’s useful to understand each and decide which you want to pursue, which will determine how much studying and effort you’ll need to put into it. Technician is the lowest class, and is permitted to use amateur frequencies over 30 megahertz (MHz), which means you can talk to other local radio amateurs, plus some international short-wave. It only requires 1 exam that consists of 35 multiple-choice questions about regulations and best practices. A general license gives you some ability to operate on all amateur radio bands, and their various operating modes. It requires passing an additional 35-question exam. An amateur extra license gives you full access to all amateur radio bands and modes, and is the most difficult, requiring an additional 50-question exam on top of the 2 previous exams.

      "content": "Ham radio is a set of frequencies set aside for amateurs. “Amateur” just means you’re using radio for personal reasons, and as an individual. Commercial radio operates on its own bands, or groups of radio frequencies. These are separate from the 26 ham frequencies, which have been set aside for individual, personal use, and range from 1.8 Megahertz to 275 Gigahertz. [6] X Research source Ham radio operators can communicate locally, from radio to radio, or use satellites to chat across the globe."
