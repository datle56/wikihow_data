      "title": "Bob",
      "content": "Bob The bob is a tried and true style for thinning hair—it relies on the shape of your head for the look and uses your hair’s natural volume. Use a root lifting spray to add extra volume, and ask your stylist for blunt layers in the front to round out the shape. The classic bob is chin length, but you can also ask for a long bob (a lob) or a mid length bob. If your hair is very thin on top, consider getting a shorter cut—less weight means more body. If you want to keep your hair longer, try an inverted, asymmetrical, or layered bob. Inverted and asymmetrical bobs are longer in the front and shorter in the back (volumizing your roots), and the piecey-ness of the layered bob gives your hair dimension. Curl your hair with hot rollers or a curling iron to get even more volume."

      "title": "Short, natural curls",
      "content": "Short, natural curls If you have natural hair, it can be very easy to cover a thinning spot, as long as the hair around it is long enough to comb over. Get your hair completely wet, but not dripping, then work in a little bit of leave in conditioner and detangler until your hair is totally moisturized. Use a comb to gently move your hair over the balding area, then rub a soft bristled brush all over your hair to enhance your curls. [1] X Research source If you use relaxing products on your hair, consider stopping while experiencing hair loss. Textured hair is much easier to move around and use for covering spots, plus, relaxers can harm your scalp and contribute to hair loss. This method can work with longer hair, too, but shorter hair gives you more body."

      "title": "Short, natural curls with a side part",
      "content": "Short, natural curls with a side part For a little extra definition, follow the same moisturizing routine as the previous style, but stop before using the bristle brush. Once you comb your hair over any thinning areas, make a side part. Use several duckbill clips to clip down the sides of the part while it dries. [2] X Research source After you put in the clips, use the bristle brush to bring out your curls like in the step above. This style works best on short hair, about 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm)."

    {
      "title": "Blunt cut",
      "content": "Blunt cut Like the bob, the blunt cut is a short, face framing style that adds volume to your hair both vertically and horizontally. Cut your hair all in one layer, somewhere between your shoulders and chin. After you wash your hair, spritz it with a salt spray and blow it dry to give it a lot of volume. Once again, the shorter the cut, the easier it is to lift your roots."

    {
      "title": "Buzz cut",
      "content": "Buzz cut It may feel a little dramatic, but a sleek buzz can be a striking(ly beautiful!) look that practically anyone can pull off. Shave your whole head with a #2 guard on your clippers to draw attention to your face. [3] X Research source For more drama, give yourself a fade by shaving your sides with a #1 guard, then flicking the clippers up at the long edges to blend them. [4] X Research source If you’re fading your hair, change the clipper setting to “short” when buzzing your sides, then switch it to “long” when blending the edges. The platinum blonde buzz is an ultra popular, fun style to try—one of the best parts about short hair is that it’s easy to change—just keep in mind that bleaching your hair can sometimes make thinning more pronounced."

      "title": "Twist outs",
      "content": "Twist outs If your natural hair is long enough for twists, try twist outs! Start with freshly washed hair, then add leave in conditioner. Twist your hair in a 2 or 3 strand twist or flat twist, making the twists run across the top and straight up the sides. [5] X Research source Wear the twists overnight, then take them out and shape your hair over any thinning area. Flat twists are more difficult than regular twist outs (where you just twist pieces of your hair around each other), but they give you more definition at the roots. To do a flat twist section your hair and gently pull it taut, then detangle with a wet brush . Start at the front of the section, and grab two little strands. Twist the bottom one towards your face, then twist it up and over the top strand. Gather a little more hair in the new bottom strand, then repeat the process. Keep adding more hair and moving back until you’re no longer working on your scalp, then just keep twisting your hair over itself without picking up new strands. [6] X Research source For more defined curls, twist your hair when it’s wet or damp. For less intense curls, twist your hair dry."

      "title": "Top knot",
      "content": "Top knot If your hair is long enough, piling it up in a top knot is a great way to cover a thinning area or bald spot. Brush the front of your hair back and apply a gel or holding spray to keep it in place. Sweep the rest of your hair up to the crown of your head, then gently twist and wrap until it’s completely coiled. Tuck the ends into the knot, and tie it with 2 hair ties. [7] X Research source To add more volume at the top, don’t tie the ends of your hair into the bun."

      "title": "Flipped side part",
      "content": "Flipped side part To get a lot of body, spray volumizing spray into your hair, then blow it dry, focusing on the roots. Start on one side of your head and gently lift and back comb sections of your hair. Once you’ve moved all the way across your head, flip your hair back over to the side you started on, and fix it with hairspray . To get the extra deep part, start (and make the part) on the outside edge of your crown."

      "title": "Long pixie cut",
      "content": "Long pixie cut Pixie cuts are cute, relatively effortless styles that can effectively hide thinning hair with some clever cutting. Buzz your sides or cut them very short, and keep the hair on top long enough to comb back over the thinning area. If you want to enhance the volume of your hair, use a texture powder or hairspray. Another pixie-like hairstyle is the caesar cut. It’s short on the sides and top with slight, wispy bangs. If your hair isn’t thinning too much, simply grow it long enough to comb over the area."

      "content": "Loose french braid Starting at the front of your hairline, take three sections of hair and braid them, adding pieces of hair to the sections as you move back. Once you’ve finished and tied your braid, gently pull on pieces of it to add body and volume. Fully pull out the pieces of hair that frame your face. [8] X Research source Braid your hair by starting with three small sections at the top. Take the right section and put it under the middle, then take the left section and put it under the new middle (old right section). Keep repeating this pattern, picking up more hair with each crossing under, until all your hair is braided."

      "title": "Box braids",
      "content": "Box braids Box braids are protective and gentle enough on your head for thinning hair. Buy lightweight hair if you need extensions, and ask your stylist for small, feathered braids. If your braids are too heavy they can pull on your scalp and make thinning worse. [9] X Research source If you have a large, very thin patch, consider asking your stylist to braid cornrows over the area, then weave extensions into the braid. If you feel excessive tightness or pain, take them out. Do your research before going to a stylist—look for someone who has a lot of experience with thinning hair, since too tight braids can cause traction alopecia (a kind of hair loss).

[11] X Research source Gather about two thirds of your hair from the top and sides, then hold it together right above your crown. Tie it with a hair tie and you’re all done. Since it’s directly over the spot, it completely covers it. You can also add a little twist by putting your hair up with a claw clip or pulling it into a bun."

Pull the hair up, then use your left hand to smooth loose hair up and over the twist. Keep twisting counter clockwise until barely any hair comes above your head, then secure it with a claw clip. Leave the ends out for more volume on top. [12] X Research source Take out any face framing pieces of hair before twisting your hair .

Undo one loop of your hair tie, split your hair into a top and bottom section, then retie just the bottom section. Gently pull on your hair to tighten it, then flip the top section down and tighten that, too. [14] X Research source Be very careful while putting your hair in a ponytail.

Style your hair and part it where you want, then take one side of your hair and flip it over the part. Take a small strand and crimp it up near the root, then put another small strand over it. [17] X Research source Keep alternating crimped and non crimped strands, and stop 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) from your part. The goal of this style is to add volume without showing the actual crimped hair. Don’t crimp the hair framing your face, and leave enough hair behind at the part to totally cover all the underlying sections. Use a heat protection spray beforehand to prevent any damage to your locks and a mini crimper to get right at the root."

[19] X Research source Rub a hair texturizer into your hands and run them through your hair, starting half an inch (1.27 cm) from the root, then keep everything in place with some hairspray. Pull the brush up and forward while blowing out the top to give your roots more volume. Concentrate the majority of the mousse on the top of your head near the crown, since that’s where you want the most hold, and add a very small amount of styling cream to the ends, since too much can weigh down your hair."
