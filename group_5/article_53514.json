      "content": "THCA doesn’t get you high or cause intoxication like marijuana. After being heated, THCA will turn into THC and then have the ability to get you high—but it won’t make you feel high in its raw form. However, raw THCA or a THCA edible may still show up on a drug test and appear as marijuana. [1] X Research source Although not used for intoxication, many people use THCA to relieve inflammation, nausea, and pain, as well as arthritis and seizure symptoms."

You might be familiar with tetrahydrocannabinol, better known as THC, which is the cannabinoid that gives marijuana its characteristic high. [2] X Research source THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) is the cannabinoid that comes a chemical step ahead of THC—or, rather, THCA transforms into Delta-9 THC when it’s decarboxylated (smoked, vaped, or otherwise heated up). [3] X Trustworthy Source State of Michigan Official website for the State of Michigan Go to source The decarboxylation process happens within a specific temperature range; typically, 200 to 290 °F (93 to 143 °C)."

You can also buy it in crystallized form, or even as a patch that’s applied directly to your skin (without any psychoactive side effects). You can also shop THCA products like: Gummies Carts Joints Waxes Did you know? Some weed enthusiasts use crystallized THCA in addition to the THC-potent wax that’s typically used in a dab.

No other cannabis products (including THCA products) are regulated by the FDA, which is important to consider when it comes to your own personal consumption. [19] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Since THCA products don’t fall under the FDA’s purview, it’s hard to know how they manufactured (e.g., ingredient quality, exact potency) and if they got contaminated somewhere along the way. That’s why it’s super important to only buy products from dispensaries and sellers that you completely trust."

When push comes to shove, marijuana laws ultimately depend on the state you live in—but THCA, being non-psychoactive and different from THC, can be addressed with the federal Hemp Farming Act of 2018. This Act states that hemp with less than 0.3% THC can be excluded from the Controlled Substances Act (like THC-potent cannabis).

If you were to look at a really zoomed-in picture of a THCA molecule versus a THC molecule, they’d look almost identical, but the THCA one would be a little bit bigger. This larger THCA molecule can’t properly sync up with the brain’s CB1 receptor like the THC molecule does—in other words, it doesn’t get you high. [22] X Research source Your CB1 receptor is the component that really processes cannabis and its effects within the brain. This is different from your body’s CB2 receptor, which is based more in your body’s immune system. [23] X Research source Did you know? The number in Delta-8 vs. Delta-9 corresponds with where the molecule’s double-bond can be located from a chemical standpoint. With Delta-8, this specific double-bond can be located on the 8th carbon atom of the molecule; with Delta-9, it can be located on the 9th. [24] X Research source"
