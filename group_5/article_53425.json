Pull the two sections of hair over your shoulders, as if you are about to tie your hair into pigtails. The part in your hair does not have to be a severe straight line. You can have a messy, uneven part for a chic bohemian style. A zig-zag part can add a bit of funk to your style."

      "content": "Make the foundation braid. Choose a side to begin with. Take a small section of about .5 inches (1.3 cm) of hair from your hairline. Separate this section from the rest of the hair with your fingers. [2] X Research source Divide this section into three strands. Make the foundation braid by starting a standard braid . Take the right strand and cross over the middle strand. Then cross the left strand over the new middle. You may want to secure the other, loose side with a hair band. This will help keep it from accidentally getting combined with the side you are braiding. This foundation braid will be on the side of the head. Since you are making French braid pigtails, you should be braiding down each side of your head. The braids will sit just between the ears and the part. If you'd like a looser braid, you can start with a larger section. If you have very thick hair, you may want to work in larger sections."

Add a small section of loose hair to the left strand. Cross the left strand over the new middle strand while pulling the middle strand to the left. Keep your hands close to the head so the braid will remain tight. [3] X Research source Make sure to add an even amount of hair each time you add hair to the strands. This will keep the braids neat and uniform, instead of uneven."

You will pull hair from around the hairline in the front, and from along the part in the back. Each time you need a new layer, separate the hair you are adding in a horizontal line. [4] X Research source When you run out of hair to add to the braid, continue braiding in a traditional 3-strand braid. Make sure to keep the braid tight as you braid. This can be achieved by pulling the sections away from each other. If you're braiding your own hair, keep both of your arms on one side instead of holding them over your head since it will be easier.

If you would like an alternate style for French braid pigtails, instead of braiding all the way to the ends of your hair, stop at the nape of your neck. Secure the French braid with a hair tie. The hair hanging over your shoulders will be loose, so you can straighten or curl these strands. [7] X Research source Another alternate style for two French braid pigtails is a bun. After finishing one of the French braids, pin the tail of the braid into a bun at the back of your head by wrapping the tail around. Secure with bobby pins. Repeat with the other side, pinning the other braid on top of the bun. Use as many bobby pins as necessary to hold the bun in place. [8] X Research source"

Make the foundation braid with a traditional braid - cross the right strand over the middle, and then cross the left strand over the middle. These braids will be small strands that curve around the back of the head to meet in the middle. You are not trying to braid all of your hair into the strands. An alternate way to do this same style is to create two larger braids. This will give a slightly different look to the style. Follow the same steps, but add more hair. The larger braids will angle downwards more than the smaller braids, which means they will meet just underneath the crown instead of in the middle of the head. [9] X Research source When you start the braid, angle the braid away from the face, towards the back of the head. Don't angle it down."

If you style into a ponytail or bun, the two French braids will rest just above the ponytail or bun. You can also join the two braids into a single, 3 strand braid that goes down your back. To do this, combine the left and middle sections of your left braid into 1 left strand, combine the right section of your left braid and the left section of your right braid into 1 middle strand, and combine your middle and right sections of your right braid into 1 right section.
