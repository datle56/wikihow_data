      "content": "Add the liquid of choice. Most fluids of a watery consistency, such as water, fruit juice, cream, and yes, even milk (including non-dairy milk), etc., will work equally well to combine with these ingredients, to make the pancakes. [1] X Research source However, there are a few caveats depending on whether you're making pancakes, crepes or waffles: Since crepes, pancakes, waffles, and an even a thicker batter for coating thin precooked meat pieces (ham, sausage, salami, etc.), will each require different amounts of fluid, giving a specific measurement is not possible. If you've never made pancakes, start by making the batter as if you were making a very thick gravy. Test to see if it's of the consistency that you want, then add dry mixture or fluid to adjust it to be thicker or thinner. Be prepared to experiment a little. For example: For a single deep Belgian waffle, you'd start with about 1/2 cup of fluid and add 3 to 4 level tablespoons of the dry mix while mixing and add dry mix or fluid until it gets to the thickness you want."

      "content": "Mix to combine. The batter is ready when it is suitably pourable. As already noted, you'll be wanting a thick, pourable batter for waffles, with it being a little thinner for pancakes, and very thin for crepes. [2] X Research source Cobbler recipes can use this batter. If you mix fresh fruit, sugar, and a thickener (your own recipe) for a fruit cobbler you can use this recipe for the topping. Just use less fluid to make a very thick paste that you can spread with a wet spoon or spatula. You may like to add about twice the sugar to sweeten the final topping. If you want to flavor the pancakes, see Tips below for ideas."
