      "content": "Dry out used coffee grounds by baking them on low heat in the oven. Remove the used grounds from the coffee maker and sprinkle them in a thin layer on an aluminum baking sheet. Put them in an oven set to 175 to 200 °F (79 to 93 °C) and let them dry out for 1 to 2 hours. [1] X Research source Alternatively, place a paper towel on the baking sheet, spread out the grounds, and let them sit for 1 to 2 weeks in a non-humid room in your house. You can also use fresh dry grounds straight from the bag or tin."

      "content": "Place the grounds in a heat-safe bowl and form them into a small hill. Place 2 tablespoons (10.6 g) to ¼ cup (20.5 g) of grounds in a small or medium-sized glass or ceramic container. Use your fingers to create a small hill out of the coffee grounds, with the peak in the middle of the container. Cloves are EPA-classified as minimum-risk pesticides and can also be used as an insect repellent. [2] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Sprinkle 1 tablespoon (6 grams) into your coffee grounds for added repelling power. Bay leaves also contain an oil that can repel common household mosquitos.

      "content": "Add a wick or a few drops of lighter fluid to the grounds and light it. Stick a 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) candle wick in the middle of the peak of the coffee grounds. If you’re using lighter fluid, be sure not to add more than a few drops or the grounds may burn too quickly. Use a lighter or match the light the center of the grounds. This will create smoke, which can deter mosquitos, cockroaches, ants, wasps, and other insects in the area from going near it. [4] X Research source Coffee grounds contain caffeine and diterpenes, which act as a natural insecticide. The smoke also masks the scents that attract bugs, making it harder for them to locate their targets. [5] X Research source Make sure the immediate area is free of animals or children and try to avoid leaving the fire unattended."

      "content": "Place the coffee grounds in a spot upwind or near your window. If you’re sitting outside, place the coffee grounds so that the smoke blows towards you to ward off insects flying nearby. Placing the coffee grounds in an open window can help prevent bugs from entering your home. To increase the smoke and help the grounds smolder, cover the fire with a damp towel. For best results, burn coffee grounds while using other mosquito control methods like wearing an EPA-registered insect repellent .

If you have areas in your yard with stagnant water, where mosquitos often breed, sprinkle 1 tablespoon (5.3 g) of freshly used coffee grounds per 1 cup (0.24 L) of water. Used coffee grounds have been shown to kill mosquito larvae and slow down adult mosquitoes from laying eggs. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source One study found that light-roasted coffee grounds are most effective, but you can use any kind you’d like. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try not to add coffee to ponds or large pools of water that link to larger waterways or that animals need to survive. Another study found that coffee ground extract can deter the main pests of the green bean plant.

Add 9 cups (2.1 L) water to 1 cup (82 g) coffee grounds and spray the mixture on a sample of leaves on plants where slugs have been. Wait for a few days to see if there’s leaf burn or other damage, then apply it to all your plants. The caffeine can cause slugs to leave the treated soil and die. [10] X Research source Add any leftover grounds to a compost container or worm bin to make a homemade compost that can improve your plants’ soil and growth. [11] X Research source You can also add the used coffee grounds to acid-loving plants like hydrangeas and nutrient-hungry plants like roses. [12] X Research source Caffeine can prevent weed growth, but it may also reduce plant growth, especially in tomatoes. [13] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source While most of the caffeine in used coffee is transferred to the water during the brewing process, used grounds might still contain trace amounts."
