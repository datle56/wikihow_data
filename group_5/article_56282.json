      "title": "You’re courageous and full of adventure.",
      "content": "You’re courageous and full of adventure. The stereotype about Sagittarians goes that they can sit still, and, well, is it a stereotype if it’s true? As a Sagittarius Jupiter, you’re always on the move, always looking for your next great adventure —and usually trying to rope your friends into the chaos with you! As a mutable fire sign, Sagittarius is all about excitement, exploration, and travel. Jupiter, meanwhile, is the planet of intellect, religion, and philosophy, so as a Sagittarius Jupiter, you’re always looking to learn new things and have new experiences. Famous “Sadge” Jupiter celebrities include lot of dreamy creatives like William Blake, Hans Christian Andersen, Vincent Van Gogh, William Butler Yeats, Margaret Mitchell, Jackson Pollock, Yves Saint Laurent, Billy Crystal, Stevie Nicks, Cat Stevens, Michael Stipe, and Tupac Shakur."

      "title": "Curious",
      "content": "Curious Jupiter represents intellect and understanding. It rules over philosophy, religion, and new ideas. It also just so happens to be the planet that rules Sagittarius, a sign famous for a yen for exploration. As a Sagittarius Jupiter, then, you’re extremely curious and long to know the reason behind things others may take for granted: why does the sun rise? What happens after we die? Where does the subway turn around? Your thirst for understanding makes you a beloved friend among your social circle. While you may sometimes hold too tightly to your own ideas, your curious and nonjudgmental attitude draws people out of their shell and makes them feel seen and understood."

      "title": "Adventurous",
      "content": "Adventurous Sagittarius is the courageous traveler of the zodiac, and as a Sagittarius Jupiter, you’re always on the go, go, go. [1] X Research source You’re constantly on the hunt for the next grand new experience, the next mountain to climb, the next language to learn or rare flower to smell or new cuisine to taste. In times of personal crisis (or just plain boredom), you may impulsively jet off to a new locale to spend a week—or to stay indefinitely! Just be aware that sometimes your need to be “anywhere else but here” can cause damage to your relationships (as well as to your bank account). Staying in one spot too long might go against your nature, but work on being less impulsive about your travels: try putting all your ducks in a row before taking off on your next round-the-world adventure. You’ll find there’s value in sitting still—once in a while."

      "title": "Visionary",
      "content": "Visionary Your adventurousness and sense of curiosity naturally lead you to see the world through a bright, unique lens. You’ve learned so much and had so many experiences that you find it not only simple, but fun, to solve problems and easily envision many possible solutions to issues others are stumped by. Because of your ability to understand and envision new perspectives and your eagerness to engage with different viewpoints, you tend to attract friends easily."

      "title": "Optimistic",
      "content": "Optimistic Curiosity goes hand in hand with eternal optimism: you’re confident that the answers to the problems of life can be found through more exploration and understanding. Your friends and colleagues love having you in their corner not only because your visionary mind can help them solve problems, but because your generally cheerful, optimistic attitude encourages everyone in your orbit. Just be mindful that your optimism doesn’t come across as dismissive: despite your nonjudgmental tendencies, you may sometimes cling too much to your own perspective. [2] X Research source Whether you’re right or not, try to avoid letting your general optimism and love of adventure make people who are less outgoing or positive feel belittled."

      "title": "Sagittarius Jupiter is very loyal in relationships and marriage.",
      "content": "Sagittarius Jupiter is very loyal in relationships and marriage. You’re fairly picky about who you date and marry, so when you do commit to someone, you’re head-over-heels attached. Your natural enthusiasm and excitement means you 2 always have a blast together—just make sure they love to travel and that they’re comfortable with you taking the lead. [3] X Research source You and your partner aren’t likely to get bored any time soon. Whoever you end up with is sure to be adventurous as well, and your shared sense of excitement and curiosity will keep your relationship fresh for decades to come."

      "title": "Sagittarius Jupiter may be a bit controlling in relationships.",
      "content": "Sagittarius Jupiter may be a bit controlling in relationships. Your optimism, visionary attitude, and sense of adventure are generally positives—but they can sometimes lead you to believe your way is the best way to do things. In a relationship, this may take the form of being a bit too controlling of your spouse or partner, or of trying to take on every responsibility in the relationship, regardless of your gender. Practice letting go and letting your partner be their own person, and realize that a relationship is healthiest when both partners put in the work. The controlling behavior comes less from a place of insecurity and more from a position of extreme attachment to your partner: you’re less likely to control who your partner can see or what they can do, but you may get overly involved in their life in an attempt to help them achieve success."
