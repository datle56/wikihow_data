      "title": "Identify the original manufacturer or producer of the product.",
      "content": "Identify the original manufacturer or producer of the product. If you purchased a product wholesale that was manufactured by another company and intend to export it, the product likely already has an ECCN assigned to it. Look on the packaging of the product, your invoices, or the product itself to find the name of the original manufacturer of the product. While other exporters may also know the ECCN for the product, it's typically best to seek out this information from the original manufacturer, which likely has a database of ECCNs for all of its products."
    },
    {
      "title": "Visit the manufacturer's website to find the ECCN.",
      "content": "Visit the manufacturer's website to find the ECCN. Companies that produce products that are frequently exported and subject to licensing typically have a database or ECCN index on the corporate website. You can search the database using the name or part number of the product. [1] X Research source For example, if you needed to find an ECCN for an HP product, you can search on the HP Part Classification Lookup engine for the part number. Since the ECCN may be affected by the country to which you're shipping the part, you would also select the name of the destination country. Some manufacturers may require you to have an account to look up ECCNs. For example, Honeywell has an ECCN Part Lookup Tool for its aerospace division, but you must have a purchase account to access the tool. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Contact the manufacturer if the ECCN isn't listed online.",
      "content": "Contact the manufacturer if the ECCN isn't listed online. Smaller companies may not have their databases or ECCN indexes available online. Use the contact information you have for the manufacturer to call and ask for the ECCN for the product you have. Before you call, make sure you have all the necessary information for the product, such as the manufacturer's official name for the product, the part number, or the serial number."

      "title": "Identify the appropriate CCL category for your product.",
      "content": "Identify the appropriate CCL category for your product. The CCL organizes all ECCNs into 10 broad categories. Evaluate the general characteristics of your product to decide which category your product falls into. The 10 categories are: 0: Nuclear Materials, Facilities, and Equipment 1: Materials, Chemicals, Microorganisms, and Toxins 2: Materials Processing 3: Electronics 4: Computers 5: Telecommunications and Information Security 6: Sensors 7: Navigation and Avionics 8: Marine 9: Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment"

      "content": "Choose which product group your item falls into. Each category is further subdivided into 5 groups. The groups are the same for every category. The number for the category and letter for the group are the first 2 characters of the ECCN. The 5 product groups are: [3] X Research source A: Systems, Equipment, and Components B: Test, Inspection, and Production Equipment C: Material D: Software E: Technology"

Scroll through the list until you find the category and group you've chosen for your product, then read through the products listed until you find a match. [4] X Research source For example, suppose you're exporting demolition blocks and detonators for construction projects. The CCL lists \"0A604\" as \"Commodities related to military explosive devices and charges,\" which includes your product. Therefore, the ECCN for your product would be 0A604. The last 3 numerical digits identify the reasons the export of the product should be controlled. As an exporter, it isn't necessary for you to understand the significance of these numbers. Once you've found your product on the CCL, read the \"License Requirements\" section to find out if a license is required."

      "title": "Check the license exemptions to confirm your product isn't exempted.",

Specific exemptions are listed in Part 740, available at https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title15/15cfr740_main_02.tpl . Exemptions typically relate to who's receiving your products and what they intend to do with them. [5] X Research source For example, if you're exporting products that normally require a license as a humanitarian donation to a nonprofit organization, your products would be exempt from the licensing requirement. Also check the country chart, included in Part 740 as \"Supplement 1.\" Even exempt products may require a license before you can export them to particular countries, as shown in the chart."

When you request a commodity classification from the BIS, you can attach any supporting documents or information you believe would help the licensing officer who processes your request better understand your product. Documents such as product specifications, marketing brochures, and patent applications can help the licensing officer determine how to classify your product. If you find any documents that you'd like to submit in support of your application, scan them so that you can submit them electronically. Note that the SNAP-R service only accepts PDF files.
