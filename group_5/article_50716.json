      "content": "Start with a personal greeting. Since you’ll likely be writing several thank you cards, you may be tempted to simply write the recipient’s name at the top of the note to save time. Try to resist this impulse! It’s best to open your card with a warm, personal greeting to show the recipient how much you appreciated their attendance at your baby shower. [1] X Research source For example, instead of simply writing “Erica,” at the top of the card, write “Dear Erica,” or even “To my dear friend Erica.”"

If they couldn’t make it to the shower but mailed you a gift, thank them for this, as well. “Thank you so much for coming to my shower and celebrating with me. It meant so much that you were there!” “Thank you for sending such a generous gift! I can’t wait to see you and thank you in person sometime soon.”"

Reiterate how thankful you are for their attendance at the baby shower and their gift, and let them know that you appreciate their friendship and support. If you’re close to this person, you can also throw in something about how excited you are for them to meet your new baby. [3] X Research source “We appreciate your gift, and we’re so glad you could make it to the shower. Baby Diego is so lucky to have you in his life, and so are we!” “Thank you so much again for being there last Saturday, and for your generous gift.

      "content": "Fill your thank you card with a warm, personal message. Tell them how much you appreciate their love and support at this special time, and let them know how excited you are for them to be in your baby’s life. Here are some examples: “Dear Caitlyn, Thank you so much for coming to the shower last week, and thank you for the gorgeous hand-crocheted baby blanket! It’s going to look so lovely in our little one’s nursery. I’m so grateful to be your sister-in-law, and I can’t wait for our baby to meet their amazing aunt and adorable cousins.” “To my very best friend, Thank you so much for making my baby shower so special, and thank you for the beautiful picture books you picked out for our little nursery library! I’m so lucky to have someone like you in my life, and so is baby Liam.” “Dear Jessica, It was so lovely to see you at my baby shower this past weekend! Thank you so much for coming, and thank you for the adorable onesies—I absolutely can’t wait to dress Arthur up in them.” “Dear Jade, thank you so much for being there on my special day.

I’m so thankful Rosie is going to have someone as wonderful as you in her life!” “To my kind and generous friend, thank you for celebrating baby Bella with me, and thank you so much for contributing to our nursery fund! Your gift is helping us create the perfect nursery, and we could not be more grateful for you.”"

      "content": "Thank your coworker for taking the time to come to your shower. Be sure to thank them for being there for you, and let them know you appreciate their gift. In general, it’s best to send each individual coworker a personalized thank you card, but if they pooled their resources together to get you one present, you can write a single thank you message and send it in a group email or text, if you prefer. Here are some examples: “Dear Elio, Thank you so much for coming to my baby shower, and thank you for your beautiful gift! I had no idea diaper bags could be so stylish and fashionable. You’re the best work bestie I could ask for, and I can’t wait for you and baby Jackson to meet!” “Dear Jasmine, I’m so thankful for your support and wise advice as I welcome my first child. It was so great to see you at the baby shower, and I’m in awe of the beautiful hand-knitted boots you made for the baby. I’ll miss you during my maternity leave!” “Dear Casey, Thank you for making my baby shower so special, and thank you for the adorable pajamas you picked out for Mason. The little bears are so cute, and I know he's going to love them. I’m so grateful to work with such a thoughtful, generous person!” “To the best coworkers I could ask for, Thank you all for coming to my baby shower! I feel so lucky to have such a kind and supportive community surrounding me at work, and I’m so excited to read the set of picture books to Lily.” “To my wonderful coworkers, Thank you for the generous gift card—you made it possible for us to get our dream stroller! I’ll miss you all during my maternity leave, but I can’t wait to bring baby Gabriel to the office to meet you.”"

Here are some examples of what to say: “We missed you at the shower, but thank you so much for sending such a generous gift! We can’t wait to use it for finishing touches for Isla’s nursery.” “Thank you for sending us such a stylish baby carrier! I love it, and I know Paxton is going to love it too. We missed you at the shower, but we can't wait to get together sometime soon. Maybe Paxton will be here by then, and he’ll be able to have his first play date with your kids!” “It was such a lovely surprise to receive the adorable baby outfits in the mail. Thank you so much—Oliver’s wardrobe just got a million times cuter! I missed seeing you at the shower, but I know we’ll find time to catch up soon. Hopefully we can get together once Ollie is born!” “Your presence was definitely missed at the baby shower (a party is never the same without you!) but we’re so thankful for the lovely bassinet you sent us. It’s so beautiful, and it goes perfectly with our decor. Let's get together once Luna is born so we can thank you in person!”"

It’s always best to send thank you cards as soon as possible after your baby shower, but sometimes life gets in the way. Don't worry! Your guests will understand that this is a super busy time for you, and they'll appreciate your belated message. Here are a few examples of what to say: “I’m so sorry for my delay in sending this card—time has been flying by during this pregnancy! I had such a wonderful time with you at my baby shower, and I’m so thankful for the mobile you got for Ellie. We set it up above her crib, and I know she’s going to love the beautiful moon and shooting stars!” “Please accept my apology for my delay in sending this card! Our hands have been full with preparations for baby Jules, and time got away from us. Thank you so much for making my baby shower so special, and for the beautiful hand-knit sweater. We can’t wait to dress Jules up in it!” “There is one upside to sending out thank you cards this late—you get to see real photos of baby Kai with your gift! Please enjoy this picture of Kai snuggling the teddy you got him. He absolutely loves it!”"

      "content": "Send your thank-you notes within 1-3 weeks of the baby shower. In general, you should aim to send out your thank you cards no later than 3 weeks after your shower. This shows your guests how much you appreciated their attendance and their gifts. [4] X Research source It’s also helpful to send your cards out quickly so that you remember who gave you each gift—the longer you wait, the more likely you are to forget (or to lose your list if you made one)! However, if life gets too hectic and you aren’t able to write your thank you messages within this time frame, don’t be afraid to send a belated card. A delayed thank you message is better than none!"

      "title": "Keep a log of all the gifts you receive.",
      "content": "Keep a log of all the gifts you receive. It can be tough to keep track of who got you each gift, so it’s a good idea to document this information. You can write your log by hand, in your notes app on your phone, or on your computer—whatever’s easiest for you. While you open presents at your baby shower, ask a trusted friend to add each of them to your list, so that you can stay in the moment. You can then add any other gifts that get sent to you after the baby shower on your own."

      "content": "Pick out stationery that you love. Writing thank you cards is more fun when you're using beautiful stationery. You can even pick stationery that goes along with the theme of your shower. For example, if your shower had a celestial theme, you could choose thank you cards with stars on them. Or, if your baby shower decor was inspired by the season of spring, you could choose stationery decorated with flowers, insects, or animals."

      "content": "Write a few thank you notes each day until they’re all done. If you try to write all your thank you cards in one go, you may get overwhelmed. Instead, try to set a daily goal for how many thank you cards you’re going to write, so that you can chip away at them bit by bit. When you spread out the work over a longer period of time, it’s much less stressful!"

      "content": "Send your thank you notes before the baby arrives. Once your little bundle of joy makes their appearance, you want to be able to focus on being a parent and bonding as a family, rather than frantically writing thank-you cards. For this reason, it’s best to send your thank you cards before your baby is born, if possible."
