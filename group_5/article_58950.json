      "content": "Use mold remover to kill visible spots of mold. Mold spores in the air are often directly caused by mold growing inside your home. By eliminating spots of visible mold, you will significantly reduce the amount of invisible mold spores in the air. [1] X Research source To identify visible mold , look for fuzzy stains that are black, green, or white in color, in enclosed spaces and rooms with a lot of moisture, such as the basement. Use sprayable mold remover to kill mold on hard surfaces, such as glass or tile. For mold on surfaces that are more difficult to clean, such as drywall, consider seeking professional help. Chemicals like bleach and hydrogen peroxide can also eliminate mold spores. Bleach can be harmful to health, though, so use it with caution. Always wear protective gloves and a mask and work in a properly ventilated area."

For best results, place purifiers in each room of your house to ensure maximum efficiency in killing the spores. [2] X Research source Purchase a quality air purifier at any home improvement store and at most mass retailers. Closely follow the instructions on the air purifier for effective results. Be sure to use air purifiers with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters, as these capture more than 99% of particles in the air."

      "content": "Install filters on air-conditioning units and windows. If mold spores in the air aren’t being caused by mold growth in the house, they are likely coming in from outside. Place HEPA filters on your air conditioners and windows to prevent outside spores from getting into your house. [3] X Research source Be sure to also keep the air conditioner’s drip pans and drain lines clean and dry so that mold does not grow in them. Pay special attention to your windows if you live in a humid area. Poorly insulated windows can pick up a great deal of condensation, which makes them very hospitable for mold, while open windows allow easy indoor access for mold spores from outside."

      "content": "Use a natural remedy, like vinegar or tea tree oil. Natural remedies are environmentally-friendly ways to eliminate mold spores without resorting to harsh chemicals. Vinegar’s acidic properties break down mold spores and prevent growth, tea tree oil is a natural antifungal and antibacterial agent, and baking soda helps eliminate moisture in the air. Here’s how you can use each to get rid of spores: [4] X Research source Vinegar: Mix equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle, then spray areas with mold growth. Let it sit for an hour, then wipe away with a cloth. Tea tree oil: Mix 10 drops of tea tree oil with a cup of water in a spray bottle, then spray areas with mold growth. Let it sit for a few hours before wiping away with a cloth. Baking soda: Mix 1/4 tablespoon of baking soda with a cup of water in a spray bottle. Apply it to areas with mold growth and let sit for a few hours before wiping away with a cloth."

As mold thrives in humid environments, eliminating excess moisture in your house goes a long way towards preventing mold and reducing spores in the air. [6] X Research source Place dehumidifiers in problem areas or rooms with visible mold to reduce or prevent mold growth. If you’re unsure which rooms the mold is coming from, use a whole house dehumidifier linked to your central air system. Set dehumidifiers to 50% humidity or lower; anything higher will encourage mold growth."

In addition to treating large spills, leaks, and floods, take steps to get rid of excess moisture following everyday activities like bathing or dishwashing, as even small amounts of water can enable mold growth. For example, wipe down bathroom floors and walls after taking a shower, and don’t leave wet clothes in the washing machine after they’ve been cleaned. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Make sure any spills or leaks you come across are dried within 24 to 48 hours. Mold can grow quickly in spaces with even slight amounts of excess moisture.

Monitor these areas for signs of excess water, such as leaks and flooding, and take rapid steps to address these issues to prevent mold growth. [9] X Research source In the kitchen, mold is particularly likely to grow in refrigerator drip pans, door seals, and garbage pans. [10] X Research source Watch out for mold growth on bedding, clothes, and old papers, as these are common places to find mold. Regularly check under sinks for leaky pipes, as these will create wet environments amenable to mold growth. Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom to vent moisture in these problem areas, making sure to place the fans so that they vent outside of the home. Clean exhaust fans once every 3 months, and make sure appliances that produce moisture, like dryers and stoves, do not vent into your attic. [11] X Research source"

Keep carpeting out of the basement to prevent moisture build-up and mold growth in the flooring. Instead, consider using linoleum or concrete flooring, as these materials don’t hold as much moisture as carpet does. [12] X Research source"

Breathing in mold can cause allergic reactions and respiratory symptoms, especially for those who have a pre-existing respiratory condition, like asthma, allergies, or emphysema. In severe cases, mold spores can trigger asthma attacks, worsen respiratory conditions, or even cause lung infections. [16] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Those with weakened immune systems, like children, the elderly, and those with chronic illnesses, are more susceptible to these health issues. People who have HIV/AIDS, are chemotherapy patients, or organ transplant patients are also likely to be more sensitive to mold. If you do not have one of these conditions, you likely won’t have a strong reaction to mold, but it is still possible. For everyone’s safety, it is best to remove all sources of mold and mold spores as soon as possible."

      "content": "What are mold spores? Mold spores are the reproductive cells of mold, invisible to the naked eye. They float through the air, dormant, until they find a moist area to establish a new mold colony. Mold spores are a natural part of the environment, and small amounts are generally harmless to people who don’t have any underlying health conditions.
