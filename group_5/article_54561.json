You don't have to grin from ear to ear, either; just a simple, subtle smile will do the trick. Try these variations: Smile slowly. If you're looking at someone but not talking to them, try letting a slow smile spread over your face instead of breaking into a huge grin. Slow, languid smiles are generally considered attractive. Smile when you make eye contact . If you're suddenly looking into someone's eyes, toss in a smile for extra appeal. (If it's a genuine smile, the other person will see it without even looking at your mouth — it will crinkle your eyes, and is known as a Duchenne smile.) Try smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. Make your whole face light up when you smile."

If you don't already know the person you're flirting with, an introduction (or lack of one) can be a great thing to build flirting around. Avoid the urge to have a cheesy pick-up line. Saying \"Hi\" followed by an introduction or a simple question is much more effective and less forced. [4] X Research source If your crush doesn't know your name and you're a naturally gregarious person, try introducing yourself at some point. It can be as simple as, \"Hi, I'm [name]. And you are...?\" Make sure you get the other person's name. To help yourself remember it, try repeating it after they say it to you. (Such as \"Lily. I love that name.\") Or, if you want to make yourself seem like a bit of a challenge, work to keep your identity a mystery for a little while. If the other person really wants to know, they will ask around or keep pursuing you. If the person you are interested knows another language like Spanish, pick up a few words of the language before you strike a conversation."

Try something like, \"I can't believe how much it's rained this week\" or \"This place sure is packed, eh?\" What you say isn't important — you are simply inviting the person to talk with you. Find common ground with someone you do know. If you've already met the other person, strike up a conversation based on a shared experience or interest. For instance, you might talk about a class you're taking together, or the train you both take to work. Again, the topic itself doesn't matter — what matters is that you're inviting them to interact with you. Gauge their response. If the person responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. If the person doesn't respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, they probably aren't interested in flirting with you. [7] X Research source"

Keep personal information (like money, relationships, education, and so on) out of it, unless the person enjoys intellectual debates. Generally, it's best to avoid debating topics personally relevant to either of you (like religion) and to instead talk about topics you don't have a personal stake in. It's easier to flirt when you're talking about fun things like your pets, reality television, or your favorite vacation spots. This doesn't mean you have to dumb yourself down to flirt, but it does mean you have to relax and avoid the deep talk for a while. Be playful and use humor. Being playful means not taking yourself too seriously, being a bit silly, playfully hitting your crush, or talking about something slightly offbeat or unexpected. It also means not putting too much pressure on yourself over the course of the conversation."

If you know this person is dating (or interested in) someone else, you can use this to your advantage in a compliment. Try weaving the compliment into the conversation . For instance, you could say something like, “I saw you play at the game the other day. I’m a huge soccer fan. How’d you get so good?” Be careful about complimenting looks .

The longer they go on, the higher your odds of running into an awkward silence. Let the other person come to you.

For instance, you might say, \"So, what are you up to on Saturday night?\" Try to keep this an open question, instead of one that requires a yes or no answer — you'll get more information that way. Don't ask someone what they are doing tonight , or even tomorrow. Try to schedule the date a few days out so that you don't come off as overly desperate. Suggest a specific event and ask if they would like to come along. This is the best approach if you're trying to arrange a group date. You could say something like, \"So a bunch of us were going to see a movie on Friday, and I'd really like it if you came with us.\" Be straightforward. If you're feeling extra confident, go in for the kill without any pretense. For instance, you could say something like, \"I'd really love to take you on a date. When are you free?\""

Instead of taking the easy way out and discussing you endlessly, encourage the other person to talk about themself. However, you can and should occasionally throw some personal facts in the person's direction to help them to ask questions about you in turn. The key is to leave it up to them to pursue an interest in things relevant to yourself. This tactic actually serves two purposes: Not only does it keep the conversation going, but it allows you to find out more about your crush. You don't need to know a lot about the other person to do this step. If you don't know them very well yet, you can ask: \"How did your day go?\" \"So, what do you do with your free time?\" If you do know the other person a bit, focus on a hobby or interest you're already aware of. For instance, maybe she's really into basketball, or you know he loves to read. \"Did you see the game last night?\" or \"Have you read any good books lately?\" would be great starts."

Here are some basic compliments you could use: If you don't know your crush very well yet, but you're working on it, use a compliment oriented in this direction. Say something like, \"It's so easy to talk to you,\" or \"I kind of can't believe I'm getting to know someone as interesting as you.\" Try weaving the compliment into the conversation.

Leaving a person slightly uncertain of the extent of your feelings for them can increase your attractiveness, giving you a bit of a mysterious edge. The point is not to make the person question whether you like them at all, but to make them wonder how much you like them. If you just openly say, \"I have a big crush on you\" or \"I've always thought you were so hot,\" then you're taking the mystery out of the exchange. Instead, you can send a text or a message that says something like, \"You looked cute in your new sweater today\" or another comment that is nice and flirtatious without giving it all away."

Though flirting should let the person know that you like them, you shouldn't make it seem like you're doing all of the work.

Try phrasing compliments objectively rather than subjectively. Here are examples of objective vs subjective compliments: \"I really like your eyes, they're so pretty.\" On the surface, this compliment may seem fine, and it probably would be appreciated. However, a common flaw in phrasing a romantic compliment is to constantly use the words \"I like/love *insert trait here*\". They tell the person that they've succeeded in winning your heart. This is great if you've already built up a solid relationship, but early on it can make you seem overeager. \"You have great eyes, they're very pretty\" . Although both compliment versions say that you like the person's eyes, this one makes it more of an observation than a personal opinion. It implies that you find the person attractive but doesn’t confirm it outright. As a result, your crush might feel both flattered and drawn to figure out how attractive you find them."

Make it clear that you're kidding. The drawback of using text to communicate is that you can't always read the emotion behind the words. If you're going to flirt with someone by teasing them, make extra sure that you're implying it's a joke. You can use winking smiley faces, all caps, or exclamation points to communicate this. Just don't overdo it with the emoticons or it'll begin to feel corny for the other person. If you've already sent something that could be interpreted the wrong way, make your meaning crystal clear.

As much as you might want to text this person forever, it's best to bow out before the conversation goes stale (as all conversations are bound to do at some point). The best way to avoid an awkward pause is to leave before one happens. Ending the conversation on a good note will lead your conversational partner to look forward to the next time you can chat. Set up your next interaction before you go. Throw out something like \"Hey, so I'll see you around tomorrow?\" or \"I'll talk to you soon.\" If you're chatting online , note that you enjoyed the conversation just before you leave. It doesn't have to be complicated — a simple \"This was awesome\" or \"I had a good time talking to you\" is enough. If you're texting, you can be a bit more casual about it. Be careful not to over-compliment your crush. Your compliments will have a lot less meaning if you bestow them for every single positive trait the person has.
