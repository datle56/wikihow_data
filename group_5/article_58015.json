      "title": "Lift the rubber latch connecting the camera to the mount.",
      "content": "Lift the rubber latch connecting the camera to the mount. The first step to getting the case off your GoPro is to make sure it is not attached to anything, be it a camera mount or the platform it comes with when first unpackaged. Looking at the base of the camera from the back, there will be a raised clip securing it to its platform covered by a rubber latch. [1] X Research source This is the piece you want to lift to reveal two prongs similar to a horseshoe shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pinch the two prongs together.",
      "content": "Pinch the two prongs together. Like a buckle clip you find on backpacks, you will need to apply some pressure to squeeze the two protruding prongs together so they can fit between the barrier walls on either side of them. These prongs are part of the camera case, and are used to attach the camera to all GoPro mounts, so when you detach the camera, they will come off the mount with it. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the camera forward to detach.",
      "content": "Push the camera forward to detach. While still pinching the clasps, push the camera away from you so the prongs fit between the two walls that are locking the camera in place. The widest parts of the prongs should be flush with the inner walls. This should be a smooth process without requiring much force, so if you are struggling you may need to pinch the prongs harder. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pry open the top latch.",
      "content": "Pry open the top latch. Hold the camera from behind and place your index finger on the front right corner of the latch and press your thumb gently along the long edge. With a little force, pull directly upwards with your index finger and the latch should pop open to reveal an oblong metal hinge. [4] X Research source The latch is the entire raised surface on the top of the case, with the edge along the front of the camera shorter than the edge along the back. If you look carefully you should be able to see the two hooks on the long edge holding the back of the case shut. For this step, imagine these hooks as acting as a hinge for the latch. With the GoPro HERO 3 cases, there is a button on the top of the latch to lock it down with a white arrow on it, and another arrow on the front right corner of the latch for the secondary release. Slide the button into the empty space beside it and hold it there to unlock it, then press the corner button and pull upwards to open the latch. This should be a relatively easy process involving little to no force."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the long side of the latch upwards.",
      "content": "Pull the long side of the latch upwards. The aim here is to unhook this side of the latch from back of the case. Starting with the short end of the latch pulled up as high as possible, lift the long edge straight upwards with your thumb. Be careful not to damage this piece, as its hooks are what keeps the case airtight and waterproof. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the back off.",
      "content": "Pull the back off. Now that the hook in unlatched, the back of the case should open easily. The hinge is at the bottom, so pull back on the top and let it hang down. This door is removable at the hinge, so be careful when you do this to make sure it stays together; you donâ€™t need to take it off completely to access your camera."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the camera out.",
      "content": "Slide the camera out. You will now be able to access the camera itself. [6] X Research source Tilt the case backwards and the camera should slide out easily. You may need to grab it with your fingertips and tug lightly, otherwise just be ready to catch it when it slides out."
