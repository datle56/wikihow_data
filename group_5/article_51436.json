[2] X Research source Divide the number of carbs in each item by the total number of carbs in the meal. Example: To figure out the percentage of carbs the oatmeal contributes take 22 (the oatmeal) and divide it by 46 (total carbs in the meal) to get 0.48. (Rounded to keep the math simple) Then do the same thing with the rest of the items so: Oatmeal - 22 / 46 = 0.48 Apple - 16 / 46 = 0.35 Yogurt - 8 / 46 = 0.17"
