Have the end fall about an inch out of your hand either towards you or away from you. This will determine whether the line will be coiled clockwise or counter-clockwise."

If the end is facing away from you, the coiling will be clockwise. The opposite will be true for left-handed coilers."

One simple way is to take the last length of rope and wrap it three or four times around the outside of the coils that you made, then thread the end through the upper of the area between the coils and pull it tight, the coil should now be secured and you can use the extra length to tie the coil to something in order to store the line."
