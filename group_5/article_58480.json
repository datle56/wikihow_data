      "content": "Poetic rizz is when someone uses poetic language to charm someone else. Metaphors, similes, imagery—you name it! Poetic rizz is all about taking lessons from the poets and turning pickup lines into charming or seductive poems. “Rizz” is shorthand for “charisma,” and when someone has or is using “poetic rizz,” it means they’re attempting to attract someone with beautiful words. [1] X Research source Poetic rizz can be cheesy and fairly simple. For example, “you stole my heart” is a common poetic rizz pickup line. You can’t really steal someone’s heart—it’s a figure of speech! This type of rizz is most commonly used on dating apps but can just as easily be used in real life. How do you know if it’s poetic rizz or not? If a line, compliment, or quote makes you swoon, it’s poetic rizz!"

      "content": "Not sure where to start when making up a poetic rizz line? Well, we’re here to help! We talked to professional writer Alicia Cook to bring you the best advice possible. Here’s what Cook recommends: Read poetry . What better way to learn poetic rizz than by learning from the poetic masters themselves? Look up poetry online, or flip through a poetry book of your choosing. As Cook says, the more you read, the more creative you’ll feel. Start with rhyme. If you’re stuck on what to say, go with a rhyme! Cook says this can help you start thinking more poetically. Think about a favorite song. When Cook has writer’s block when working on a poem, she remembers poetry is just like music. What would be your charisma or rizz’s rhythm and beat? Focus on imagery. Cook elaborates that imagery is one of the most analyzed pieces of a poem. This means it’s popular! So, when in doubt, opt for a rizz line that compares someone to a beautiful image. Be creative! No poem is the same, so no pickup line has to be the same. As Cook reiterates, “there’s no black or white way” to write a poem (or, in this case, rizz line)."
