[1] X Research source Transfer the chopped-up slices to an airtight container and eat them within 3 days to enjoy them at their freshest. [2] X Research source To keep the chunks from going brown, cover them in a tiny bit of orange, lemon, or lime juice. [3] X Research source What about whole pineapple? Whole, ripe pineapple lasts for 3 days on your countertop. [4] X Research source Confirm that the fruit is ripe by smelling for a tropical/fruity scent, successfully pulling off one of the leaves/fronds, and checking if the fruit “gives” a tiny bit when you press on it.

[6] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source As a general rule of thumb, frozen fruit is freshest when eaten within 8-12 months of freezing.

      "content": "Sterilize the clean jars and lids in boiling water. Place a canning rack or a kitchen towel in the bottom of a stock pot that’s big enough to hold all the jars and lids. Set the jars right-side up in the pot and nestle the lids and sealing rings in between them. Fill the insides of the jars followed by the whole pot with water until it covers the tops of the jars by at least 1 in (2.5 cm). Put the pot on high heat and bring the water to a boil. Boil the jars and lids for 10 minutes if you’re near sea level, and for 1 additional minute for each 1,000 ft (300 m) you are above sea level. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source For example, if you live in Miami, boil the jars for 10 minutes. If you live in Denver, give them 15 minutes. Use metal canning tongs to carefully empty and remove the jars and lids, then place them on a clean towel. Move on to the next step while the jars are still hot. Reduce the heat to low so the water in the pot remains hot."

[9] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source You can start this step while your jars and lids are sterilizing, rather than waiting until the jars are ready to pull from the boiling water.
