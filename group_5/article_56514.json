Confirm this information against your labels as well as the patient's hospital wristband (if inpatient) or health card (if outpatient). If using a hospital wristband, you should also match the patient's health number or medical record number (MRN) if present and if your hospital policy dictates. [2] X Research source"

Date of birth, age, and sex. MRN or health number plus the lab accession number. The tests to be performed on that specific sample. The tube colour or type, varies by facility.

      "title": "Place the label on the tube.",
      "content": "Place the label on the tube. Ideally, the lab label should be covering the tube manufacturer label to leave a small window so the specimen is still visible. The left edge of the label should be directly against the tube stopper. [6] X Research source It helps to roll the tube with your hands or fingers to ensure complete adhesion."

      "title": "Avoid incorrect placement or positioning.",
      "content": "Avoid incorrect placement or positioning. Labels should not: Be crooked or slanted. The barcode should be straight. Be wrinkled, creased, or torn. Be wrapped around the tube so the barcode is perpendicular, or folded over itself like a \"flag\". Be covering the specimen window, obscuring the view of the sample."

      "content": "Follow specific downtime procedures if IT failures prevent you from generating labels. At minimum, handwrite the patient's first and last name, MRN or health number, date of birth, time of collection in 24-hour format, and your initials or employee ID. You should write this information on a blank specimen label or on the tube manufacturer label using indelible blue or black ink."
