      "content": "Use bubble wrap or moving blankets to make moving easier. Wrap delicate furniture and items you can’t lift off of the ground entirely. This is also a good idea if the piece has sharp edges to prevent wall damage. Make sure the blanket covers all of the essential parts of your furniture that could get nicked during the moving process.

      "content": "Keep obstacles out of the way and give yourself room to work. Create a clear path for the furniture to avoid nicking things on your way out. If you hit obstacles along the way, you run the risk of damaging your furniture or even hurting yourself. Make sure you have an entirely clear path to move through that is wide enough for your widest piece of furniture and then some.

      "content": "Slide furniture across carpet fast with plastic slides. Furniture slides are small sheets of thin plastic that go underneath large pieces of furniture so you can slide them easily. Lift up one end of a dresser, armoire, or other large, sturdy piece of furniture and slide a furniture slide underneath all of the legs on one side. Slide another furniture slide underneath all of the legs on the other side. Push the top of the furniture piece or use the handles attached to the furniture slides to drag or push the piece of furniture on a carpeted surface. [4] X Research source If you push too hard on a tall piece of furniture, it could topple over. Try to push from the middle or the bottom area of the furniture to avoid accidents. You may need to use more than 2 furniture slides for long pieces of furniture."

      "content": "Put a small mat or rug underneath a piece of furniture for hardwood floors. You can slide furniture along your hardwood floors without scratching them by placing a small mat or rug underneath your furniture. Alternatively, you can also use specialized hardwood furniture slides . Either way, carefully lift one side of your furniture and set the mat, rug, or slide underneath as far as it will go. Then, lift the other side of the furniture to slide the mat or rug the rest of the way. Make sure it is underneath all of the legs of your furniture piece. [5] X Research source Do not use rugs or mats that have rubber pads on the bottom; they won’t slide along your floor. You can also use upside-down carpet squares in place of a rug, slide, or mat."

      "content": "Lean especially heavy items on a 2-wheel hand dolly. Grab a hand dolly if you’re using a ramp for a truck or you need to move heavy items alone. Gently slide the lip of the dolly underneath one side of the furniture as far as it will go. Slowly lean backward with the furniture until you can use the wheels of the dolly to roll your item safely. [6] X Research source Never use a hand dolly on furniture items that are taller than chest height. They’re too much of a fall risk. If you feel like you can’t safely get an item on a dolly or it feels unwieldy when you’re moving the dolly, stop. It’s not worth risking a disaster. Do not use a dolly with stairs if you’re by yourself unless you’re extremely confident you have total control over the item. Use a 4-wheel dolly for especially long or unwieldy items."

      "content": "Lifting straps make carrying clunky items a breeze. Lifting straps spread the weight of your furniture and give you easy to use handles or straps to put on or carry. To use a 1-person lifting strap, slide the strap underneath the base of the furniture piece. Put the straps over your shoulders or into both hands. Then, carefully walk with your furniture piece. [7] X Research source Never try to carry furniture pieces that are tall or extremely heavy with a furniture strap. If you feel the strap move while you’re carrying the item, set the item down and readjust the grip and strap."

Place the smaller items towards the front of the truck. This will balance the weight of the truck and make sure nothing topples over while you are driving.

      "content": "As you pack the truck, keep furniture safe by packing strategically. The biggest risk for your furniture is how it shifts while your moving truck is in motion. To make sure your furniture stays safe, pack smaller, softer items in between your large pieces, like boxes, cushions, and pillows. Make sure that your tall items are secure.

      "content": "Almost every moving truck has a built-in ramp, so use it! Moving trucks usually have metal ramps that pull down from the back of the truck. Park your truck on a flat surface near your home and pull out the ramp as far as it will go. Make sure the ramp is secure before you walk on it or put any furniture on it. [10] X Research source You may need more space than is provided in a parking spot to set up your truck ramp. Park your moving truck in an area with at least 20 feet (6.1 m) of room behind it to avoid hitting any other cars."

      "content": "If you can’t roll heavy items, use a lift to get them in the truck. Instead, use a hydraulic lift to raise items up into your truck. It’s just not safe to try lifting a 200–300 lb (91–136 kg) dresser or table. Place your furniture on a hydraulic lift table near the bed of your truck. Use the foot pedal to lift the furniture up to the height of your truck. Then, gently slide the furniture out into the bed of the truck.
