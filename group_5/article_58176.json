      "content": "Papyrus' goal is to join the Royal Guard and capture a human. However, this is solely based on his desire to be respected and recognized by others. While he may seem like an intimidating opponent, you don't have much to worry about. He's surprisingly kind at heart and values friendshipâ€”even with humans. This is what makes him a fan favorite and a popular choice for gifts and merchandise . He's the only enemy in Undertale with attacks that never kill the player; at most, the player's HP will be knocked down to 1 HP."

Your SOUL will be red for one turn and then change to blue for the rest of the fight. After lowering his HP enough, Papyrus will unleash a \"special attack\" that fails. You'll then need to dodge his basic attacks for a few turns. Afterwards, Papyrus will give up and you'll be able to spare or defeat him."

The attacks are as follows [1] X Research source : Blue attack : This attack was previously referenced by Sans , though he purposefully misled you. Blue bones will move across the Bullet Board, but you won't be able to dodge it. Let the blue bones pass. Your SOUL will then turn blue for the duration of the fight. Dodge the white bones by jumping. Dodge a few small bones and then a medium-sized bone. Dodge 1 small bone, 3 medium bones, and 3 large bones. This time, the bones will come from the left side. Dodge 1 large bone, 1 large bone (top), 3 small bones, 1 medium bone, and 1 large bone (top). Dodge 3 large bones, 1 blue bone (ignore), and 1 small bone coming fast from the right. Dodge 2 medium bones (jump through the middle), 1 large bone (top) coming from the right, and 8 bones that form an arc. Jump through the middle of 2 bones twice. Ignore the blue bone. Dodge 1 medium bone coming fast from the right. Jump through 2 sets of bones coming from both sides of the screen. A series of bone arcs will come from the right side. Jump to avoid them.

Once you jump over the dog and Cool Dude written in bones, you're nearing the end. Eventually, a large forest of bones will appear. Move the SOUL up on the Bullet Board. You should pass over a giant bone. The Bullet Board should be high enough to cover the lower half of Papyrus' face. The very last attack will be a small, slow-moving bone from the right side.

If you don't choose \"Flirt\" at least once, the post-battle \"date\" will only be a \"hang out\". After the fight, simply return to his house to begin the date."
