Then, let it sit for 2 to 3 minutes to heat up. Warming up the metal helps create a better eyelash curl, giving your lashes a curling iron-like effect. [4] X Research source Do not use a large spoon, like a serving spoon. The spoon needs to fit neatly over your eye so the curve of the spoon matches the curve of your eyelid. Ensure the water is warm, not hot. A very hot spoon can potentially burn your lashes or eyelids."
