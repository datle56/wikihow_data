      "content": "Steam out the wrinkles in your bathroom using a hot shower [2] X Research source Attach your veil to a hanger and let it hang on the door in your bathroom while you shower. You can also hang the veil on the bathroom door and let a hot shower run for 15 minutes. The steam from the shower will help release the wrinkles from your veil. Allow your veil to dry and check for wrinkles. If they still exist, you can repeat this step or try another method. Sometimes this steam method is not totally effective for heavily wrinkled veils. Note : Do not put the veil directly in the shower or on the shower door - it is to be put on the bathroom door, not the shower door."

      "content": "Lightly mist the wrinkles out using a spray bottle. Using a spray bottle filled with warm water (or a product such as a brand name Wrinkle Releaser), lightly mist your veil keeping the veil about 10 inches/25cm away from the mister. Make sure that the veil does not get wet, just lightly misted. Shake the veil gently to release the wrinkles and hang to dry."

      "title": "Place your veil in a dryer with a \"delicate\" setting.",
      "content": "Place your veil in a dryer with a \"delicate\" setting. Some of the newer dryer models have a \"delicate\" setting. Run your dryer for a few minutes to get it warm and then place the veil in the dryer for about 15 seconds on the delicate cycle. Remove promptly and hang up. Note: This method is not recommended for all veils types - veils with decorative beading, rhinestones, pearls or appliques which are glued on may have glue melting issues in a dryer."
