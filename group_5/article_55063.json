      "content": "Obtain the 7 Dragon Balls. You can get Dragon Balls by defeating Time Patrollers in Parallel Quests (PQs). [1] X Research source The most popular PQs for farming Dragon Balls are PQ 4, 7, 19, 23, 34, and 79. This is due to how quickly you can fight a Time Patroller or having an overall low completion time. The exception is PQ 79, which has two Time Patrollers which increases your overall changes for getting a Dragon Ball. It's best to switch between multiple PQs for farming Dragon Balls, as once you get a Dragon Ball from a PQ it's less likely to drop another one. [2] X Research source"

Repeat the quest \"The Hero Tapion Awakens.\" Make sure you select the instructor you're trying to max out as your mentor and your partner for the quest.
