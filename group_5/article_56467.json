      "title": "Look for signs or ask the person directly.",
      "content": "Look for signs or ask the person directly. There are many tells if people use magic, like certain talismans hung on the walls, certain bracelets or charms worn or put in their car/place of business, or the possession of an altar (but keep in mind that many different cultures use altars, including Buddhists and Catholics). Someone practicing witchcraft may also burn a lot of red candles, as well as use needles in their candles. Still, it's always best to get direct confirmation about a person's spiritual beliefs instead of making assumptions. Practitioners of Wicca have a Wiccan rede that is \"an' ye harm none, do what ye will.\" Wiccans follow this strict moral creed against doing harm to others; so, if you suspect that someone is cursing you, they likely aren't Wiccan. However, other persuasions of witchcraft may have looser codes."
