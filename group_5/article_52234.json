Dispense a few drops of regular dish soap into the opening of the bottle. Then, fill the bottle about halfway or more with warm or cold water. Avoid soaking the bottle in your sink as this may introduce bacteria. If it needs to soak, set it in a basin that you only use for washing bottles."

That way, the gravel or rice reaches all the nooks, crannies, and corners of the bottle. [3] X Research source This method is great for irregularly-shaped bottles, as the gravel or rice will reach areas that you may not be able to reach with a brush. Ensure your gravel doesn’t have sharp edges that can scratch the inside of the bottle. If you are concerned about scratches, use rice instead."
