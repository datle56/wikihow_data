Swirl a dab of glue on your real nail, and another dab of glue on the part of the fake nail that will be attached to you (not the part that will be sticking up). Carefully place the fake nail directly over your real nail so that the bottom curve lines up perfectly with your cuticle. Press it down and hold for 10 seconds to let it set. [8] X Research source Make sure the nail is set firmly against your real nail, with no gaps. Don't use too much glue. You don't want it to squirt out the sides. A few dabs will be sufficient. If glue does squirt out, use a cotton swab to gently wipe it away. Be very careful not to put the nail on crooked. The glue dries fast. Start applying nails to your dominant hand first."
