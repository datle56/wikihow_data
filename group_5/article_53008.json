      "content": "He's a little insecure. Shy guys might be shy around their crush because they feel a bit nervous about their flirting abilities and romantic history. In his mind, he's the most awkward person on the planet (even if you find him totally charming!). He probably really wants to talk to you, but he's too stressed about messing up, so he just can't bring himself to."

He might leave every conversation and obsessively think about all the things he could've done wrong. Eventually, this might cause him to clam up, especially around people he wants to impress.

To an introverted guy, you're this charismatic, easy going, amazing person, and so how can he possibly expect to get your attention? If he thinks you're really great, it might actually cause him to become even quieter around you."

Because he's in the presence of his crush! A shy guy will almost certainly be more nervous around someone that he really likes. If you notice that he's sweating, stammering, or fidgeting, that's definitely a sign that he's crushing out on you.

Shy guys might not be able to talk a big game, but that doesn't mean that he's not paying super close attention to the person he likes. If you mention your birthday or your favorite food, somehow, he never forgets it. When you get a hair trim or change your mascara, he's the first to quietly tell you that it looks nice.

A movie, a home-cooked dinner, or a walk through the park would all probably make him absolutely swoon."

Ask him thoughtful questions that give him room to for deeper explanations. Questions that can be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\" might not lead to great chats. Instead, try to find a way to open the door to a more meaningful connection. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Try asking him big about his passions or his dreams: \"If you could accomplish one thing in your life, what would you want it to be?\" For instance, you might ask him about something he loves so that he feels comfortable: \"You're so good at guitar. Why do you think you love it so much?\" Chatting through his childhood is another easy way to get deep: \"What's your happiest memory from childhood?\""

He's probably gone through life feeling like he never expresses himself fully; as a result, he might feel misunderstood. Make sure he knows that you see how great he is. For example, try to: [7] X Research source Let him know that you appreciate it when he opens up: \"Wow, thank you so much for sharing that with me. I know it's hard for you, and I think you're amazing.\" Tell him you love how much he values actions over words: \"Thanks for taking out the trash for me!

Not only will this make you feel better about your crush, but it'll also help him feel understood , too.

When someone gets vulnerable with you, your response is important; with an introverted crush, this might be especially true. It probably took your guy forever to pack up the courage and share a secret. So when he does, try to accept what he says, offer a kind response, and allow him to talk as much as he wants.

If things progress with your guy, you’ll eventually want to introduce him to your friends and family, which can be challenging for someone shy. Big gatherings or constant meetups might feel super overwhelming to him. So instead, to help your circle get to know your amazing guy on better terms, try staggering his visits with them. [13] X Research source For instance, instead of inviting him to a big NYE bash with everyone you know, start him off with a nice, relaxing dinner with your parents.
