Yes, you may suffer defeat or disappointment—perhaps you already have. But every wound is a lesson for the future, every wrong path or misstep serves as a guide for future travels. Take heart, and lean into the ruin: things often have to fall apart before new things can come together. [2] X Research source In some instances, the Reversed 10 of Cups may also suggest total ruin beyond repair or a dead-end Keywords: Survival, healing, liberation, light at the end of the tunnel, hopelessness"

      "content": "Upright The 10 of Swords isn’t exactly a friend to relationships. It predicts loneliness, betrayal, and breakups. If you draw this card in relation to your love life, it’s likely there’s already trouble in your love life—this card isn’t a warning, then; it’s a nail in the coffin. [3] X Research source If you’re in a relationship: You or your partner have hurt one another, perhaps through infidelity or another form of betrayal, or maybe you’ve grown distant and short with one another. If you draw this card, it’s time to really assess your relationship: is it what you want? The card demands an answer, even if it’s not one you want to give. If you’re single: If you’re looking for love and struggling to find someone you connect with, something may be blocking you. Is it possible you need to do some more healing from an old relationship or another past wound? Practice loving yourself and enjoying solitude; it’s hard work, but it may ensure your next relationship is healthier and more stable."

      "content": "Reversed If you draw this card upside-down, rejoice: you may feel exhausted and on the brink of collapse, but this is not the end, it’s only the darkness before the dawn. If you’re single, you may meet someone soon, whereas those in relationships will find renewed commitment and devotion for their partners. If you’re in a relationship: If you and your partner have been fighting or you’ve been considering whether to stay in your relationship, this card predicts your love will experience a second life. Stay the course, and it’s possible the storm will break. If you’re single: If you’ve been feeling discouraged or lonely lately, this time of suffering will come to an end eventually. Endure, and give yourself grace: you’re deserving of love, and it will come soon enough."

      "content": "Upright Take heed: you may be heading for collapse. This card predicts burnout at work, or perhaps difficult coworkers who will do whatever they need to get ahead, including bad-mouthing others. Your current position may come to an end soon, so try to prepare an exit strategy in case it’s needed. [4] X Research source Tip: This may sound scary or overwhelming, but try to see it as a blessing: the card knows how hard you work, and it likewise knows that working too hard will lead to exhaustion. Assess your career: are you where you want to be? Not just financially, but professionally? If not, consider leaving before you’re forced to: go where you want to go and where you’re wanted."

      "content": "Reversed Congrats: you’ve reached a new professional chapter in your life—or you will soon. If you’ve been struggling with burnout or a toxic work environment, that’s going to change soon. Maybe you’ll summon the courage to leave your current position, or the chaos afflicting you at work will pass on its own in the near future. [5] X Research source Tip: Being forced out of a job due to a toxic work environment may feel like the opposite of good news. But the 10 of Swords asks you to remember that every cloud has a silver lining—difficulty in the present may make room for a brighter future than you could ever have imagined."

      "content": "Upright In the days or weeks ahead, you’re likely to experience declining mental or physical health. You may be burning yourself out and your body is taking the toll. Take this card as a warning. Practice being gentle with yourself and your time in the near future, and you may minimize any health risks. Tip: Not setting strong boundaries in your personal or professional life could leave you taking on too many commitments and not having enough time for yourself. It can feel uncomfortable to say “no,” but your health may be counting on you to."

We know it’s hard to wait, but try to hang in there a little longer—better times are likely coming right around the corner. Tip: This card could also indicate a descent into dangerously poor mental health. In either case, be good to yourself in the coming days: surround yourself with loved ones and take time for your hobbies. Cuddle animals and take walks. Practice breathing."

      "content": "Upright This card foretells a rift in your spiritual or religious circle. You may be on the verge of abandoning your current belief system because it no longer serves you or you find you don't trust it any longer. Or you may simply need to find a new group, as members of your present circle may turn against you soon. Tip: This may mean a major upheaval, but getting out of a bad situation will make you happier, healthier, and more spiritually fulfilled in the long run. Take time to really consider what you believe and what you want from your spiritual environment: are you getting it right now? If not, what steps do you need to take to find it?"

Tip: If you're not already, take time every day to cultivate your spiritual side. Meditate or do yoga for a few minutes every morning, as this may help to center you and open your third eye chakra ."

      "content": "This card depicts a figure lying face down with 10 swords in their back. Most decks depict this card as a man lying on the ground, having been stabbed in the back with 10 swords. It’s an ominous card, certainly—this man has fallen victim to a violent surprise ending. And yet, despite this, the sun shines in the background. The sun may remind us that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel—or rather, in the sky. [7] X Research source"
