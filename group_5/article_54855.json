You should include everything, including things such as scarves and hats. When you do this you should also gather all the towels, bedding and cloth toys that you have used in the two days.

You can take these items to the dry cleaners and have them washed there. This is a way to clean the clothes without damaging them, while still killing the lice.[Image:Get Lice Off Clothes Step 3 Version 4.jpg|center]] This method could be used for woollen clothes that you don't want to shrink in a hot wash, or silk clothes that are too delicate for the washing machine. You should inform the person working at the dry cleaners about the lice so they can take extra care. You may be able to use a home dry cleaning kit if this involves you putting the clothes in the dryer on a high heat for at least fifteen minutes. As long as the clothes are exposed to a temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 5 to 6 minutes, the lice should be killed."

For example, this method could be used for leather and suede clothes. This method can also be used for other non-machine washable fabrics, such as wool and silk."

      "content": "Clean around the house. The chances of becoming infested by lice that have fallen onto the carpet or a piece or furniture are relatively small, but taking some further steps to tackle lice that may have escaped your body and clothes helps limit the chances of an infestation. Vacuum the floor and furniture, paying particular attention to where the person with lice has been. Wash bedding, towels and other cotton and linen material the person with lice has come into contact with. This step is more important for body lice, which generally live in clothing, than head lice.
