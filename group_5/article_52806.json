If you are constructing an altar for a specific purpose or holiday, you might want to look up details of that tradition online before you begin. Searching for photos and examples of similar altars is a great way to get started. Many people mix and match components of different religions, spiritual traditions, and cultures that have personal importance to them. Day of the Dead altars typically include pictures of saints and deceased relatives; candles; flowers, food, and drink. [1] X Research source You can make a similar altar in homage of a deceased friend or relative, using food and toys that person would enjoy. St. Joseph's Day Altars are constructed in many places on March 19th. They are usually constructed in three tiers covered with food and decorations, surrounding a statue of St. Joseph. [2] X Research source You can construct a similar altar to celebrate another holiday. After honoring the saint or holiday, eat the food with friends and family or give it to people in need of food."

It can also simply be a ritual you use to worship, without having to analyze its meaning."
