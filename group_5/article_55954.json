      "content": "Use a tire pressure gauge to check the PSI. Check the owner's manual to see what the correct PSI is for your vehicle's tires. Remove the end cap on each tire's air valve and stick the pressure gauge inside. Press down quickly and look at the reading. If the PSI is too low, add a little air to the tire. [1] X Expert Source Audra Fordin Certified Automotive Technician Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. If it's too high, press on the valve to release some of the air and check it again. [2] X Research source Use a digital tire pressure gauge or a traditional stick-type gauge for this. You can usually use a stick-type gauge for free at your local gas station. Check the pressure when your tires are cold. You won't get an accurate reading if you've been driving on the tires for a while. Check the inflation and adjust it (if needed) once a month. [3] X Research source A warning light will usually light up on your car's dash if there's an issue, though."

      "content": "Bring your car to an auto shop at least once a year for alignment. Only a professional can do this, so take the car to a mechanic. An alignment is usually pretty cheap ($50 to $75) and it doesn't take long. If the auto shop isn't packed, you should be in and out in no time. [4] X Research source Cars tend to veer slightly to one side or the other when alignment is off. [5] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source If your tread doesn't look the same on all tires (for example, the front tires look more worn down than the back ones), your wheels are probably out of alignment. Schedule more frequent checkups if you drive in an area with lots of potholes and rough terrain."

      "content": "Take your car to an auto shop for this every 6,000 miles (9,700 km). Many mechanic shops will offer to rotate your tires and do an alignment during the same visit. Regularly rotating the tires ensures they wear evenly, which prevents excess strain on the steering and suspension system. [6] X Research source When your tire tread wears down significantly, try to replace all 4 tires at the same time so they'll be perfectly balanced. If that's not in your budget, though, just make sure the new tire matches the size and shape of your current tires to prevent any problems."

      "title": "When you’re low on power steering fluid, the wheel may feel stiff.",
      "content": "When you’re low on power steering fluid, the wheel may feel stiff. Open your car’s hood and unscrew the cap on the power steering fluid reservoir. Grab the power steering dipstick (it's usually attached to the reservoir cap or located nearby ) and stick it into the reservoir. The fluid should be slightly above the refill mark. If it isn't, it's too low. [7] X Research source Fill the reservoir with fresh fluid until it's at the right level. [8] X Expert Source Audra Fordin Certified Automotive Technician Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. Then, start your car, turn the wheel back and forth, and check the reservoir again. If the level dropped, add more fluid until you're fully topped off. See the owner's manual to determine what kind of power steering fluid your car needs.

      "content": "If the fluid looks black or brown instead of red, it’s contaminated. Unscrew the cap on the power steering reservoir and drain the bad fluid into a bucket or siphon it out with a turkey baster. Hop behind the wheel, turn the key, and move the steering wheel from side to side a few times until the last bit of old fluid bubbles up; drain that, too. Refill the reservoir about 3/4 of the way with fresh fluid. Start the engine again and turn the wheel back and forth a few times to get the fluid flowing. [10] X Research source Then, fill up the reservoir the rest of the way with new fluid. [11] X Expert Source Audra Fordin Certified Automotive Technician Expert Interview. 13 January 2022. Check your car's manual to see what kind of power steering fluid it needs. Bring drained fluids to an auto parts store, recycling facility, or transfer station to be disposed of properly. Never pour fluids down the sink or into the trash.

      "content": "If you spot damage, get the belt(s) replaced as soon as you can. The serpentine belt or V-style belt (or possibly both, depending on your car) supplies power to your steering system. Pop the hood and check out your accessory belt(s) up close (use your owner's manual to locate them if you aren't sure). Look for damage like cracks, fraying, separating layers, cracks, or missing chunks on the underside. If you spot any damage, take your car to a professional ASAP to have the belt(s) replaced. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Replace your serpentine belt every 60,000–90,000 miles (97,000–145,000 km) as a preventative measure.

      "content": "This may be the issue if your car suddenly doesn't turn. Belts slip or lose tension when they’re almost at their failing point, and they’re most likely to slip around tight turns. If your car suddenly gets very difficult to turn, it might have a slipped belt. You'll probably hear a high-pitched whine, chirping sounds, and/or vibration noises coming from under the hood, as well.
