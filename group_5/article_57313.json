      "content": "Display 4-6 photos to increase your chances of getting noticed. Bumble might have a reputation for being a feminist dating site, but appearance is still the most important factor for most people. Your photos are about 75-80% responsible for getting people to swipe right. Pick 4-6 well-lit photos that show you in your best light. Include at least 1 headshot and a couple of photos that show off what you like. [1] X Research source For instance, you might include 2 close-up shots, 2 photos of you engaging in your hobbies, and 1 photo of you with your dog. Try to include at least 1 photo of you dressed up and at least 1 casual photo. Don’t use photos that have a filter, especially if it dramatically changes your look. Only choose photos with you in them. Don’t waste precious space by including photos of your pet or something you think is interesting."

      "title": "Use an attractive headshot of you in a red top for your profile picture.",
      "content": "Use an attractive headshot of you in a red top for your profile picture. You want your first photo to be the best one so people keep scrolling. Choose a headshot that shows you from the shoulders up. Try to pick a photo that presents something about you, such as what you do for fun. Ideally, you'll be wearing a red top in your profile pic because it will get people to stop. Additionally, don’t use a selfie if you can avoid it. [2] X Research source Use a professional photo for your headshot for best results. If you don't have professional photos, you might use a photo your friend took of you holding your dog at the beach. Alternatively, you could get your friend to take a picture of you at an outdoor festival."

    {
      "title": "Include photos that show a natural, everyday look.",
      "content": "Include photos that show a natural, everyday look. You likely want to show off your best looks, but this can make you look high-maintenance. If you’re a girl, the “girl next door,” natural makeup look will typically get more matches. If you’re a guy, photos of you in regular clothing will get more attention than gym or tuxedo pics. If you’re non-binary, you might choose photos that aren’t too gender-specific so people know not to expect you to be binary. Choose photos that represent how you normally look. If you usually dress to the 9s, you might decide to go ahead post photos of you going out. However, be aware that you may get fewer matches."

      "title": "Skip photos that show off a lot of skin unless your goal is casual sex.",
      "content": "Skip photos that show off a lot of skin unless your goal is casual sex. Most people interpret these types of photos to mean you’re looking for sex, whether or not that’s true. Men often perceive that women who show off their assets in their dating profile are easy and open to hookups. On the other hand, women often view shirtless photos on men’s profiles as a sign that they don’t want a serious relationship. To keep your intentions clear, leave out photos that might be misinterpreted. For instance, don’t post photos of you in the club or looking sexy in a hot tub."

      "title": "Say “no” to group photos.",
      "content": "Say “no” to group photos. You probably think that group photos make you look like a fun person. However, they’re actually really confusing for people because it’s hard to figure out which person you are. Plus, it’s likely that some people are going to think someone in your photo seems more interesting than you are, which will make them swipe left. Stick to photos that only include you. [3] X Research source You might get away with a group photo if it’s clear who you are in the picture. For example, it’s probably safe to post a picture of yourself with your parents."

      "content": "Avoid photos that flash a lot of high end goods. You might want to show off your excellent taste or the spoils of your success, but this can be more of a turn-off than you might think. People may misinterpret your prized possessions as a sign that you’re shallow or high-maintenance. This is totally unfair to you, so wait until later to show off what you’ve earned. For instance, don’t post a photo of you shopping for luxury cars or showing off your designer duds."

      "content": "Use a conversational style to make your profile engaging. Your profile should read like you talk because people find that relatable. Write your bio in sentences, then read it aloud to make sure it sounds natural. Revise it until it sounds like something you’d say over coffee. Ask a friend to help you do this! Read your bio to them, then get their feedback on how you can make it better."

      "content": "Identify 10 adjectives that describe you to help you decide what to write. You might be struggling with what to say, and that’s totally normal. One way to get past your bio writer’s block is to choose 10 adjectives that might describe you and then focus on the ones that best represent you. Write out the ways you embody those adjectives, then develop them into a 2-3 sentence bio. First, write your adjectives. For instance, “I’m funny, smart, adventurous, hardworking, quiet, thoughtful, introverted, imaginative, helpful, and silly.” Then, choose 2-3 adjectives that best describe you. As an example, you might pick adventurous and imaginative. Next, explain how you embody those traits. You might write, “I’m a weekend warrior, I like hiking, I travel a lot, I’m a daydreamer, and I paint.” Finally, create your bio. For instance, “Weekends are spent on adventures, whether I’m hiking a nearby trail or exploring unfamiliar parts. In my spare time, I paint the images that come to me in my daydreams. You may have seen some of my artwork at local coffee shops.”"

However, people aren’t going to swipe right if you come off as a total mess. Create a bio that suggest you have a plan for your future, including career and financial goals. Make sure your profile presents you in the best possible light. You don’t need to have a perfect life to find a partner. However, don’t include statements like, “Figuring out this thing called life” or “Looking for my sugar daddy.”"

      "content": "Explain what you'll bring to a relationship. People want to know what you have to offer them, so include this in your profile. Consider what makes you a great catch, as well as what your past partners liked about you. Use these details to create a short list of things you can offer your potential partners. Write something like, \"I'd love to cook for you,\" \"I enjoy planning dates,\" or \"I took a massage class and would be happy to show you my skills.\""

      "content": "Avoid self-deprecating humor about food, alcohol, or bad habits. It’s hard to be funny in your dating profile, and sometimes your jokes just don’t come across. Unfortunately, the self-deprecating jokes that kill in real life may seem like a cry for help in your dating profile. Skip the references to binges, guilty pleasures, risky decisions, or unkempt living spaces. Make sure you’re showing yourself in the best possible light. Wait until you meet them in person to dazzle them with your sense of humor. For instance, skip statements like, “Life is meaningless without my daily chocolate fix,” “I’m probably still trying to find my way home from last night,” or “My dog is the clean one in our relationship.”"

Bumble has a reputation for being a feminist dating site, so people aren’t going to be impressed by your outdated jokes. Similarly, using cliches makes you seem unoriginal, even though that’s likely untrue. Don’t worry about being clever! Just be yourself. [4] X Research source For example, don’t use cliches like, “I’m here to find my partner in crime,” “Just a Jim looking for my Pam,” and “Fluent in sarcasm.” Similarly, avoid gender-based jokes, such as “Searching for a trophy wife,” “I need someone to make me a sandwich,” or “I don’t like changing my own tires.”"

Because men and women think differently, it’s really hard to understand how someone of the opposite gender will perceive your profile. You don’t want people getting the wrong idea about you! Show your profile to someone of the opposite sex who has the qualities you look for in a partner. Then, ask them what they think. Here are some questions you might ask them: Does this profile catch your attention? Why or why not? What is your perception of me based on my profile? What kind of relationship do you think I want? What do these pictures say about me? Is anything in my profile a turnoff? Are there changes I could make to appeal to you more? If I messaged you, would you message me back? Why or why not?"
