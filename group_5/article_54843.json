      "title": "Pick the right major.",
      "content": "Pick the right major. Unlike medical school, there are no prerequisites for law school, so choosing a major can be particularly tough. In fact, The American Bar Association itself does not recommend any undergraduate majors or group of courses to prepare for a legal education and says so on its web site. [1] X Research source Choose a major with a higher degree of law school acceptance. Consider majoring in philosophy, economics or journalism--in a recent review of data from the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) those majors have a high rate of acceptance. Think twice about prelaw. While the name seems to suggest that it would be a good path to follow on your way to law school, not everyone agrees. Check to see how much of the coursework in the prelaw program at the school you're considering seems related to the work you'll do in law school. Undergraduate majors that involve lots of reading and stress critical thinking offer good foundations for law school. Critical thinking, logic, and good writing skills are crucial to success in law. Don't just pick a major because it sounds like a law school will approve of your choices. Many different undergraduate majors feed well into law, and the fact that you're passionate about something can and will show up in the way you portray your experiences."

      "title": "Focus on your GPA.",
      "content": "Focus on your GPA. Getting the best possible grades is essential for a strong law school application. Whatever major you choose, focus on excelling in all of your classes. The median GPA for law school acceptance is 3.42. Higher tier schools have much more rigorous requirements. For example, the median GPA for acceptance to Yale Law School is 3.9, Harvard is 3.89 and Stanford 3.85. Start strong. Since a good GPA is so important, plan to work on your grades right away. Attend classes regularly, set aside ample time to read and study and if you need help, work with a tutor. GPA isn't the only consideration for law school acceptance, but it's extremely important and should be your main focus during your undergraduate years. Whether or not you do take on graduate school (before or during your law degree), your undergraduate GPA still matters. Law schools look at everything - be prepared."

      "title": "Integrate extracurricular activities.",
      "content": "Integrate extracurricular activities. While good grades are essential, you want to present yourself as a well-rounded candidate, so plan to get involved in some extracurricular activities. Get involved right away. Admissions committees will want to know how long you have been involved in each activity and what meaningful contributions you've made. If you wait until senior year to join a group, it may be perceived as a move you're making purely to increase your chances of acceptance rather than an involvement that sprang from a genuine passion or interest. [2] X Research source Limit the number of groups you join. The depth of your involvement is much more important than the number of activities in which you are involved. [2] X Research source Explore all of your options--affinity clubs, intramural sports, service organizations--then commit to two or three that you really connect with. Keep track of your hours of involvement because the applications often ask you to specify how many hours you spent on each activity per week. Consider larger, more established organizations. Many prestigious nonprofits, like UNICEF and Habitat for Humanity, have college chapters on campuses all over the country. [2] X Research source Take on a role in student government or on a school publication (newspaper or journal). These are highly valued by law school admission's committees. [3] X Research source Secure a leadership position. Whatever organization you choose to become involved in, be sure to step up and take a leadership role. It's essential that you be seen as someone who can take charge, manage multiple responsibilities and people and achieve results. Again, don't just pick something because it sounds good. Get involved and get passionate about something because you can, as these areas of interest can also be considered by law firms as you're looking for a job later."

      "title": "Take an internship.",
      "content": "Take an internship. Working as an intern can help familiarize you with life in a law firm or other relevant business, give you valuable skills and introduce you to professionals whose advice and guidance can benefit you. You don't have to intern at a law office. Look for internships in related fields such as government, community activism or journalism. A law firm internship may sound great, but if all you did was answer phones and make coffee it won't give you much to talk about on your applications. Search for internships online or at your school. There a lots of sites that list internship openings, and the career guidance office at your university should also have listings that you can use. Plan ahead. Internship positions fill quickly. Apply for summer positions in the winter; submit applications for fall and spring term positions at least one semester in advance. If you cannot afford to go unpaid, try for a part-time or summer job in an area that you're interested in. Law schools do want applicants who have experience, but they do understand that not everyone can afford to get it for free. In the same vein, search for stipends and programs that have extra time allotted, so that you can get the experience while not going into debt preemptively. These are great experiences to learn if something is really right for you, but don't close other doors in the process."

Not only must you be thinking about grades, activities and internships right from the start of your college career, you must also be thinking about the multiple requirements and deadlines of the law school application process. According to Assistant Dean for Admissions and Financial Aid at UCLA School of Law Rob Schwartz, “It’s best to start thinking about getting recommendations and preparing for the LSAT at least a year in advance and preferably even as much as two years in advance because the recommendations are a very critical part of the admissions process....\" Take the LSAT early. For a fall admission, plan to take the LSAT by December of the previous year. If you think you may want to take the exam more than once, make your first testing date in June or October."

[5] X Expert Source Nathan Fox, JD LSAT Teacher, Founder of LSATdemon Expert Interview. 15 November 2019. You can study for the LSAT on your own or take advantage of tutoring services and programs that focus on getting students ready for this exam. Take a class. Choose a professionally designed LSAT course to give you an overview of the exam and tools and practice you'll need to earn the best possible score. Be sure the class is taught by a highly qualified instructor and is small (under 20 students) so you can get individual attention. Note: Some of these classes can cost between $500 and $1,300. Budget carefully or consider going to the library to get prep books. Part of the appeal of the class is the notion that you've sunk so much into paying for it that you know you'll spend that much time. Make sure you are taking that much time. Take the class a few months before your LSAT date; that way, you'll have time to study on your own, reinforcing what you've learned in your class. Work with a tutor. Receiving one-on-one instruction for a professional LSAT tutor can help address your specific needs and fill in knowledge gaps you may have. Choose a tutor who's been teaching for at least two years and plan to meet a couple times a week for maximum benefit. Take practice exams. One of the best ways to get ready for the LSAT is to spend time answering the kinds of questions that will be on the real exam. Becoming familiar with the questions and the format of the test will increase your preparedness and make your more comfortable when your testing day rolls around. [6] X Expert Source Nathan Fox, JD LSAT Teacher, Founder of LSATdemon Expert Interview. 15 November 2019. You can take practice exams on your own. LSAC offers a free online prep test, and there are sample tests on other sites and in LSAT study guide books you can buy. Join a group. Taking a proctored exam with other students simulates the real-world testing environment. Your prep test will be timed, and you'll have a sense of what it's like to maintain your focus in a room crowded with other students. Some LSAT classes offer practice testing as part of the curriculum. If your plan to take a class, choose one that includes a testing component. Don't underestimate the importance of practice. In an article written for U.S. News & World Report, the author recommends taking at least 30 full-length practice tests in preparation for the real LSAT. Even if you take a practice test and score high, don't rush into taking the exam. If you score high before studying, you are more likely to get an even higher score if you study for at least three months. With a high enough score, you can get into the best law schools, and doors will open for you everywhere after graduation.

      "title": "Search for law schools.",
      "content": "Search for law schools. Law school is a huge commitment of time, money and effort. Be sure to pick the one that best suits your career goals. Look at specialties. If you want to practice family law or criminal law, for example, it makes sense to apply to schools who specialize in those fields. Do some online research to check out a school's area of expertise. Consider your chance of acceptance. Top-tier schools receive thousands of applicants and accept very few. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't aim high, but you need to be realistic as well. Pick one or two \"reach\" schools (ones you may not get into) as well as schools whose average LSAT and GPA rates are in line with your own. [10] X Expert Source Nathan Fox, JD LSAT Teacher, Founder of LSATdemon Expert Interview. 15 November 2019. Graduating from a top-tier school does open doors for you in the professional world, but it's not the only factor. Don't be overly influenced by a school's ranking. Talk to graduates. Nobody can give you the low-down about a school the way alumni can. Seek out people who attended the schools you're interested in for insight into the school's academic and social environment. Consider cost. Law school is expensive, so cost can clearly be a factor when you're deciding where to apply. If a school you're interested in seems out of reach financially, check into scholarship opportunities they may offer. In general, state schools are less expensive than private schools so put those at the top of your list if cost is a major consideration. Be aware that you'll be paying back your law school loans for years after graduation. Do you best not to overburden yourself with student loans--it could cause you considerable stress or even limit your career options. Look into location. Law school is tough enough without being isolated from family or living in a city that doesn't suit you. Consider how far away you can be from your support group, how easily you make friends and whether you're a city-lover or more of a small-town-dweller when looking at schools. Also consider location for after law school. Some schools have strong regional placement, such that attending means that most of the jobs you will find are within 50 or 150 miles. Other schools have more national or international placement. If you're set on a particular area for after graduation, you may pick a very different school than if you're looking to explore different destinations."

Those thoughts can keep your spirits up while you wait or help fortify you if you don't get the response you hoped for. If you don't get accepted to the school you wanted, there are things you can do to make yourself a desirable candidate in the future. Consider retaking the LSAT's (you can take them three times in a two-year period), working for a year or two before reapplying, attending graduate school, or even transferring into the school with good grades from your first year at another institution."
