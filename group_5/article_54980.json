      "title": "Beta-alanine produces a byproduct that causes tingling and itchiness.",
      "content": "Beta-alanine produces a byproduct that causes tingling and itchiness. Beta-alanine is the beta amino-acid inside of pre-workout that delays muscle fatigue and loss of power. However, beta-alanine can also cause an effect called paresthesia, which isn’t harmful, but does cause tingling and itching. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Researchers aren’t 100% certain why beta-alanine does this inside the body, but it’s common enough that more studies are being done on it."

      "content": "Split your dosage up into several smaller doses. Many people find that instead of taking an entire dose at once, breaking up their pre-workout into 2 or 3 doses helps prevent the itching. Try taking smaller amounts of pre-workout throughout the day to stop that tingly feeling. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pre-workout typically lasts in your system for about 4 hours. Try starting your first dose about 4 hours before you plan to work out."

Studies show no long-term side effects after using beta-alanine, and itchiness and tingling have been the only major side effects reported.
