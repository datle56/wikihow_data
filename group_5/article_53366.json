Some use it to mean “do not interact unless contacted.” In this case, the user is signaling they’re open to contact from people they contact first.

DNIUC, DNI, and related tags are often seen on Discord, TikTok, and Twitter. However, these are unofficial status tags, so not everyone may know what they mean. DNIUVC and DNIUEC are other variations that mean “do not interact unless very close” and “do not interact unless extremely close,” respectively."
