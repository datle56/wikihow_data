      "content": "Purchase unfiltered honey. Regardless of how much time passes and the temperature it's stored at, honey that's been processed or tampered with will not crystalize. Only raw, unfiltered honey will crystalize. Make sure you purchase unfiltered, pure honey. [1] X Research source Unfiltered honey may have an added cost, but it's the only way to get crystalized honey. It may be easier to find unfiltered honey in an organic grocery store or the organic section of your store."

      "content": "Store your honey in a plastic jar. Exposure to air may make honey crystalize faster. Plastic jars are generally more porous than other storage options. If your honey did not already come in a plastic jar, transfer it to one to speed up the crystallization process. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask at a store which honey crystalizes fastest.",
      "content": "Ask at a store which honey crystalizes fastest. If you're buying your honey from a local business, like a farmer's market, ask the provider which honeys crystalize fastest. Honeys infused with things like rose petals may crystalize faster than other types of honey. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add water.",
      "content": "Add water. A low glucose-to-water ratio speeds up the process of crystallization. Try adding a tablespoon or two of water to your honey and mixing it in. This may result in faster crystallization. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Store your honey in the refrigerator. [5] X Expert Source David Williams Beekeeper & Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 13 February 2020. Honey stored in temperatures around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) will crystalize much faster. Store your honey somewhere like the fridge. Use a thermometer to determine your fridge's heat to make sure it hovers around the 50s. [6] X Research source Do not freeze your honey. This will prevent it from crystalizing."

      "title": "Wait for your honey to crystalize.",
      "content": "Wait for your honey to crystalize. Unfortunately, there is no exact formula to know how long honey crystalizes. When kept at the right temperature, most honey will crystalize but this can take anywhere from weeks to years. [7] X Research source When your honey crystalizes, you will realize the honey is formed into large crystals with white air bubbles in between. [8] X Research source"
