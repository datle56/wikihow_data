      "content": "You must unlock the Dough Raid to awaken your Dough Fruit. Follow these steps to unlock the Dough Raid: Obtain 1 God's Chalice and 10 Conjured Cocoas. You can get the God's Chalice from praying at the Gravestone or defeating Elite Pirates, and you can get Conjured Cocoas from defeating Cocoa Warriors or Chocolate Bar Battlers. Trade the God's Chalice and 10 Conjured Cocoas for a Sweet Chalice. You can do this via the Sweet Crafter located in Chocolate Land in the Sea of Treats. Defeat 500 enemy NPCs in Cake Land. Talk to the NPC drip_mama in front of the large mirror in the middle of Cake Land to check how many enemies you've killed. Once you've killed 500 enemies and spoken to drip_mama, the Dough King will appear. Defeat the Dough King. If you do at least 10% damage, you'll get a Red Key. The Red Key unlocks the door inside Candy Castle and gives you access to the Cake Scientist. The Cake Scientist sells Dough Raid Microchips, which cost 1,000 fragments or 1 fruit worth at least $1 million in-game money."
