Staying 6 feet (1.8 m) or farther away is even better, particularly with children and pregnant women. It's best to be in a different house away from children and pregnant women if at all possible. In fact, avoiding contact with pregnant women for 20 days is best, while you shouldn't get closer than 6 feet (1.8 m) to a child in the first 3 days. Limit car rides with other people. If you need a driver, sit in the back seat in the opposite corner from the driver. [10] X Research source"

You should be able to close it tightly. Keep the bag out of reach of any pets or children. Also, separate it from the other trash bags in the house. Often, you will be asked to return your trash bag with the trash in it back to the facility. In some cases, though, you may be asked to wait 3 months and then throw it away normally. The bag you were given should have a tight seal to keep it from smelling. If it starts to smell, call your local hazardous waste disposal to see if they will take it."
