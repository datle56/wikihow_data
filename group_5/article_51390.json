A percentage is just a special kind of fraction. For example, \"5% of doctors\" is quick way to write \"5 out of 100 doctors.\" By dividing the answer by the starting value, we turn it into a fraction that compares the two values. In our example, $50 / $400 = 0.125 ."

There's a trick to these problems with many zeroes. Instead of counting the zeroes each step of the way, we can rewrite these as 5.3 billion and 7.4 billion ."

By subtracting this from our answer, we're left with just the percentage size of the increase. 140% - 100% = a 40% increase in population . This works because starting value + increase = end value . Rearrange the equation and we get increase = end value - starting value ."
