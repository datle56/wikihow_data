If you're not working with a simple easily-identifiable shape, like a circle or a trapezoid, then you may be working with a shape that is made up of several other shapes. You have to recognize what those are so you can break the larger object down into a series of smaller objects. [1] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source In this case, this object is composed of the following shapes: a triangle, a trapezoid, a rectangle, a square, and a semi-circle (half of a circle)."

Finding the area of each shape will lead you to find the area of each part of the shape; once you've found the area of each shape using the formula and measurements you were given, all you have to do is add up each area to find the area of the entire object. When calculating area, you have to remember to state the area in square units. The area of the entire object is 44.78 in 2 . Here's how you get it: [3] X Research source Find the area of each shape: Area of Square = 2.5 in 2 = 6.25 in 2 Rectangle = 4.5 in x 2.5 in = 11.25 in 2 Trapezoid = [(3 in + 5 in) x 5 in]/2 = 20 in 2 Triangle = 3 in x 2.5 in x 1/2 = 3.75 in 2 Semi-Circle = 1.5 in 2 x π x 1/2 = 3.53 in 2 Add the areas of each shape together: Area of Object = Area of Square + Area of Rectangle + Area of Trapezoid + Area of Semi-Circle Area of Object = 6.25 in 2 + 11.25 in 2 + 20 in 2 + 3.75 in 2 + 3.53 in 2 Area of Object = 44.78 in 2"
