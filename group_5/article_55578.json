Hot and cool air can escape quickly, which means your furnace or air conditioner has to work harder and use more energy. Additionally: Close your curtains in the summer so the house doesn’t get hot. Put on a sweater in the winter instead of turning up the heat. [6] X Research source Use ceiling or box fans instead of turning on the AC. [7] X Research source"
