      "content": "Blanch your beans for 3-4 minutes on high heat. Blanching will help the beans retain their structure and freshness once you freeze them, but you don't need to cook them through. Blanching helps to kill bacteria inside of the beans and stop the growth of enzymes so that the beans taste better and retain all of their important vitamins.
