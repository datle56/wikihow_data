      "content": "Sheet masks are super hydrating and only take 10-15 minutes. Look for sheet masks with skin nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and antioxidants to really plump and moisturize your skin. Since over-using sheet masks can irritate your skin, stick with one application a week. [1] X Research source Try other types of masks to target specific issues. For example, overnight masks are great for extremely dry skin. Clay, sulfur, and mud masks are awesome for soaking up oil and gently exfoliating your skin."

You can apply a quick spritz of face mist to clean, makeup-free skin, and it's fine to use over your makeup, too! Look for hydrating ingredients like lactic acid, glycerin, aloe leaf extract, and hyaluronic acid to plump your skin.

Harsh ingredients get your skin squeaky clean, but they also strip your skin’s protective oils along with the dirt. Abrasive cleansers (like scrubs) can irritate your skin if you use them daily, and fragrance can cause dryness and irritation. For the best results, stick with a mild cream or gel formula.

If you have dry, sensitive, or acne-prone skin, try a mild chemical exfoliant like 5% glycolic acid to refresh your skin. Avoid mechanical exfoliants (like scrubs) since they're a little harsh for you. If you have oily skin, stronger chemical treatments and scrubs are good options to reveal smoother skin. No matter what skin type you have, limit exfoliating to twice weekly so you don't irritate your skin. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Avoid strong chemical and mechanical exfoliation if you have hyperpigmentation or if you tend to scar easily. Always apply moisturizer after you exfoliate your skin. Never exfoliate your skin if you have open cuts or a sunburn."

[10] X Research source Use a sunscreen formulated for your face. Regular sunscreens are a little too heavy for the skin on your face and could clog your pores.
