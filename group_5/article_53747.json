      "title": "Bright bottoms can draw attention to your legs.",
      "content": "Bright bottoms can draw attention to your legs. If your goal is to downplay your thighs, go for bottoms in solid, neutral colors, like brown, black, and cream. For jeans, try dark wash or black denim. [1] X Research source Bottoms with a lot of detailing, like extra pockets or sequins, can also draw attention to your legs and add extra bulk. Pick bottoms that are slim and smooth all the way around."

      "title": "Vertical stripes have a slimming effect on your legs.",
      "content": "Vertical stripes have a slimming effect on your legs. If you would like to wear pants with a pattern, look for ones with vertical stripes or patterns to elongate your body. Solid blocks of color, like black and white, are better than small, intricate patterns. [2] X Research source The same is true for skirts and dresses, too. Vertical stripes will elongate and slim you, while horizontal ones may make you look wider. Try to stay away from busy prints, which can also draw attention to your legs."

      "title": "Bottoms like these will be much more comfortable.",
      "content": "Bottoms like these will be much more comfortable. Try to pick out pants that start out wide and slightly taper down at the ankle for a nice balance. Trousers with pleats and joggers are the perfect examples of this. [3] X Research source Try to find straight or bootcut pants instead of flare ones. If the fabric flares out too much at the bottom, it could make your legs look wider."

      "title": "Your natural waistline is usually the slimmest part of your torso.",
      "content": "Your natural waistline is usually the slimmest part of your torso. Pick out pants, trousers, jeans, and skirts that are slightly high waisted to draw attention to your figure and highlight your curves. Try adding statement belts around your natural waist to bring it out even more. [4] X Research source Your natural waistline is the area right above your hips. It’s the spot you naturally grab when you put your hands on your “hips” while standing. If you’re wearing a long top, tuck it into your bottoms to let your waistline shine."

    {
      "title": "Draw attention to the slimmest part of your legs.",
      "content": "Draw attention to the slimmest part of your legs. Try going for midi skirts that end just above or just below the knee to cover your thighs while slimming your legs. Skirts with lace or ruffle detailing at the bottom will work even better for this, since they draw the eye downward. [5] X Research source Try A-line skirts or trumpet skirts to fit your body type perfectly."

    {
      "title": "Starchy, stiff denim can add extra bulk to your legs.",
      "content": "Starchy, stiff denim can add extra bulk to your legs. When you’re picking out jeans, go for denim that’s a little bit stretchy. Jeggings and jean leggings are perfect for this since they conform to your body without adding extra fabric. [6] X Research source Dark wash denim is better than light wash, since the darker colors can help draw attention away from your legs."

    {
      "title": "Draw the eye upwards in your outfits.",
      "content": "Draw the eye upwards in your outfits. Go for flowy, embellished blouses, patterned button-ups, structured jackets, and graphic T-shirts. When you accentuate your upper body, you can make people focus on your upper half instead of your legs. [7] X Research source Tie dye shirts and floral blouses also work great for this! Look for tops with fringe or lots of pockets."

      "title": "When you’re dressing up, make yourself look taller with a pair of heels.",
      "content": "When you’re dressing up, make yourself look taller with a pair of heels. Go for simple heels that don’t have a ton of straps or bling on them so you elongate your legs instead of cutting them off at the ankle. If you aren’t a fan of stilettos, go for kitten heels, wedges, or midi heels instead. [8] X Research source Try to avoid knee-high boots. Footwear like this can make you look shorter instead of elongating your legs. Nude heels are particularly elongating since they look like an extension of your leg."

      "title": "Flats, mules, and dress shoes can elongate your legs.",
      "content": "Flats, mules, and dress shoes can elongate your legs. When you’re picking out shoes, go for ones with a slightly pointed toe to draw attention to your footwear and lengthen your entire body. Plus, pointed shoes make any outfit look a little more chic and sophisticated. [9] X Research source Go for nude shoes that match your skin tone to really elongate your legs."

    {
      "title": "It’s all about drawing the eye upward.",
      "content": "It’s all about drawing the eye upward. Go for chunky necklaces, long earrings, big headbands, or fluffy scarves. Pieces like these will finish off your outfit while making people look upward at your face and torso. [10] X Research source Try matching your necklace to your earrings to make your outfit look more cohesive. Flashy rings and facial piercings also work well for this!"

      "title": "Bags like these make your legs look a little smaller.",
      "content": "Bags like these make your legs look a little smaller. Go for big, bulky handbags and backpacks to store your essentials in when you go out. If you’re in the professional field, try carrying a briefcase or a satchel for all your important papers. [11] X Research source Small clutches and delicate handbags can make your legs look bigger in comparison."
