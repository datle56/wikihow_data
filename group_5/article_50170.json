The more outrageous and disheveled you look, the drunker you'll appear. [1] X Research source Having messy hair tells other people that you don't care about being perfect and are here for a good time. It could also make people think that you've been partying."

[2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For that reason, many drunk people will drop things frequently. Many times, this includes food and drink. Put ketchup or mustard stains on your shirt and act like you don't notice it or that you don't care. If someone mentions the stain, respond by saying \"Yeah, I know. I don't care.\" You can use other things to create stains, but avoid dairy products or any other food that would produce an odor."

Make sure that it doesn't look intentional, or else people won't associate it with drunken behavior. Try to make it look like you just used the bathroom. Tucking your shirt in half way could be a fashion statement. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Glazed and bloodshot eyes are a common sign of drunkenness. There are safe and natural ways to make your eyes naturally red. To do this, rub a small amount of freshly cut onion, menthol, or peppermint oil under your eye to make them appear redder. [4] X Research source You can also try crying or blinking several times to make your eyes look redder. Redness occurs because alcohol can swell the blood vessels in your eyes and makes them appear red. Make sure that the peppermint oil, menthol, or onion does not make direct contact with your eye."

      "content": "A big part of acting drunk is to embody the feelings and emotional outlook of someone who is drunk. Typically when people get really drunk, they try to act sober to fit in. This can be difficult because you'll need to assume the perspective of someone who does not want to appear to be drunk while still convincing people that you are. [5] X Research source Look like you're trying to keep your composure but slip up occasionally and act drunk. You can say something silly or outrageous and then tell everyone that you're sorry and you didn't mean to say it. Don't go overboard or overact. This may tip people off. Lean against a wall and then stand upright, as if you're trying to regain your balance. You can say something like \"No, no, I'm totally fine. I don't think I had enough to drink.\" Combine this with slurred speech to seem more realistic. Being loud and socially inappropriate does not necessarily equate to being drunk. However, being accidentally inappropriate can make you look drunk."

      "content": "The effects of alcohol can lead to increased aggression, self-disclosure, and sexual inhibition. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Be more open and honest than you normally would. Say things that you wouldn't say regularly. Go off on tangents and talk about your childhood. If you're going for the \"angry drunk\" act, then get angry in response to minor things. Act more flirtatious and be more willing to talk about your history and childhood. You can say things like, \"Onion rings. I remember when I ate my first onion ring. I was seven--no, I was six years old.\" Touch people more often. Touching someone's arm or pushing their shoulder is an act of flirtation. [7] X Research source You can make sexually suggestive or inappropriate comments to appear drunker. Just remember not to cross the line and harass anyone."

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Act like you don't understand simple things. You can accomplish this by asking repeated questions or repeating what a person is saying. When asked to do something, take twice as long as you'd usually take, and constantly ask the person for help. Changing the channel on the TV or a song on a mp3 player is a great opportunity to seem like you don't know what you're doing. When trying to change the channel you can say, \"I don't get it. It keeps going to the menu. I don't know what I'm doing.\""

You can also lean against walls when you're stationary to give off this effect. Another approach is to roll back on your heels and act as if you are trying to get back on your toes.
