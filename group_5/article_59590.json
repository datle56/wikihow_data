      "content": "Cut off any old coating on the metal. Using a utility knife, cut a line along any old rubber coating that’s still on the metal. Once you’ve cut the length of the rubber, it should peel off easily. If not, use the utility knife to carefully scrape it off. [1] X Research source Be careful not to scratch the metal beneath as you cut through the coating with the knife."

      "content": "Remove rust with sandpaper or steel wool. Scrub the metal with a low-grit sandpaper or steel wool to remove any rust. You can also purchase a rust removal product at a hardware store and either immerse the metal in it, or apply the product via spray or gel. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Rub the metal with fine-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Rub the metal with fine-grit sandpaper. Once the rust is gone, move to a fine-grit sandpaper to even out any scratches you made in the metal with the coarser sandpaper. If you used a rust removal liquid or gel and there are no scratches in the metal, you can skip this step. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash the metal with soap and water. Use water and a mild soap to wash away any remaining dirt and grime on the metal. You may need to use a scrubber sponge to get it fully clean. [4] X Research source If the metal is sticky or gunky, wipe it down with a product like Goo Gone, then wash with soap and water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the metal thoroughly.",
      "content": "Dry the metal thoroughly. The metal shouldn’t have any moisture on it, or the rubber coating won’t adhere properly. Wipe the metal with a dry, microfiber cloth, getting into all the cracks and crevices. If you’re coating something with lots of little spaces you can’t get the towel into, allow the metal to air dry overnight. You can also aim a heat gun at these spots to dry them more quickly. Hold the gun a few inches away from the metal and move it in small circles or lines so you’re not heating the same spot for too long."

      "content": "Spread out a tarp or newspaper to catch any drips. Find a flat, sturdy work surface either on a table or on the floor and lay down a tarp, dropcloth, or some newspaper. This will catch any drips when you pull the metal out of the liquid. Since you'll be hanging the metal to dry, place a dropcloth under where you'll be hanging it too. Avoid working outside on a windy or humid day, since this can affect the way the rubber dries. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap thick wire around part of the metal you won't dip. The metal will need to hang to dry, so wrap some sturdy wire around it at a spot where the wire won’t slip and where you don’t want any rubber coating. Leave a few extra inches of wire attached so you can hang it up later. [7] X Research source Purchase wire at a craft or hardware store. Flexible jewelry wire or picture-hanging wire will work. If you want the entire object coated, consider spraying it rather than dipping it to get more even coverage."

      "content": "Pour the liquid rubber into a shallow, disposable container. If your metal is too wide to fit into the product’s container, pour the liquid rubber out into a plastic container that can fully hold whatever you’re dipping. Use a container you’re comfortable throwing away or repurposing, since you shouldn’t attempt to reuse it for any food storage. If the metal object will fit into the product’s container, there’s no need to pour it out. If the object is very large or unwieldy, it may be best to spray it rather than dip it."
