      "content": "Get some cellophane tape. You will need a thin, clear cellophane tape with a strong adhesive grip. Scotch brand is the most common, but any brand will work as long as it is very adhesive. Make sure that roll is not very wide. 1/2\" is the standard."

      "title": "Remove a piece of tape.",
      "content": "Remove a piece of tape. Remove a small piece of tape from your roll. Remove a 1/2\" piece of tape from the roll, creating a 1/2\" x 1/2\" square of tape."

      "title": "Affix the tape to the lock groove.",
      "content": "Affix the tape to the lock groove. The tape should be wrapped around both the front and the back of the SD card, creating a level surface along the edge with the lock groove. Make sure to firmly press the tape down so that there are no wrinkles or bubbles. Ensure that none of the contacts on the back of the SD card are covered by the tape, or the card will not read. Bumps in the tape or raised edges could cause the SD card to get stuck in the slot."

      "content": "Insert the card into your device or reader. The SD card should now be fully unlocked. If it is still locked, make sure that the tape has created a level surface on the lock edge. [1] X Research source"
