      "content": "Turning it off and on actually works sometimes. To power cycle or reset your Insignia remote, simply remove the batteries, wait for 2 minutes, then put them back in to see if that worked. You want to wait the full 2 minutes to make sure all the power has drained from your remote, effectively turning it off completely. If you're worried that there's a stuck button , repeatedly press all the buttons on the remote. Hand lotion and oils, drink spills, crumbs, and dust can easily cause your stuck buttons. Pressing the buttons repeatedly should loosen any that are stuck."

      "content": "Put in new batteries to ensure dead batteries weren't the cause. You might think that the batteries you inserted would last at least 2 years, but they could have prematurely drained due to overuse, heat, or many other reasons. To make sure your batteries aren't the cause, insert new batteries into your remote and try it."

      "title": "Pair your remote with your TV again.",
      "content": "Pair your remote with your TV again. Sometimes, your remote will randomly unpair with your TV, so you'll need to re-pair. Depending on the kind of remote you have, there are different ways to do this: [1] X Research source Using an enhanced version of the Insignia RC, open the back panel and press the \"Pair\" button for a few seconds. Without a pairing button, press and hold the \"Home\" button for about 30 seconds. If neither of the previous options work, press and hold the \"Left Navigation\" and \"Menu\" buttons at the same time (the \"Left Navigation\" button is the left button on the circular navigation button)."

      "title": "Anything in the way can block signals.",
      "content": "Anything in the way can block signals. Make sure there isn't a blockage between your remote and the Smart TV's receiver. Anything like decor, picture frames, vases, books, candles, or other knick-knacks can block signals from your remote to your TV, making it appear that your remote doesn't work. Move these to see if your remote can control your TV."

      "title": "Turning it off and on again might help!",
      "content": "Turning it off and on again might help! Your TV is more complicated than your remote and might actually be the source of your remote not working. Rebooting your TV is akin to turning it off and back on again and may clear some technical glitches. [2] X Research source To turn off your Insignia Fire TV, press the \"Settings\" button on your remote, then go to Device & Software > Restart . [3] X Research source If you have a different Insignia TV, you can turn it off and unplug it from the wall to ensure a full reboot."

      "title": "As a last resort, reset your TV.",
      "content": "As a last resort, reset your TV. Since your TV is more complicated than your remote, it could be the source of your problems. Just know that resetting your TV to factory settings will also clear any personal data that you've set. To reset your TV, go to Settings > System > Reset to Factory Defaults . If your remote won't work to navigate to those settings, press and hold the Power button on your TV until you get a factory reset dialog on your screen."

      "title": "If nothing worked, you'll need to go a step further.",
      "content": "If nothing worked, you'll need to go a step further. If your remote was exposed to water, dropped several times, or was exposed to high temps, you'll most likely need a new remote. You can use a universal remote, like an RCA Universal Remote , Philips , ONN , and GE Universal Remote . If your remote was never dropped or exposed to these elements and you believe you have a bad remote due to manufacturing errors, contact customer support."
