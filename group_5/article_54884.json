[1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Cars are not airtight, just breathe normally and you'll get all the oxygen you need. If you have been in an accident or it's too hot or cold in the car, stay calm and work quickly to try to get out. Speed is only of the essence if the car is likely to burn or if the temperature is rising or falling quickly. If you are feeling too hot, remove clothing. Too cold, add clothing. Be especially attentive to children, the elderly and pets who are likely to feel temperature extremes much faster."

If you have had an accident or being wedged in somehow, it's possible that not all the doors are locked. If you find one that opens, exit through this one, being sure to check for traffic and pedestrians before you do so. Help others to get out."

If so, carefully climb out without placing pressure on the glass if it is still visible. Check for traffic and pedestrians before freeing yourself from the car. Help others to get out."

      "content": "Use this approach if you are around people. Note that this method may not be useful if you need to get out in a hurry, such as if you're concerned that the car might be about to catch on fire after an accident. Try to attract the attention of someone passing by. Try one or more of these approaches: Bang on the inside of the windows and call out to attract attention. Write a note and hold it against the window to explain that you need help to get out. Wave something around in the car to attract attention."

      "content": "Ask the person to try the outside handles of the car to see whether they release or not. If they do, then you can get out of the car via that door. If they do not, ask the person if they can seek help for you or perhaps break the door or window in some way."

      "title": "Consider breaking a window.",
      "content": "Consider breaking a window. This means making a mess and potentially causing injury, so take precautions to lessen the harm. Avoid the windshield unless you have no other choice, as it's made to be unbreakable (safety glass) and even if you did manage to shatter it, the stickiness of safety glass can make it hard to get through and you'd need to push the majority of it out before you could get out. Side and rear windows are the best options for escape. If you have no tools or heavy objects to break the window with, use your feet. If you have high heels, these might work when placed at the center of the window. Aim to kick near the front of the window or along the hinges (see the demonstration in the video below). Be aware that it's very hard to break a window by kicking, so find these breakpoints. If you have a heavy object, aim for the center of the window. A rock, hammer, steering wheel lock, umbrella, screwdriver, laptop, large camera, etc., might all serve as suitable battering objects. Even the keys might work if you're strong enough. If you've already thought ahead, you might have a window breaking tool handy in the car. There are various tools available, such as a \"center punch\", which is a small tool that could be easily stowed in the driver's side door or on the dashboard, for fast retrieval. This power punch is usually spring-loaded and can also be found in a hammer shape. Failing that, you could also carry your own small hammer."

      "content": "Get out with extreme care. Help passengers to get out with the same extreme care; in particular, don't drag them over the glass but lift up and over. You may be able to open a door from the outside rather than having to have every other person clamber out. Call your repairer to come tow the car away for fixing and get a taxi home. If there has been an accident, report to police."
