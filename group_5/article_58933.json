      "content": "Paint your door red if it appeals to you. Red doors do not have any negative associations, so there’s no reason not to paint your front door red, unless it isn’t permitted in your area or by your HOA. Brightly-colored doors can add curb appeal to your property in addition to all the positive associations of the color red. If you participate in feng shui, however, a front or main door that faces west or northwest should not be painted red. These directions represent the element of metal, while red represents the element of fire. Painting a door that faces these directions red could create an elemental conflict. [8] X Research source The shade of red you choose does not affect the associations with the color, so choose whatever shade you like best. If you think a bright red would make you feel stressed, go with something darker or more muted, for example."
