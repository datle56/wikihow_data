From there, you can divide it into subsections that are about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Secure the sections using clips so that the only hair hanging has either been curled already or is the next section of hair that is going to be curled."

Don't use the clamp at the bottom of the wand that \"holds\" the hair as it curls. Be sure not to overlap your hair, as this will reduce heat and result in limp sections. Use your fingers to hold the edge of the section of hair close to the barrel without burning your hair. Doing this rather than using the clamp will prevent crimps in the curls.

Be sure to alternate the curling direction between clockwise and counterclockwise for a more natural effect. [5] X Research source"
