      "content": "Do this before you even open your closet. If you know it’s going to be a rainy day, this will eliminate a lot of your choices right off the bat, making it easier to pick something out. If it’s going to be sunny, you can gravitate toward your spring and summer clothes. If the weather is cold, you might want to add some layers and outerwear. [1] X Research source The forecast is a good starting point, but even meteorologists make mistakes! If it’s been raining all week, you might want to grab a rain jacket even if the forecast predicts sunny skies."

      "content": "This could be running errands or grabbing lunch with a friend. Jeans and a T-shirt are always good staple items to start with (and they look cute no matter what). If you want to stay really comfortable, try some athleisure wear, like leggings and a jacket. [2] X Research source If you’re doing a lot of walking that day, go for sneakers or running shoes. If you’re mostly sitting down, try ballet flats or sandals to complete your look."

      "content": "If you’re headed to the office, you might need to dress up a bit. If your workplace is very professional, a full suit or a skirt and blazer might be your best bet. If it’s a more casual environment, try some slacks and a button down shirt with dress shoes. [3] X Research source If you need something sleek and professional, start with a nice top made out of quality material, like a silk blouse, or something well-tailored, like a button down dress shirt. You can then pair that with black trousers or a pencil skirt."

      "content": "Strut your stuff when you hit the town in a blinged-out look. Grab that little black dress from the back of your closet or put on some nice dress pants with a button down shirt. Throw on a pair of heels or some dress shoes to complete your outfit for a fancy dinner or a club. If heels aren’t your thing, try a pair of gladiator sandals or some ballet flats instead. Factor in whether or not you’ll be doing a lot of walking, getting in and out of cars, or spending a significant amount of time outdoors when choosing your outfit."

      "title": "Your base items will help you build the rest of your outfit.",
      "content": "Your base items will help you build the rest of your outfit. In general, you only have a couple of options for your first layer: a top or a dress. Once you pick out your base, you can start building your outfit based around that. If you need a casual outfit, start by choosing your top. Go with a cute tank top or cotton t-shirt that you can pair with your favorite jeans. [4] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Or, if the weather will be warm and you’ll be outside, try a casual sundress or khaki cargo shorts. For your base layer, you’ll want to start with the thinnest materials first. You’ll add volume and thickness later, if desired, by choosing additional layers."

      "content": "It’s easy to pair bottoms once you’ve chosen a top. Base your choice for the bottom piece on the style of the top you’ve already picked out. Pair t-shirts with skinny jeans or leggings for a casual look. If you’ve chosen a pretty blouse or a short sleeve dress shirt to wear to a nice dinner, go with sleek black pants/trousers or a black skirt. If you’ve chosen a dress, a bottom piece is optional. The only bottom pieces you’d need to consider would be tights or leggings to go underneath the dress."

      "content": "Spice up a basic outfit with something to cover your arms. Try a cropped jacket, a cardigan, a funky hoodie, a faux fur vest, or even just a long-sleeved button-down shirt to go over your short sleeves if you expect it to be chilly. If your base outfit is monochrome or features solid colors, choose a bolder third piece to accent. [5] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. For instance, liven up a black top and pants with a brightly colored or patterned cardigan or sweater. Add a casual flannel button down over a t-shirt and jeans to pull the outfit together and make it more interesting. If you’ve chosen a boldly striped top, try a sharp solid colored blazer over it. A blouse or a top with ruffles, embellishment, or buttons may be more appropriate for a formal occasion."

      "content": "Don’t be afraid to mix and match your pieces. Wear a soft knit cardigan over a silk top to add texture to your outfit. Or add texture by putting a belted, faux fur vest over a trendy sleeveless top and sleek skinny jeans. [6] X Expert Source Kathi Burns, CPO® Board Certified Professional Organizer Expert Interview. 31 December 2019. Another example would be a button down cotton dress shirt topped with a tweed blazer. If your top and bottom are both solid colors, try adding a third piece in another bright, solid color to make it really pop. For instance, a black top and bright red jeans could be jazzed up with a bright blue cropped jacket. Another example would be pairing black dress trousers and a dark grey button down dress shirt with a royal blue blazer."

      "content": "It’s important to stay bundled up during the winter. Let the style of your outfit dictate what kind of jacket or coat you pair it with. A classic pea coat looks great dressed both up and down, while a cropped denim jacket can add a modern twist to a basic outfit. Or, dress up your look with a leather jacket or a structured blazer. [7] X Research source Add a warm, fleece hoodie over a t-shirt and leggings/jeans for a casual look. Use a shawl or a cardigan to stay warm in a business casual outfit."

      "content": "Your outfit will dictate what style shoes you pick out. A good rule of thumb is to think about the season, occasion, formality, and activity level (SOFA). For instance, professional, sleek outfits should be paired with heels, patent leather dress shoes, or stylish ankle boots to complete the look. Casual looks go great with running shoes or high top sneakers. Summery outfits might pair well with flip flops or gladiator sandals. [8] X Research source Shoes also provide an opportunity to add a pop of color to an otherwise monochrome outfit. Try spicing up an all black look with brightly colored shoes, like red or blue."

      "content": "A simple belt can really spice up your outfit. For instance, polish the look of a baggy button down dress shirt by adding a brightly colored high-waisted belt. Your formerly casual outfit now looks trendy and form-fitting. Or, try tucking your top into a pencil skirt and add a thin belt for a classy, iconic look. [9] X Research source Try a black leather belt with dress trousers and a nice button down shirt, topped with a sharp blazer, for a super polished look. Or, add a wide belt with a band to a dress for a funky, modern look. Use a belt with a large buckle for a fun accessory that draws attention to your waist."

      "content": "Rings, necklaces, and bracelets can really elevate your look. In general, gold jewelry goes well with warm tones like yellow, orange, and red, while silver jewelry pairs well with cool tones, like blue, gray, and black. If you aren’t sure where to start, pick out a single statement piece, like a large necklace or bracelet. If you want to go all out, try stacking bracelets or rings on top of each other for a fun, funky look. You can also choose jewelry based on which area of your outfit you want to highlight. For instance, add a gorgeous pendant necklace to a v-cut top. If you’re going for casual or neutral, a nice watch is never out of place. Simple studs in your ears add a little sparkle while not looking out of place with your t-shirt and jeans."

      "content": "It’s the finishing touch on an almost-perfect outfit. If you’re wearing a casual look, try a crossbody bag or a small backpack for your phone, wallet, and keys. If you went business casual, a satchel or a small purse is perfect for your look. If you’re in fancy evening attire, try holding a small clutch with you throughout the night. If your outfit is fairly monochromatic, don’t be afraid to add a pop of color with your handbag or backpack. If you’re wearing a lot of print or color already, stick to a neutral bag or backpack, like white, brown, tan, or gray."
