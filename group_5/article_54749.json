      "title": "Try different camera settings to find what works best for you.",
      "content": "Try different camera settings to find what works best for you. The Settings menu has a deep level of customization for the camera settings. Getting the right camera is crucial for providing the best view of the ball, other players, and the field. The best camera settings are going to vary from player to player. Different players at different skill levels may prefer different settings. Experiment with different settings and see what works for you. The following are some recommended camera settings to start out with. Camera shake: Off — This provides a cool cinematic effect, but it won't improve your skill. It may even hinder it. Turn it off. FOV: 110° — A higher field of view will allow you to see more of what's going on on the field. Distance: Between 180 to 270 — Closer provides better maneuverability, but further allows you to see more. Height: 100 to 110 — A higher camera allows you to see more. Angle: -5.0 to -4.0 Stiffness: 0.40 to 0.45 Swivel Speed: 2.20 to 5 — A fast swivel speed allows you to rotate the camera more quickly to see what is going on behind you. Transition Speed: 1.20 to 1.80"

      "title": "Dribbling.",
      "content": "Dribbling. Dribbling is one of the most basic skills that you need to learn. Dribbling is a way of controlling the ball by balancing it on the roof or the hood of your car. Use a slight boost to get under the ball and make micro-adjustments to speed and steering to keep your car under the ball. Try to keep the ball on the windshield or just in front of the car's center of mass when dribbling the ball."

      "title": "Aerials.",
      "content": "Aerials. Aerials are a way of hitting the ball in midair. This can be done to make a shot or defensively to redirect the ball. To perform an aerial , gain some speed using boosts. Focus on the ball and hit the jump button to take to the air. Aim your car at the ball and use boosts to maintain speed. Use different flips, rolls, and rotations to change directions in mid-air. Hit the ball with the front of your car. Some players like to change their button configuration so that the boost button is mapped to the bumper button. This makes it easier to jump and boost at the same time."

      "title": "Flicks.",
      "content": "Flicks. Flicks are a way of shooting or passing the ball. To do a flick, start dribbling with the ball perfectly balanced on your car. Tap the jump button to do a slight jump and flip your car to hit the ball and send it flying. There are different types of flicks you can do by rotating and flipping your car in different directions. These different types of flicks can generate different levels of power and send the ball flying in different directions. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Low 50/50. This is a way of faking out your opponents. While dribbling the ball, an opponent may try to jump at the ball to take it from you. What you can do is slam on your brakes to drop the ball and then immediately do a slight jump so that you are in line with the ball behind it. This will cause your opponent to either fly over the top of the ball or hit the outside edge and flip over the top of the ball. Then your car should still be positioned behind the ball and ready to take control of it once again. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Powerslide. The powerslide mechanic allows you to make sharp turns without losing too much speed or momentum. It's the same as drifting. Normal turns are very wide, especially at high speeds. This makes it hard to center your car on the ball. Tapping the Powerslide button while turning allows for much sharper turns.

      "title": "Speed Flip.",
      "content": "Speed Flip. Speed flips are one of the most popular ways to get around the field quickly, especially during kick-off. To speed flip, start by boosting. Then jump and do a slight diagonal front flip by pressing the left analog stick to the front-left or front-right. Then immediately cancel the flip by pulling back on the left analog stick and holding it until the car lands on its wheels. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Wave Dash.",
      "content": "Wave Dash. Wave dashes can be used to recover as well as to gain speed when you are low on boosts. You can do a wave dash with or without boosts. To do a wave dash, jump and tilt your car backward so that the back wheels land first. Then tilt the stick forward to force the front wheels to the ground. If you are using boosts, tilt the car forward slightly to boost and force the car back down to the ground quicker. Then tilt back and allow the wheels to touch the ground before forcing the front wheels to the ground. You can also do wave dashes to the side, but you will need to hold the Powerslide button while doing so. You can do wave dashes on the ground, wall, or ceiling. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice to get good at all the maneuvers and mechanics. Like any other skill, the only way you are going to get good is by practicing. You can practice using Free Play mode. Have a specific skill or mechanic in mind that you want to practice and keep drilling it until you get the hang of it. You'll need to practice every day to get good. Alternatively, if you are playing on a PC, you can use custom training maps that are designed to train specific skills. This will give you a more fun and entertaining way to practice your skills."

Sometimes a defensive position is better. If a teammate is dribbling the ball, get into a position where they can pass the ball to you. Don't just follow behind them. You may also want to hang behind and play goalkeeper."

While you can regain Boost by collecting power-ups on the field, remember that your teammates need Boost too. Collecting all the Boost power-ups on the field may not be helpful to your teammates."
