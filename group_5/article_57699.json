      "title": "Stand against a wall with your head up and shoulders back.",
      "content": "Stand against a wall with your head up and shoulders back. Stand with good posture and your feet flat on the ground about shoulder-width apart. Keep your chin level, and your shoulders relaxed. Pull your stomach in and put your weight on the balls of your feet to stay balanced."

      "title": "Make a mark on the wall where your arm meets your shoulder.",
      "content": "Make a mark on the wall where your arm meets your shoulder. This is usually the boniest part of your shoulder close to the seam at the top of your shirtsleeve. Use a pencil to make a light mark that is easily erased when you’re done. Reach across the body with your right hand to mark where your left shoulder joint is, and use your left hand to mark your right shoulder joint. [1] X Research source Keep your shoulder line as straight as possible for the most accurate measurement. Tape sheets of paper to the wall in a row wider than your shoulders if you don't want to make pencil marks on it."

      "title": "Measure the distance between the two marks on the wall.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the two marks on the wall. Once you’ve marked the placement of both shoulder joints on the wall, use a measuring tape or yardstick to measure the distance between them. This is your shoulder measurement. This method will be less accurate than having a friend help you take your shoulder measurement, but it’s close enough to help you find a ready-made shirt size. If you’re having a tailor make or alter your shirt, they may ask you to come in for more accurate measurements."

    {
      "title": "Ask someone for help.",
      "content": "Ask someone for help. Since standard shoulder width measurements are taken along the upper portion of your back, having another person take this measurement for you is preferable."

      "title": "Wear a shirt that fits well.",
      "content": "Wear a shirt that fits well. While not strictly necessary, a tailored dress shirt is ideal because the seams of the shirt help guide the tape measure, but any well-fitting shirt will work to provide helpful guide points. [2] X Research source If you are wearing a dress shirt that fits your upper body correctly, you can use it as a guide. The shoulder seams on the back of your shirt usually match up with your actual shoulder points, so when in doubt, measure from there, Reeves suggests."

    {
      "title": "Standing with your shoulders relaxed, locate your shoulder points.",
      "content": "Standing with your shoulders relaxed, locate your shoulder points. These two points should also be the points at which the shoulder meets the arm or the points at which the shoulder begins curving down into the arm. They’re actually marked by your acromion bones, which can be found at the upper tips of your shoulders. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Measure the space between your shoulder points.",
      "content": "Measure the space between your shoulder points. Have your helper position the end of the tape measure flat against your back at the first shoulder point, suggests Reeves. Your helper should measure up and over the curve of your shoulders, across your back, and then back down to the outside edge of the other shoulder point. “Typically, you would measure what we call a point-to-point or PTP, which would be across the shoulder blades from one end to the other,” Reeves adds. Remember to measure across the broadest part of your shoulders. This usually lands roughly 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below the neckline. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use your shoulder measurement to determine your shirt size.",
      "content": "Use your shoulder measurement to determine your shirt size. Read your measurement in inches or centimeters and save it for your records for tailoring and comparing with sizing charts. When selecting a shirt size, if your measurements fall between sizes, it’s usually best to go with the larger size and have it altered to fit so you can dress to impress with perfectly tailored clothing. Standard shoulder width is often used for men's tailor-fit dress shirts and blazers. You also need this measurement when determining the best possible sleeve length for a shirt or blazer. Average shoulder width measurements for men range from 15.8 inches (40 cm) to 20.9 inches (53 cm). Women’s shoulder widths range from 13.4 inches (34 cm) to 18.9 inches (48 cm). [5] X Research source You may need to take additional measurements of your neck, sleeves, chest, and waist for the best fit."

      "title": "Find a shirt that fits well.",
      "content": "Find a shirt that fits well. A tailored dress shirt is your best option, but any shirt that fits your shoulders correctly will work as long as that shirt has sleeves. If you want a looser fit than the shirt you’re measuring, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the measurement after taking it. This measurement can be substituted for your back or standard shoulder width measurement, but it’s not quite as accurate as one measured across your actual shoulders."

      "content": "Lay the shirt flat and locate the shoulder seams. Place the shirt on a table or other flat working surface. Smooth it out so that the material lies as flat as possible. Locate the shoulder seams or the points where the sleeves meet the top seam of the shirt. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Measure the shirt from the left shoulder seam to the right shoulder seam.",
      "content": "Measure the shirt from the left shoulder seam to the right shoulder seam. Place the end of the tape measure at the top of the left shoulder seam. Bring the tape measure straight across the top of the shirt until it meets the top of the right shoulder seam. [7] X Research source The tape measure should lie flat and horizontal and aligned with the bottom of the shirt. Write down your results. This measurement is your shoulder width. Consider marking it down and saving it in your records."
