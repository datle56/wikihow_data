Many wellness and spiritual communities believe in the law of vibration, which suggests that everything in the world vibrates at a specific frequency. According to this law, nutrient-dense, natural foods have higher vibrations, while processed, heavy foods have lower ones. Eating high vibrational foods can help you raise your vibrations so you can experience more vitality and wellness. When you’re living a high vibrational lifestyle, you’ll feel a sense of peace and wellbeing. Empathy and forgiveness will come naturally to you, and you’ll feel joyful and light. Here are some tips to raise your vibrations: Cultivate positive emotions (like love and happiness) and let go of negative ones (like fear and shame). Positive emotions have high vibrations, so they can help you elevate your frequency. Practicing mindfulness , meditating, and expressing gratitude can also raise your vibration."
