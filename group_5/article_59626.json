If the Volume Up button on your remote doesn't work, go to Settings on your TV and navigate to Sound > Sound Output > TV Speaker/(external device) . If you're using an external speaker, try selecting TV Speaker to see if your external device is the issue. If you hear sound from the TV's internal speaker, the issue comes from your external speaker."

If you don't see an HDMI or sound issue from the self-diagnostic tests, and you updated your TV and reset it but still have sound issues, try using a different speaker.
