      "content": "Buy linseed stand oil and turpentine from an art store. If you don't have ingredients handy yet, everything you need may be purchased at a local art store. Turpentine and linseed stand oil may be used for a standard oil glaze. Two parts turpentine should be used for each part of stand oil you use. Although linseed and flaxseed oil come from the same plant and are similar, linseed stand oil might have additives to improve its paint-cleaning abilities. [1] X Research source Because glaze is used in relatively small amounts, you should use the smallest containers available, so long as you're able to get the proportions right. Empty and cleaned baby food jars (about 2 to 4 ounces) are a good size to use. Poppy seed oil, walnut oil and other types of linseed oil will work as well. However, these alternatives result in slightly yellowing your painting. Mineral spirits may be used in lieu of turpentine if you don't have turpentine available."

      "title": "Pour stand oil into a mixing jar.",
      "content": "Pour stand oil into a mixing jar. Most artists will only need a small amount of glazing medium, so you'll want to create about 2 to 4 ounces of glazing medium. To make this amount, start by pouring about 1 ounce of your linseed stand oil into a resealable airtight jar. Be sure to use a jar that has a screw-top lid so that you can simply screw it on and save unused oil for future use. [2] X Research source Use caution when handling the linseed oil, since it is highly flammable. If you use any rags to wipe up linseed oil, avoid simply throwing them in the trash since they can spontaneously combust. Instead, soak any linseed oil rags in jar filled with water and take them to a local hazardous waste site for disposal. [3] X Research source The jar used for mixing should be cleaned out and dried prior to mixing anything. Choose a small jar so that your glazing medium isn't exposed to too much air which could cause it to dry out more quickly."

      "title": "Add two parts turpentine for one part of the oil you're using.",
      "content": "Add two parts turpentine for one part of the oil you're using. Add twice as much turpentine to the jar as the stand oil you added. So, if you've placed 1 ounce of stand oil in your jar, add 2 ounces of turpentine. These two ingredients combined will give you a basic glaze to work with in your paintings. [4] X Research source Linseed oil is quite thick so you'll need less oil in comparison to the amount of turpentine needed."

    {
      "title": "Stir the glazing medium.",
      "content": "Stir the glazing medium. Take a wooden stick (like a craft stick) or use the end of an old paint brush and stir the turpentine and oil. The mixture will need a lot of stirring to combine it. As soon as you've combined the glaze, you can begin to use it (especially because it will begin to separate). You can use the medium directly out of the jar, or pour a small amount into a saucer to use. [5] X Research source Avoid shaking the glaze. Vigorous shaking will introduce air bubbles into your glaze which could be transferred to your paint. Air bubbles will cause your paint to dry poorly."

      "title": "Explore different oil and turpentine combinations.",
      "content": "Explore different oil and turpentine combinations. [6] X Research source The small differences in ingredient proportions will result in slightly different finishes. While linseed oil is typically seen as the go-to oil to use in homemade glazes, many other oils can be used as well. If you want to experiment, you may find certain glazes achieve a different end than others. If you're interested in working with different glaze combinations, you should make multiple batches at the same time. You'll be able to compare them directly with one another this way. Glazes will also respond differently based on the makeup of the paint you are using."

      "title": "Purchase linseed oil, turpentine and Damar varnish.",
      "content": "Purchase linseed oil, turpentine and Damar varnish. A Damar varnish glaze will give your painting a much stronger shine than the basic turpentine formula. A basic formula is two parts turpentine, one part linseed oil, and 1 part damar varnish. So, you'll need 2 ounces turpentine, 1 ounce linseed oil, and 1 ounce of damar varnish. [7] X Research source All of these ingredients may be found at a local arts and crafts supplies store. This will make about 4 ounces of damar varnish glaze. Depending on how heavily you apply your glaze, this may be too much. Consider making half of this amount and making more as needed."

      "content": "Pour the ingredients together into a sealable jar. A clear jar is optimal, as it will allow you to observe the ingredient proportions and the mixing process. Take caution while you pour in the ingredients, as turpentine and varnish are flammable. It helps to know the capacity of the jar prior to mixing them. That way, you can fill it up according to the glaze's desired proportions. If you use any rags to wipe up linseed oil, avoid simply throwing them in the trash since they can spontaneously combust. Instead, soak any linseed oil rags in jar filled with water and take them to a local hazardous waste site for disposal. [8] X Research source"

You can stir the mixture after adding each ingredient so that the glaze combines well. Once the mixture is combined, you can begin to use the glaze. You can use the medium directly out of the jar, or pour a small amount into a saucer to use. [9] X Research source Don't shake the jar too much before using it. Vigorous shaking will introduce air bubbles into your glaze which could be transferred to your paint. Instead, stir the glaze right before using it."

      "content": "Add a few drops of lavender oil to your glaze just before using it. [10] X Research source Use 3 drops of lavender oil per ounce of glaze you are making. Adding this to the glaze right before using it will give the glaze a thicker body, as well as improve the \"wet time\" that the artist can work within while painting. Look for oil of spike lavender at most fine art supply stores."

      "title": "Pour a small amount of glaze onto a palette.",
      "content": "Pour a small amount of glaze onto a palette. Because glaze is used in relatively small quantities (only an ounce or two at a time), you should pour out a small amount into the palette you're using to paint with. Make sure to keep it separate from other paints and mixtures."

      "content": "Add paint and glaze together on the brush. Dip your brush in glaze, then add the paint you are using for the area. Combining glaze and paint on the brush will help ensure that the glaze matches the shape you want to have emphasized. You should use a high-quality artist's brush in order to get the best effects from your glaze."

      "title": "Consider using multiple types of glaze in a project.",
      "content": "Consider using multiple types of glaze in a project. Different combinations of oil will result in different transparencies and shine. Because of this, it may be worthwhile to experiment with a few different types of glaze in your work. Using poppy seed oil, for instance, will result in a yellow tinge, which may be desired if you want your painting to look artificially aged."

      "title": "Allow your painting ample time to dry.",
      "content": "Allow your painting ample time to dry. Using a glaze with stand oil means your painting will take significantly longer to dry. Because of this, you should allow a full week for an oil glazed painting to properly settle. If you don't want to wait as long, you can minimize your use of glaze, or even go without it entirely.

      "title": "Use glaze in moderation.",
      "content": "Use glaze in moderation. Glaze should be used as a way to accent important aspects of the painting's foreground. The effect is lost if you glaze your painting excessively. Try to limit your glaze to the shapes you want to pop out at the viewer. [12] X Research source You can also apply several light layers of glaze so you have more control. If you apply multiple layers, you may need to mix up more glaze."

      "content": "Seal the medium when not in use. In order to keep the glaze fresh and useable, keep it sealed whenever you're not using it. It is good to keep the glaze sealed in the jar you made it in. [13] X Research source When stored in an airtight jar, glazing medium will last several weeks up to a few months. If exposed to air, your glaze will dry out."
