      "content": "Create a design on Canva.com. Open Canva on your web browser or the app. Click Create a Design on the top right corner of the page. You can see many design types, like presentation, doc, etc. But 'diary' is the best since it is a diary's size. Diaries come in different shapes, however, so you can either select a different type or just type a custom dimension by clicking Custom Size on the bottom left of the search section. If you want to make your cover page with an image in the background, you can click on Import Image , or select one of the images you uploaded on Canva before. It can be a photo of yourself, your family, your favorite band, or anything. It's all your wish! You can start a blank design if you want to add an image later."

      "content": "Start by customizing the cover. The cover is very important for a diary. You can customize it any way you like. Do whatever suits your style. You can add some colour, graphics, images, text, etc. You can either upload your own content or add Canva's premade media. Alternatively, you can generate new media using 'Magic Media', an AI tool, to create media based on what you write. You can also write your text, change the font, font size, and font colour. Feel free to use your imagination.â€”It's your diary! If you are using a template, you can make changes in fonts, colors, etc. Sometimes you might end up changing the entire template, but that's okay! There is no rule on what to change and what to not. Templates can either be for inspiration or to make work easier. You can also look up ideas on the internet. YouTube and Pinterest are good sites."

      "content": "Create the pages on which you will write. First, make your standard page upon which you will write your entries. You can add single lines if you want, decorate it with graphics, etc. Then, make duplicates by clicking the Duplicate option found above the page. The number of duplicates should be slightly more than the number of pages you think you will need. 100-200 pages is usually the sweet spot."
