      "title": "Accept yourself as you are.",
      "content": "Accept yourself as you are. Accept and understand that you are a wonderful and awesome human being, regardless of your sexual orientation. It's just a part of who you are to be LGBTQ."

      "content": "Imagine yourself as having the same rights to a happy and fulfilled life as everyone else. \"You're worth it,\" claims the advertisement. You aren't a mistake, an anomaly, or a freak; you are a person with unique sexual and romantic inclinations. You can still seek love and joy in your romantic life, as well as academic or professional achievement and success, just like everyone else."

    {
      "title": "Find support.",
      "content": "Find support. Discuss coming out and accepting yourself with other gay and lesbian people. While everyone's experiences will be different, most will agree that accepting themselves and coming out was a great milestone in their life. Consider joining a support organizationâ€”a college LGBTQ group, a Gay-Straight Alliance, a queer youth group, or talking anonymously to a support helpline or online support forum if you can't find somebody to talk to. It's a good idea to work with a therapist as well. When scheduling a consultation with a professional, ask them if they have experience working with LGBTQ+ folks, if they have any difficulties with this population present, and what is their general approach when working with LGBTQ+ folks."

      "title": "Allow yourself to be noticed.",
      "content": "Allow yourself to be noticed. It is still worthwhile to come out to family and friends, even if it may have negative implications. You may lose a few friends who don't accept you for who you are, but do you really want to be friends with them if they can't stand hanging out with the real you? Tell your closest friends first, then your family and others once you're comfortable and happy. The more you do it, the easier and less frightening it becomes, yet it is still necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have a good time and enjoy your life.",
      "content": "Have a good time and enjoy your life. For lesbian, asexual, bisexual, and LGBTQ individuals equally, relationships are fun and meaningful aspects of life. When you're happy with yourself, they're even more delightful. So go out and enjoy yourselves. Make it a point to engage in activities that bring you delight. Allow no one to make fun of you or make you feel inferior because of your sexual orientation.h"
