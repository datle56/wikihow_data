[1] X Research source If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) or shorter (152.4 cm), you will want a ball that is 18 inches (45 cm). If you are 5 feet (1.5 m) 1 inch (155 cm) to 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), try a 22 inch (55 cm) ball. Get a 26 inch ball (65 cm) if you are between 5 feet (1.5 m) 8 inches (173 cm) and 6 feet (1.8 m) 1 inch (185 cm). If you are 6 feet (1.8 m) 2 inches or taller, you will need a ball that measures 30 inches (75 cm). The size of the exercise ball depends on your height and what exercises you plan on doing with it. When you do a dumbbell press on an exercise ball, ensure that your feet can touch the ground firmly."
