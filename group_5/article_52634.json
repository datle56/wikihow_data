      "content": "Remove the core. [4] X Research source Starting at the bottom of the pear, use a melon baller or teaspoon sized measuring spoon to scoop out the base of the pair, followed by the core. The pear will look whole when standing upright, but will have a hole at the bottom where the core has been removed. Alternatively, you can use a fruit corer - a special tool designed to remove the cores from fruit. Simply place the end of the corer (which is essentially a hollow metal tube) over the stem then press it downwards, forcing it all the way through the center of the pear. Give it one or two turns, then draw it out. You will now have a perfectly cored pear. If the pear is a little wobbly after coring, you can cut an even slice from the bottom so it stands upright."
