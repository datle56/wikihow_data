Mix your cement according to the instructions and slowly pour it into the mold. Smooth the top of the mixture with a 50 in (130 cm) plank, making sure the mold is completely filled. [2] X Research source Run a knife along the edges of the concrete after it has been poured to make the mold easier to remove. Cure the concrete by completely dousing it in water over the course of three days. This will also help prevent heat-cracking. [3] X Research source"

Use a heavy duty adhesive or build a small shelf to keep the thermometer on the wall. To lower the temperature, open the vents above the door.
