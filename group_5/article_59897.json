Start to walk your fingers up the fabric so that both ends bunch up. [1] X Research source Instead of looking like a sheet, your hammock should look like a loose rope when you’re done gathering the material on both ends."

      "content": "Wrap the end of the fabric around your arm. Drape one end of the fabric around your forearm so that 2 feet (61 cm) of it is hanging over your arm. Grab onto the short end that’s hanging with your free hand, wrap it under your arm, and hold it so that it’s pulled across your chest. [2] X Research source The hammock fabric should be completely wrapped around your forearm if you followed the steps correctly."

      "content": "Pull the wrapped fabric down, off your arm. Pull down on the fabric that’s wrapped around your arm while still holding onto the long end of the hammock fabric. This should create a knot-like loop where your arm used to be. [4] X Research source Do not pull the loop or you will undo your knot before it’s secured."

If carabiners didn’t come with your yoga hammock, you can purchase them online or at a hardware store. [5] X Research source You’ll need 4 carabiners in total. 2 for each end of the hammock and 2 that attach to the mount, hook, or beam near the ceiling."

It’s important that your mount or hooks are drilled directly into ceiling joists or solid wood or they will not be able to support your weight. Locate a portion of your ceiling that is at least 8 feet (2.4 m) off the ground and made of solid, sturdy wood. [9] X Research source If you have drywall or drop ceilings, you may have to hang your hammock from a secured beam or rod, rather than hanging it from your ceiling. A contractor will be able to tell you if your ceiling can handle the load if you’re unsure."

The other side of the ceiling hook or mount should be about 16 inches (41 cm) away from the original marks that you created.

Press the bit against the marks that you made and pull the trigger of your electric drill while applying upward pressure. This will create holes for your mount bolts. [12] X Research source Wear a face mask and eye protection as you drill so that debris doesn’t fall into your eyes or mouth. You can find the bolt size for your hammock in the instruction manual or product description."

If you are using hooks, simply press the threaded end of the hook into the hole you created. Turn the bolts or hooks clockwise until they are completely screwed into the ceiling. Use a wrench to finish tightening bolts, if you are using them. [13] X Research source Pull down on the hooks to make sure they are secure once you're done."

Pull down on the carabiner to create a knot that attaches the rope to the hook, mount, or beam that you plan on hanging it on. Then, go over to the other rope attached to the ceiling and do the same thing. [16] X Research source This slipknot will prevent the ropes from coming undone when you pull down on them."
