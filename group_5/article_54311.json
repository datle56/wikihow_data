The \"Restricted\" list is different from the \"Blocked\" list in that restricted users can still view public posts and posts on mutual friends' pages from the person who blocked them.

If you've been restricted, you won't be able to see the private posts, hence the space here. Depending on when your friend made their public posts, you might not see a gap here even if you have been restricted."

If there's a \"Public\" globe to the right of every post's timestamp, you know that you aren't seeing their private posts. [2] X Research source This doesn't necessarily mean they've restricted you--they may have simply decided to post only public items."

      "content": "Ask a mutual friend to look at your friend's Timeline. Even if you can't see private posts or their old photos, your friend may have just deleted their old information and locked down their account to retain privacy from all of their Facebook friends (not just you). You can verify this by having a mutual friend look at your friend's Timeline and tell you if they see anything that you don't. [4] X Research source Even just asking them if your friend has posted recently when you can't see any account activity from the past month or so will accomplish this goal."
