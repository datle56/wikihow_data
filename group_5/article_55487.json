These excerpts would make a wonderful tribute to your dad in heaven, whether you’re writing a note to him for his birthday, posting a photo of him on social media, or saying a few words at a gathering to honor his memory. “All other love is mockery to this, a Father’s love— Fit emblem of the strength of His, who dwelleth far above: More lasting than eternity– more boundless than the sea! The blessing mine, the ray divine, may Father’s love e’er be.” —Mary Eliza Perine Tucker, The Father’s Love “And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly. Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration. Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be. Be and be better. For they existed.” —Maya Angelou, When Great Trees Fall “An honest man here lies at rest As e'er God with his image blest. The friend of man, the friend of truth; The friend of Age, and guide of Youth: Few hearts like his with virtue warm'd, Few heads with knowledge so inform'd: If there's another world, he lives in bliss; If there is none, he made the best of this.” —Robert Burns, Epitaph on My Own Friend ”When I come to the end of the road And the sun has set for me I want no rites in a gloom filled room Why cry for a soul set free? Miss me a little, but not for long And not with your head bowed low Remember the love that once we shared Miss me, but let me go.\" —Christina Rossetti, Let Me Go “I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.\" —Alfred, Lord Tennyson, In Memoriam A. H. H."
