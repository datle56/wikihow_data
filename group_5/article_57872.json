      "content": "Use Vedic Math to multiply numbers higher than 5. If either of the numbers that you are multiplying are over 5, using Vedic Math can help you solve the multiplication equation more quickly and easily. If either number is below 6, however, it’s likely that it would be faster for you to simply recall the answer from memory. Vedic Math multiplication is designed for larger sums of numbers. Therefore, when multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it’s usually much quicker and simpler to solve the equation without using Vedic Math."

Draw an equation line below the second number (you will write down the solution to the problem below this line later). [1] X Research source For example, if you’re using Vedic Math to multiply 6 x 7, write 6 on a piece of paper, then write 7 right below it. Draw the equation line just below the 7. While Vedic Math is characterized as a form of mental calculation to be used without a pen and paper, it can be useful for those starting out to write it out in order to better visualize the steps. If you are more adept at solving math problems in your mind, however, you can simply visualize this layout rather than writing it down."

      "title": "Subtract both the top and bottom numbers from the Vedic base of 10.",
      "content": "Subtract both the top and bottom numbers from the Vedic base of 10. Performing the calculations one at a time, first subtract the top number from 10 and write the result to the right of the original number. [2] X Research source Then, subtract the bottom number from 10 and write it to the right of the original number and just below the new calculation for the top number. You should now have 2 columns of numbers, with your original numbers in a column on the left and your new numbers in a column to the right. For example, for multiplying 6 x 7, first perform 10 – 6, which equals 4. Write the 4 to the right of the 6. Then, perform 10 – 7, which equals 3. Write the 3 to the right of the 7, just below the 4. By subtracting from 10, you’re taking the ‘base’ of the numbers. The term ‘base’ in Vedic Math refers to the base 10 number system used in Vedic Math, as well as the fact that the ‘base’ number will be used as the basis for calculation. [3] X Research source The standard bases in Vedic Math are 10, 100, 1000, and 100,000. For single-digit numbers, you’ll use the base of 10 because it’s the base closest to single-digit numbers.

Using traditional multiplication, multiply the top number in the column on the right by the bottom number in the column on the right. If the answer to the multiplication is greater than 10, write the right-most digit below the equation line and carry the left-most digit to the next step. If the answer is a single-digit, simply write the single-digit answer below the equation line under the right column. [5] X Research source For example, for the original equation 6 x 7, you now have 4 and 3 in the right column. Multiply 4 x 3, which equals 12. Write the 2, the right-most digit, below the equation line. Carry the 1, the left-most digit, to the next step. To help you remember the left-most number, you can write it off to the side. Be sure to write it away from the equation, though, so you don’t get confused."

Choose either the top or bottom number from the left column (it doesn’t matter which one you choose – the solution will always turn out the same regardless). Then, subtract the number in the right column that is diagonal to it. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source For example, if the original equation is 6 x 7, 6 will be written on top of 7 in the left column, and 4 will be written on top of 3 in the right column. Therefore, you can either perform 6 – 3 or 7 – 4, both of which equal 3."

If the solution to the multiplication of the numbers in the right column was over 10, you wrote down the right-most digit below the right column equation line and carried over the left-most digit. At this point, add the carried over digit to the solution of the diagonal subtraction in the previous step, and write down the total below the left column equation line. For example, for the original equation 6 x 7, 6 was written on top of 7 in the left column, and 4 was written on top of 3 in the right column. You then multiplied 4 x 3, which equals 12, and wrote the 2, the right-most digit, below the right column equation line and carried the 1, the left-most digit. At this point, you will then add the carried over 1 to the 3 that resulted from either 6 – 3 or 7 – 4 in the previous step, which equals 4. Write the 4 in the left column below the equation line."
