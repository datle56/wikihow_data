      "content": "A quick hello shows your coworkers that you’re friendly. You see your coworkers every day, so be sure to acknowledge them when you see them.

      "content": "Poor body language may make you seem closed off to conversations. Anytime you’re working, straighten your posture, keep your head up, and relax your shoulders.

[2] X Research source Even when you’re deep in focus at work, take a second to think about your posture and how you appear to other people."

      "content": "This helps you feel comfortable and connected when you talk to people.

      "content": "You’re more likely to open up when you have the same interests. When you’re with your coworkers, pay attention to the things that they talk about or have in their work area.

[4] X Research source For example, if your coworker brings up soccer, you can ask them what their favorite team is or if they watched the most recent game."

      "content": "Practice saying it out loud so it’s less scary doing it for real. It’s okay to feel a little nervous when you’re presenting in front of your coworkers, but practice makes perfect.

If you have time, ask a friend or coworker you feel comfortable around to listen to you so you get experience talking in front of someone else. [12] X Research source Try recording yourself and listen to see if there are still places you need to work on more."
