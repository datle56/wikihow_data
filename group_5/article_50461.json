      "content": "The green lights on your Apple Watch are the heart rate sensors. These lights periodically flash when you're wearing your Apple Watch to measure your heart rate. These lights can be disabled by turning off the watch's heart rate sensor. There's no way to keep the heart rate sensor on and also turn off the green lights. According to Apple, this is called \"photoplethysmography,\" which works around the fact that blood is red and absorbs green light. [1] X Research source The amount of blood flowing in your wrist increases and decreases with the beating of your heart. This also affects how much green light is absorbed from the sensors on the back of your Apple Watch, which is how it can measure your heart rate."
