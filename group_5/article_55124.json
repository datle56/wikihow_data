      "content": "Start each day with dry brushing. Dry brushing is an ancient exfoliation technique designed to slough off dead skin and stimulate your body's circulation. Dry brushing once or twice a week makes your skin look brighter, and if you keep up the routine your skin will begin to glow. [1] X Research source Choose a dry brush made from natural fibers, rather than plastic bristles. Natural bristles aren't as rough on your skin. Brush your body using short, firm strokes from your outer extremities toward your heart. Brush your legs, torso and arms. Use a softer, smaller brush for your face. Always start with dry skin and a dry brush. Brushing your skin while wet won't achieve the same effect. Avoid dry brushing if you have sensitive skin or a skin condition, like eczema or psoriasis, since the practice can irritate your skin. Even if you don't have any of these conditions, you should also stop or decrease how often you dry brush if you notice any redness, pain, or sensitivity afterward."

      "title": "Take a cool shower.",
      "content": "Take a cool shower. Rinse off your skin with cool, not hot, water. Hot water is hard on your skin and causes it to dry out and toughen. Use warm water at the beginning of your shower to gently wash away dirt. At the end, switch to cool water to tighten and tone your skin. Generally, you should only shower once a day for about ten minutes. Longer showers can dry out your skin. When you wash your face, splash it with cool water instead of hot water. Save hot baths for special occasions. They're good for the soul, but not necessarily for the skin."

Gently rub the cloth over your skin. You may want to use a separate wash cloth for your body and your face. Make sure to clean these tools regularly to prevent the build-up of bacteria.

For dry areas of your skin, such as elbows, shins, and forearms, you just need water."

Tobacco stains skin and causes premature wrinkles. When it comes to damaging skin, tobacco is one of the worst culprits. Alcohol. Too much alcohol can stretch skin out, especially around and under the eyes, because it causes the body to retain water. It also reduces Vitamin A in the skin and can cause broken blood vessels. Limit alcohol to one or two drinks a few times a week. Caffeine. Drinking a lot of caffeine dehydrates your body, which has an adverse effect on your skin. Limit your coffee to one cup a day, and follow it with a big glass of water. Dairy. Studies show that consuming dairy, such as cheese and milk, can further aggravate your skin. Acne, for example, is a problem with the inflamed oil glands and the fat from the milk and cheese can further inflame the oil gland.
