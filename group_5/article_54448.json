      "content": "Add one to your kitchen island, kitchen counters, open wall space, and more. Search online for inspiration and you’ll find many creative ideas. Breakfast bars can be nestled in at the ends of kitchen counters, added to kitchen islands or peninsulas, attached to open walls, or used as freestanding, movable tables. You can add a breakfast bar right in the kitchen, in the transition zone between the kitchen and an adjoining room, or close to but outside the kitchen. [1] X Research source No matter how small or oddly-shaped your kitchen is, there’s probably a way to add a functional and beautiful breakfast bar. So go ahead and get creative!"

      "content": "Aim for 36–42 in (91–107 cm) of walking clearance. Walking clearance is the amount of space between the edge of the bar top and the opposing wall, cabinets, appliances, etc. The ideal clearance is 42 in (110 cm), since it offers plenty of space when you need to move an appliance in or out of the kitchen, but 36 in (91 cm) is also acceptable. [2] X Research source The absolute minimum walking clearance is 30 in (76 cm), and local building codes may require greater than that."

      "content": "Make it 28 in (71 cm) wide per seat and 24 in (61 cm) deep overall. It’s tough to comfortably fit a full place setting if the bartop isn’t at least 24 in (61 cm) deep, although 18 in (46 cm) is manageable if necessary. [3] X Expert Source Josh Goldenberg Residential Remodeling Expert Expert Interview. 25 January 2022. [4] X Research source Likewise, it’s hard to eat comfortably if there isn’t at least a 28 in (71 cm) wide space per seat. In fact, 30 in (76 cm) is preferable if you have the room. [5] X Research source For example, if your wooden bartop is 1.75 in (4.4 cm) thick, set the brackets so they’ll hold the top surface of the bartop 1.5 in (3.8 cm) above the top surface of the adjoining countertop. So, if you want to have 2 seats, your bar top should be 56–60 in (140–150 cm) wide, or 112–120 in (280–300 cm) wide if you want 4 seats."

      "content": "The standard is 42 in (110 cm), or you can opt for countertop height. Most people prefer to have their breakfast bar situated higher than the standard kitchen countertop height of 36 in (91 cm), for both comfort and style. That said, in some cases it may make more sense to have your breakfast bartop flow seamlessly from your kitchen countertop. [6] X Research source While standard bar chairs and stools are made to fit a 42 in (110 cm) bartop, it’s easy to find chairs and stools that fit 36 in (91 cm) as well. If you want to have the option of standing and eating comfortably, 42 in (110 cm) is definitely the way to go.

The overhang is the distance the bartop extends out from the wall or cabinetry without anything (other than support brackets) underneath it. If the bartop doesn’t have a sufficient overhang, you’ll bang your knees against the wall or cabinetry every time you sit down! [8] X Research source Always aim for at least 12 in (30 cm), and, if you have the space and strong bracketing to support the overhang, consider going as far as 18 in (46 cm) for maximum comfort.

      "title": "It depends on the bartop material, but the answer is usually yes.",
      "content": "It depends on the bartop material, but the answer is usually yes. The bartop’s overhang—which equals the open leg space underneath—is essential for comfortable breakfast bar seating. Among common bartop materials, quartz can typically handle a 14 in (36 cm) unsupported overhang, granite, 10 in (25 cm), and solid surface, 6 in (15 cm). The overhang capability of wood varies widely based on thickness, species, and many other factors. Consult with the bartop manufacturer for specific guidance. [10] X Research source In most cases, you’ll need 2 brackets for a breakfast bar that’s up to 48 in (120 cm) wide, 3 brackets for 48–96 in (120–240 cm), and so on. [11] X Research source If you’re building a breakfast bar off the end of a kitchen island or peninsula, you may be able to use hidden brackets that cantilever out right along the underside of the bartop."

      "content": "Mark the wall, attach brackets to the wall structure, and secure the bartop. Building a simple breakfast bar is a good project for the average DIYer. It really only involves standard DIY skills like measuring, drilling, and cutting. As a very broad outline, you’ll need to do the following: [12] X Research source Mark a 42 in (110 cm) high line along the wall and mark the locations of the wall studs to anchor the brackets into. Drill pilot holes and screw the brackets into place so that the tops are at the 42 in (110 cm) line. Cut the bartop to size, if needed, and attach it to the brackets from underneath with adhesive, screws, or both. A solid piece of hardwood, at least 1.5 in (3.8 cm) thick, is a good choice here."

      "content": "Install a new piece of countertop that overhangs the existing base. If you’re adding a breakfast bar to the end of your kitchen island, for instance, buy a new countertop for the island that creates an overhang of at least 12 in (30 cm) for the breakfast bar. Quartz may be able to handle this overhang unsupported, but most countertop materials will need overhang support. Here’s a general preview of the process: [13] X Research source Remove the old countertop, being careful not to damage the cabinetry. Measure, mark, and install support brackets into the cabinet structure. Alternatively, install “invisible” supports, which are flat metal rails that run under the entire countertop and cantilever out to support the overhang. Install the new countertop, using a combination of adhesive and screws."

      "title": "Make the bartop slightly higher if you don’t want to replace the whole countertop.",
      "content": "Make the bartop slightly higher if you don’t want to replace the whole countertop. Instead of having a breakfast bar that’s a seamless continuation of the countertop—which requires replacing that entire section of countertop—create a minor separation between the two elements. Install the support brackets into the structure of the cabinetry so that they’ll hold the bartop slightly higher than the countertop—nearly equal to the thickness of the bartop, ideally. [14] X Research source For example, if your wooden bartop is 1.75 in (4.4 cm) thick, set the brackets so they’ll hold the top surface of the bartop 1.5 in (3.8 cm) above the top surface of the adjoining countertop. Instead of trying to match the existing countertop, choose a coordinating color or pattern in the same material, or a different material that complements the existing countertop."

The cost can go up quickly depending on the materials you use, of course, but $500 USD is a good initial estimate. If you hire someone to build the same basic breakfast bar for you, figure on paying around $500 for labor."
