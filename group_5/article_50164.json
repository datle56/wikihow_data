      "content": "“Achillean” is a term to describe men who are attracted to men. The term is popular on social media and in fandom spaces, and is often used to refer to male-identifying people or characters who have attraction to other male-identifying people, be they cisgendered, trans, nonbinary, or of another gender identity. [1] X Research source Example: “I like men, but I prefer to call myself Achillean rather than gay.”"

      "title": "Achillean may also simply mean “like Achilles.”",
      "content": "Achillean may also simply mean “like Achilles.” Literally, “Achillean” just means “similar to Achilles.” Someone may use “Achillean” to describe someone or something that shares qualities with the Greek hero Achilles, like masculinity, bravery, strength, or any number of other traits. Example: “The way you fought off those muggers was very Achillean.”"

      "title": "Achilles was a queer-coded Greek hero.",
      "content": "Achilles was a queer-coded Greek hero. In Homer’s Iliad , Achilles shares a close bond with another male Greek figure, Patroclus. Whether or not the two were gay is hotly debated, but many scholars agree that the relationship may be read in any number of ways as queer, at least, and so the two have become gay icons of sorts in contemporary pop culture, hence the rise of “Achillean” as a term. [2] X Research source In 1883, the scholar John Addington Symonds used the term “Achilleian friendship” to describe an affectionate masculine relationship, similar to that of Achilles and Patroclus. [3] X Research source Scholar A.C. Hamilton also uses the term in his article “Spenser’s Treatment of Myth.” [4] X Research source Achilles’ relationship with Patroclus was also popularized and speculated in the popular contemporary novel The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller."

      "title": "Achillean is likely a spinoff term of “Sapphic.”",
      "content": "Achillean is likely a spinoff term of “Sapphic.” “Sapphic” is a more popular term used to describe women who are attracted to women, or something that has lesbian or lesbian-identifying qualities. Sappho, for whom the term is named, was a Greek poet from the island of Lesbos who often wrote about her desire for women. [5] X Research source “Achillean” was coined as a masculine complement to “Sapphic,” using the legendary male hero as a root word."

      "title": "“Achillean” is said to be distinct from the word “gay.”",
      "content": "“Achillean” is said to be distinct from the word “gay.” Defined loosely, “gay” refers to anyone who experiences attraction exclusively to those that are of the same gender. “Achillean,” on the other hand, refers more exclusively to male-identifying people who are attracted to other male-identifying people, and who also may be attracted to non-male-identifying people. For example, a woman who is a lesbian might be described as gay, but would not be described as Achillean. Further, a man who is attracted to both men and women might be said to be Achillean or bisexual, but not strictly gay. That said, many use “gay” to simply mean someone attracted to their own gender, and may be attracted to other genders, as well."

      "content": "The Achillean flag features a green carnation on a striped background. The green carnation is a queer symbol popularized by novelist Oscar Wilde and worn by those attracted to men. [6] X Research source The blue of the flag is said to represent masculinity, while the off-white is said to represent joy. [7] X Research source The flag was likely designed by a Tumblr user named pridenpositivity, and was soon after redesigned by a DeviantArt user named Pride-Flags."

Similarly, someone who is pansexual is attracted to people of any or all genders."
