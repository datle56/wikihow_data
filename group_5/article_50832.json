[8] X Research source To find an agent, research the top talent agencies in your area. You want to make sure that you’re working with a reputable agent, who doesn’t ask for any money upfront. Many talent agencies allow you to apply online. However, it’s a good idea to meet with a potential agent in person before you and your parents commit to working with them. If you live in a rural area where it's difficult to find an agent, that doesn't mean you can't act. It just means that you need to look for work through trade publications, such as Backstage, and online casting sites, so you can identify local acting opportunities. In some cases, agents won't take you on as a client until you have some professional acting credits to your name. You may want to find a few jobs on your own (or with your parents' help) before trying to land an agent."

Whether you have an agent or not, it's important to find as many ways to market yourself as an actor as possible, especially if you don't live in L.A. or New York, where most acting opportunities are. Make videos for YouTube that demonstrate your acting skills -- there's no guarantee casting directors or agents will see your videos, but you never know when one will go viral. Videos of school play and regional theater performances are ideal content for your YouTube channel. Local commercials or TV appearances are also a good idea because agents or casting directors outside your area probably haven't seen them. If you're feeling creative, you can also post original short films that help showcase your acting ability."
