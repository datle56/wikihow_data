      "content": "Make sure your lips aren't dry. Moistening them (but not too much) makes it easier for your lips to slide over your partner's. [1] X Research source Use colorless, stick lip balm for best results. Squeezable balm will work too but use in moderation. You don't want to smear shiny Carmex all over your partner."

      "title": "Close your eyes just before your lips touch.",
      "content": "Close your eyes just before your lips touch. Some people enjoy looking into their partner's eyes when kissing, but for most, it's a huge creepy turn off. Keep them closed and you will enjoy it more. Think about how blind people sense so much more than sighted people, the same principle applies. You will get a more rushing sensation from the touch and feel of a kiss if your eyes are relaxed and closed."

      "title": "Use your hands!",
      "content": "Use your hands! Don't let your arms awkwardly hang there. Guys, your hands should be around her back, waist, or on the sides of her face. Girls, your hands can be in a NUMBER of places, including: around his neck, on the sides of HIS face, on his stomach, on his hips, or a guy's favorite, on his biceps. Also don't be afraid to run your fingers through your partner's hair, just make sure your hair is clean just in case it happens to YOU!"

      "title": "Let them know what they are doing is good.",
      "content": "Let them know what they are doing is good. Softly moan, sigh, or kiss back harder if what they are doing is pleasurable. Girls, if you are holding their arms/biceps, give a little squeeze plus a moan to drive them nuts."

      "content": "If you're smaller than the partner you're going to kiss, then hold your head a little back and stand on your tiptoes if comfortable. If you are a girl and you are shorter, as it is in most cases, wrap your arms around his neck and he will naturally wrap his around your waist and lift you up."

      "title": "French Kiss.",
      "content": "French Kiss. Remember: Don't dive straight for the tonsils. Play with their tongue - caress, fondle, wrestle with it. [2] X Research source Think of it as trying to massage the other's tongue. NEVER bite; you could easily hurt the other person. If you're a bit intimidated by French Kissing , don't be! It sounds scary only because it is not as easy as a regular kiss, but just do it in small steps. First, start kissing like a normal kiss, then slowly open your mouth and touch your partner's tongue softly with yours. They will get the hint and go from there! Use your tongue in the way you want your partner to use his/hers - both of you will naturally do the same."

      "title": "Relax!",
      "content": "Relax! As long as you're both comfortable and at ease, the kiss will be pleasurable for you two. Just empty your mind of everything except the moment at hand and you will master the art of kissing."
