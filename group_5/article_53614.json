      "title": "First, draw a large oval.",
      "content": "First, draw a large oval. This will be Gary's shell. It should look like the outline of a face at this point, but don't be unnerved; Gary's shell is just unusually tall."

      "title": "Draw a flat oval below the shell for his body.",
      "content": "Draw a flat oval below the shell for his body. Gary's a fairly thin snail, so don't puff him up any more than necessary, and make sure he lies flat on the ground."

      "title": "Add two small circles for the eyeballs.",
      "content": "Add two small circles for the eyeballs. Connect them to the body using thin rectangles. Gary's eyes are actually similar to Mr. Krabs', so keep that in mind as you complete this step."

      "title": "Add two concentric circles for his actual eyes.",
      "content": "Add two concentric circles for his actual eyes. Add detail to his shell by drawing a swirl then five small ovals above it."

    {
      "title": "Ink the drawing.",
      "content": "Ink the drawing. Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Also erase any remaining sketch lines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Color in your drawing.",
      "content": "Color in your drawing. Use pink and purple for the shell, and shades of green and light blue for his body and blue eye stems and green eye rings with a red pupil and There you go, Gary the Snail!"
