Vowels are written independently only when they begin a syllable. Start learning how to write in Telugu by focusing on the individual letters first. [4] X Research source The individual vowels (అచ్చులు - acchulu) are: అ ఆ ఇ ఈ ఉ ఊ ఋ ౠ ఎ ఏ ఐ ఒ ఓ ఔ అం అః , pronounced respectively as a, aa, i (as in pit), ii (as in meet), u (as it put), uu (as in root), ru ( as in prude), ruu (as in crude), e (as in peck), ae (as in cake), ai (as in my), o (as in show), O (as in row), ou (as in cow), am (as in mum) and aha.

The important thing is to dedicate yourself to learning by keeping your ultimate goal in mind. [6] X Research source Grab some Telugu-language books and copy the script you see in them.

And, as with most languages, knowing the most common 2,700 words will make you familiar with about 80% of the words used in Telugu writing or conversation. [10] X Research source This 90-day plan may not be ideal in every situation, depending on your specific goals for learning Telugu. However, it is a broadly-useful way to learn the basics of a language in a fairly short amount of time."

Explore several options and choose one that suits your goals for learning the language. Hiring a Telugu tutor may be a pricier option, and it may be hard to find a Telugu tutor where you live.

At this point, you’ll be able to “dive in” to Telugu conversations and pick up on at least some of what the Telugu speakers are saying. [14] X Research source If you have friends who speak Telugu, ask them to carry on a conversation while you follow along--and even join in.

However, the real reason may be that they tend to be less self-conscious about trying things out, making mistakes, and trying again. So, free your inner child while you learn Telugu! [16] X Research source If you mangle your words or ask a nonsensical question, laugh it off and try again. Most Telugu speakers, like native speakers of languages around the world, are happy when non-natives try to speak their language. Instead of being insulted that you messed up, they’ll likely be eager to help you out."
