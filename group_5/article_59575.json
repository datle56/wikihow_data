      "content": "Lay the underwear on a flat surface. It's much easier to fold or roll when you're using a flat surface. You can use a table, the bed, or even the floor or a lap desk. Place the underwear flat on the surface with the front facing up. Quickly smooth out any wrinkles. For underwear, the surface doesn't have to be very big."

      "title": "Turn the band of the underwear down.",
      "content": "Turn the band of the underwear down. Fold the band over the underwear so that the top is inside out. You will use the band at the end to fold the underwear into itself so you just need 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) at the top. [1] X Research source Think of this step like turning up the cuff on a sleeve."

      "title": "Fold the underwear in thirds by bringing in the 2 sides.",
      "content": "Fold the underwear in thirds by bringing in the 2 sides. Fold the right third over the middle section of the underwear. Do the same with the left side by bringing it over the right side. You should have an elongated rectangle that's 1/3 the size of what you started with. [2] X Research source Before folding the right and left sides in, you can fold the bottom half of the crotch up to the band. However, it's not a necessary step."

      "title": "Roll the underwear up from the bottom of the crotch to the band.",
      "content": "Roll the underwear up from the bottom of the crotch to the band. Start with the bottom edge and fold a little bit over itself to start the roll. Continue the roll upward until you meet the band. [3] X Research source If you want, you can do small folds instead of rolling. That will create underwear that will stand upright in the drawer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the band over the underwear.",
      "content": "Flip the band over the underwear. Roll the underwear all the way to the very edge of the fold. Grab the roll with 1 hand. With your other hand, pull the band and extra underwear over the roll you just made, essentially flipping the band back the other way. You should have a tight roll that won't come undone.

      "title": "Place the underwear on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Place the underwear on a flat surface. Pick whatever is easiest for you, such as the dining room table, a coffee table, or even the floor or bed. Place the underwear in front of you, flattening it out. Use your hand to get rid of wrinkles. Put the underwear with the front side up. The edge closest to you should be the band of the underwear."

      "title": "Begin rolling the underwear up from the band.",
      "content": "Begin rolling the underwear up from the band. Grab the edge of the band and fold a tiny bit over itself. That will begin the roll. Keep rolling the underwear until you reach the crotch. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space unrolled when you hit the crotch. [5] X Research source You will use the extra space to fold the underwear into itself."

      "title": "Flip the underwear over.",
      "content": "Flip the underwear over. Grab the roll from both ends so it doesn't unroll, then flip the underwear so the part you just rolled is facing the flat surface. You should have a long roll with a tiny flap of the crotch unrolled in the middle. [6] X Research source Put the crotch so it's facing you."

      "content": "Push the crotch over the flap. Lift the 2 inches (5.1 cm) of crotch you left unrolled over the folds you just made. You will now have a mostly compact underwear roll, but if you leave it just like this, it will come unrolled. [8] X Research source The crotch should cover the folds you made, reaching over the top."

      "title": "Flip the underwear into itself.",
      "content": "Flip the underwear into itself. Tip the side of the underwear facing you upwards, and you'll notice a little opening, like an envelope. Flip that over the rest of the folds, basically moving it inside out. Repeat this motion a second time to complete the fold. [9] X Research source Once you've made the final fold, it shouldn't come unrolled. It's somewhat like rolling socks on themselves."

Lay the underwear out flat and fold it in half from left to right. Put the underwear in the middle of the shirt. Leave the socks off for right now. [10] X Research source This method allows you to roll socks, underwear, and a shirt in 1 tight bundle, making it easy to grab what you need. If you want, you can place a pair of shorts or pants between the shirt and the underwear. Fold the pants in half lengthwise. Lay them out flat and center them on the shirt with the waistband just under the collar of the shirt. However, don't use anything too bulky, as it won't roll well. [11] X Research source"

Be sure to smooth out wrinkles as you go and make the fold as neat as you can to prevent future wrinkles.

You now have a tight, neat bundle that won't come undone. [15] X Research source"
