Generic desktop computers need to be opened using screwdrivers. However, certain brands have buttons or knobs you can use to open the computer case. This eliminates the need for tools, making the process much easier. If you have a dell GX260 or GX270 desktop, you do not need to remove any screws to open the case. There are two buttons you press and then lift the case to open. If you have a tower case, there are also usually buttons. HP D510 small form desktops also have buttons you can use to remove the case. If you have an HP D510 tower desktop, there are tiny knobs on the back you unscrew. You will not need a screwdriver or other tools to open the desktop case. An HP D50 small form desktop also has knobs you unscrew. A screwdriver or other tools are not required for these desktops. A Dell Dimension 8200 Desktop has a button you press to open the case. Make sure to lay this kind of computer on its side, with the CD drives and front of the computer facing downward, before opening."

It will have specific instructions based on your laptop. It should include pictures and diagrams that indicate which screws need to be removed if you're opening the desktop case. If you can't find your owner's manual, you'll usually need to open a computer in a way that allows you to access the motherboard. This usually means opening the computer on the side opposite of where plugs are inserted into the computer. Unscrew the plugs on this side, and then gently lift the case off of the computer. Set it aside somewhere safe while you work on or clean the computer."
