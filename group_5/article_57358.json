      "title": "Be busy so he wonders who you’re giving time and attention to.",
      "content": "Be busy so he wonders who you’re giving time and attention to. Libras love being the center of attention, and they really don’t like it when that attention is split with other people. Plus, Libras are cardinal signs, meaning they love to plan ahead. If you want to make your Libra guy jealous, tell him that you’re too busy to hang or you can’t see him this week. “Oh sorry, I can’t hang this week. I have plans every day after work.” “Ooh, this weekend is pretty busy for me. Could we do next week instead?”"

      "title": "Mention others to show him that your attention is directed elsewhere.",
      "content": "Mention others to show him that your attention is directed elsewhere. Libras are very sensitive, so he’s sure to notice when you start talking about someone else. When you two are hanging out, casually mention your other friends (bonus points if they’re also guys). You don’t have to be crass, but you can signal to your Libra man that you enjoy spending time with others to make him feel jealous. “Mark and I went to the most delicious steak house the other day—you’ve gotta try it!” “One of my classmates told me the funniest joke this morning. I couldn’t stop laughing for like, an hour.”"

    {
      "title": "Be social with other people so he feels left out.",
      "content": "Be social with other people so he feels left out. Libras are often afraid of being alone, so you can play into this. Make plans with your pals and spend time having fun with your friends (and don’t forget to take tons of pics to post on Instagram later, too). Want to be a little more subtle? Ask your friends to post pics with you and tag you so you show up on his feed."

      "title": "Make your guy jealous with fun, flirty pics.",
      "content": "Make your guy jealous with fun, flirty pics. Libras are naturally drawn toward beauty and appearance, which means they’re often on social media a lot. [1] X Research source Try posting pictures of yourself and with friends on social media to show your guy just how much fun you’re having without him. Libra is ruled by Venus, the planet of love, harmony, and self-worth. Their ruling planet drives their love of all things beautiful."

      "title": "Show other people attention online to make your guy jealous.",
      "content": "Show other people attention online to make your guy jealous. Instead of commenting on his pics or replying to his Story, leave a comment on someone else’s page that he’s sure to see. He’ll wonder why you’re ignoring his content and commenting on someone else's. Keep your comments G-rated, and don’t flirt with anyone online. Just a simple, “You look great!” or, “Wow!” will be enough to make your Libra man pause."

      "title": "Brief, rushed texts tell your guy that you don’t have time for him.",
      "content": "Brief, rushed texts tell your guy that you don’t have time for him. When he reaches out to you, instead of sending long paragraphs or multiple texts, keep it short and sweet. This way, you’re not ignoring him entirely, but you are showing him that you have other things you could be doing. Lay off the emojis and the punctuation, too. Stick to short, one-word messages to let him know you’re not super interested in talking to him."

      "title": "Make your Libra guy wonder why you aren’t texting him back.",
      "content": "Make your Libra guy wonder why you aren’t texting him back. Libras are social creatures, and they love spending all their time with their partner. You can make him jealous by widening your response times—leave him hanging for a few hours to make him sweat. Libras don’t love being ignored entirely, so try to remember to respond to his message eventually. Otherwise, he could get hurt enough to move on."

      "title": "Libras love flattery, so losing it will make him sad.",
      "content": "Libras love flattery, so losing it will make him sad. [2] X Research source If you can cut down on the compliments, he’ll feel a little hurt, and probably wonder why you stopped appreciating him so much. Over time, he might even start to wonder who your compliments are going to (now that they’re not directed at him). Cutting down on compliments can also make him think that you’re losing interest in him. If that’s the case, he might just up the ante and work harder to reel you back in. It’s fine to cut down on the compliments, but don’t criticize your guy as a way to win him back. Libras are super sensitive, and hurting his feelings could push him further away from you."

    {
      "title": "Direct your attention to other people to make him feel threatened.",
      "content": "Direct your attention to other people to make him feel threatened. Libras hate it when they aren’t the center of attention. If you’re at a party or a big get-together, leave his side and go make friends somewhere else. Laugh at someone else’s jokes or get into a deep conversation with a new friend to really make your Libra man jealous. Talking to other people at a party is fine, but flirting in front of a Libra guy is a no-go. Libras value just, honorable behavior (their symbol is the scales, after all), and seeing you flirt with someone else could be enough to make him walk away."

      "title": "Contact other people to show him that you’re in high demand.",
      "content": "Contact other people to show him that you’re in high demand. Give this social butterfly a taste of his own medicine by responding to texts and answering DMs when he’s around. If he gets irritated or annoyed, tell him that you can’t just ignore your friends! Libras are normally pretty confident, but they can get insecure when you don’t give them 100% of your time.

    {
      "title": "Getting jealous will tell him that you still care about him.",
      "content": "Getting jealous will tell him that you still care about him. Libras are not confrontational people, so if he notices what you’re doing, he won’t confront you about it. Instead, he’ll probably do something to set you off. Keep ignoring it and maintain an aloof, neutral response. He might try to flirt with other people in front of you, or he might start ignoring your messages. Just keep in mind that it probably means your tactics are working, and he’s getting jealous enough to retaliate."
