      "content": "Break things down so you don’t have so much to do at once. Creating a minimalist house or apartment is a really big undertaking, and it’s understandable if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. Take a deep breath, and focus on 1 room a time. There’s no deadline for reorganizing your home, so give yourself as much time as you need to get your home exactly the way you’d like it. [1] X Research source It might help to target your messiest room first, and then branch out from there. You might also reorganize your rooms in the order that you usually walk through them. For instance, you might start in your bedroom, then move on to the bathroom, living room, and kitchen."

      "title": "Start with the biggest items and work your way down.",
      "content": "Start with the biggest items and work your way down. Look at each piece of furniture, and ask yourself if you really need it or not. Then, work your way down to smaller items, like household appliances, pieces of decor, books, and other personal belongings. See if your home really needs the item, or if it’s just taking up space—this can really help narrow things down. [2] X Research source For example, you might have an old armchair that you never use or sit in. You can donate this to charity, or resell it to a new owner. You might have too many lamps in 1 room, or lots of books and magazines that you never read. These are things you can get rid of to simplify and “minimize” your space."

      "title": "Donate or toss out any extra items that you don’t need.",
      "content": "Donate or toss out any extra items that you don’t need. Look through your drawers and cabinets to see if you have any duplicate items lying around, like measuring cups, extra silverware, throw pillows, blankets, extra cosmetics, and more. Ask yourself if you’re using these extra objects frequently—if the answer is no, then it’s probably safe to throw them out. [3] X Research source For example, if you have an extra tube of lipstick that you never use, consider throwing it out (or giving it to a friend if it’s unopened). If you have 5 or 6 throw pillows on your couch, donate most of them so you only have 1 or 2."

      "title": "Sort your belongings once a season and donate some of them to charity.",
      "content": "Sort your belongings once a season and donate some of them to charity. Set a time during the year to go through all of your things, whether it’s clothing, kitchen tools, books, or anything else. If you don’t actively use the item any more, set it aside in a donation pile. [4] X Research source Charities like Goodwill and Volunteers of America are great to consider. You can also sell your old, unwanted items and donate the profits to a charity. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to clean up clutter as soon as you notice it. Get in the habit of putting everything away as soon as you’re done with it, so your home can be really clean, open, and streamlined. Set aside a few minutes every night to clean off the surfaces of your home, so it doesn’t start to stack up. [6] X Research source For instance, you can recycle any old receipts and papers laying on your countertop before you go to bed. You can wash your dishes right after each meal so they don’t collect in your sink."

      "title": "Search for any loose receipts or files lying around.",
      "content": "Search for any loose receipts or files lying around. Ask yourself if you need them, or if they’re just taking up valuable space in your home. To be safe, scan the documents to your computer or phone so you can have them on hand if you need them. Then, recycle the leftover paper to get rid of the clutter! [7] X Research source You can use a regular scanner, or a special scanning app, like Dropbox, Evernote, Adobe Scan, or Piksoft TurboScan Pro. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep everything out of sight unless you’re actively using it. Find a place in your home for all of your leftover items, whether it’s a cabinet, dresser, ottoman, or some other form of storage. [9] X Research source Choose an assigned space for every item in your home, so you can remember where everything goes in the future. [10] X Research source For example, you can keep a few DVDs stored in an entertainment center, and your basic toiletries stored in a bathroom cabinet. You can keep your clothes organized in a dresser or wardrobe, depending on what your closet space is like."

      "content": "Decorate with a few accents you really love, then get rid of the rest. Chances are, you don’t need dozens of pictures or pieces of art hanging up on your wall or cluttering up your counters and surfaces. Look through each decoration—does this art, photo, or decor item hold a lot of personal value, or is it just taking up space? Focus on the decorations and accents that really add a personal touch to your home, instead of hanging up random paintings and photographs. [11] X Research source For instance, you might hang up a piece of art that a friend or family member made instead of a random accent you bought at a store. You might prefer hanging up a tasteful family photo instead of a bunch of random nature photos. Limit 1-2 accents for each room, so your home isn’t overwhelmed with odds and ends."

      "content": "Look for furniture that can do at least 2 things at once. Minimalism is all about streamlining your space. Shop for pieces of furniture that really help make the most of your home. Fill your rooms with furniture that double as storage, or serve another useful purpose. [12] X Research source For example, you might have a sofa that pulls out into a bed. You can fill your room with small, empty ottomans that you can open and fill with different odds and ends. Some bed frames can double as a nightstand."

      "title": "Don’t decorate your home with a lot of distracting colors.",
      "content": "Don’t decorate your home with a lot of distracting colors. Instead, focus on calm, neutral-toned hues that really balance out your living space. Play around with subtle tones, like whites, tans, grays, and browns. You can create a really inviting and engaging living space, even if you don’t have a lot of colorful decorations. [13] X Research source Neutral tones don’t have to be boring! You can add a lot of life and character to your living space by adjusting the tone. For instance, you can repaint basic white walls with a warm, coconut milk color. [14] X Research source If you want to jazz things up, choose a single, warm color to liven up your room. This could be something like a bright red nightstand or a yellow area rug."

      "title": "Add a couple of blankets, pillows, or drapes to your home.",
      "content": "Add a couple of blankets, pillows, or drapes to your home. Your home doesn’t need to be overflowing with linens, but a few textiles can really help give your home a little personality. Hang up a few simple drapes around your windows, and prop a few floor pillows around your living space. A little linen can go a long way! [15] X Research source You can create some warm, cozy effects by arranging linens with heavier materials, like wool. For example, you can make up your bed with linen sheets and a warmer blanket."

      "title": "Add simple, neutral-toned window coverings to help minimize your space.",
      "content": "Add simple, neutral-toned window coverings to help minimize your space. Ditch any curtains or drapes with a lot of crazy colors and patterns—these are pretty distracting, and add a lot of visual “clutter” to your home. Instead, choose basic shades, coverings, blinds or drapes, which offer some privacy without sticking out. [16] X Research source For example, you might invest in a set of window blinds instead of colorful curtains. You might switch out patterned drapes for simple, neutral tones."

      "title": "Add an extra dimension to your living space with a few textured items.",
      "content": "Add an extra dimension to your living space with a few textured items. Look for rugs, accessories, and other accents that add a fun, textured touch to your living space without overwhelming the room’s simple design. Pick out different materials, like wood, velvet, or leather, and see what kinds of arrangements you can create. [17] X Research source For instance, you might have a wooden coffee table paired with a velvet chair, along with a leather couch. You might add a spiky houseplant to your living space as an extra touch."

      "title": "Pick out simple lights that won’t overwhelm your living space.",
      "content": "Pick out simple lights that won’t overwhelm your living space. Cool-toned lights are really popular, but they make your living space feel cold and harsh. Instead, go for some slightly warmer bulbs—these will keep your living space well-lit, but also add a nice ambiance. [18] X Research source Candles tend to add a lot of clutter to your living space, and aren’t a really great option for a minimalist home. If you really love natural light, invest in some uniquely shaped candles that don’t require a lantern or container."
