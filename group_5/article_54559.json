      "content": "Pull your eyelid out. Using your forefinger and thumb, grab your upper eyelid and gently pull straight outwards (not up or down) the outer ridge of skin on your eyelid, not just your eyelash, as this may lead to you pulling out some eyelashes."

      "title": "Press down on your eyelid.",
      "content": "Press down on your eyelid. Using the forefinger of your other hand, gently press down on the center of your eyelid as you continue to hold it out. This requires some good coordination, so be careful not to poke your eye. It may take a couple tries to get it right -- but keep at it! [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull your eyelid up.",
      "content": "Pull your eyelid up. With your eyelid clasped between your forefinger and thumb, quickly withdraw the forefinger you used to press down with, and lift up with your forefinger and thumb. Make sure you take the forefinger out just a millisecond after you pull the eyelid up, otherwise it will not be flipped. This, too, may take a couple of attempts to get the timing right.

      "content": "Repeat this process with your other eyelid. Follow the same steps you used for your other eyelid. If you're not ambidextrous, this may feel very awkward, but after a few tries you should begin to get the hang of it."

      "title": "Pull your eyelid up.",
      "content": "Pull your eyelid up. Once you've got a good grip on your eyelid, pull it up above your eye, around where your eyebrow is. This will probably feel strange, so don't freak yourself out! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Press your eyelid.",
      "content": "Press your eyelid. In one smooth motion, use your thumb to press your eyelid against the bone under your eyebrow (the supraorbital arch) and withdraw your forefinger. Your thumb will then be holding your eyelid up against your face without your forefinger. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Push your eyelid down.",
      "content": "Push your eyelid down. Now, with your thumb, gently push your eyelid down so that it folds over itself and flips inside-out. The push-force should be more against your face as you lower your eyelid with your thumb. This is so your eyelid doesn't slip from under your thumb. [8] X Research source"

A \"peace sign\" is when you hold up only your middle and forefinger and spread them apart like a pair of scissors. [11] X Research source"

Your middle finger should rest at the bottom of your eye. [12] X Research source"
