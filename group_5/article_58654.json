      "content": "This is an awesome way to advertise online for free. While pop-ups and banner ads cost money, advertising on Facebook or Twitter is free. Use your company’s social media accounts to share fun information about your product with others online. You can even live stream, or comment on other people’s posts to draw more attention to your page. Social media is also a great place to showcase other promotions, like discounts and giveaways. [2] X Research source Remember, most people on social media aren't looking to be sold a product. Instead of directly advertising, try posting interesting, relevant content that will build awareness about your product. Be inviting and playful, not cold and calculated with your posts. [3] X Expert Source Christine Michel Carter Global Marketing Expert Expert Interview. 30 September. Interact with the people who comment on your posts and ask you questions about your product. The more engagement you get, the more likely you’ll be to see growth!"

If you've just launched something new and want to let your customers know, write a blog post that highlights all the features it offers. Include details on how it differs from older products and why it would appeal to your customers. Publish the blog post on your website and link to it on social media sites like Instagram and Facebook. [6] X Research source Let's say you run a popcorn brand and you just launched some new flavors.

      "content": "Get the word out about your new product in local newspapers. First, brainstorm what makes your product new or interesting. Ask yourself what you think is most appealing about your product, and what will excite journalists to cover its release. Once you start writing, make every word count. Keep the announcement brief at about 300-400 words maximum. Email it to any news organization in the area you think might be interested. If your product is available online and you have some budget to spend, consider using the help of a press release firm. They can write articles for you and post them on hundreds of relevant news sites. [8] X Research source Make the first line of your press release clear and to the point to get journalists' attention. If your ice cream shop is giving away free ice cream to promote your new menu, write something like, \"Ice cream shop will give free ice cream to first 100 customers next month.\""

      "content": "Offer a free sample to customers to get them to try your product. Nothing shows confidence in your product like letting your customer sample it for free before buying. Additionally, a customer is more likely to buy something if they have just experienced its benefits. You can’t do this with every product, but if you can let folks “test drive” your product, they’ll be more likely to buy it. [9] X Research source A sample doesn't just refer to food products. The same principle applies to other products and services. For instance, if you're selling cars, test drives or a free trial subscription to an online service are the rough equivalent of a free sample."

      "title": "Give out coupons, special discounts, or deals to attract customers.",
      "content": "Give out coupons, special discounts, or deals to attract customers. Most people dislike the idea of \"missing out\" on a good deal, so they're more likely to buy a product if there’s a special bonus that's not normally available. A lot of consumers will buy something they wouldn’t have normally purchased just because it’s on sale or comes with some kind of extra benefit. [10] X Research source Potential incentives include: New member discounts. If you offer cheaper prices for people who make an account, sign up for a mailing list, or become a member of your service, you’ll build up a larger reoccurring customer base. Buy-one-get-one-free deals. Offer the customer a free reward (this can be more of your product or a different product entirely) if they buy a certain amount of your product. Holiday deals and sales. Running a promotion for holidays can really generate new business. People tend to buy more goods on certain holidays, and a sale is a great way to attract folks. Rebates. By putting the responsibility to claim a discount on the customer after the purchase has been made, you can save money relative to other promotional deals because many will forget or neglect to send in their rebates."

      "content": "Ask popular influencers to review your product online. Influencers are well known members of an industry who people trust, such as hairstylists who have a strong social media presence and review hair products. Identify influencers in your industry who might be able to spread the word about your product and make an impact on its reception. Contact 2-3 influencers via email to try out your product and review it. [12] X Research source You can offer to give them your product for free in exchange for the review. If they’re an especially popular influencer, they may ask for some kind of monetary compensation on top of it. For example, if you’re developing a fitness app, you might ask a popular fitness guru from Instagram to try the app and review it on their platform."
