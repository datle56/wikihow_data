      "content": "Posh Protect Posh Protect is Poshmark’s protection policy for users who make purchases on their website. The policy states that Poshmark will issue a full refund if you receive an item that doesn’t match the seller’s description. [5] X Research source Once you receive an item, you have 3 days to report any issues, and you’ll need to provide photos for Poshmark to verify the problem. If Poshmark approves the return, they’ll send a return label for you to send the item back to the seller, and they’ll issue a full refund. Poshmark’s return policy covers damage that the seller did not disclose, incorrect or missing items, inauthentic items, or items arriving not as described. The policy does not cover items that don't fit, that you’ve changed your mind about, or items that were traded or paid for outside of the Poshmark platform. Poshmark does not issue refunds for these issues, though you can try to resell the item on Poshmark yourself. If you don’t report an issue within 3 days of receiving your order, your payment will automatically be released to the seller, so be sure to report any problems in a timely manner!

For this reason, it’s definitely a red flag if a seller asks you to pay them through another platform, like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, or a bank transfer. [14] X Research source This stands for other online marketplaces, such as DePop or ThredUp, as well. Dishonest sellers often try to get people to pay outside of these platforms, instead requesting that you pay through less secure methods like wire transfers.
