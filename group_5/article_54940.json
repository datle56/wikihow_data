      "content": "Place bait traps near ant trails. Choose a slow-acting bait so the ants bring it back to the rest of the colony in the nest. Set out the traps where you’ve seen ants the most frequently, such as your kitchen, bathroom, or attic. Replace the baits every few days until you don’t see any more carpenter ants in your home. [1] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Avoid using an insecticidal spray that immediately kills carpenter ants since the rest of the colony won’t be affected by it and it can cause them to spread out to build more nests. Bait traps are your best bet if you can’t easily find where the ants are nesting or if you don’t want to use chemical insecticides. If you have kids or pets, place the traps where they’re unable to access them since they contain mild poisons."

After you’re finished applying the dust, seal the holes with a dowel or small piece of cork and paint over it to hide your repairs."
