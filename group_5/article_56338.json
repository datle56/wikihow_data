Chicken broth, peanut butter, and marinara sauce tend to be popular. Rub your finger along your Yorkie’s teeth and gums while she licks your fingers. After the first day, start occasionally dipping your finger in your dog’s toothpaste. Some popular flavors include poultry, beef, and liver. Make sure she likes it. If she has no interest in licking it, then you might want to try another flavor. You should never use human toothpaste to brush your Yorkie's teeth.
