      "content": "Take a small section of hair from the back of the head. With your comb, separate a small diagonal section of hair from the bottom of the back section. Comb it flat against the client's neck, letting it come to a natural fall. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide the hair in four sections that are parted neat and straight. Your vertical part should be straight down the middle of your client's head, and your horizontal part should be about one inch above the hairline. Each side of the bottom horizontal portion should be divided equally down the center and tucked off to each side."

      "title": "Comb the hair flat against the neck.",
      "content": "Comb the hair flat against the neck. The hair should be cut in natural fall. This means that you should comb the hair flat against the neck, holding it with light tension. This will help create more blended graduations. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin cutting.",
      "content": "Begin cutting. Take a diagonal subsection of hair from the back, and hold your hand close to the base of the scalp at a 45-degree angle. Cut the hair along the 45-degree line created by your fingers. [5] X Research source Cut the hair above the parietal ridge (where the skull begins to curve upwards to the top of the head) at a lower elevation. If you are right-handed, comb the left section aside, beginning with the right half of your first section. Left handed individuals should follow these directions in reverse, starting first with the left section and then working from the outside in."

      "content": "Follow the guideline of your hand closely. You will want to cut a straight line from the outside inward. Use the straight edge of your hand to maintain your cutting angle. Cross check by pulling a small piece of hair from the same spot on either side and visually checking the length."

This line can be identified by connecting an imaginary line from ear-to-ear across the top of the middle of the head. Separate the back portion by directing it behind the ear.

[8] X Research source A layered cut will make the hair naturally stack on itself, giving your stacked bob more body as a result.
