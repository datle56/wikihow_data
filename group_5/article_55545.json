      "content": "Add the right interests. Omegle allows you to choose interests so you can be matched with people who like similar things. But beware: some interests are more dangerous than others, so proceed at own risk. Religion and other controversial topics are especially prone to extremists, trolls, and people you don't want to meet. If you notice there are lots of trolls or bots with a certain interest, remove it and try again after a week."

      "content": "If you want to avoid trolls, make it clear. After introducing yourself, say something like, \"I don't want to be rude, but if you are horny, can't speak English, or don't want to actually have a conversation, please disconnect.\""

      "content": "Learn how to identify trolls and bots. There are key ways to point out people who are trolls. They may say something very random and offensive at the start of the conversation, or simply say \"I'm horny\". They usually type first, and type often, as well. Bots leave automated messages and are often instant replies that don't relate to the subject."

      "content": "Don't be afraid to disconnect. If the person you are talking to seems to be weird, simply disconnect. Also, if the person starts a conversation by saying \"asl\" they are most likely looking for someone to have cyber sex with."
