Peek underneath your sink and locate both shutoff valves—they’ll be at the lower end of the 2 flexible water supply lines that connect to the underside of the sink. Turn them clockwise until they are fully closed. Then, turn on the hot and cold faucet taps and drain the water from the lines. [3] X Research source If the water supply won’t shut off completely, you’ll have to replace 1 or both shutoff valves.

      "content": "Pry the cover off the faucet tap with a flat-head screwdriver. Compression faucets have screws in each tap (hot and cold) that are concealed beneath plastic or metal caps. These caps often have the H (hot) and C (cold) indicators marked on them. Wedge the blade of a flathead screwdriver beneath the cap and pop it off. [6] X Research source You’ll usually find a small indentation somewhere beneath the rim of the cap—if you do, wedge your screwdriver into this spot. If you’re only replacing the washer on 1 tap (e.g., cold), don’t bother popping the cap or working on the other tap (e.g., hot). But this might be a good time to replace the washers on both taps.

Adjust your crescent wrench so it fits snugly around the packing nut, then turn counterclockwise until it releases. At this point, you can lift the tap stem up and out of the sink. [9] X Research source In some cases, you may have a compression-style sink with separate faucets—that is, a hot faucet and cold faucet, each attached to their respective handles. If so, grip the faucet with one hand while you loosen the packing nut with the wrench in your other hand. Then pull the tap stem up and out of the faucet. If the packing nut won’t budge, try spraying it with a lubricant like WD-40, then wait 5-10 minutes and try again. If it still won’t move, call a plumber so you don’t cause damage to your sink trying to get it out. [10] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Alternatively, you can cheaply buy a collection of various rubber tap washers beforehand, and use the closest match during your repairs.

Then, if your tap stem uses a screw or nut, use the screwdriver or pliers to tighten the screw/nut back in place. [14] X Research source Depending on the tap stem model, the washer might press into an indentation in the bottom or slide over the end of the stem and into a channel. Your best bet is to place the new washer in the same spot where you found the old one."

[17] X Research source If nothing leaks, you're all done! If there is a leak, then the washer likely wasn’t the culprit in the first place. In many cases, the problem is a rutted or damaged tap seat. It’s possible to repair/replace the tap seat yourself if you have some plumbing skills, but it’s better to call a plumber if you’re a novice. [18] X Research source"
