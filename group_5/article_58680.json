      "content": "Untreated cedar shingles will start to rot after about 5 years. Over time, exposure to rain and sunlight will start to discolor and soften the wood. Eventually, they’ll start to rot and break down completely. [2] X Research source The time it takes for your untreated cedar shingles can vary depending on the climate you live in. For instance, they may start to rot quicker in more humid areas."

      "content": "Treat cedar shingles with a water-repellent preservative. Water-repellent preservative (WRP) is a generic term for a clear finish that penetrates the wood to create a protective layer that helps prevent water damage. Applying a layer of WRP can help keep your cedar shingles protected from the elements. WRP doesn’t contain any pigment and adds a shiny layer over your cedar’s natural appearance."

      "title": "Use a semitransparent or a solid-color stain if you want to add color.",
      "content": "Use a semitransparent or a solid-color stain if you want to add color. Semitransparent stains are oil-based stains that penetrate the wood to protect it from water and UV radiation. Unlike WRPs, they do contain pigments that can alter the color of your cedar shingles. Solid-color stains contain even more pigment, but also provide more protection against UV radiation from the sun. If you want to both protect your cedar shingles and add a darker color to them, go with a semitransparent or a solid-color stain."

      "content": "Dip bundles of shingles into a water-repellent preservative. If you’re using a clear coat WRP to seal your cedar shingles, the most efficient way is to dip-apply the preservative. Take a bundle of shingles, dip them into the container of WRP, and then allow the preservative to fully dry according to the directions on the packaging. Once they’re dry, your cedar shingles are sealed and ready to go."

      "content": "Use a brush or pump sprayer to apply stains. If you’re using a semitransparent or a solid-color stain, you can use a paintbrush to apply the stain, or you can use a pump sprayer to apply the stain to multiple shingles at once. Apply an even layer of the stain and allow it to fully dry according to the directions on the packaging. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply a pigmented stain to the shingles. Cedar absorbs the harmful UV rays from the sun, which can turn the wood gray over time. By applying a pigmented wood stain, you can both revitalize the look of your cedar and protect the wood from the radiation that can affect its color. [4] X Research source The pigment in the stain will help absorb the UV rays and keep them from turning your cedar shingles gray."

      "content": "Clean your gutters and clear debris off of your roof. Clogged gutters, branches, and leaves can cause water to pool on your roof which can break down your cedar shingles more quickly. Once in the spring and twice in the fall, clear out your gutters and remove any branches, leaves, or any other debris from your roof to help keep it healthy. [6] X Research source In the fall, you may have more leaves and branches on your roof, so it’s a good idea to get up there and clean it up at least 2 times or more if needed."

If you notice 1 or more of your shingles are looking discolored or rotten, contact a professional to have them properly replaced to help keep your entire roof healthy.
