      "content": "Apple probably won’t replace individual keys. A lot of frustrated MacBook users find that the letters start wearing off their most commonly used keys (such as A and S) after about 6 months of use. This seems to be especially common with MacBook Pro models released around 2018-2019. As frustrating as this problem is, Apple is unlikely to be very helpful—it’s considered a cosmetic issue, which isn’t covered by your warranty. While some users report that they were able to get individual keys replaced for free in the Apple Store, others state that Apple is only willing to replace the entire keyboard and top case at full cost. If you’d rather not spend the money to replace the whole keyboard, another option is to trade in your MacBook with Apple’s trade-in program ."

      "content": "Clean off oils with alcohol or electronics cleaning wipes. If you’ve started to notice shiny spots on your keys, some of it might be from oils from your skin. You can freshen up your keys by cleaning them with a microfiber cloth lightly dampened with isopropyl alcohol, or with wipes specially designed for cleaning keyboards and other electronics. Be careful not to get any moisture between your keys. Use a cloth or wipe that’s slightly moist, not sopping wet. You can also clean your keys with a cloth moistened with ammonia-free glass cleaner. However, be very careful to avoid any products that contain ammonia. It may eat through the paint and plastic on your keys. If the shiny spots are still there after a thorough cleaning, you might be seeing actual wear on your keys rather than just oils on the surface. It’s normal for the matte finish to start rubbing off after a few months of regular use."
