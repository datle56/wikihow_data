      "content": "Drink a cup of coffee or tea for a quick shot of energy. Sit down with your caffeinated beverage of choice when it’s time to focus on your task. It will help perk you up and improve your powers of concentration. [2] X Research source Don’t overdo it, though! Drinking too much caffeine will make you jittery, and you’ll actually have a harder time focusing. Stick to no more than 300 mg of caffeine (the amount in about 3 typical cups of coffee) per day. For the best effects, drink it once a day, at the time you most need to boost your focus."

      "content": "The act of chewing increases blood flow to parts of your brain. Grab a stick of gum or a peppermint candy if you feel your focus slipping. You might find that having something to work on with your mouth makes it easier to concentrate. [3] X Research source There’s not much hard data to back it up, but some scientists believe that the smell of peppermint can increase alertness and help you concentrate longer. Choose mint gum or candy for an extra shot of mental energy."

Move it around in your hands while you work on your task. [4] X Research source Other forms of movement can also help you concentrate. For instance, try sitting on a bouncy chair or even standing and doing light stretches while you work. It’s not clear why fidgets are so helpful. Scientists think the extra stimulation keeps your brain busy enough that your mind doesn’t wander as much during boring tasks."

If you can, find a place to work where you won’t be distracted by TV screens, loud noises, or other people moving around and talking. [8] X Research source If you’re working on a computer or tablet, consider installing an app or browser extension that can block distracting websites or social media apps. For instance, try a productivity app like Freedom, or an extension like StayFocusd. Sometimes it can be hard to get away from distracting background noise. If you can’t find a quiet place to work, put on noise-canceling headphones and listen to white noise or quiet music."

If you keep getting distracted by something that’s worrying you, write it on a piece of paper or make a note in a document on your computer. Then you can turn your attention back to whatever it is once you’re done with your current task. [9] X Research source For instance, if you’re worried that you’re going to forget about another task you need to do, write a reminder to yourself. If you’re feeling down about something, putting your feelings on paper can make them less overwhelming and distracting. For example, write something like, “I’m still mad about what happened in class yesterday!” Once you’ve done that, you might find it easier to let go and stop thinking about it. If you still can’t stop thinking about whatever is distracting you, take a brief break and move around to help clear your head."

Set that time aside for just the one thing you want to focus on, so you won’t be tempted to multi-task. Set both a start time and an end time, since having a time limit can help you stay on track. [12] X Research source For instance, you might block out half an hour after lunch to do your math homework. If you’re not able to finish your task in the amount of time you set for yourself, schedule a new time to complete your work—even if it’s just a little later the same day."

Try to choose a spot where you can close the door so you’re less likely to be disturbed. [14] X Research source Try not to pick a spot that’s too comfortable (like your bed or a really cozy couch), or you might be tempted to fall asleep. Experiment with the type of environment that works best for you. For instance, some people actually concentrate better in a place with quiet background noise, like a coffee shop or public park. [15] X Research source It’s not always possible to find a good place to work, but you can do things to make your space more comfortable. For example, add a cushion to your chair, put up a privacy screen at your desk, or grab a blanket if you’re too cold."

As you meditate, try to notice when your mind wanders. It’s totally okay if this happens—the important thing is that you notice it! When you get distracted, gently turn your attention back to whatever you were focusing on. When you’re done, guide your attention back to your breath for a few moments before ending the meditation."
