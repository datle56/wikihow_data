      "content": "Obtain a gravity flow filter. This method of filtering is the cheapest of all the filtration methods. It works by connecting the filter body, containing a filter pad, with a siphon tube. The siphon tube pushes the wine through the filter. This is the cheapest method, but it is also the slowest. The slowness of this process also causes the filter pads to collect yeast and other particles from the wine."

      "title": "Buy extra filtration pads.",
      "content": "Buy extra filtration pads. The wine is forced through the filter pads. There are three different grades of filter pads. Coarse filter pad. This type of pad adds polish to the wine without losing body or color. Polish/medium filter pads. This is the type of pad that winemakers most commonly use. It adds polish to wine without removing too much body or color. Sterile/fine pads. This type of pad should be used last after the other two pads. The greatest amount of yeast is removed with this pad. It also helps remove the effects of oxidation in your wine."

      "content": "Attach the outtake tube. Fasten the outtake siphon tube to the release on the barrel or storage unit. Prepare a bottle for the wine to flow into at the other end of the filter pad. Make sure that the system is hooked up properly, and the filtration plates are set up right to prevent leakage. [2] X Research source Complete any steps in the winemaking process, except cold stabilization, before filtering. Your wine should be in the barrel or storage unit and ready to be bottled prior to beginning gravity flow filtration. Sterilize your filtration system before using."

      "content": "Replace the bottle with an empty one as it fills. This method is best if you are dealing with one or two gallons of wine at a time. Allow 45 minutes to an hour to filter one gallon of wine."

      "content": "Observe the buildup of particles on the filter pad. This type of system produces a coarser filtration. For a finer filtration, you will need a mechanical filtration system. As wine begins to get stopped up behind the pad, tilt the siphon tube back toward the barrel or storage unit, remove the filter pad, and replace it with a new one."

      "content": "Purchase a hand pump system. This system requires two people to operate. One person is needed to steady and pump, and the other person is needed to switch bottles. It works by pumping the system to push the wine through the tubing to the filtration system. This method is faster than using a gravity filtration system."

Continue to add powder in small amounts to the wine as you push it through the filtration system. Powder filtration works by forming a cake along the filter pad with the filtration powder, allowing the pad to filter out very fine particles. Replace your filtration pad constantly. Never reuse pads."
