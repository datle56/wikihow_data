      "content": "Wet your skin with warm water. Warm water helps open up your pores and can lead to a closer shave. Either hop in the shower and stand under the water for a few minutes, or soak a washcloth in warm water and hold it against your vaginal area before you start shaving.

Use caution if you use scissors, and use a handheld mirror to see what you’re doing the whole time."

      "content": "Apply baby oil to your pubic hair. After you wet your skin, pat it dry with a towel and grab the baby oil. Apply a thin layer all over your vaginal area, focusing on the areas where your pubic hair is the thickest. [2] X Research source Baby oil helps soften the skin and the hair, which can lead to a smoother shave with less irritation. Look for pure mineral oil or baby oil without any additional ingredients. Try not to get baby oil inside of your vagina, since it can cause irritation. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the oil sit for about 5 minutes. Give the baby oil some time to soak into your skin and hair. [4] X Research source Mineral oil (baby oil) is safe for most skin types, since it doesn’t actually penetrate beyond the first layer of skin. [5] X Research source If you have sensitive skin and you’ve never used baby oil before, test it on a small patch of skin before putting it on your vaginal area. Baby oil is very soothing, and it can even help reduce inflammation."

      "title": "Use baby oil instead of a shaving cream.",
      "content": "Use baby oil instead of a shaving cream. While dermatologists recommend using a shaving cream, some people find that baby oil is a great alternative! If you applied some earlier to soften your skin, just leave it on; otherwise, spread a thin layer of baby oil all over your vaginal area. [6] X Research source Baby oil may actually be a better choice for sensitive skin. Shaving creams and gels sometimes contain ingredients that can irritate your skin. Keep in mind that baby oil isn’t formulated as a shaving cream or gel. Since it’s an oil, it has the potential to clog your razor faster than a shaving cream would."

      "title": "Grab a new, clean razor.",
      "content": "Grab a new, clean razor. When you shave your vaginal area, it’s important to set up for success. Get a new razor that you haven’t used before to ensure that it’s sharp. If you use a dull razor, you could cause razor bumps or even ingrown hairs. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Experts recommend changing your razor every 5 to 7 shaves, or more if you have sensitive skin."

      "title": "Shave in the direction your hair grows.",
      "content": "Shave in the direction your hair grows. Take a look at your vaginal area and notice which direction the hair is growing (usually, it grows downward). As you shave, use short strokes, and always go in the direction of the hair. This will prevent irritation and can help avoid ingrown hairs. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source When you get to the underside of your vaginal area, or your vulva lips, you can use a mirror to look at the hair direction. A handheld mirror can also help you see how much hair you have left to shave."

      "title": "Rinse your razor after each swipe.",
      "content": "Rinse your razor after each swipe. Pubic hair can clog up your razor and lead to a bumpy shave. As you keep shaving, rinse your razor with water after each stroke. Your shave will be smoother, and your skin will be much less irritated. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Baby oil is slightly stickier than shaving cream, which is why it’s extra important to rinse your razor after each stroke."

You don’t have to dry your vaginal area all the way—leaving a little bit of moisture can actually help hydrate your skin.

They’re a little more gentle, and they can help soothe your skin if you need to."

      "content": "Apply a thin layer of baby oil to moisturize your skin. Shaving dries out your skin, and baby oil is a great moisturizer. When your skin is mostly dry (but still slightly damp), smooth on a thin layer of baby oil and rub it into your skin. Let it soak in to hydrate your skin and prevent further irritation. [12] X Research source Since baby oil is fragrance-free, it shouldn’t irritate your skin at all."
