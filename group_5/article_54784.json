      "content": "Take a portal to Azsuna and fly to Dalaran from there. If you don’t want to complete Legion’s introductory questline, there’s a simpler way to get a Dalaran Hearthstone. Head to the Stormwind Portal Room in Stormwind City if you’re in the Alliance, or the Orgrimmar Portal Room if you’re in the Horde. Then, enter the portal that leads to Azsuna. From there, use your mount and fly to the floating Dalaran island . [1] X Research source Remember: your character must be at least level 50 to take a portal to Azsuna in WoW , so this method won’t work if your character is below level 50. You’ll also need a flying mount to reach Dalaran, so buy a suitable mount if you don’t have one already."

      "content": "Speak to innkeeper Amisi Azuregaze at the Ledgermain Lounge. Once you’re in Dalaran, find the Ledgermain Lounge—an inn and tavern in the northern quarter of Runeweaver Square. Head over to Amisi Azuregaze, the innkeeper, and interact with her. Choose the “I seem to have misplaced my Dalaran Hearthstone, may I have another?” dialogue option, and you’ll get the hearthstone! [2] X Research source This method is especially convenient if you’ve somehow lost or discarded your Dalaran Hearthstone; visiting Amisi will get you a new one free of charge. If you’re having trouble finding Amisi, use your map! She’s at the coordinates 49.76, 40.17 in Dalaran."

If you’re a member of the Alliance, travel to Stormwind City , which is their capital. From there, speak to Chromie (an NPC present in both cities) to select the Legion timeline in your game. From there, find the local quest board in your city (Hero’s Call Board for Stormwind or the Warchief’s Command Board for Orgrimmar). [3] X Research source Even though the locations are different, you’ll still get the same overall quest that eventually leads to getting a Dalaran Hearthstone!"

Once you choose it, a quest called “The Legion Returns” will automatically be initiated regardless of your faction affiliation. “Broken Shore” is the introductory sequence for the Legion expansion in WoW , and “The Legion Returns” is the first quest in the sequence. [4] X Research source The only objective for “The Legion Returns” is to check in with a military leader in your respective city. If you’re in the Alliance, visit Recruiter Lee. If you’re in the Horde, visit Holgar Stormaxe. Recruiter Lee is a human located in Stormwind Harbor, in the northwestern section of Stormwind City. Holgar Stormaxe is an orc located at the Dranosh'ar Blockade in Durotar, just outside Orgrimmar."

However, if you haven’t played the introductory sequence yet, you’ll need to complete it to get your hands on a Dalaran Hearthstone. [5] X Research source There are 8 total quests in this questline that must be completed: The Legion Returns To Be Prepared The Battle for Broken Shore Fate of the Horde (Horde) / The Call of War (Alliance) Emissary Demons Among Us Keep Your Friends Close In the Blink of an Eye"

If you’re leveling up an alt character or you boosted one of your WoW characters, it’s possible to skip past the introductory sequence of quests. Simply complete “The Legion Returns” by reporting to either Recruiter Lee (for the Alliance) or Holgar Stormaxe (for the Horde). They’ll give you a choice to skip the quests or do them; choose to skip the questline, and you’ll automatically travel to the city of Dalaran.

Simply take the portal to Dalaran, bear witness as the city of Dalaran is teleported to the Broken Isles, and finally turn in the quest; you’ll receive the Dalaran Hearthstone as a reward!

Technically classified as a “toy,” a Dalaran Hearthstone has the power to take your character directly to Dalaran on the Broken Isles. Each hearthstone has a 20-minute cooldown period (meaning you can’t use it again for 20 minutes after teleporting with it). Beyond that, you can use a Dalaran Hearthstone as much as you want. [8] X Research source Dalaran Hearthstones were introduced in the 2016 WoW expansion, Legion (which is why, initially, completing the introductory Legion questline was the only way to get one). Dalaran Hearthstones can be an efficient way to travel. After using your hearthstone to get to Dalaran, you can take a portal to Orgrimmar or Stormwing (your character’s capital city)."
