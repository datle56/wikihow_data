      "content": "Wash your rear end with mild soap and water. A clean bum is easier to shave and prevents the spread of bacteria from…you know. So, take a hot shower and wash your behind before you get started! The heat will soften the hair and open up your pores and hair follicles, making them easier to shave and making ingrown hairs or razor bumps less likely. [2] X Research source Towel dry the area with a clean towel (not one you’ve used already) to keep bacteria away."

      "content": "Stand and rest one leg on top of the side of the tub, the toilet, or a footstool. Any position that’s comfortable for you and lets you reach where you need to is a good position to be in. Most people find it easier to shave down there when they’re vertical and propping one leg up on an elevated surface, but you can do it with both feet planted on the ground and spread apart if that’s easiest. [3] X Research source If you need a better view of what you’re doing, try standing over a hand mirror on the floor or positioning yourself so you can look at a wall mirror over your shoulder. If your hair is on the longer side, try buzzing it shorter with a trimmer before lathering up. This helps prevent clogs in your razor or trimmer when it’s time to remove it fully."

      "title": "Lather up with shaving cream or gel—all over and liberally.",
      "content": "Lather up with shaving cream or gel—all over and liberally . Grab a shaving cream or gel for sensitive skin and spread a generous layer all over the area of the buttocks you intend to shave (including the whole cheek and/or going all the way to the anus). It may be easier to lather up one cheek at a time so you have more shaving cream-free skin to grab ahold of when it’s time to put razor to skin. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use one hand to spread one cheek out and hold it taut.",
      "content": "Use one hand to spread one cheek out and hold it taut. If you’re right handed, it’s probably easiest to start by holding your left cheek out with your left hand and shaving with your dominant hand (or vice versa for lefties). Don’t be shy about spreading wide—the fewer crevices or wrinkles in your skin, the smoother the shave will be (especially as you work deeper into the crack). [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Shave slowly and carefully with short, small strokes.",
      "content": "Shave slowly and carefully with short, small strokes. For the smoothest shave, go against the gain of growth (but if you have sensitive skin, it may be best to shave with the grain). Rinse off your razor or trimmer every few strokes with cold water to reduce irritation and try not to press too hard—let the razor do the work. [6] X Research source Many find success shaving from the bottom upward, following the shape and curve of the cheek instead of working perfectly vertically (especially as you get near the tailbone, which is where most people are most likely to cut themselves). Start at the innermost part of your butt crack you plan on shaving and work your way outward. You can use a regular razor or an electric trimmer for this. Many prefer a trimmer since a sharp razor blade is more likely to cut you in a very sensitive place. Look for trimmers designed for sensitive areas , since not all designs are meant to shave such delicate skin. How much of your butt you shave is up to you! Some just want to get rid of visible hair on the cheek, while others want to go all the way to the anus. Do not pass the razor over your actual anus, which is very sensitive and easy to nick. You’ll get any hair that circles it by shaving the deepest skin of your cheek. Once one cheek is done, lather up and repeat on the other side."

      "content": "Rinse your butt thoroughly, exfoliate it, and pat it dry. Once you’re done, hop back in the shower and rinse off with cool water. Then, exfoliate your butt skin gently to prevent razor bumps or blemishes. A post-shave exfoliation untraps any hairs that may have curled back into the skin and removes any dead skin cells that didn’t get shaved or rinsed away. [7] X Research source You can use a gentle exfoliating scrub , or just wipe the area with a regular, clean washcloth. Gently pat your bum dry (try not to rub too hard to avoid irritation). Wait a few minutes to get dressed if you can to make sure you’re fully air dried (it’s more comfortable)."

      "content": "Waxing Waxing gives you cleaner initial results than shaving, and the smoothness will last longer before you need a repeat treatment. This might be a good option if you only want to be hairless for the summer, but don’t mind growing it in more for most of the year. It’s best to let a pro do this for you (it’s a sensitive area, after all). [8] X Research source If you wax, give yourself a few days of recovery before you wear tight clothing down there or do a vigorous activity or workout."

      "content": "Depilatory creams Using hair removal creams seems like an easy way to get rid of hair in hard-to-reach areas, and they can be effective. However, there’s some risk involved; you could accidentally burn the very sensitive tissue around your anus, and the chances of having an allergic reaction to the cream are higher. [9] X Research source If you go this route, test a small patch of the cream first to make sure your skin can handle it. There are some depilatories marketed specifically for your derriere or private parts. However, most general use creams advise users not to use it on or near sensitive areas."

For most people, it’s fairly painless and doesn’t have any side effects, and the hair removal is long term (you may only need treatments as often as every 2 years).

Unlike laser hair removal, electrolysis is a completely permanent procedure (and is the only FDA-approved method for permanent hair removal). You’ll need at least several sessions to fully stop hair growth.

There’s no strict medical or hygienic reasons to remove your hair down there—it all depends on your physical comfort, personal hygiene needs, and visual preference. Some might prefer to shave it all off for aesthetic or sexual reasons, while some just want to keep the area cleaner and/or less odorous. And some people prefer to leave it exactly the way it is! If you’re not sure about getting rid of your hair entirely, try buzzing it shorter with a trimmer first to see how it looks and feels. For a lot of people, just keeping the length down is enough."

A big pro for many is appearance; whether it’s for your own aesthetic or sexual preference, feeling good about how your bum looks can boost your confidence. [12] X Research source Some other pros include: Less sweat. If you’re particularly hairy, the added warmth down there can lead to some unpleasant perspiration (you’ve probably heard this called “swamp *ss” before). Reduced odor. Less sweat and less hair to hold onto it means fewer and weaker smells coming from your rear. No clinging toilet paper bits (or bits of something else…). Let’s just say that less hair means there’s less that gets left behind (pun intended) after you go number 2. Less itchiness. If your hair is coarser, it may contribute to dry or irritated skin in your nether regions."

      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons Of course, there are some potential downsides to removing a naturally occurring part of your body. Many of them are due to the physical process of shaving itself, but a lack of hair can have some uncomfortable consequences too: Razor bumps or burns. Any place you shave is at risk for irritation, including the sensitive skin on your derriere. A less-than-careful shave can lead to razor bumps, razor burn, irritation and redness, and/or cuts (ouch!) that can lead to infection, ingrown hairs, or even folliculitis. [13] X Research source Itching during regrowth. Imagine stubble growing on top and between your butt cheeks. It can be uncomfortable to say the least! It might not actually reduce sweat. Yep, it’s a double-edged sword; when your bare cheeks rub against each other, the resulting friction can make you sweat down there. This can be frustrating for folks who shave to try and reduce sweat. Ultimately, whether you sweat less or not after shaving depends on your individual body and hair growth. Upkeep. Once you start shaving or waxing, you have to keep doing it regularly to maintain your results."

      "content": "Use powder to prevent chafing, sweating, and odors. If smooth cheeks are uncomfortable, apply a lot of an anti-chafing or anti-sweat powder all over and between them to soak up moisture and reduce friction. These products come in powders, spray powders, or lotion-to-powder creams, so use whichever is easiest and most comfortable to apply. [14] X Research source Consider keeping some adult wet wipes on you when you’re traveling, too. These make for a quick clean up to counter any itching or odors that pop up."

      "content": "Wear light, moisture-wicking fabrics down there. Choose underwear that’s a little stretchy, dries fast, and feels lightweight to help reduce sweating and eliminate moisture quicker (especially if you wear tight briefs or trunks). Natural fibers like cotton or bamboo are generally breathable and comfortable. When it’s hot, try to avoid wearing thick and heavy fabrics like denim pants to keep things even cooler.

      "content": "Use an exfoliating butt scrub to keep your cheeks smooth and bump-free. If you’re prone to butt acne (or “buttne”) or find yourself getting razor bumps all the time, exfoliating your rear end can help clear up your skin and remove dead skin cells that clog razors (resulting in ingrown hairs or razor bumps). The skin on your buttocks is tougher than the skin on your face, so it can handle a slightly rougher exfoliant. [16] X Research source Apply the exfoliant at the top of your thing and work upward to make sure you don’t miss a spot. Try a manual exfoliator like a loofah or scrub, or try a chemical exfoliant with salicylic acid (especially if you struggle with buttne)."

      "content": "Butt hair may have a purpose (or several), but we’re not exactly sure what. One theory about why we all have butt hair is that there just isn’t a good enough evolutionary reason to get rid of it. Humans lost a lot of their primate-like hair over the eons as body hair became less necessary for survival; your bum may just happen to be one spot that evolution forgot since having butt hair isn’t a dis advantage to surviving. [18] X Research source Here are some other theories: Early humans and hominids may have used butt hair to amplify their anal scent in order to communicate over long distances, attract mates, or mark territory. This idea sounds revolting today, but may have contributed to our species’ survival! Hair helps prevent chafing, irritation, and/or between the butt cheeks by reducing friction, making it more comfortable to move around. This is one practical reason that people decide to keep their butt hair (or at least some of it)."
