      "content": "Cast on 4 times the number of stitches you will need for your project. When you start a project with a ruffled border, you will need to cast on 4 times the amount of stitches that your pattern calls for. For example, if your pattern tells you to cast on 30 stitches, cast on 120 stitches to start. This provides the fabric volume for the ruffles. To cast on, make a slipknot and tighten it on the right hand needle. Loop the working yarn around the left hand needle 1 time, and then insert the right hand needle into the loop. Loop the yarn over the right hand needle tip, and pull it through the loop. [1] X Research source"

Knit all of the stitches in the first row, unless your pattern instructs you to do otherwise. For example, if your pattern instructs you to work the ruffle in another special stitch, then work that stitch instead. To knit a stitch , insert the right hand needle through the loop from the front. Loop the yarn over the right hand needle and pull the yarn through the stitch on the left hand needle. Let the stitch on the left hand needle slide off. [2] X Research source You may continue working the rest of your rows in the knit stitch for a garter stitch ruffle."

To continue working your ruffle in the stockinette stitch, the second row and all even rows thereafter will need to be purled. Check your knitting pattern instructions to see if this is the recommended stitch. To purl , insert the right hand needle through the first stitch on the left hand needle from the back. Then, loop the yarn over the tip of the right hand needle and pull it through. Hold the yarn taut and then lift the old stitch slide off of the left hand needle."

Your ruffle can be as long or as short as youâ€™d like it to be, but a good length might be anywhere from 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm). Keep working the rows until your project is the desired length. Measure the ruffle with a ruler when it seems like you are getting close to the desired length, especially if you are trying to achieve a specific measurement."

To knit 2 together, insert your knitting needle in through 2 stitches at one time, and then knit the 2 stitches together just the same as you would knit 1 stitch. [3] X Research source Continue to knit 2 together all the way to the end of the row. If you are working in the garter stitch, then work another row of knit 2 together stitches after this row to complete your ruffle border."

However, if you want to add a ruffle row somewhere else on your knit project, then you will need to pick up stitches. For example, if you want to knit a ruffle row down the center of a knit item, then you will need to pick up stitches. To pick up stitches, insert your needle in through each of the stitches in a single row. Then, work the stitches to knit your ruffle row."

Then, knit the next stitch in the front and in the back. Knit into the stitch as you normally would to knit into the front, but do not let the old stitch slide off the needle. Instead, insert the needle in through the back of the stitch to knit the same 1 purlwise. Then, slip the old stitch off of the needle and allow the 2 new stitches you created to replace them. [5] X Research source After you knit front and back, knit 1 stitch again. Then, knit front and back again. Repeat this increase sequence all the way across the row. Every other odd stitch in the row will be a single knit stitch, and every even stitch will be a knit front and back stitch. You may also knit front and back into all stitches in the row if you want a fuller ruffle."

Then, knit 1 stitch and pull the new first stitch over the stitch you just knit. [6] X Research source Repeat the bind off process all the way to the end of the row.
