      "content": "Sulfates are detergents that make products suds up but they're harsh. When you shampoo and condition with sulfates, they strip the natural oils from your hair and scalp which can make your dry issue even worse. To protect your hair and help it stay hydrated, get products that say they moisturize your hair with natural ingredients. A great shampoo or conditioner might have aloe, vitamin E, argan oil, or baobab oil, for instance. [1] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. If your scalp is also itchy, flaky, and looks red or irritated, you may have dandruff which is actually caused by an overgrowth of yeast.

      "content": "Work a rinse-out conditioner through your hair right after you shampoo. Use a conditioner that says it's moisturizing or hydrating. These usually have silicones that coat your hair and prevent moisture loss. Leave the conditioner on your hair for at least 2 or 3 minutes so the product can penetrate your hair. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source If you read the product label, you might see silicones listed as dimethicone, dimethiconol, and amodimethicone.

      "content": "Protect your hair from moisture loss by locking in hydration. Massage a deep conditioner or coconut oil through your hair, starting at the ends and working toward your scalp. Let it sit on your hair for 20 to 30 minutes before you rinse it out with cool water. This seals the outside cuticles of your hair so moisture can't escape as easily. [5] X Expert Source Courtney Foster Licensed Cosmetologist Expert Interview. 9 December 2019. If you're buying a deep conditioner, look for one that's approved to use on your scalp, too. Choose a product that says it's deeply moisturizing or hydrating and that's designed for dry or brittle hair. Crunched for time? It's fine to rinse off the deep conditioner before the time's up. It won't be as effective, but you should still notice extra moisture. You can also use avocado oil, argan oil, or jojoba oil since these are all deeply moisturizing. Plus, you can use natural oils to moisturize your scalp!"

The lemon juice simply masks the eggy smell so feel free to leave it out if you don't have any. Don’t rinse the mask out with warm or hot water because the egg will start to clump in your hair. Want a little extra softness or shine? Mix in 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil, or 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of coconut oil to your egg mask."
