      "title": "Wash your hands before you pick up your hedgehog.",
      "content": "Wash your hands before you pick up your hedgehog. Use the same soap each time you wash your hands. Your hedgehog will begin to associate that scent with you and be more comfortable. Do not wear gloves when you handle your hedgehog. Your hedgehog will not be able to smell you. [1] X Research source Hedgehogs may also be frightened by the smell of gloves and begin to bite. If you do not want to use your bare hands, use a blanket instead. If you do use a blanket, use the same one each time and wash it with the same detergent."

      "title": "Pick up your hedgehog delicately.",
      "content": "Pick up your hedgehog delicately. Place your hands on both sides of your hedgehog and scoop him off the ground. Allow your hedgehog to find a comfortable position in your hands. You want him to feel supported and safe. [2] X Research source It is best to pick up your hedgehog when he is belly down. You can hold your hedgehog in your hands or place him on your lap. Your hedgehog may ball up when you pick him up. This is completely normal. [3] X Research source Do not handle your hedgehog right after you eat, touch something with a strong smell, or handle another animal. Your hedgehog will not know that it's you and may bite you or huff and ball up. Wash your hands thoroughly to get rid of the smell."

      "title": "Give your hedgehog time to unroll.",
      "content": "Give your hedgehog time to unroll. Your hedgehog may be shy and take a long time to unroll. You can let him relax under a blanket until he unrolls, or you can let him rest on your lap. Your hedgehog will learn that your lap is a safe, comfortable place to sleep and relax. [4] X Research source Always be gentle when you are holding your hedgehog. Being too rough or impatient can damage the relationship you are trying to build. Feel free to watch TV or use your computer while your hedgehog rests in your lap."

      "title": "Pet your hedgehog from head to tail.",
      "content": "Pet your hedgehog from head to tail. Always pet your hedgehog in the direction the quills lie. Petting in the opposite direction will be uncomfortable for both you and your hedgehog. When your hedgehog is relaxed, his quills will lie evenly. If your hedgehog feels threatened, the quills will become more spread out and sharp to the touch. [5] X Research source Avoid petting your hedgehog when he feels threatened. Your hedgehog may not enjoy being petted until he trusts you. Go slow with the petting at first."

      "title": "Place your t-shirt in his cage.",
      "content": "Place your t-shirt in his cage. Hedgehogs have a strong sense of smell. Your hedgehog must be able to smell you and associate your scent with safety. This will help him become more outgoing and comfortable with you handling him. Place a t-shirt that you have worn for the whole day in your hedgehog's cage. [6] X Research source Do not wash the shirt before you place it in the cage. The shirt should not have any loose threads. Your hedgehog will use your shirt as a blanket."

      "title": "Sleep with a fleece.",
      "content": "Sleep with a fleece. Sleep with a fleece that is the size of your hedgehog's sleeping area for 2 or 3 nights. Once the fleece has your smell, place it in your hedgehog's sleeping area. If your hedgehog uses a sleeping bag, you can sleep with the sleeping bag for a few nights before you allow your hedgehog to use it. [7] X Research source A baby receiving blanket can be used as well. Fleece and vellux fabrics are preferred because you do not have to worry about fraying or loose threads. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Be careful with new scents.",
      "content": "Be careful with new scents. Any time you use a new lotion, perfume, or soap, you are introducing a new smell. Your hedgehog may be confused and not recognize you. Try to be consistent with the scents that you wear. If your hedgehog likes a new scent, he may begin to anoint (i.e. froth from the mouth and spread the foam on his quills). [9] X Research source Your hedgehog may also react to a strong scent by becoming irritated."

      "title": "Talk to your hedgehog.",
      "content": "Talk to your hedgehog. Talk to your hedgehog any time you hold, feed, or bathe your hedgehog. This helps him get used to your voice and associate your voice with comfort and safety. [10] X Research source Always use a calm reassuring tone. If your hedgehog balls up or raises his quills, you may be speaking too loudly. Talk to your hedgehog when you give him a treat. This will help him associate your voice with something positive."

      "title": "Play soft music in the background.",
      "content": "Play soft music in the background. Your hedgehog will enjoy the sound of music and find it soothing. Having music in the background helps your hedgehog adjust to his new environment as well. If there is a constant stream of music, your hedgehog will not be as startled by new sounds. If your hedgehog is accustomed to silence, he will be more afraid of sudden noises. [11] X Research source If a noise is loud to you, it is probably too loud for your hedgehog as well. [12] X Research source Observe the sounds your hedgehog is making towards you as well. If he is purring, he is happy and content. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Introduce new sounds slowly.",
      "content": "Introduce new sounds slowly. Your hedgehog will become overwhelmed if you introduce too many new sounds to him at once. [14] X Research source If you are talking to him, try to talk without the TV or any music in the background. If you are watching TV, just let the television be the only sound that your hedgehog hears. If you have frequent visitors or there are multiple people in your house, your hedgehog will have to get used to their voices as well. Even sounds such as opening and closing doors can be irritating to your hedgehog."

He does not like to be still and cuddle but prefers to explore and get into things. If your hedgehog has this type of personality, you may want to bond with him during play time. Supervise the play, speak softly and reassuringly, and enjoy watching the hedgehog play. An explorer will like walking on your hands. Be sure to move one hand in front of the other as your hedgehog walks. [17] X Research source"
