      "content": "The circle-A symbol means “society seeks order through anarchy.” The circle-A symbol is one of the most recognizable symbols of anarchy and has been used in youth culture since the 1970s. Many anarchists believe that the circle is the letter “O,” standing for order or organization, and the “A” represents anarchy. [1] X Research source This comes from Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's 1840 definition of anarchism, where he says “as man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The circle-A may have come from a Spanish working-class rights group. Spain’s International Workingman’s Association (IWA or IWMA) was a group formed around the 1860s that worked to create unions and fought for working-class rights. [3] X Research source Their logo was a circle with an A in the middle that looked like a measuring tool, representing the working class. The IWA in London was created in 1864 and led by Karl Marx, who wrote essays that inspired Communist political theory. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "In the 1970s and ‘80s, the circle-A became a punk-rock symbol. The circle-A became the perfect symbol for punk frustration and rage with mainstream society in the U.S. and U.K. [5] X Research source It was spray painted onto buildings, sewn into jackets, tattooed, and included in zines, creating a feisty new movement in youth culture. The symbol also appealed to punk’s anti-establishment, anti-capitalism, and anti-conformist views. [6] X Research source This version of the symbol became more hand-made and slashed compared to the previous circle-A symbols, matching punk “break the system” attitudes of the time. In the 1980s, Crass, a political anarcho-punk (anarchism-punk) band, explained the ideology of anarchism and brought it to the center of the punk movement. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "In the U.S., the anarchy symbol is listed as a domestic terrorism symbol. In 2022, the U.S. government released a new Domestic Terrorism Symbols Guide that includes “Anarchist Violent Extremism” symbols like the circle-A, the black cat, and the red and black flag. However, using these symbols doesn't automatically mean you’re engaging in illegal activity. [8] X Research source For example, some people use these symbols to reference their original, historic meaning or for other non-violent purposes. [9] X Research source These symbols aren’t automatically hate symbols, because only anarchist extremists, a small group of anarchists, believe in and commit violent revolution.

      "title": "Anarchy is a belief that government is harmful and unnecessary.",
      "content": "Anarchy is a belief that government is harmful and unnecessary. Anarchy comes in all different forms, but most anarchists believe that the government restricts the choices of individuals when the point of society is to widen them. Anarchists push for a society where people can do whatever they’d like, except stop others from doing what they’d like. [11] X Research source Anarchy became a movement in the 1870s, however, anarchist thought has existed since the mid-1600s. Anarchy is also used to criticize larger systems like racism, sexism, ableism, anti-LGBTQ+, ageism, capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Black cat The origin of the black cat (or sabo-tabby) symbol is unclear, but most people believe it was created by Ralph Chaplin, an American organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). [13] X Research source The black hissing cat was meant to symbolize striking for better workers’ rights, but it later became a code for direct action and sabotage. [14] X Research source Today, the IWW doesn’t endorse the use of the black cat or condone sabotage by workers. [15] X Research source The Swiss anarchist Théophile Steinlen used the black cat (Le Chat Noir) in some of his most famous paintings, which inspired anarchists in other countries like France.

      "content": "Black flag The black flag is the opposite of all other colored flags, representing the absence of government. The black also symbolizes determination, strength, anger, beauty, and hope. [17] X Research source Although anarchy’s history is shared with socialism and communism, the black flag is a way for anarchists to separate these ideologies. [18] X Research source The black flag has been associated with anarchy since the 1880s when many anarchist journals and organizations adopted the name “black flag.”"

      "content": "Black and red flag Black and red have been used by anarchists since the late 1800s, and the diagonally divided black and red flag was first used by anarchists in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. [19] X Research source In Western Europe, the flag represents bringing together the red of Communism and the black of anarchism. [20] X Research source Others believe the red represents the blood that every human has while the black symbolizes the suffering of those who are starving, unemployed, or without worker’s rights. [21] X Research source In countries like Ukraine, fascist movements also used a red and black flag, but theirs was divided horizontally. This often caused confusion at protests.
