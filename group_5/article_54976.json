      "content": "If there’s no food, pigeons are less likely to roost on your property. Keep your outdoor trash cans sealed at all times and clean up any garbage, crumbs, pet food, or dropped food your family or visitors might leave on your patio or yard. Pick up fruit and berries that may fall from trees and bushes, like pyracantha bushes or olive trees, and avoid tossing seed on your lawn if the seed isn’t germinating. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Never feed pigeons. They have excellent memories when it comes to food sources and they’ll constantly return to places where they have human accomplices. Try a pigeon-proof bird feeder to feed other birds while you remove pigeons. If it doesn’t work, remove your bird feeders entirely until the pigeon problem has passed. There’s a myth that feeding pigeons rice will keep them away since the rice expands in their stomachs and kills them. This doesn’t really work, since the pigeons will just throw up the rice and carry on, unharmed."

      "content": "Reflected light interferes with the pigeons' eyesight and repels them. Locate surfaces where your pigeons like to land (rooftops, balcony railings, window ledges, etc.) and stick waterproof reflective tape to the surface. Choose any color you like if you want it to blend with your outdoor space’s aesthetics. As long as it’s reflective, it will help keep them at bay. [2] X Research source Alternatively, try hanging foil balloons or old CDs on strings from awnings, nearby trees, or garage ceiling beams to frighten the pigeons away."

Locate popular landing sites for your pigeons and tie the string from one end to another of the area.Try to place it about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the perching spot’s surface (you may need to install short poles or hooks into the surface to lift the string). [3] X Research source A single string may be enough to keep pigeons off a windowsill or narrow ledge, but will do little for large, flat areas like rooftops."

      "content": "An angled sheath provides a slippery surface pigeons can't roost on. Sheathing products like BirdSlide consist of three sheaths that form right triangles. Position the base of the sheathing on any flat, narrow roosting area like eaves, ledges, window sills. The sloped side of the triangle (opposite the right angle of the base) is angled at 40-60 degrees and makes it hard or impossible for pigeons to land.

      "content": "Mesh is a humane deterrent that looks pleasing and goes anywhere. Simply cover or drape any surface where pigeons may perch or lay their eggs, like under air conditioning units or on awning support beams, with bird netting or mesh. This will prevent them from entering the place at all. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Hold the netting in place with small hooks, staples, or loops of wire. These will hold up better against the elements than adhesives. Pigeons and other birds may peck and pull at the netting, so check on its position once in a while and reattach or replace it when needed. Keep in mind that netting will keep all birds away, not just pigeons."

      "content": "These lightweight decoys look like predators and scare off pigeons. Place a pigeon scare where the pigeons usually roost, or in a very near spot where pigeons will still see and be spooked by them. Be aware that pigeons will eventually grow used to the presence of mute raptors that “perch” in the same location. [6] X Research source For good measure, move the decoy on a regular basis. Alternatively, try placing a life-size fake snake on flat areas like balconies or rooftops. It’ll be even more effective if it moves."

      "content": "A quick spurt of water will chase a pigeon away without harming it. This method isn’t ideal for the long haul, but is effective if you need to get rid of a pigeon (or a few) right away. Spray the birds when they first arrive or try to land, rather than running for the hose once they’re settled. Make sure you’re using a hose fitting or head that allows you to spray accurately from a short distance. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pigeons are easily deterred by specific scents they don't like. If you use citronella candles to keep away mosquitos, you’re in luck—keep them lit to repel pigeons, too. Alternatively, spray a cinnamon and water mixture, diluted peppermint essential oil , or white vinegar in areas where pigeons congregate. They can’t stand the scent! [8] X Research source Try sprinkling spicy crushed red pepper flakes or ground black pepper on surfaces pigeons enjoy, too. Anything spicy will turn them right around."

      "content": "Spikes make it uncomfortable or impossible for pigeons to perch. Look for spike strips at your local hardware store or garden center and attach them to ledges according to the instructions. Usually, you’ll place the strip on the front edge of a ledge and press down to activate an adhesive that bonds it to the surface once cured. [9] X Research source Alternatively, use a Slinky toy in place of spikes. Spread the Slinky out along your handrail or ledge with the coils about 1.5 in (3.8 cm) apart. Wire or duct tape it in place every 0.75 in (1.9 cm). [10] X Research source Usually, pigeons will spot the spikes and won’t even try to land on them. If you’re worried about causing the pigeons pain if they do try to land, opt for plastic or rubber spikes with rounded tips instead of pointier metal ones."

      "content": "When a pigeon sees a laser beam, it'll think it’s a predator and fly away. Simply jiggle a small laser pointer in the direction of a pigeon to spook it away harmlessly. To repel larger numbers of pigeons, consider installing a laser bird deterrent system specifically designed to keep birds away from greater distances (or ask a pest control professional to do it). [12] X Research source If possible, aim your lasers at the bodies of pigeons and their surroundings rather than at a pigeon’s face or eyes (it’s unknown if lasers can blind birds, but it may be possible). Lasers are effective against many types of birds. However, crows are typically intelligent enough to see through the ruse."

      "content": "Ultrasonic devices broadcast a tone that bothers pigeons. Use an ultrasonic repellent to cover a large area and block pigeons humanely. Simply set the electronic device on your property and let it ring—some have sensors and only ring when birds are near, while others can be programmed or started remotely. [13] X Research source Check your local regulations about the use of ultrasonic devices. In many areas, humane devices have only been approved for use in airports since the noise can harm non-pest birds and pets, like cats and dogs. Pigeons hear mostly in the same range as humans, so there are only a few frequencies that won’t bother nearby people (young people, especially young women, may be more sensitive to the noise).

      "content": "Pigeons will see a predatory falcon or hawk and flee from its “territory.” Google “falcons for pigeon control” to find services in your area. Typically, a falcon trainer will wander the area or facility where pigeons are a problem with their bird tethered to their arm. The pigeons will see the falcon, think that it’s taken over the area, and flee to safer pastures. [15] X Research source The technical term for this practice is “falconry-based bird abatement.” It’s effective and humane, but may have to be redone now and then if pigeons start to return."

      "title": "Various gel products can repel pigeons by how they look or feel.",
      "content": "Various gel products can repel pigeons by how they look or feel. Optical gels contain natural oils that look like fire to pigeons because of the ultraviolet light reflecting off of it that pigeons can see. Contact gels typically include trace amounts of spicy capsaicin, which causes gentle irritation to the pigeons’ feet when they land and train them to not return. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Double check your gel’s ingredients to make sure it’s non-toxic before buying and applying. To apply, follow your gel’s instructions and slather a thin layer over any surface you want to keep pigeons off of. Use gels sparingly and as a last resort. There is always a chance a bird (especially small ones) may land on the gel and get stuck, meaning you’ll have to free them or they may get trapped and die. Never use gels containing polybutylene. This extra sticky gel is harmful to pigeons and other birds since it can get on their feathers and affect how they fly and protect themselves against water.

Fill any gaps between your roof shingles or in the siding of your house, and seal the edges of places where pigeons nest with hardware cloth and silicone caulk or with plastic bird netting. Close off the space above attic or garage rafters with industrial bird netting. [18] X Research source Prevent access to your attic by trimming tree branches that grow close to your roof. Seal \"bird blocks\"—the blocks between rafters where they rest on the plate of the exterior wall of the building—with a piece of 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) mesh screen that's cut to the same length and width as the bird block. Cap your chimney with mesh stainless steel caps that prevent animals from entering while still allowing smoke to escape (just make sure no pigeons are already in your chimney before you or a pro installs the cap)."

      "content": "It’s often easier to nudge a pigeon outdoors than to try and trap it. If a pigeon gets loose in the house or garage, isolate it in one room or area by closing all doors and windows. Then, find the largest opening to the outdoors—like the living room door or a large window—and open it as wide as possible. Then, wait for the pigeon to find its way out. [19] X Research source Turn off all lights or bright devices in the room and close the blinds on non-open windows. This makes the exit window or door look brighter, which will lure the pigeon closer. If it’s a big room and the pigeon can’t find the exit, hold a bedsheet in front of yourself (making sure to cover your eyes) and slowly walk toward the pigeon to pin it between the exit and the sheet. The pigeon will think the sheet is a wall that’s closing in on it."

Request they humanely trap and remove pigeons that got inside or install one-way bird doors that let pigeons exit your home but prevent them from re-entering. The pros will also clean up any droppings, feathers, or other refuse left behind with the proper cleaning equipment and protection gear that might be too expensive to obtain on your own. [20] X Research source Pest control pros might use the same repelling methods mentioned above, plus more advanced techniques like installing shock track systems or administering pigeon birth control to thin out a flock’s population over time."
