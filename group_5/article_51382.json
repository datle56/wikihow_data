      "content": "Reduce the digits of your birthday to a single digit. To find your Life Path Number, all you have to do is some simple addition. First, write your birth date out by month, date, and year (00/00/0000). Next, add up the two digits of your birth month until you get a single number, then repeat the process with the date and year. Finally, add up the three single digits—this will give you your Life Path Number. [1] X Research source For example, let’s say your birthday is April 10, 1992, or 04/10/1992: 0 + 4 = 4 1 + 0 = 1 1 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 21, and 2 + 1 = 3 4 + 1 + 3 = 8 If your final number comes out to 11, 22, or 33, don’t reduce it! These are Master Numbers and hold immense power. Try using a free online Life Path Calculator if you’d rather skip the math."
