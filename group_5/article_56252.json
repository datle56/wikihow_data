      "title": "Exit the Tops Casino and speak with one of Caesar's men.",
      "content": "Exit the Tops Casino and speak with one of Caesar's men. Once you complete the quest “Ring-a-Ding-Ding,” you will exit the Tops Casino located on the New Vegas Strip. You will be confronted by Vulpes Inculta (or Alerio, if Vuples Inculta was killed), who will bestow upon you a necklace called the Mark of Caesar, which gives you safe passage to the fort where Caesar is located. The Legionnaire will point you towards Cottonwood Cove, where you can board a boat to reach the fort."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head to Cottonwood docks.",
      "content": "Head to Cottonwood docks. Cottonwood Cove is a Legionnaire camp located at the southeast part of the map. There will be a set of docks along the river near the campsites. Locate the campsites and stone buildings, then follow alongside the waterway to the docks. Speak to Lucullus the ferryman. He will be found beside a boat at the docks. He is easy to find since he is the only Legionnaire at the docks and the boat is the only boat near him. Walk up to him and speak with him."
    },
    {
      "title": "Board the boat.",
      "content": "Board the boat. You can either speak with Lucullus to initiate the boat ride or click on the boat directly. However, if this is the first time seeing Lucullus, you will need to speak with him before you take the boat ride to the fort."
    },
    {
      "title": "Head up the hill.",
      "content": "Head up the hill. As soon as you get off the boat, follow along the dirt pathway passing by Legionnaire guards. The dirt path can be found immediately and will take you all the way up to the fort. Follow it up the stairs until you reach the top of the hill."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go through the fort to Caesar's tent.",
      "content": "Go through the fort to Caesar's tent. Enter the large gates at the top of the hill, and once inside, head straight towards Caesar's tent. His tent is straight ahead; however, you will need to go around the fighting arena to reach the tent. The dirt pathway heads various ways around the inner workings of the fort. Luckily, you can easily see his tent, as it is the largest one in the fort and is on top of a hill overseeing the fighting arena."
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak with Caesar.",
      "content": "Speak with Caesar. Once you enter Caesar's tent, he can be found straight ahead sitting on his throne. Speak with him by clicking on him. When you speak with Caesar, he will order you to enter a vault behind his tent to destroy what is within. Caesar will give you the platinum chip to open the vault door."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow Caesar's orders.",
      "content": "Follow Caesar's orders. Make your way through the underground vault, killing the enemy defense robots within. Once you clear out the vault and make your way to the bottom, you have the option to either self-destruct the dormant robot army within or activate it. Use the platinum chip to operate the console, which will give you the option to either activate the army or initiate the self-destruct sequence. Whichever you decide, you will never get to interact with the robot army. You will instead be able to see them through a window from the operations console room. Whatever choice you make, Caesar won't know the difference as he will just hear a sound from below the fort, thinking that you destroyed what was inside. If you do activate the robot army, Mr. House will be pleased with your decision. You will be serving for Caesar once you complete this task. From there on, Caesar will order you to do various quests (as part of the Legion), including killing Mr. House, gaining support from the Boomers, dealing with the White Glove Society, and destroying the Brotherhood of Steel."
