Go to their Contact page to submit an appeal. [1] X Research source Select Report a technical issue from the list of possible subjects, then choose Other from the Choose a service section.

      "content": "Explain why you think you should be unblocked. At the bottom of the contact form, you’ll be able to explain what you were doing when the problem happened, plus provide additional information about your request. Give as many details as possible so it’s easier for Bumble’s support team to evaluate your request. For example, you could say, “When I logged in this morning, I got a message saying my account has been blocked. I reviewed the community guidelines and I’m sure I haven’t violated any of them, so I think this may have been a mistake. Would it be possible to get my account reactivated? Thank you.”"

While resetting your account is a popular method for getting around a Bumble block, it’s technically not allowed under Bumble’s terms and conditions. [3] X Research source Use this method if their support team doesn’t approve your request to have your account unblocked, but keep in mind that you might be banned again if you get caught. There’s no penalty for deleting an old Bumble account and creating a new one. However, if you repeatedly delete and remake your account, you may get shadowbanned (where your profile doesn’t appear to other users). [4] X Research source"

Use a new phone number if you want to sign up with the Use mobile number option. [9] X Research source Make an account on a new device or download a VPN so your IP address appears different. [10] X Research source Delete the metadata of your original profile photos, or edit them slightly, so Bumble’s algorithm doesn’t recognize them (and ban you again).
