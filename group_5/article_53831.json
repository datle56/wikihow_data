      "content": "Recognize the symptoms of a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the arteries that feed blood to your heart get clogged, blocking off blood flow. This damages the heart and causes the chest pain associated with a heart attack. The chest pain experienced during a heart attack can be described as dull, achy, squeezing, tight, or like a heavy pressure. It focuses around the center of the chest. To make sure you're having a heart attack, look for its other symptoms: [2] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source Shortness of breath Nausea or vomiting Light-headedness or dizziness Cold sweats Pain in the left arm, jaw, and neck."

      "title": "Take aspirin if you're not allergic.",
      "content": "Take aspirin if you're not allergic. Most blockages that lead to heart attack are the result of clot-causing platelets (blood cells) that are attracted to a plaque buildup from cholesterol. Even a small amount of aspirin will suppress the presence of platelets in your blood, thinning both blood and clots. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Studies show that chewing the aspirin tablet is more effective at treating the clot, easing the chest pain, and preventing damage than swallowing it. Slowly chew on a 325 mg tablet of aspirin while waiting to receive emergency attention. Get the aspirin into your system as soon as possible."

The resulting chest pain usually feels like a sharp, stabbing pain in either the center or the left side of your chest. In some patients, though, the pain is more of a dull pressure that spreads to the jaw and/or left arm. This pain can worsen with breathing or movement. Some of the symptoms of pericarditis look a lot like those of a heart attack: [6] X Research source Shortness of breath Heart palpitations Low-grade fever Fatigue or nausea Cough Swollen legs or abdomen"

      "content": "Seek immediate medical attention. Though pericarditis is often mild and resolves on its own, it's difficult to distinguish between its symptoms and those of a heart attack. It can also develop into more severe cases that can require surgery to relieve the symptoms. You need immediate supervision and diagnostic tests to find out what's actually causing the pain. Call emergency services or ask someone to take you to the nearest emergency room. Just like with heart attacks, early treatment is the best way to prevent the condition from worsening."

      "content": "Make sure you have acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid irritates the connection between the stomach and esophagus, causing it to relax. This then causes the acid to rise from the stomach into the esophagus, resulting in a burning pain in the chest. People with acid reflux may also experience nausea or a feeling like food is stuck in the chest or throat. It sometimes leaves an acidic taste in the mouth. [13] X Research source McCONAGHY J, Oza R. Outpatient Diagnosis of Acute Chest Pain in Adults. Am Fam Physician. 2013 Feb 1;87(3):177-182. The condition is usually triggered or worsened by fatty or spicy meals, especially if you lay down after eating. Alcohol, chocolate, red wine, tomatoes, citrus fruits, peppermint, caffeinated products and coffee can cause acid build up and reflux."

Make sure that you read the insert carefully to ensure you understand how this medication will affect your overall digestion.

These two herbs may help with digestion, and can possible have a soothing effect on your stomach. [17] X Research source DGL-licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) extract can help coat the mucous lining of the esophagus and prevent the damage and pain of acid reflux. Take 250 to 500 mg capsules three times daily, chewed either one hour before or two hours after meals. If you take this for a prolonged period, visit your doctor to have him check your potassium levels. Licorice can reduce the potassium content in your body, which in turn can cause heart palpitations and arrhythmias. Buy deglycyrrhizinated capsules to prevent side effects such as swelling."

Really let your chest muscles expand and relax as you do this. While facing a corner, stretch your arms out fully and place one hand on each wall. Move your hands further apart from each other, letting your chest come closer to the wall in the process. With your feet planted on the ground, get a firm hold of the sides of an open door.
