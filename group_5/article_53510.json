      "content": "Macy’s offers price adjustments for their items within 10 days of purchase. While Macy’s doesn’t price match competitors anymore, they do match their own prices in store and online. You can request a price adjustment if you find a lower price for your exact item on Macy’s website and your original purchase wasn’t made with a promo code or discount offer. If your item qualifies, they will refund you the difference to your original form of payment. [1] X Research source what-are-macys-policies-for-online-merchandise-pricing-and-price-adjustments Macy’s only offers price adjustments for online listings on their site, not in-store listings. Items shipped and sold by third-party sellers do not qualify for price adjustments. Macy’s only accepts price requests submitted by customers, not applications or third-parties (i.e. Capital One Shopping). If you’re requesting a price adjustment for an online purchase, the 10-day price adjustment request period begins on the day you place your order—not the day you receive it."
