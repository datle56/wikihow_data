      "content": "Push your cuticles back to prevent lifting. Use a wooden cuticle stick to gently push back your cuticles . This prevents any loose skin from sticking to the gel, which is usually the main cause of lifting or peeling. [2] X Research source If you’re using a metal cuticle pusher, be extra gentle so you don’t damage your nail bed. [3] X Research source For easier removal, leave an oil-free cuticle remover on your cuticles for 2-3 minutes before pushing them back."

      "content": "Buff your nails to remove shine and excess skin. Hold a 180-grit nail file parallel to your nail, and buff the surface using circular motions. [4] X Research source The purpose of buffing is to create a rough surface for the gel polish to cling to, which can help make your manicure last longer. Since over-buffing can damage your nail bed, aim for 6-8 strokes per nail. Be sure to buff all around the edges of your nail to prevent the gel polish from lifting. Use the side of your nail buffer with the coarsest texture, which is usually colored black. Find a nail buffer at your local beauty supply store or order one online. Some are shaped like a rectangular block, while others are shaped like a popsicle stick."

      "content": "Avoid soaking your nails in water before your gel manicure. It takes about 60 seconds for the nail plate to absorb a substantial amount of water, which can cause the plate to swell and bend. Gel polish can’t adhere properly to a swollen nail plate that’s moving around, and this may result in chipping, cracking, or peeling when the plate goes back to its original shape. [10] X Research source Wash your hands for 15-20 seconds to avoid adding too much water to the nail bed. Stay away from tasks that expose your nails to water for at least an hour before gel application. This includes swimming, washing the dishes, or taking a shower."

Dip your brush in the gel polish, then wipe the excess polish on the sides of the container before brushing it on your nail. If you apply thick layers, the UV light won’t be able to cure the gel properly, which may cause lifting, wrinkling, or weird ridges on your nails.

To cap your nail, brush over the area underneath the edge of the nail after each layer. Make sure the coat is as thin as possible to avoid peeling. [16] X Research source This helps to delay chipping because the polish wraps around the nail and clings to it. If it does start to chip, it won’t be as noticeable because it will chip on the edges before coming off the tip of your nail."

If you don’t cure your nails long enough, it can cause chips and cracks, so follow the directions of your specific products to dry the gel polish after every coat. Generally, LED lamps take about 30 seconds to cure on average, while UV lamps take 130 seconds to cure. [17] X Research source Keep in mind that UV bulbs need to be changed on a regular basis. If not, the light will dim, resulting in dull gel colors and faster chipping. LED bulbs do not need to be changed. UV lamps should be at least 36 watts, while LED lamps need to be 18 watts for most gel polish brands to fully cure. [18] X Research source"
