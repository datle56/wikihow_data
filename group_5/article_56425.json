      "title": "Mercury (Hg, atomic number 80)",
      "content": "Mercury (Hg, atomic number 80) This metallic silver metal has a melting point of just −38 °F (−39 °C), so it’ll be a liquid at standard room temperature, which is around 77 °F (25 °C). [1] X Research source Mercury is naturally-occurring, and it was once used inside thermometers, dental fillings, and batteries. However, inhaling the vapors mercury produces can cause lung damage and kidney problems, so it’s toxic if you’re exposed to high levels. [2] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source After cleaning up a mercury spill, contact a doctor if you start having tremors, headaches, difficulty breathing, or muscle weakness. [3] X Research source Seafood can contain trace amounts of mercury. Stick to shrimp, scallops, tilapia, and salmon since they have lower levels of mercury.

      "title": "Bromine (Br, atomic number 35)",
      "content": "Bromine (Br, atomic number 35) Bromine melts into a deep-red, oily liquid with a bleach-like odor when it reaches 19 °F (−7 °C). [5] X Research source Bromine is usually used in flame retardants and agricultural pesticides, but exposure to the pure element or the fumes it produces is toxic. [6] X Research source Exposure to bromine could cause eye and throat irritation, and cause painful sores on your skin."

      "title": "Francium (Fr, atomic number 87)",
      "content": "Francium (Fr, atomic number 87) While francium is a solid metal at room temperature, it melts into a liquid when it reaches 81 °F (27 °C). Francium is an alkali metal, so it’s highly reactive and doesn’t exist in its pure form often on Earth. Since it’s a rarer element, scientists primarily study francium and don't use it outside of a lab setting. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Cesium (Cs, atomic number 55)",
      "content": "Cesium (Cs, atomic number 55) Cesium is a silvery white metal, and it melts into a liquid at 83.5 °F (28.6 °C). [8] X Research source Cesium has the largest atoms of any element and the highest density compared to other alkali metals. When it’s exposed to air, cesium ignites into a reddish-violet flame. [9] X Research source Pure cesium also reacts violently with water."

      "title": "Gallium (Ga, atomic number 31)",
      "content": "Gallium (Ga, atomic number 31) Gallium is a soft gray metal that melts when it reaches 86.3 °F (30.2 °C). Just holding gallium in your hand will warm it up enough to turn it into a liquid. Gallium isn’t toxic, but handling it still may cause some skin irritation. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Rubidium (Rb, atomic number 37)",
      "content": "Rubidium (Rb, atomic number 37) Rubidium is a silvery-white metallic element that melts when it reaches 102.7 °F (39.3 °C). Rubidium is normally used in lab settings since it can spontaneously ignite when it’s exposed to air or water. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "The atomic bonds have less energy and separate at lower temperatures.",
      "content": "The atomic bonds have less energy and separate at lower temperatures. Elements turn from a solid into a liquid when the atoms receive more energy and move around. If elements have strong bonds, they have a higher melting point. Since the energy in the bonds of liquid elements is really low, it doesn’t take as much heat for them to convert.

      "content": "There are 11 elements that are gaseous at room temperature. Besides hydrogen, all of the gasses are on the right side of the table, with the rightmost column being the “noble gasses,” which are completely non-reactive. The elements that are gaseous are: [13] X Research source Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1) Helium (He, atomic number 2) Nitrogen (N, atomic number 7) Oxygen (O, atomic number 8) Fluorine (F, atomic number 9) Neon (Ne, atomic number 10) Chlorine (Cl, atomic number 17) Argon (Ar, atomic number 18) Krypton (Kr, atomic number 36) Xenon (Xe, atomic number 54) Radon (Rn, atomic number 86)"
