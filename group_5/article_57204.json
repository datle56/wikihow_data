      "title": "Obtain a largish hardcover book.",
      "content": "Obtain a largish hardcover book. Used book stores, library book sales, and thrift stores are good places to find a tome that will suit this purpose. Look for something with an attractive cover in a color that suits your (or your recipient's) style. Some old books are bound with leather (or a lookalike) and embossed. Look around for textbooks, mismatched/outdated encyclopedias, Reader's Digest Condensed Books or anything that you think will be worth more for its cover than its contents."

      "title": "Cut the pages away from the cover.",
      "content": "Cut the pages away from the cover. You can use scissors or a craft knife. Open the cover and cut along the gutter (crease) line. If you like, hang onto the pages or part of them for use in a collage or other paper crafts. Text, even if it's nothing in particular, can lend character to craft projects, and things like old encyclopedias can be great sources of images and inspiration. You can also cut out text to glue onto the cover of the book- the name of the person, etc."

You should end up with a rectangular shape, with folds on two adjacent edges and four layers of material. Measure and mark the following: One spine width from the corner where the two folded edges meet, along the edge with two folds. This measurement is shown by the red line in the previous diagram. One book cover width from the corner where the folded edges meet, down either of the longest sides. This measurement is shown by the blue line in the previous diagram. A diagonal line from the end of the first measurement to the end of the second measurement. Cut the triangles from the markings you made. You should now have two triangles that measure as follows: A = twice the spine width. B = the length of the short side (width) of the book cover. C = the distance that you want your book purse to open up. Repeat the process to make two more triangles with these dimensions, making for a total of four triangles."
