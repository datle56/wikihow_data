    {
      "title": "Arrive on time to be considerate of your nail tech’s time.",
      "content": "Arrive on time to be considerate of your nail tech’s time. If you have a good nail tech, their schedule is probably booked in advance. That means they may not have a lot of wiggle room to start your appointment late if you don’t arrive on time. If you’ll only be a few minutes late, call the salon and let them know you’re on your way. Get there a few minutes early if you have questions or special requests. That way the nail tech or salon owner has plenty of time to spend with you. Have an idea of what color or design you want before you reach the salon. If you take a long time to pick out a color, that cuts into the time allotted for your scheduled service. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the salon know about cancellations as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Let the salon know about cancellations as soon as possible. When unforeseen events come up that require you to cancel your appointment, call the salon right away. Canceling on the day of the appointment makes it difficult for your nail tech to fill the hole in their schedule, directly affecting their income. Some salons have a cancellation policy that requires you to pay a fee for canceling an appointment without 24 hours' notice. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Practice good hygiene.",
      "content": "Practice good hygiene. Shower the morning before your appointment. Your nail tech will be up close and personal with you for at least 30 minutes. Taking a shower with soap and water should be enough to avoid any unpleasant body odor. If you’re getting a pedicure, don’t forget to wash your feet when you soap up. Clean under your nails even if you don’t think they’re dirty. Dirt under your fingernails can be difficult to see, especially when wearing dark nail polish. Before your appointment, take a second to remove any dirt and debris with an orange stick or nail brush."

    {
      "title": "Reschedule if you’re ill or have an infection.",
      "content": "Reschedule if you’re ill or have an infection. Don’t show up to your nail appointment if you have the flu, COVID-19, or another contagious bug. You’ll only feel worse, and you may pass on your sickness to your nail tech or anyone else in the salon. If you’re on the mend and no longer contagious, keep your appointment if you’re feeling up to it but consider wearing a mask. If you have a fungal nail infection, you may still be able to have a nail service. Tell the salon when you make the appointment to see if they can accommodate you. In rare cases, you may be asked to bring your own tools. [3] X Research source If you have diabetes or poor circulation, consult your doctor before scheduling a pedicure. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don’t bring any food to your appointment.",
      "content": "Don’t bring any food to your appointment. It’s rude to eat in front of others. Plus, it’s not sanitary. Aside from that, grease or crumbs from your food can end up in your nail polish, affecting how it looks and wears. [5] X Research source Dust from acrylic and dip nails can also end up in your food if another nail tech is filing a client’s nails nearby."

    {
      "title": "Don’t chip off your old gel polish.",
      "content": "Don’t chip off your old gel polish. Chipping off gel polish damages your nail beds. As the piece of gel polish peels off, it removes the top layers of your nail, which can make it dry and brittle. Professional nail artist Mia Rubie advises that even soaking gel polish off with acetone at home can dry out your nail bed if you aren’t careful. If you remove gel polish at home, always use hand cream and cuticle oil to help replenish moisture in the cuticles and nails."

    {
      "title": "Leave kids and pets at home.",
      "content": "Leave kids and pets at home. Most nail salons don’t have the space or personnel for child care. In addition, some products and tools, like acetone and nail drills, can harm your child or your pet. Beyond the danger, children and pets can distract the other nail techs and their clients, which can cause injuries. If you must bring a child to your appointment, bring along another adult to keep an eye on them or make sure they have a book, toy, or game they can play with quietly. Children who are not clients can pose a liability for the salon’s owner because they may not be covered under their commercial insurance policy. [6] X Research source There are also many states with laws barring animals from salons. [7] X Research source Service dogs are the exception to the rule. These highly trained working dogs are welcome with their owners."

      "title": "Don’t worry about how your legs and feet look.",
      "content": "Don’t worry about how your legs and feet look. Many people are sensitive about their feet or worry their nail tech will think their stubbly legs are gross. The good news is that nail techs often perform pedicures for clients with hair or stubble on their legs and less-than-perfect toes. They usually don’t even notice. [8] X Research source Avoid shaving your legs right before a pedicure. The razor can make small scrapes and cuts on your leg that can become infected.

    {
      "title": "Be courteous and polite.",
      "content": "Be courteous and polite. Introduce yourself to your nail tech when you arrive. Show your nail tech the same courtesy as anyone else you meet. If this is your first visit, introduce yourself. If you’re a regular client say hello and call them by name. Being polite makes the experience more enjoyable for you and your nail tech."

    {
      "title": "Tell the nail tech what service you want when you arrive.",
      "content": "Tell the nail tech what service you want when you arrive. Make sure there’s no question about what you want before the nail tech starts working on your nails. And if something doesn’t look right to you, speak up. Politely ask questions or point out that something isn’t to your liking so the nail tech can fix any issues right away. [10] X Research source The worst thing you can do is wait until your nails are done before pointing out a problem since the nail tech may not have time to redo your nails until later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Point out any minor injuries at the beginning of your appointment.",
      "content": "Point out any minor injuries at the beginning of your appointment. If you have cuts or scrapes on the body part your nail tech will work on, point it out before the service starts. In some cases, the nail tech can simply avoid the area. In others, you may need to wait until the area is healed. Any broken skin can allow bacteria to get in and cause an infection. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell the salon if there’s product on your nails.",
      "content": "Tell the salon if there’s product on your nails. Inform the salon if you have gel polish, acrylic, or polygel on your nails when you make the appointment. Removing these types of nails requires more time than traditional nail lacquer. By letting the salon know what product you have on your nails, you give them the chance to schedule enough time to complete your service without rushing. This makes for a more relaxing, satisfactory experience for you and your nail tech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid loud or disruptive phone use during your appointment.",
      "content": "Avoid loud or disruptive phone use during your appointment. Phone conversations during a nail service are rude to your nail tech and disruptive to the salon’s other patrons. [12] X Research source While the occasional short call is understandable if your nail tech has to wait for you to finish to be able to work on your nails, you’re disrespecting their time. Put your phone in silent mode to avoid disturbing others with call and text notifications."
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak up immediately if something is uncomfortable.",
      "content": "Speak up immediately if something is uncomfortable. Your nail tech doesn’t want you to have a bad experience. Tell them right away if you feel discomfort – or even pain – at any time during your nail service. Whether it’s a too-hot towel or too much pressure during a hand massage, you don’t have to suffer in silence. This is also a good time to tell your nail tech if you’re ticklish. Nail services with products that must be cured under a UV light can cause painful heat spikes in your nail bed. Let your nail tech know you’re feeling the burn. They may be able to use thinner layers that require less curing time or switch to a different type of lamp. [13] X Research source If you experience heat spikes every time you cure your nails, it may be time to take a break from gel manicures. Frequent heat spikes can lead to nails separating from the nail bed. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Don’t flex your hands or feet during the service.",
      "content": "Don’t flex your hands or feet during the service. Don’t try to anticipate where your hand or foot should be. Keep your hands or feet as still and relaxed as possible. Flexing the ends of your fingers or concentrating on holding your hand perfectly still can actually cause it to shake. [15] X Research source Don’t make your hand overly limp, either. Hold your hand as if resting it on a table during a conversation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the tech move your things to the drying station.",
      "content": "Let the tech move your things to the drying station. Don’t try to grab your coat or bag the moment your polish is done. Your nail tech usually carries your belongings to the drying station to prevent dinging or smudging your nails. Nails cured under a UV lamp are hardened as soon as the nail tech is done, so you don’t have to worry about bumping them."

    {
      "title": "Tip from 15 to 20% of the cost of your service.",
      "content": "Tip from 15 to 20% of the cost of your service. This is the general industry standard, no matter what type of service you receive. [16] X Research source Remember, tips are not included in the service price. While how much you tip is completely up to you, a gratuity is a sign of respect and appreciation for the nail tech's work. The most common tip at nail salons is usually 20%. Use a tip calculator or multiply the bill total by 0.15 for 15%, 0.20 for 20%, and so on. For example, to figure a 20% tip on a $50 bill, multiply 50 x 0.20 to get 10, making the tip $10. A 20%+ tip is appropriate for exceptional service or special requests like intricate nail art or 3-dimensional sculpting."

    {
      "title": "Leave the tip at the front desk when you pay.",
      "content": "Leave the tip at the front desk when you pay. While some like to give the tip directly to their nail tech, leaving it at the front desk is usually best. This helps you avoid distracting the tech from their next appointment. Tips can usually be added to a bill paid with credit or left as cash. Nail techs especially appreciate cash tips because they get the money immediately instead of waiting until payday. [17] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t ask for a discount.",
      "content": "Don’t ask for a discount. Nail techs often have no say in the pricing. In many nail salons, the salon owner sets the prices, so the nail tech doesn’t have the authority to give discounts. Many factors go into the pricing of nail services, including supplies, wages for the nail tech, and other business costs, like licensing and fees. [18] X Research source If you feel something is wrong with the service, politely bring it to the attention of the owner or salon manager. They may be inclined to reduce the price or offer a free service. Ask about package deals instead. Many salons offer discounts when you bundle multiple services. For example, the salon may charge less when you schedule a manicure and pedicure for the same appointment."
