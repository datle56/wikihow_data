A G'joob egg is white with blue speckles and a large blue spot, with tan-colored horns and pipe tusks similar to a G'joob. [4] X Research source Make sure to breed outside of a Rare monster availability window. If there is an event going on that allows Rare monsters to be bred, you could end up breeding a Rare Noggin, Rare T-Rox, or Rare Toe Jammer with a combination of a Pummel and T-Rox. This will decrease your chances that the Pummel and T-Rox will breed a G'joob. [5] X Research source"
