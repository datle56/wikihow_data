      "content": "Remove excess mustard and blot the stain. For fresh stains, gently scrape a dull knife or spoon across the affected area to remove as much mustard as possible, being careful not to rip the garment’s fibers. Then, dip a cloth or paper towel in water and blot the area to dilute the mustard. [1] X Research source Note: This process is only for cleaning clothing and fabrics that can be washed in a washing machine. For clothes that are dry-clean only or fabrics that otherwise cannot be washed, go to the next section. If the stain isn’t fresh, first soak the fabric in cool water mixed with color-safe bleach for up to an hour, repeating as necessary to soften the stain. Scraping the excess mustard off is important because it reduces the risk of the mustard getting on other parts of the clothing and creating new stains. Do not try to remove the mustard with a paper towel, as this will only rub the condiment deeper into the fibers and make it harder to remove."

Rinse thoroughly with cold water, and repeat as necessary until there is no discoloration. If laundry detergent isn’t available, dish soap will also work. [3] X Research source Other ways you can spot treat the stain include blotting on a bit of rubbing alcohol or non-sudsing ammonia with a cloth, applying a solvent-based laundry stain remover per the product’s instructions, or mixing oxygen bleach in tepid water and submerging the garment overnight."

      "title": "Why does mustard stain?",
      "content": "Why does mustard stain? Mustard contains turmeric, a spice that gives the condiment its bright yellow color, and in turn, causes it to stain fabrics. Mustard seeds also contain tannins, a type of dye, which can also contribute to the problem. This condiment sets quickly, as well, which makes the stains even more difficult to remove.
