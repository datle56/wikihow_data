      "content": "Make sure it can be attached to a string. This allows for easy, smooth, swinging movement. To communicate with your spirit guide, the first thing that you should do is get in the habit of listening to yourself, and that requires concentration. You can also purchase a pendulum if you prefer, but be cautious about choosing one made up of stones. It is better to choose one that is made of brass or other metals. Stones have their own energy which might interfere with clear movement. Sit at a table or have a flat surface on your lap."

      "content": "Make sure you know what the movements of the pendulum mean. Keep in mind that all information must come through your higher self. Even when trying to talk to your spirit guides, the answers will still come through you. The best way to get in the habit of getting information from your spirit guide is to practice asking them to yourself."
