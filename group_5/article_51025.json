      "content": "Some people in 16th-century Italy associated black cats with death.

      "title": "Black cats were also victims of the infamous witch trials.",
      "content": "Black cats were also victims of the infamous witch trials. Early Christians both feared witches and saw them as a threat. As Christianity began to spread across Europe and slowly replace paganism, the perception of pagan practices changed from positive to negative. Early Christians proclaimed pagan worshippers to be witches, and they especially targeted people who had animal companions, such as cats. [10] X Research source The reason that black cats are specifically targeted isn’t exactly known, but their dark color and ability to blend in with the shadows likely didn’t help their reputation. Both cats and people suspected of being witches were hunted down in the crusade against witchcraft. This negative perception of witches and black cats came to North America with Puritan settlers and resulted in the infamous Salem witch trials of the 17th century."

      "content": "Black cats were blamed for spreading the Bubonic Plague. The Bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, was a deadly disease that took many lives from ​​1346 to 1353. The disease was transmitted to humans mainly by infected fleas that traveled on rodents. However, cats could also transmit this disease to humans after coming into contact with infected prey. This likely didn’t help much in curbing the superstitions that claimed black cats were omens of death and bad luck. [11] X Research source Some researchers believe that the mass killing of cats due to their association with witchcraft actually accelerated the spread of the plague since there were fewer predators to hunt down rodents.
