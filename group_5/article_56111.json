      "content": "Check to see if you need a building permit. Many cities will require building permits for installing hot tubs, and if you need a permit, you’ll likely need to hire a contractor for the installation. Contact your local building or housing department to find out if you need a permit. [1] X Research source If you do end up needing a permit, you probably won’t be allowed to install the hot tub yourself. Still, we’ll cover all of the steps so that you can check your contractor’s work and figure out what they’re doing."

      "content": "Choose a flat location with good drainage for your tub. Make sure the spot you choose is large enough for the hot tub as well as some extra leeway for getting in and out and performing maintenance. A safe amount to allot is approximately 10 by 10 ft (3.0 by 3.0 m), but it depends on the size of your hot tub. [2] X Research source Examine your city's building code to ascertain how far away from your home you must place your hot tub. Many codes require at least 5 feet (1.5 m) of clearance between your home and your property line. The hot tub should be at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from any overhead power lines, as well as 5 feet (1.5 m) removed from the spa panel. Water and electricity do not mix."

      "content": "Install a concrete base or spa pads, if necessary. Hot tubs, when full, can weigh as much as 3,000–4,000 pounds (1,400–1,800 kg). For this reason, you will need a firm foundation on which the hot tub can rest. [3] X Research source If you don't have a concrete slab for your hot tub, you have two options: Option #1: Pour a concrete slab. Dig out a 4–6 in (10–15 cm) square or rectangle using a shovel and level the ground. Then, pour your concrete and wait for it to cure. This will provide the most supportive foundation for the hot tub. Option #2: Install a prefabricated spa pad. These pads have interlocking grids that make installation easy, and they can be removed if you ever decide to relocate your tub. This is the ideal option if you don’t want a permanent concrete slab."

      "content": "Call a GC and structural engineer to put the tub on a deck. Hot tubs are often built into (or on top of) a deck. Whether you want to build a deck around the tub or just install the hot tub on top, you need a professional. Landscape designer Matt Daly recommends contacting a reputable and licensed deck engineer and general contractor to have them take a look. You will also need to get a permit if you want to build a deck exclusively for your hot tub, so having a pro on your side is a huge help."

      "title": "Identify which route you’ll use to power the hot tub.",
      "content": "Identify which route you’ll use to power the hot tub. There are two types of hot tub electrical hookups. The first uses a typical 110v connection and just plugs into a normal outlet. If you’re using one of these hot tubs, figure out where you’ll run the cable. The second option is 220v+ hot tubs, which must be hooked up to your home’s circuit box by a licensed electrician. If your tub requires a hardline, contact your electrician to see if he needs to run the conduit ahead of time. [4] X Research source 110v and 220v+ hot tubs aren’t different power-wise, but the 220v+ tubs get hot very quickly compared to the plug-in types, which can take some time to warm up. Unless you are 100% positive that you’re never going to need to move the hot tub or you live somewhere very cold and plan on using the hot tub in the winter, you’re probably best off going with the 110v plug-in variety. They’re just less effort to set up."

      "content": "Plan your delivery route of the tub from the curb to the foundation. An unfilled hot tub can weigh upwards of 800 pounds (360 kg), so it's important to know how you will get it from the delivery van to your backyard. Make sure that the width of the tub will pass through any gates, foliage, or structures with enough leeway. If you purchase the hot tub from a hot tub installation shop (vs. a manufacturer), they’ll normally set the hot tub down wherever you ask."

      "content": "Assemble the hot tub on top of the slab or spa pad. Read the instruction manual that came with your hot tub to set it up. Since the tub itself is normally just one large piece, installing the walls and jets is normally a breeze. Just follow the instructions—everything normally fits together and snaps into place like you’re building a Lego model. [5] X Research source Expect to spend around 2-4 hours putting the actual hot tub together. Just to be clear, it’s best to build the tub precisely where you want it. Building it elsewhere then moving it is just making extra work for yourself."

If you have a 220v+ hot tub, reach out to your electrician to have them install a breaker and run the lines to your electrical control box. [6] X Research source If you have a typical outlet, just plug the tub in to confirm it powers on."

      "content": "Connect the hose to the intake valve on the tub and fill it. Read your instruction manual to confirm that you need to hook a hose up to the pump’s intake valve. If you do, remove the skimmer and run a garden hose to the intake valve inside of your hot tub. Continue filling the tub until the water reaches the level of the skimmer. [7] X Research source Some hot tubs you just fill the tub with a hose and skip the intake valve entirely. Just follow your instruction manual."

Before you hop in, run through a fresh cycle to confirm everything is working: [8] X Research source Turn off the electricity. Clean the interior of the hot tub and make sure all jets and knobs are in place. Open the air valves. Turn the electricity back on and begin heating the tub. Mix in the proper chemicals to ensure sanitation ."
