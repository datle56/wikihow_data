      "content": "Look at her body language. If you make eye contact from across the room (especially if she smiles at you), she might be interested in dancing with you. If the girl seems to be avoiding eye contact at all costs, then it's probably a good sign she isn't interested. In that case, no worries! You can look around the room for another partner.

      "title": "Approach her from the front so she sees you coming.",
      "content": "Approach her from the front so she sees you coming. Walk towards her directly so she sees that you are probably coming over to talk or ask her to dance. This gives her the chance to prepare (or walk away if she wants to). If you’re feeling nervous about approaching her, remember to stand up tall and take a deep breath. You’ve got this! [3] X Research source If she’s standing with her back to you, either move around to face her or politely say “hi” to get her attention. Never start by grabbing or touching her. Asking a girl to dance should always start with a simple, straightforward question."

      "title": "Naturally transition from dancing by yourself to dancing with her.",
      "content": "Naturally transition from dancing by yourself to dancing with her. When the music’s blaring, it can be hard to ask someone to dance without shouting. The easiest way to ask a girl to dance with you at the club is to start dancing by yourself and eventually make your way towards her to let her make a move. Show interest by making eye contact once or twice while you’re dancing near her. Approach her from the front until you’re dancing in front of her. Without physical contact, see if she’ll follow your dance moves or approach you to get closer. [5] X Research source It’s probably going to be really loud, but you can still lean in and say, “Hey! I’m [your name]. Nice to meet you.” [6] X Research source Keep what you’re saying short so it doesn’t get lost in the club noise. Try saying “Hey, how’s it going?” or giving her a compliment like “You’re the first girl I noticed here.” [7] X Research source If you’re not a great dancer, it's totally fine! Keep your dance moves fun and you can even get a little silly. The goal is to show that you’re having fun and not taking yourself too seriously. [8] X Research source Don’t make her think you’re creepy. Don’t touch, grab, or make physical contact with a girl who is dancing as a way to try and initiate a dance. [9] X Research source"

If she’s with a group of friends, it can be a little intimidating to get in there, but you can do it! Just take a deep breath, walk up with a smile, and say “hi” to everyone there to make them feel comfortable with you talking to their friend. [10] X Research source After you’ve said “hi,” or talked long enough to feel comfortable, you can ask her “Would you like to dance?” or “Do you want to go dance?” [11] X Research source"

[12] X Research source Catch her eye or mirror her dance moves to see if she’s willing to engage with you. After a few seconds of dancing, you can offer her your hands to dance together (if your school rules let you dance with a partner). [13] X Research source"

If you’re in a place where the music isn’t too loud, or at formal dance setting, a simple introduction makes it more comfortable to dance with each other (if you don't know each other already). You don't have to spark up a full conversation, although you can make small talk if that feels more comfortable, or if you want to get to know her. [17] X Research source Say something like, “My name's John, by the way, what's your name?” Follow it up with something like, “What brings you out tonight?” if you want to continue the conversation while dancing. You don't have to wait until you’re dancing to make the introduction. Just do whatever feels most natural and comfortable."

To respond to the “no,” politely say something like “You’re a great dancer, and if you’d like to dance later, I’ll be over there.” Being prepared for her to say “no” and respectfully accepting the rejection will make you seem confident and keep the door open if she changes her mind.
