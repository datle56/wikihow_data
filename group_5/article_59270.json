      "content": "Use a connectivity checker to see if the fuse is conducting. You can't get the electrodes of an ohmmeter or multimeter on the ends of the fuse, so you have to trace the wires back to some metal connection point, and touch the conductivity checker probes there. If the fuse does not conduct electricity, it must be replaced."
