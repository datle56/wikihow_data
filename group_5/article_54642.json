Go to source By talking to your co-workers after work or during break times, you can see whether they want to improve their working conditions and if they would be willing to help you create a union. You can also find out what changes your co-workers would like to see and share your ideas about how unionization can affect those changes. Place union literature in non-work areas, like parking lots or break rooms. If your job is remote, email union pamphlets from your personal account to your other co-workers."

One of the biggest drawbacks is that unions charge dues which are typically used to pay the salaries of union workers in case of a strike. Typically, these dues are 1 to 2% (roughly 2 hours) of your monthly wage. [18] X Research source Some unjust unions spend these dues on six-figure salaries for union leaders or luxurious offices. [19] X Research source Slower advancement: Many unions have rules that favor workers based on seniority. This means that newer employees may be more likely to be passed over for promotion. [20] X Research source Employers also may not be able to reward exceptional employee performance because of labor contracts. Less autonomy: Union workers are bound to obey any decisions made by the union. Workplace tensions: Unions can create tension between workers and employers, potentially causing workers to have lower levels of trust and satisfaction in the workplace. Unpaid strikes for nurses: Unlike other careers, nurses who belong to a union aren’t paid during a workers’ strike. [21] X Research source"
