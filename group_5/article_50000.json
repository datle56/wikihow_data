      "content": "Hyphenate “how-to” when talking about a set of instructions. How-to can be used either as a noun (a person/place/thing/idea) or an adjective (a word used to modify/describe a noun). In both cases, “how-to” with a hyphen refers to a set of instructions or a step-by-step tutorial about completing a task. [1] X Research source When used as an adjective, “how-to” is often paired with words like “book,” “guide,” “article,” or “video.” Example of how-to as a noun: “wikiHow has a great how-to for cleaning a laptop.” Example of how-to as an adjective: “wikiHow’s website has tons of how-to articles for just about every topic.” “How-to” is mostly used as a noun in American English—it’s not as common in British English."

      "content": "Keep “how to” unhyphenated when using “how” as a conjunction. The word “how” serves many purposes in the English language. However, when paired with the word to , “how” is a conjunction (a clause- or sentence-connecting word) that means “the manner or way in which” something happens (according to the Random House Unabridged Dictionary). [2] X Research source Let’s take a closer look: “Caleb doesn’t know how to make macaroni and cheese .” In this example, “how” refers to Caleb’s lack of ability to prepare a bowl of mac and cheese. “Angela knows how to play baseball .” In this example, “how” refers to Angela’s ability to play baseball."

      "title": "\"How-tos\" is the correct way to pluralize \"how to\".",
      "content": "\"How-tos\" is the correct way to pluralize \"how to\". According to the basic rules of English grammar, apostrophes are only used to show possession or to form contractions. [3] X Research source In very rare cases, apostrophes can be used to pluralize all lowercase letters (“Be sure to dot your i’s before signing that contract”), the capital letters A, I, M, and U (“She got all A’s this semester”), words that stand for themselves (“There are no but’s about it”), or abbreviations ending in periods (“A lot of Ph.D.’s work at this school”). [4] X Research source The word “how-to” doesn’t fall under these rules, so it can be pluralized as “how-tos.” Example: “wikiHow has a lot of how-tos that you can scroll through.” No matter how you spell it, “how-tos” doesn’t really roll off the tongue. You’re better off using “how-to” as an adjective and pluralizing the word that it’s describing (like “how-to videos” or “how-to articles”)."
