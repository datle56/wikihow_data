      "title": "Appreciation for the character",
      "content": "Appreciation for the character The Joker’s been around for over 80 years, and has had many incarnations. [1] X Research source He’s been played by everyone from Mark Hamill to Heath Ledger to Jared Leto, and has appeared in comics, cartoons, and live action films. There’s a lot of material, and a lot of Joker to love. Someone with a Joker tattoo might simply be showing their appreciation for the character. People tend to be drawn to the Joker’s fun but dangerous personality, his colorful designs, and the mayhem that follows him. He’s something of a pop culture icon that way. The Joker’s also been referenced by other pop culture icons, from musicians like Eminem or Lady Gaga to video games like Mortal Kombat or popular Batman games."

      "title": "Revolution or rebellion",
      "content": "Revolution or rebellion The 2019 movie Joker , starring Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, is a tale of a “little guy” inspiring uprisings that threaten to turn social order on its head. This revolutionary tale has resonated with many, and some people with a Joker tattoo may be signaling their appreciation for the character as a rebellious leader. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Anarchy or chaos",
      "content": "Anarchy or chaos The Joker might be best known for his love of a little mayhem. Most of his schemes revolve around sowing discord just for the sake of discord. That wild spirit speaks to a lot of fans, who may get a Joker tattoo as a way to channel some of that unbridled chaos."
    },
    {
      "title": "Nonconformity",
      "content": "Nonconformity The Joker’s always been an outcast, and that’s especially true of his 2019 film appearance, where he’s portrayed as a troubled man who’s cut off from his support systems. [3] X Research source His status as an overlooked or outcasted member of society strike a chord in many, who sympathize with the idea of an antihero sticking to his own agenda."
    },
    {
      "title": "Good and evil",
      "content": "Good and evil The Joker often straddles a line between black and white. Sure, he causes plenty of trouble, but he doesn’t usually do it for the sake of evil—rather, he does it to have fun. Sometimes he even teams up with Batman to save the day. [4] X Research source This refusal to stick to one side is endlessly compelling, and has won the character plenty of admirers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mischief",
      "content": "Mischief At the end of the day, the Joker’s M.O. is hijinks at any cost. He’s something of a prankster who takes all his gags to the extreme. Someone with a Joker tattoo might just want to bring a little wild whimsy to their everyday life, or remind themselves to have a little fun, even if it means getting into trouble now and then."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Damaged”",
      "content": "“Damaged” This is maybe Leto’s most noticeable tattoo in the movie, as it sits right on his forehead. It’s a stark reminder that the Joker isn’t exactly an upstanding citizen, but its placement on his noggin might suggest that his mind’s not quite intact, either."
    },
    {
      "title": "“HAHAHAHA”",
      "content": "“HAHAHAHA” The Joker’s laugh is about as iconic as his demented smile. Here, though, the “HAHAHA” tattoos may be a nod to Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s The Killing Joke series, as they seem to resemble a particular panel. [5] X Research source The Killing Joke is a much darker take on the Joker, so Leto might be borrowing some of his forerunner’s edge here."
    },
    {
      "title": "“J”",
      "content": "“J” Some fans speculated that the “J” tattoo on Leto’s Joker’s face was a hint that he’s actually Jason Todd, aka Robin—a callback to the Arkham Knight game, where he has a scarred “J” on his cheek. [6] X Research source The movie dispelled this theory, and it probably just stands for “Joker,” but it’s fun to think about."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smiles",
      "content": "Smiles What’s the Joker without his signature red smile? Leto’s Joker sports a few different smiley tattoos—a mouth across his abdomen, an open-mouth smile on his hand. These may be variations on his iconic facial feature, or even nods to the much darker series The Killing Joke —the smile on his hand seems to resemble that iteration of his character. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Jester skull",
      "content": "Jester skull At his heart, the Joker is an off-the-rails jester, playing tricks on the populace of Gotham for his own amusement. The skull jester on his chest is a perfect encapsulation of that, imbuing the classic jester image with some macabre edge and danger."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dead Robin & Bat",
      "content": "Dead Robin & Bat Leto’s arms feature a robin pierced by an arrow, and a dagger through a bat. These are clear reminders of Mister J’s unending mission to “kill the Batman,” as well as Batman’s iconic sidekick, Robin. [8] X Research source A bit sadistic to get that sort of thing tattooed, if you ask us."
    },
    {
      "title": "“All-In” cards",
      "content": "“All-In” cards A hand of cards might point to the Joker’s high-stakes attitude and his tendency to gamble with his—and other people’s—lives. The ace is a common symbol of luck, and the “All-In” on the banner in front suggests the Joker’s all-or-nothing approach to his wild schemes. [9] X Research source The gambling motif extends to the card suit symbols on his knuckles."
    },
    {
      "title": "“God’s Only Child”",
      "content": "“God’s Only Child” This tattoo rests on Leto’s back, and is an audacious statement of the Joker’s self-importance or inflated ego. It could also be an irreverent jab at organized religion. If there’s one thing the Joker hates, it’s “organized” anything."
    },
    {
      "title": "Humor",
      "content": "Humor A jester’s primary job is to entertain and get a laugh from his audience, whether that’s a crowd of commoners or the king himself. [10] X Research source A jester tattoo may be a constant reminder to have a little humor as someone goes about their daily life, and to not take things too seriously, or to crack a joke every now and then to keep things light."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mischief or mystery",
      "content": "Mischief or mystery Jesters don’t just rely on jokes. They might also get up to hijinks and pranks in order to liven the mood, and wear masks to become different characters to add to their performance. A jester tattoo might represent getting up to a little trouble, or add an air of masked mystery about its owner."
    },
    {
      "title": "Masked emotions",
      "content": "Masked emotions A jester’s mask doesn’t just lend him a funny face. It also helps to enhance the emotions he portrays in his performance, and hides his actual face underneath. A masked jester tattoo might symbolize its wearer’s concealed emotions or private life, suggesting they show a different face to the world than their actual one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Intelligence",
      "content": "Intelligence Being a jester isn’t exactly easy. Jesters must crack jokes and mock their audience, namely royals, without actually causing real offense, lest they find their heads on the chopping block. [11] X Research source It takes plenty of smarts to dance that line, and so a jester tattoo may signal that its owner admires that wit and sharpness."
    },
    {
      "title": "Balance",
      "content": "Balance As with any humor, there’s a touch of darkness to a jester’s position. They’re often made up as fools, or seen as lesser, even as they rub elbows with higher-ups. That dichotomy lends jesters a certain balance of light and dark, levity and seriousness, comedy and tragedy, and make jesters a reminder that there are 2 sides to every coin."

      "content": "Get a tattoo of your favorite version of the Joker character. The Joker’s been causing problems for 80+ years, and there are so many versions of him to love. Choose your favorite version to get tattooed, whether that’s his original comic appearance, an animated incarnation, or a live-action portrayal like Heath Ledger’s. Think about which one speaks to you, then go for it!"

      "title": "Choose an iconic element of the joker to get tattooed.",
      "content": "Choose an iconic element of the joker to get tattooed. You don’t have to get a full portrait. Consider picking just one part of the Joker’s getup, like his Cheshire smile, green hair, or his instantly recognizable purple suit. This gives your tattoo a slightly subtler touch, and might be easier on your wallet, to boot."

    {
      "title": "Get an iconic Joker quote tattooed.",
      "content": "Get an iconic Joker quote tattooed. For a different approach, skip the character and go right to one of his iconic lines. Get “Why so serious?” in a scratchy font, or, \"A joke a day keeps the gloom away!\" Or, go a little more philosophic and get lettering that says, \"I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy,” or, \"What doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger!\""

    {
      "title": "Consider the tattooing style before you get your tattoo.",
      "content": "Consider the tattooing style before you get your tattoo. When choosing a tattoo design , the style can alter its appearance and vibe dramatically. For example, an American Traditional Joker, with the style’s bold lines and vivid colors, can add some classic flair to the classic villain. [12] X Research source On the other hand, a realistic Joker might be best if you want to capture the likeness of a live-action actor. An all-black, or blackwork tattoo, offers a clean and sometimes edgier look. Emulate the comic or cartoon styles to capture an iconic scene."
