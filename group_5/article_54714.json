      "content": "The model number will be on a rectangular sticker on or in the appliance. The model number will always begin and end with a letter. Newer appliances may have a QR code sticker that you can scan with your phone camera, which will take you directly to a page with information about your specific appliance. [1] X Research source Use the following table to find the potential model number sticker locations for your appliance type. If your specific appliance type isn't listed, look for the model number sticker on the back, bottom, or inside of the appliance, as these are the most common sticker locations across all of GE's products.

      "content": "GE model numbers are actually a string of product info codes. The model number is 7 to 11 characters long, and a model number can contain anywhere from 4 to 9 1- to 2-character codes that give information about the product. This combination of codes and their meanings is called \"nomenclature.\" For example, a GE range model number has 10 characters, which form 8 codes. These codes denote the range's brand, fuel type, configuration, oven type, feature pack, model/door color, model year, and product color. Many appliances have similar codes, but they may differ slightly between different products. For example, the GE brand code for a range is J, but for a washer, it's G. To learn what the codes mean for your appliance, look for it in GE's digital 2024 nomenclature guide by clicking here ."

      "title": "Appliance age is coded into the serial number, not the model number.",
      "content": "Appliance age is coded into the serial number, not the model number. Thankfully, the serial number of your appliance is located on the same sticker as the model number. The first two characters of the serial number will be two letters. The first letter correlates to the month the appliance was made, and the second correlates to the year. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Each letter correlates to a handful of different years. To determine which year your appliance was made exactly, check the front or back page of the appliance manual for a date (which is printed in MM-YY or MM/YY format). The date will be printed next to the publication number. This date can help you narrow down what year your appliance was made. The model number does have a \"Model Year\" code included, but it's not clear if these codes are the same as the codes used in the serial number. For the most reliable method to discern your appliance's age, use the serial number method. Use the table below to decipher your appliance's age using the serial number. Letter Month Years A January 2013, 2001, 1989, 1977 B -- 1945 C -- 1946 D February 2014, 2002, 1990, 1978 E -- 1969, 1948 F March 2015, 2003, 1991, 1979 G April 2016, 2004, 1992, 1980 H May 2017, 2005, 1993, 1981 J -- 1952 K -- 1953 L June 2018, 2006, 1994, 1982, 1970 M July 2019, 2007, 1995, 1983, 1971 N -- 1972, 1956 P -- 1973, 1957 R August 2020, 2008, 1996, 1984, 1972 S September 2021, 2009, 1997, 1985, 1973 T October 2022, 2010, 1998, 1986, 1974 V November 2023, 2011, 1999, 1987, 1975 Z December 2024, 2012, 2000, 1988, 1976 AY -- 1965 BZ -- 1966 CA -- 1967 DB -- 1968 VU -- 1961 WV -- 1962 XW -- 1963 YX -- 1964"
