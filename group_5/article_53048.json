      "title": "You may not have used enough lube.",
      "content": "You may not have used enough lube. Sex involves a lot of friction, which can take its toll once you and your partner are both finished. If you didn’t use lube before getting intimate, the friction might have created a few small tears in that area."

      "title": "Your partner touched your cervix while you were intimate.",
      "content": "Your partner touched your cervix while you were intimate. If your significant other is pretty well-endowed down there or is using a really big toy, they might have touched your cervix while you were both getting intimate. According to experts, this can feel similar to having cramps, and it might be causing your soreness the morning after."

      "title": "The sex was pretty hardcore.",
      "content": "The sex was pretty hardcore. Rough sex is big turn-on for some couples, but it can lead to some issues after-the-fact. Really rough sex tends to create a lot of friction, which can lead to some soreness in the days after."

      "title": "You might have a latex allergy.",
      "content": "You might have a latex allergy. Many condoms are made with latex. If you’re feeling sore after the fact, a latex allergy could be making that area feeling pretty sore and inflamed. If you think you’re allergic to latex, use polyurethane condoms instead of traditional latex ones. However, these condoms are a bit more fragile, and are more likely to break or slip off.

      "title": "You have an infection or other underlying condition.",
      "content": "You have an infection or other underlying condition. Yeast infections, STIs, bacterial vaginosis, and other infections might be leaving you uncomfortable and sore. With an infection, you’ll probably notice other physical symptoms, like discharge, a burning sensation, and general discomfort. [2] X Research source Other conditions, like endometriosis, may be causing a little extra pain after you have sex. [3] X Research source If you’re having trouble figuring out the cause of your pain, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist. They can help you pinpoint what’s going on. Endometriosis is when the lining on your uterus grows along the outside of your uterus, like your ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have really painful or heavy periods, you might have endometriosis. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Use a heating pad or take a warm bath. A little bit of heat can help soothe away the pain. Relax and unwind in a warm bath, or rest a heating pad over the sore area for a few minutes to give yourself some relief. [5] X Research source Only use a heating pad for 15-20 minutes at a time. Set it to low or medium heat, which will soothe pain away. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Ice the sore area if the pain is really bad.",
      "content": "Ice the sore area if the pain is really bad. If your entrance to your vagina, or vulva, is looking pretty swollen, place a couple of ice cubes in a clean rag or baggie. Slip on a comfortable pair of underwear, and place the ice pack along the outside of your vulva, using the cloth as a buffer. Keep the ice in place for 10-15 minutes and see if you notice any improvements. Don’t put any ice inside of your vagina—this will just make the soreness worse."

      "content": "Visit your gynecologist and see if you have an infection. Don’t assume you have an infection—instead, tell a gynecologist how you’re feeling and see what they have to say. If an infection is the main cause of your soreness, prescription medicine might be the best way to treat it. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "It depends on what’s causing it.",
      "content": "It depends on what’s causing it. Unfortunately, there’s no hard and fast rule to how long your soreness will stick around. If you have a few small tears, they should heal up within a few days. If you have a larger, bleeding tear, it might take weeks for the area to heal. [8] X Research source In general, give yourself a few days to heal up and recover—if you’re still feeling sore, meet with your gynecologist. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Dedicate extra time to foreplay and getting lubed up.",
      "content": "Dedicate extra time to foreplay and getting lubed up. Your body will produce its own natural lube when you feel aroused. Don’t feel like you need to rush—take as much time as you need with your partner beforehand. If you’re still feeling a little dry, use a little extra lube before getting intimate. When you feel aroused, your vagina becomes a bit wider, which can help if your partner is pretty well-endowed."

      "title": "Go a little slower at first.",
      "content": "Go a little slower at first. There’s no need to rush! Even if you and your partner enjoy rough sex, start off at a slower pace before picking up speed. Give yourself a little bit of time to adjust, so you won’t feel quite as sore after being intimate."

      "title": "Switch things up with your partner.",
      "content": "Switch things up with your partner. Talk with your partner about trying some new things in the bedroom. A new position might help reduce some of the pain. For instance, if you’re usually on the bottom, ask your partner if you can try being on top next time around—this might give a little more control, and help you find a rhythm that works well for you."

      "content": "Let your partner know if something isn’t working. Be honest if you’re feeling some pain during your intimate moments. If things are going too fast, let your partner know! Slower sex might help cut back on some of the pain. Alternatively, you can talk to your partner about oral sex. [12] X Research source Be clear about what you want to be different and why. [13] X Research source For example, do you want more frequency of oral sex or use some different moves. [14] X Research source"
