      "content": "Remove excess hair dye. If you act immediately after the stain forms, you will have a much better chance of easily removing it. Begin by using a clean cloth to blot at the hair dye stain. Use gentle up and down tapping motions, and avoid rubbing or spreading the hair dye around, as this can stain an even larger area of your linoleum floor."

      "content": "Blot until hair dye stops lifting. Once you have absorbed most of the excess hair dye that is sitting on top of the stain, wet another clean cloth and continue blotting at the hair dye stain. Keep blotting until no more stain is being lifted."

      "content": "Scrub the stain with a magic eraser. Dip a Mr. Clean magic eraser into the soapy water, then begin to scrub at the stain. The soapy water will keep the stain damp so that it set slower, and the magic eraser works as an extremely fine sandpapering tool that is highly effective at dislodging the dye stain.

      "content": "Spot test rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol runs the risk of staining your linoleum surface, so before applying rubbing alcohol on the stain, it's important to test it first on your linoleum. Add rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball, then dab the cotton ball on an inconspicuous area of your linoleum surface, such as in a corner. [3] X Research source Wait about 10 minutes, then check on the area. If the linoleum has lightened considerably or has turned a different color, do not use the rubbing alcohol on the stain."

      "content": "Dab the stain with rubbing alcohol. Apply rubbing alcohol liberally to a clean cloth, then dab at the stain with the cloth so that the rubbing alcohol transfers to the stain."

      "title": "Let the rubbing alcohol sit for several minutes.",
      "content": "Let the rubbing alcohol sit for several minutes. After dabbing the stain and coating it in rubbing alcohol, let the stain sit for several minutes to allow the rubbing alcohol to sink in and start dislodging the dye stain."

      "content": "Spot test acetone. Apply a small amount of nail polish remover, also called acetone, to a cotton ball and dab at an inconspicuous spot on your linoleum surface. Wait several minutes and check the spot. If the acetone hasn't damaged the surface or changed the color of the linoleum, it is safe to use. [4] X Research source Acetone is slightly more abrasive than rubbing alcohol, so try to use it only if the rubbing alcohol did not work."

      "content": "Rub at the stain with acetone. Apply acetone to a cotton ball, making sure it's fully saturated, then rub the cotton ball in circular motions over the stained portion of the linoleum. Rub the stained area until the stain stops lifting or comes out completely. [5] X Research source If dye starts coming out, discard the cotton ball, saturate another cotton ball with acetone, and use it so that you don't rub the dye back into the linoleum."

      "content": "Wipe the area with water. Once the stain has been removed or isn't lifting anymore, dampen a clean cotton ball in water and rub over the area you were cleaning to wipe away any acetone residue. Since acetone is a somewhat caustic substance, it's not a good idea to leave any excess or residue on the linoleum."

If the linoleum looks unchanged, go ahead and use the hairspray to tackle the hair dye stain. [6] X Research source Make sure to use alcohol-based hairspray, as the alcohol is the agent that will work to lift the stain. Alcohol is typically an ingredient in cheaper brands of hairspray."

      "content": "Spot test the bleach. Pour a small amount of chlorine bleach onto a clean rag and dab it into the linoleum in an inconspicuous area. Bleach has a lightening effect if not used on an already light surface, so if the linoleum looks discolored or markedly lighter, do not use bleach to clean the stain. [9] X Research source Bleach should only be used as a last resort. Some advise never to use bleach on linoleum, while others report success in removing hair dye stains. This is why spot testing bleach is essential; if it discolors the surface of the linoleum, it should not be used since it can cause even more damage. Wear gloves when using bleach."
