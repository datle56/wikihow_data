      "content": "From shampoo to styling gel, make sure the label mentions color. There are color-safe variations of basically every product out there, so if your goal is to preserve color, stick with brands and items designed specifically to protect color-treated hair. If you aren’t sure which products are ideal for your hair texture and color, ask your stylist for recommendations! [1] X Research source This is especially important when it comes to your shampoo and conditioner, since those are the two items you’re probably using the most often."

      "content": "In the vast majority of cases, this will be enough to remove any buildup. Purchase a clarifying shampoo designed for color-treated hair. [2] X Expert Source Bianca Cox Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 May 2019. Wash your hair according to the instructions on the label. [3] X Research source Once you’ve rinsed the clarifying shampoo out, condition your hair the same way you normally would. [4] X Research source This is hands down the best way to deal with buildup, regardless of what’s causing it. Regular clarifying shampoo can strip color though, so make sure you use a color-safe version! So long as the impact on the color is minimal, you should be able to do this once a week. Avoid using clarifying shampoo more than that, though. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "This is a riskier alternative to clarifying shampoo, but it may work. Some people have success with apple cider vinegar, while others find that it strips color in some cases. If you don’t want to use clarifying shampoo, apple cider vinegar will remove buildup. [6] X Research source Hop in the shower, shampoo the same way you normally would, and then mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of apple cider vinegar with 5 tablespoons (74 mL) of water. Massage the mixture into your hair and leave it for 5 minutes before rinsing and conditioning. [7] X Research source Apple cider vinegar has the potential to irritate skin. If you feel a burning sensation on your scalp or you have any kind of reaction to the vinegar, rinse it out immediately."

      "content": "Tap water contains minerals that can lead to buildup, so rinse them out. Every time you wash your hair with tap water, the minerals from the tap get left behind in your hair (chlorine and magnesium are the big culprits here). To rinse those minerals out after showers and washes, bend over a sink and pour club soda through your hair. This will wash out any buildup before it has time to settle in your hair. [8] X Research source You may be able to use distilled water instead of club soda if you prefer. [9] X Research source Rinsing tap water out of your hair is especially important if your buildup is partially caused by hard water (tap water with a high mineral content). [10] X Research source If you notice crusty, white deposits around your sinks and drains, you probably have hard water where you live. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Baking soda will get buildup out, but it may strip some of that color. Baking soda is a strong cleanser, which makes it great if you’re struggling to remove buildup. Due to its strength, this may strip some of your hair’s color though, so beware. Use 1-part baking soda and 2-parts water to create a thick liquid. Work the watered-down baking soda into your hair, leave it in for a 10-20 minutes, and then rinse it out. [12] X Research source You can also add pure baking soda to your hair when it’s dry and comb it out. This may be your best bet if the buildup is caused by oil."

      "content": "Micellar water-based buildup products work wonders, but they remove color. In the event that you either used too much dye or you are actively trying to soften the shade of your hair’s color, grab a buildup breaking product that contains micellar water. Micellar water is super good when it comes to culling buildup, but it will definitely strip a shade or two out of your hair’s color. Follow the instructions on the product’s label to clean your hair. [13] X Research source Micellar water is a popular ingredient in the popular French-girl skincare routine, so make sure that the product you buy is designed for hair and not skin. Micellar water is basically super cleanser. It works by attracting and suffocating dirt and oil, which makes it perfect for removing product buildup in your hair. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "All of that product and oil in your hair ends up in your brush. Keep the bristles clean to avoid reintroducing all the buildup you remove back into your hair. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the easiest way to clean your brush is to use a little warm water and shampoo to get the brush wet, and then use a toothbrush to scrub in between the bristles. Rinse the brush off and let it air dry when you’re done. [18] X Research source If you have naturally oily hair, the buildup in your hair may be sebum—an oil your body naturally produces. Brushing regularly and keeping a clean hairbrush is one of the best ways to solve this particular type of buildup. [19] X Research source Doing this at least once a month should help keep your hair brush clean. A brush that has a mix of boar bristles and nylon fibers is going to be your best bet if you want to protect your hair color since those materials are the best at spreading natural oils out evenly along each hair’s shaft.

      "title": "Heat will strip color, but you have to wash to remove buildup.",
      "content": "Heat will strip color, but you have to wash to remove buildup. This is definitely one of those “round peg with a square hole” situations. However, you can circumvent this obstacle just by changing the temperature of the water. By using the coldest temp you can stand, you won’t accidentally strip the color when you’re removing buildup from your hair. [21] X Research source Generally speaking, heat of any kind is not going to be great for your hair—especially if it’s dyed or color-treated. Cut back on the flatiron/curling iron usage, and always set your hair dryer to the lowest heat setting available. You can use heat protectant on your hair to keep the heat from damaging that, but the more products you put in your hair, the more buildup you’ll run into."

      "content": "If you’re washing to remove buildup regularly, the dye may fade. The solution here is simple. Add 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of your hair dye to your sulfate-free conditioner. If you got a professional color treatment, ask your stylist or colorist to do this for you. Every time you wash your hair with shampoo, follow it up with your tinted conditioner to refresh the color while you care for your hair. [22] X Research source You stylist may even recommend a pre-tinted conditioner for you. If you buy one of these conditioners, don’t add any extra dye to it."

If you accidentally strip some of the color, a stylist or colorist will be able to fix it. If you can’t get the buildup out, your stylist will be able to identify the problem and fix it for you.
