      "content": "Check to see if it's a browser issue. Possibly your current browser is playing up. If you can, either switch to a different browser or hop on another computer. See if you can open the spreadsheet from the new browser or computer. If you can, it is likely a browser issue on your usual computer. To fix: Turn the browser off. Shut down all open tabs. Wait a few seconds (always a good idea to let things settle). Open your browser again. Open the Google Drive. Click on the spreadsheet you want to open. If it was a browser issue, then the spreadsheet should now open, no problems."

      "title": "Wait.",
      "content": "Wait. If the above steps haven't worked, consider waiting a half hour or so before trying again. Possibly something is held up Google's end, possibly there is just too much traffic or something isn't right out there. Come back and try again later and hopefully it will remedy. Stay calm by turning this wait into a coffee break and an excuse to clean up that messy stack of papers or bills."
