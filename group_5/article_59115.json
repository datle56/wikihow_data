      "content": "Dry erase marker Find a dry-erase marker of any color and draw over the permanent marker stain. Dry-erase markers contain solvents that help dissolve permanent marker. Once the stain is completely covered, wipe the area with a soft cloth. The stain should begin to come off. [1] X Research source This method works exceptionally well on dry-erase boards and is safe to use on smooth plastic surfaces . It may not be as effective on textured surfaces, however. If you cannot wipe the dry-erase marker off, spray the area with a glass cleaner, then wipe it off with a paper towel. Don’t give up if the dry-erase marker doesn’t remove the permanent marker immediately. Cleaning specialist Ahmed Mezil says the stain may not come off right away: “You definitely need to do a couple of rounds to get the whole [stain] off because it does take two to four tries.” [2] X Expert Source Ahmed Mezil Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 13 April 2021."

      "title": "Alcohol, hand sanitizer, or acetone",
      "content": "Alcohol, hand sanitizer, or acetone Rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and acetone all help dissolve chemicals in permanent marker. For small stains or curved surfaces, soak a cotton ball in the alcohol, then wipe the surface until the stain comes off. For flat surfaces or larger stains, pour the alcohol directly onto the stain, then wipe it away with a paper towel. Repeat the process as needed until the stain has been completely removed. [3] X Research source Rubbing alcohol is the safest of these 3 methods, but you may need to use it a few times to get the stain off. The higher the alcohol percentage, the more effective it will be. If possible, try to get something that is 90% or higher. Hand sanitizer works great on curved surfaces because it doesn't drip as much. Acetone is the strongest option. However, it can remove paint and melt certain surfaces, so it is not recommended for painted surfaces and softer plastics. Before using acetone, test an inconspicuous area first. If the plastic appears distorted or loses its color, use rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer instead. The longer the permanent marker has been on the plastic, the tougher it will be to remove. Old stains may soak into the plastic and leave a “ghost” of the stain after you clean it."

Soak a cotton ball, cotton pad, or a corner of a microfiber cloth in hydrogen peroxide, then gently rub the permanent marker stain. For larger stains, pour the hydrogen peroxide directly over it, then wipe off with a paper towel. [4] X Research source Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful stain remover that can strip color, so it may not be the best option for painted surfaces. Test it in an inconspicuous area first. Be careful not to get any hydrogen peroxide on your clothes, carpet, or other fabrics."

      "content": "Magic eraser Purchase a plain magic eraser without any additives, such as bleach. Cut the sponge into smaller pieces to make it easier to work with, then dip it in water. Rub the permanent marker stain with the magic eraser using circular movements, being careful not to press too hard. It may take anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes before you start seeing results. Keep scrubbing until the stain has been removed. [5] X Research source If the stain is particularly tough, consider dipping the sponge in rubbing alcohol instead."

      "content": "Baking soda and toothpaste With a fork or spoon, mix equal parts baking soda and white toothpaste together in a bowl until it forms a thick paste. Spread the paste evenly over the permanent marker stain, then use a toothbrush to scrub the stain away. After a few minutes, rinse the area with clean water. The toothpaste and baking soda should’ve removed most of the permanent marker, but if any residue remains, apply some alcohol to finish the job. [6] X Research source Use toothpaste that's white (or a pale mint color) and not the gel kind; white toothpaste is more abrasive, which makes it more effective. Because toothpaste is abrasive, avoid using it on painted surfaces. For small stains, start with about a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and baking soda. For larger stains, use up to a teaspoon or tablespoon of each. Use a thick layer; if you can see the stain through the paste, add a little bit more. Toothbrushes work well for textured surfaces because the bristles can get into the nooks and crannies. For smooth surfaces, it’s okay to use a towel or your finger."

Choose a good quality rubber eraser and simply rub the stain with it until the stain disappears.

When you wipe it off, rub the area with the eraser again to remove any stubborn bits of permanent marker."

When you are done, wipe the area clean with a paper towel. [9] X Research source If there is any oily residue, soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe it clean."

If you’re worried using harsh chemicals may damage the wood, apply a bit of peanut butter to the stain and let it sit for at least 5 minutes. Then, dab the area with a damp microfiber cloth to pull up the peanut butter and dissolved ink. Repeat as needed until the permanent marker has been removed from the wood entirely. [15] X Research source If the stain is stubborn, it may be necessary to use rubbing alcohol instead. House cleaning professional Guy Peters also recommends using toothpaste for hardwood surfaces, like flooring: “Toothpaste is my favorite method for removing permanent marker from hardwood and it works well for both finished and unfinished wood. Stick with toothpastes that include baking soda (Arm & Hammer is the best) and avoid gel toothpastes since they won’t work at all. Simply apply the toothpaste to the permanent marker spot and rub the area with small circles [with a sponge or thick cloth]. Use a damp cloth to remove any extra toothpaste, and repeat as needed.” [16] X Expert Source Guy Peters House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 12 July 2021."

      "title": "What makes permanent markers “permanent”?",
      "content": "What makes permanent markers “permanent”? Sharpies and other permanent markers contain both ink and a type of alcohol. When you write with one, the alcohol evaporates and leaves the ink stuck on the surface, almost like a layer of paint. This is why permanent marker is more difficult to remove than other types of markers. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Are permanent markers really permanent?",
      "content": "Are permanent markers really permanent? In most cases, no. Because permanent markers become “permanent” when the alcohol they contain evaporates, it’s possible to remove the ink by reintroducing an alcohol to the stain. This is why products that contain alcohol or acetone, like dry-erase markers, work well to remove permanent marker stains. [21] X Research source"

In general, though, permanent marker will remain on plastic for at least several months and usually longer if you don’t attempt to remove it. [22] X Research source This is why it’s best to remove the permanent marker as soon as possible. The longer it remains untouched on the surface, the more difficult it is to get off."
