      "content": "Start by calculating the number of free hours you have each day. Grab your class schedule so you can figure out how much time you have to work with outside of class. Then, divide your available free time into blank study blocks. [1] X Research source Don’t forget about free blocks of time in between classes, too. You can get a lot of work done during free periods. [2] X Research source Studies show that studying in short bursts is the most effective way to learn. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use due dates and deadlines to prioritize different tasks at certain times. Avoid assigning yourself vague tasks like \"Study literature.” Instead, check your planner to see what’s coming up in the next few weeks, then assign tasks accordingly. Use key words like “read,” “write,” “review,” “outline,” and “memorize\" so you know exactly what you need to do. For example, if you have a history exam coming up in 2 weeks, you might write in study block tasks like “review lecture notes,” “go over highlighted concepts,” “do practice questions in text,” “make vocabulary flashcards,” and so on."

      "content": "Spread chunks out over several days so you don't stress out. If you need to write an essay that you know will take you about 4 hours to complete, don’t devote a 4-hour block of time to it on a single day. You’ll just end up overwhelming yourself and the rest of your schedule will get thrown off track, too. Instead, break the work into several 30-50 minute chunks over the course of a week or so.

      "title": "You can devote extra time to classes that are important to you.",
      "content": "You can devote extra time to classes that are important to you. As you’re assigning subjects to study blocks, consider which classes are the toughest—you’ll probably need to assign longer and/or more frequent study blocks to those particular subjects. You might also want to devote more time to key subjects, like the ones specific to your major, and spend less time studying for your electives. For example, if calculus isn’t your strong suit, devote 50-minute blocks to that subject every other day. If English is a breeze for you, a 30-minute block every 3-4 days might be all you need. If art history is an elective, you might only need to study for that once a week."

      "content": "You don’t need to study the same subject two days in a row! You’ll retain more information and experience less burnout if you space things out. For example, assign blocks of time for studying calculus and science on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Then, schedule blocks for literature and history on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.

Gather your syllabi or check your online resources to find exam dates, assignments, and other important details for each class. Do this right away so you can get organized, plan your time well, and stay ahead of assignment due dates. [8] X Research source You can use a notebook-style planner or an app for this. Go with what you’re most comfortable with and more likely to use consistently. Use a day planner with blank spaces and time slots so you can schedule things by the hour. Some people prefer digital planners while others prefer scheduling on paper—choose whichever option best motivates you.

      "content": "Give yourself 5- to 10-minute breaks between study blocks. Slogging away for hours at a time will do more harm than good, so breaks are crucial! If you tend to lose track of time, set a timer at the beginning of each study block so you don’t miss a break. [9] X Research source You can do whatever you want during breaks! Stretch, check your phone, get a snack, hit the restroom, or go for walk. The most important thing is to get up and walk away from your desk so you’re truly breaking from the material.

      "content": "It's important to make time for fun, exercise, and rest. The best study plan is a balanced one! Recreational activities, healthy meals, exercise, and getting plenty of sleep are crucial if you want to make the rest of your schedule stick. You'll be able to stay on track and perform at your best when you're taking care of all your needs. [11] X Research source For example, block out a 4-hour window every Sunday to chill with friends. Carve out 30 minutes a day to walk, jog, or do any other exercises you enjoy. Don't forget to block out 7-9 hours every night for sleep, too! Getting a little less than that is okay occasionally, but sticking to a consistent sleep schedule will help you feel your best."

      "content": "This helps solidify your schedule until it becomes routine. You don’t have to study in one devoted space for every study block, of course! Just choose a good place for each study block that makes sense with your schedule and stick to that location every time. [12] X Research source For example, if you have a free hour to study between history and literature, go to the library for that study session. Pick your favorite table on the second floor and make that “your spot.”"

Listen for key ideas in lectures and write them down in your own words. Keep your notes for each class separate and organized.
