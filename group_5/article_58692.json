It was sometimes associated with elk, along with qualities like nobility and integrity. Warning: During WWII, the Nazis unfortunately commandeered this rune as a symbol of their cause. While Algiz doesn’t have the reputation of other negatively repurposed symbols (like the swastika), it’s still important to analyze this symbol carefully whenever it’s used in modern contexts."

      "content": "Create bind runes with multiple runes. Bind runes are combinations of multiple runes designed to create a symbol with a more specific intent/meaning. Start by deciding what you’d like your bindrune to accomplish, and choose runes that are most relevant to that goal. Keep that goal and intent clear in your mind as you design your bind rune. You might combine Algiz and Eihwaz to create a protective bind rune that protects and banishes evil, or combine Uruz and Gebo if you’d like protection and wisdom for your current relationship. Like protection runes, feel free to incorporate bind runes in all aspects of your life—you might make a sticker of the bind rune and personalize your phone case, or draw it on a decorative rock you keep around your home."
