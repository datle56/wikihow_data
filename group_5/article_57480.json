      "content": "Find something to use as a handle for your stamp. A plain wine cork work great, but you an also use an old chess piece for something more antique-looking. You can also make your own handle by rolling some polymer clay into a tube the size of your thumb, and then baking it in your oven according to the instructions on the package. If you decide to use a chess piece, be sure to peel the felt away from the bottom. [1] X Research source Most polymer clays need to be baked at 275°F (135°C) for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece."

      "content": "Find an interesting button to use for the design part of your stamp. Coat buttons are great for this, because they don't have button holes at the front, which can affect your design. If you can't find an interesting button, you can also use a brooch, cameo pin, a charm, or a pendant."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hot glue the button to the handle.",
      "content": "Hot glue the button to the handle. Make sure that you are using enough glue so that the button sits securely on the bottom of the handle. If you are using a chess piece or a polymer clay tube as your handle, then you can use 2-part epoxy clay for something more durable. [2] X Research source To use 2-part epoxy clay: cut off equal amounts of part A and part B, then mix them together until you get a uniform color. Mold the clay to the base of the handle, then press the button into it. Smooth down any jagged or uneven edges with your finger. [3] X Research source Once the clay cures, you can sand any roughness down further. You can also use another type of thick glue, such as industrial-strength glue. Do not use white, school glue. It is not strong enough."

      "content": "Carve a design into the bottom of the tube. Many clay-working tools are too big to carve such intricate designs. Luckily, you can use just about anything to carve your design, such as a: ball-point pen, knitting needle, toothpick, stylus, or paperclip. You can also \"stamp\" a design into the clay. Simply find a fancy coat button or charm, and press it into the clay. Carefully pull the button or charm away. The indent is your design."

      "content": "Let the stamp cool. If you'd like, you can sand the bottom of the stamp gently to make it perfectly smooth. Do this by placing a sheet of fine-grit sandpaper on a flat surface, and then rubbing the base of the stamp back and forth across it. This should not affect your design, because it is carved into the stamp. Rinse the stamp when you are done, then part it dry."

For more detailed instructions, refer to the methods on making wax seals and hot glue seals . You can also make a seal out of clay. Simply roll a bit of polymer clay into a ball, then flatten it. Rub some oil or water onto the stamp, then press it into the clay. Gently pull the stamp away, then bake the clay piece according to the package directions. [5] X Research source"

Even if you are extra careful, there is a chance of the wax igniting as it drips onto your paper. This can result in a small fire. Work on top of a tiled counter or a clean, metal baking sheet. Have a large glass of water near by—something that is easy to grab and spill. This method is recommended for stamps made out of metal. You can use other stamps, such as clay ones, but they will be more likely to stick to the wax."

Hold the wax in one hand, and a lighter in the other. Ignite the lighter, and hold the wax up to it. If you are using a wax stick that has a wick inside of it, light the wick, and let it burn for a few moments. You can also use a candle instead."

Let a few, big drops of wax drip onto the paper, until you get a puddle that is the same size as your seal. [6] X Research source If you are using a candle or wicked wax stick, hold the candle/wax stick at a 45-degree angle above the paper. [7] X Research source Black soot may get into your wax, especially if you are using a wicked stick. This is normal."

If you work with a dry stamp, the hot wax may get stuck to it. [9] X Research source You can use a store-bought stamp meant for making wax seals, or you can make your own stamp using the methods above; do not use a rubber ink stamp. Use cold water. If your stamp gets too hot, the wax won't cool down fast enough. It might also stick to your stamp. If you are working with a non-metal stamp (such as a clay stamp), use oil instead.

Instead, hold it against the wax for a few more seconds, then try pulling it away again. [12] X Research source If you try to pull the stamp away too soon, the design may not form properly. Gently rotate the stamp around the wax before you pull it away. This will allow the wax to gently release the stamp. [13] X Research source"

A silicone mat, a glass tile, or a plate would be ideal. [14] X Research source You can also use a sheet of aluminum foil or a metal baking sheet. In a pinch, you can also use a sheet of paper. [15] X Research source Keep in mind that, after you peel the seal away, some of the paper will cling to the back. This method is great if you need to make a lot of wax seals."

      "content": "Allow the hot glue gun to heat up first. You can use plain hot glue sticks or colored hot glue sticks. Keep in mind that you can always paint your seal when you are done. Some arts and crafts stores also sell special wax sticks meant for hot glue guns and making wax seals; you can use one of those instead. Crayons are not recommended, as they can damage your hot glue gun. If you do decide to use a crayon, gently push the it down into the hot glue gun, otherwise, it may leak out the sides. Consider placing your stamp on top of an ice pack. This will chill your stamp down, and help the hot glue seal set faster. [16] X Research source Your stamp can chill while your hot glue heats up!"

If you want, you can paint it a more interesting color. [17] X Research source Typical wax seal colors are red, black, or gold, but you can use any color you want. If you oiled your stamp, you will need to wash the seal with soap and water, or the paint won't stick. If you are making a lot of seals, you can also spray paint them instead.
