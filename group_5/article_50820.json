      "title": "Make yourself available to your employees.",
      "content": "Make yourself available to your employees. Open door doesn’t mean that your office door is literally always open. Rather, it means that your employees can come to you with any issues or suggestions that they have, and you will be receptive. [1] X Research source If you’re very busy, you can specify times when your employees can filter in or out of your office, or you can make rounds to visit your employees in their workspace. Actively listen to your employees to make sure they feel like they're being heard. Give serious consideration to employees' suggestions about how to improve productivity—after all, they're the ones on the ground each day!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let them know you see their hard work.",
      "content": "Let them know you see their hard work. Every employee in your organization contributes to making your business a success. If you acknowledge their contributions, they'll feel appreciated, and they'll be more likely to keep doing good work in the future. [2] X Research source Say, “I don’t say it often enough, but we couldn’t keep this place running without your hardwork. Thanks for all you do.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "This can help motivate your staff to do their best work.",
      "content": "This can help motivate your staff to do their best work. Make your office a pleasant place to work by providing good lighting, encouraging a friendly attitude, and allowing employees to bring in a personal touch, such as family photos or a fun poster. Provide your employees with rewards and incentives for good work, such as a pizza party or a monthly certificate. Set up a bulletin board to post about employee’s achievements. You can also create a section for photos of employees and company events. Try instituting a casual Friday. Make a point to celebrate holidays and birthdays."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work alongside your employees regularly.",
      "content": "Work alongside your employees regularly. It’s easy for a boss to become out of touch with the job tasks of lower level employees. This can create resentment from employees whose jobs you don’t understand, and it prevents you from spotting areas that could benefit from change. Instead, spend some time each week helping your employees with their regular tasks so you'll always know what's going on. [3] X Research source Sit in on a planning meeting. Join the sales team on the floor. Spend a few minutes sorting mail in the mailroom."
    },
    {
      "title": "Challenge your employees by giving them new assignments.",
      "content": "Challenge your employees by giving them new assignments. Trust them to get the job done right, even if it's outside of their normal workload. For example, allow junior employees to work on committees alongside senior employees. [4] X Research source If you don’t allow your staff to grow, they may seek other opportunities. Letting employees try new things can lead to innovation. You can also use it as a strategy to increase the number of people on your staff who are able to complete certain tasks. Try to support the career goals of your employees when you can. For instance, if you know an employee is interested in leading a team one day, you might assign them the lead role on a project."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a collaborative, supportive culture.",
      "content": "Create a collaborative, supportive culture. It’s normal for people to hit roadblocks, especially if you’re assigning tasks that stretch your employees. If an employee seems to have hit a barrier that they can’t cross, work with them to get the job done. [5] X Research source Don’t take over for your employee. Instead, provide them with assistance, whether it’s from you or another employee who can mentor them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Offer training sessions, guest speakers, or training videos.",
      "content": "Offer training sessions, guest speakers, or training videos. Provide ongoing training for current employees in addition to the training you give to new hires. If you have the resources, you could even send your employees to a conference or seminar. Monitor your employees to see if they are struggling to meet their work demands, especially if you work in a rapidly changing industry. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Assign someone to a job and then let them handle it.",
      "content": "Assign someone to a job and then let them handle it. Delegating helps you get more work done and creates a well-trained workforce. Once a task has been assigned, trust that employee to complete it without you hovering over them. [7] X Research source For example, allow problems to work their way up a hierarchical chain before they reach you. This will empower your employees to make more of the day-to-day decisions. Stepping in to help an employee who truly needs direction is not the same as micromanaging."
    },
    {
      "title": "Good bosses keep their employees well-informed.",
      "content": "Good bosses keep their employees well-informed. Employees need to know if you’re happy with their work performance, so tell your employees how they’re doing. You don’t have to have formal evaluations. Instead, incorporate feedback into your workplace operations. [8] X Research source Give positive feedback during meetings, right after an employee gives a presentation, or while you walk around the office. Meet with employees for a few minutes each week to discuss their projects. If an employee is expecting feedback on a project, get back with them ASAP so they don't feel frustrated or anxious."

    {
      "title": "Don’t criticize or chastise your employees in front of others.",
      "content": "Don’t criticize or chastise your employees in front of others. While you may think that it creates teaching opportunities, it actually inspires negativity and stress in your employees, who will fear being embarrassed by you in the future. Instead, meet with employees in private. [9] X Research source Try to give positive praise at least as often as you offer criticism. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Short emails can seem curt.",
      "content": "Short emails can seem curt. Read all of your emails, and send a timely acknowledgment of receipt. Avoid sending dismissive notes like “Thanks” or “Got it.” Instead, acknowledge what was said. [11] X Research source Say, “Thanks for letting me know that the deadline has shifted. I appreciate your hard work.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Even bosses need assistance sometimes.",
      "content": "Even bosses need assistance sometimes. Your employees will recognize it as a sign of strength because your aren’t afraid of admitting that you don’t know everything. [12] X Research source Say, “I’m mulling over how to approach this merger decision, and I’m open to your suggestions. If you’d like to talk about your ideas or concerns, drop by my office between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m. today.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use it as an opportunity to grow.",
      "content": "Use it as an opportunity to grow. Don’t be defensive when your employees criticize your decisions or performance. Instead, consider their comments and decide if they make sense. If they do, consider it an opportunity for growth. [13] X Research source Don’t punish people for giving you negative feedback. No one is perfect, not even you. It’s normal to make mistakes. If you do make a mistake, admit the error and apologize for it. [14] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Acknowledge them instead of taking the credit.",
      "content": "Acknowledge them instead of taking the credit. Consider the organization’s accomplishments to be a group effort. Bad bosses often hog the credit, but good bosses spread it around. Acknowledge the contributions of others. Congratulate your employees for a job well done. When people give you praise, mention the employees who helped you make the accomplishment happen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Some employees may be better performers than others.",
      "content": "Some employees may be better performers than others. Perhaps some even remind you of yourself. Keep these opinions to yourself. Showing favoritism is damaging to the workforce. It can discourage workers who don’t feel favored, and it can cause stagnation in favored employees. [15] X Research source If you find yourself focusing your attention on a fraction of your employees, make a point to shift your attention to include others. If you go out to lunch or happy hour with employees, make sure everyone is invited."
    },
    {
      "title": "Engage with them, but keep it professional.",
      "content": "Engage with them, but keep it professional. When you’re the boss, you have to separate yourself from your employees. While you can still grab lunch or join them for the occasional happy hour, you need to behave professionally the entire time. If employees see you as a peer, you will lose your authority. [16] X Research source Maintain strong boundaries around your personal life. Don’t overshare personal details, such as what you did over the weekend or the issues you’re having with a relative. [17] X Research source Keep your conversations centered on the workplace or your professional experiences. Also, avoid engaging in office gossip. Spreading gossip will destroy your credibility as a boss immediately. [18] X Research source"
