      "title": "Rub the water mark with a white piece of silk.",
      "content": "Rub the water mark with a white piece of silk. Rubbing your silk upholstery or garment with a white piece of silk transfers the water mark onto the fabric. So, use a piece of fabric you don’t mind getting stained. Then, gently rub it over the water mark following the grain of your silk item. [1] X Research source Do not use colored silk to remove the stain. Rubbing your silk with colored fabric can cause the dye to transfer onto your garment. If you can’t find any white silk, use a piece of muslin or white cotton. Avoid rubbing the silk against the grain of your garment. This can wear out or damage the fabric."

      "content": "Turn on your steamer or bring some water to a boil. Set your steamer to its lowest heat setting and wait for it to heat up. If you don’t have a steamer, fill a pot with water and place it on your stovetop over high heat. Or, fill a kettle with water and bring it to a boil. [2] X Research source Steam helps loosen and disperse the water mark, removing it from the silk. Reduce the heat to a simmer once the pot of water starts boiling. Alternatively, use the steam setting on your iron."

      "title": "Hold the water mark over the steam for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Hold the water mark over the steam for 1 minute. Move the steamer back and forth over the water stain, holding the steamer 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) from the silk. [3] X Research source If you’re using a pot of water or kettle, hold your garment 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) above the steam. Just keep the stained spot in the steam for 1 to 2 minutes. [4] X Research source Test the steamer or iron a few times before using it to ensure it spits out steam, not droplets of water. Be careful when steaming your garment. Continually move the fabric back and forth to avoid burns."

      "content": "Blot the silk and place it on a clean towel to dry. Use a clean white cloth to dab and remove moisture from the silk. [5] X Research source Then, place a clean, white towel on a flat surface. Lay your garment on top and allow it to dry thoroughly. [6] X Research source If the stain does not go away, steam the silk again. If that doesn’t work, try one of the other stain removal methods below."

      "title": "Dab the water mark with vinegar or lemon juice mixed with water.",
      "content": "Dab the water mark with vinegar or lemon juice mixed with water. Mix equal parts white vinegar and cool water in a spray bottle, or lemon juice and cool water. Spray the water mark with the solution and dab it with a white cloth until the mark disappears. [7] X Research source Wash the silk after applying the stain remover. Check the silk for colorfastness and test the spray on a hidden part of the fabric before applying it to the mark. If the item isn’t colorfast or the solution stains the silk, get it dry cleaned, instead. Use this stain remover to get rid of other unsightly spots, like sweat, deodorant, and food."

      "title": "Fill a bowl with cold water and a few drops of gentle detergent.",
      "content": "Fill a bowl with cold water and a few drops of gentle detergent. Pour a few drops of a detergent designed for delicate garments or a gentle, fragrance-free detergent into a bowl of cold water. Then, mix the detergent thoroughly in the water. [8] X Research source Read the care label on your silk item before hand washing it. If the label says “Dry Clean Only,” take it to a professional dry cleaner. If the care label says your item is machine washable, follow the instructions to safely wash it in your machine. Test your silk item for color fastness before washing it, too. Do not use heavy, harsh detergents or bleach on silk items. These cleaners can damage the silk fibers and cause the color to fade."

      "title": "Soak the garment in the soapy water for 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the garment in the soapy water for 3 to 5 minutes. Laundry and dry cleaning expert Ocean Van says to submerge the silk in the soapy water and gently swirl it around. Then, leave it in the water for 3 to 5 minutes to help dissolve the water mark. [9] X Research source If your fabric is a print or dark color, skip this step . Instead, dip the garment in the water and then take it out immediately. This helps keep the colors from fading or running. Do not soak silk for more than a few minutes. This can damage the structure of the fabric."

      "title": "Rinse the garment in cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the garment in cool water. Empty the bowl of soapy water and rinse it out to get rid of any soap. Then, refill the bowl with cool water and insert the silk garment. Gently swirl the garment around to rinse out the soapy residue. [10] X Research source Repeat this step as many times as needed until you feel all of the soap is rinsed from the silk. Add a little bit of distilled white vinegar to the fresh water to help neutralize the soapy residue and prevent alkali damage. For extra soft silk, add 1 to 2 drops of hair conditioner to the rinsing water."

      "content": "Roll the garment between a towel and then allow it to air dry. Place your silk garment on top of a white towel and gently roll it up to remove excess moisture. [11] X Research source Then, professional dry cleaner Safir Ali recommends hanging the garment up on a padded or velvet hanger to dry. Or, lay the garment flat on the towel. Check to see if the water mark is gone once the silk is dry. It typically takes 1 hour for silk to dry. [12] X Research source Laundry and dry cleaning expert Jeimy Flournoy says not to wring the silk garment dry, as this can damage the fibers and cause the garment to lose its shape. Never dry your silk in the sunlight. Sunlight can damage the silk and cause it to decompose or fade."

      "content": "Rinse the silk with white vinegar and detergent if the stain remains. If the water mark isn’t gone after the garment dries, fill a bowl with cool water, a few drops of gentle detergent, and a splash of white vinegar. Let the silk soak in the water for 3 minutes. Then, let the garment dry. [13] X Research source The vinegar helps evaporate the water stain on your garment."

      "title": "Blot the affected area with a dry, white cloth.",
      "content": "Blot the affected area with a dry, white cloth. Act quickly as soon as you notice the water mark on your silk garment or upholstery. Simply pat and dab the spot with a dry, white cloth or paper towel until the water mark is gone. [14] X Research source Do not rub the water mark with the cloth, as this can cause it to spread or damage the silk. It’s important to use a white cloth because colored fabrics can potentially bleed onto your silk item. Treat water marks as soon as possible—fresh stains are typically easier to remove than old ones. If blotting the water mark doesn’t get rid of it, try one of the stain removal methods below."
