      "content": "Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout the process. Sulfuric acid can burn your skin, irritate your eyes, and cause severe damage if enough comes into contact with you. You can wash sulfuric acid away, but it will still burn for a short time. If the burn breaks the skin and looks severe, stop what you are doing and immediately go to the hospital after flushing the area with plenty of water.

      "content": "Pour 450 millilitres (1.9 c) of lemon juice into a beaker and test its pH . Lemon juice or lime juice are optimal as these fruits have a very high concentration of citric acid, making the extraction process easier. Use a pH strip to test the juice - it should be at about 2 or 3 on the pH scale. [2] X Research source Don't use oranges, grapefruits, or other mild citrus fruits that don't immediately taste tart. These are lower in citric acid content and your end result won't be nearly as strong or effective."

      "content": "Add an eyedropper filled with 10% strength sodium hydroxide and test it again. The sodium hydroxide will neutralize the acidity of the lemon juice. [3] X Research source Add a filled eyedropper of sodium hydroxide, test the acidity with your pH testing strips, and it if it is not at about an 8 or a 9 on the pH scale, add a few more drops and test again. The solution should have a deep orange color. If you can't find 10% strength sodium hydroxide at your grocery store or chemical store, combine 10 millilitres (0.042 c) of full-strength sodium hydroxide with 90 millilitres (0.38 c) of water to make the chemical a lower strength.

If the coffee filter paper gets clogged, empty the liquid into a beaker, replace the coffee filter, and continue to pour the solution through the filter. It may take several attempts to fully filter the liquid."

      "content": "Combine the calcium citrate with heavily diluted sulfuric acid and stir. Use about enough sulfuric acid to just cover the top of the calcium citrate, and stir rapidly. The exact amount you use will differ slightly based upon how much calcium citrate you produced. It won't dissolve easily, but you will end up with a pure white solution. Be extremely careful with sulfuric acid, even when it is diluted. If you get sulfuric acid on your skin, immediately stop what you are doing and flush the area with soapy water. It will irritate the acid, but it is much better to wash it off as best you can than leave it to burn your skin. [7] X Research source For severe burns, rinse the area with plenty of water as best as you can and go straight to the hospital."

The calcium citrate has mostly converted to citric acid at this point, but it must be filtered from any impurities. The solution will be thick, so pour distilled water into the solution to help force the citric acid through.

The liquid filtered out will be near-pure citric acid. You can let the solution cool for longer to make a more concentrated form of citric acid. If you want to make citric acid crystals, allow the solution to sit out and evaporate for about 1 to 2 weeks. You will see the crystals start to form over time, but be careful not to disturb it. You can crush these crystals to make powder. [9] X Research source"

You can use more or less water than this if you need to make the solution to be of a lower or higher concentration, but don't alter the amount of citric acid you use. For a stronger solution, boil 0.5 US pints (240 ml) to 0.75 US pints (350 ml) of distilled water per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of citric acid. This will be better for cleaning and high-intensity uses for the acid. For a weaker solution, boil up to 2 US pints (950 ml) of distilled water per 1 pound (0.45 kg) of citric acid.
