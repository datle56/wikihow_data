To reliably find an Applin, you must dash into trees in the areas where Applin can be found (and due to this, you must have unlocked dashing from the Stony Cliff Titan quest). You can find Applin in the following areas: [1] X Research source East Province Areas One and Two South Province Areas One and Two Tagtree Thicket West Province Area Three Apple Hills (The Teal Mask DLC) Kitakami Road (The Teal Mask DLC) Mossfell Confluence (The Teal Mask DLC) 1 Star Raid Battles 2 and 3 Star Raid Battles (The Teal Mask DLC)"

There are no other requirements to getting a Dipplin other than using a Syrupy Apple, so you can evolve your Applin right away. Alternatively, you can sometimes find Dipplin in 4 Star Raid Battles in The Teal Mask DLC, though this may not be a reliable way to find a Dipplin due to their rarity."
