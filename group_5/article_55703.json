      "title": "Set the dates for the competition.",
      "content": "Set the dates for the competition. Anywhere between 6 and 8 weeks is the shortest duration you should attempt for a weight loss challenge. Shorter challenges will have the least drastic results in the end, but they can also be the most productive because there’s a slight sense of urgency throughout the competition. Between 8 and 10 weeks is the most commonly used time frame for a weight loss challenge. Give the challenge a catchy name that references the duration of the event, like the “10-Week Lifestyle Reboot” or something else similarly motivating. [1] X Research source 12 weeks should be the maximum duration for a weight loss challenge. After 12 weeks people may start to lose interest in the competition or drop out because it’s too strenuous."

      "content": "Set realistic rules. The recommended and safest rate of weight loss is approximately 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source On average, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, by way of diet and exercise, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. This is a realistic goal that everyone can shoot for. As host of the competition, it will be your responsibility to convey to the participants that ultimately the contest is about health, not weight. Caution your participants about using extreme measures and unhealthy methods to lose weight, and warn them about the dangers of losing too much weight too quickly. When you host the first meeting, provide literature about healthy weight loss strategies, along with quality information about diet and exercise for safe weight loss. Emphasize that they should use diet and exercise to lose weight, not starve themselves. State clearly and kindly that you'll have to privately intervene if you notice anyone who starts shedding weight inexplicably fast or starts to look unhealthy during the contest and that it could result in their disqualification."

      "title": "Determine how to measure success.",
      "content": "Determine how to measure success. Most challenges measure success by pounds lost, and this method will be easiest for you to measure. Providing the data in pounds lost will also more straightforward for the participants. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by calculating the highest percentage of weight loss over the time period of the challenge. Record each participant’s weight every week, and on the final day of the competition you will get the average of those weekly weigh-ins and subtract that number from the participant’s start weight. The objective is to reveal who showed the most improvement over the course of the contest, measured by percentage of weight loss. Sometimes weight loss challenges will measure success by body fat percentage instead of pounds lost. Both methods of measurement are effective, but it may be easier to measure body fat percentages accurately if you have a personal trainer or fitness expert involved in the competition."

      "title": "Decide if participants will work as teams or individually.",
      "content": "Decide if participants will work as teams or individually. Working in teams can be a lot more fun (and effective) for everyone involved. If you decide to do teams, the process will be slightly different. Create small groups of 2 to 6 people, with one of them acting as team captain. Success will be measured by total percentage lost by the group rather than individually. The weigh-ins will work the same as with individual play, except that the team captain will record everyone's weights and submit them each week. The captain will also be responsible for making sure everyone in the group makes the weigh-ins and for team support in general."

      "title": "Set the entry fee (if you're going to have one).",
      "content": "Set the entry fee (if you're going to have one). Make it something affordable, like $25 or $50 per person. The collected amount can fund the cash prize for the winner and also cover any expenses associated with the competition, such as T-shirts or planning a post-challenge party to celebrate everyone’s success. If you decide to require an entry fee, task one person with being in charge of the funds throughout the challenge. Keep the money in a secure place, like in a lock box or safe, and make sure that all expenses are well-documented. Skip the entree fee requirement if you think it will discourage others from participating in the challenge. If you aren’t sure, send out an email to announce the competition. Get a feel for who is interested in competing and then poll those people about what amount would be fair and affordable to charge as an entry fee."

      "title": "Determine what the winner will receive.",
      "content": "Determine what the winner will receive. Usually the reward is the cash prize generated from the collected entry fees (minus any expenses). You could also offer prizes like laptops, iPads, or gift certificates, if you have that capability. If you are holding the challenge for colleagues at your place of employment, ask your employer to sponsor the event and provide prizes for the competition. You’ll need to decide if the winner takes all, or if you plan to have first and second place winners in the competition. A winner-takes-all prize is certainly more of an incentive for the participants, but if you have several generous prizes planned, it would make sense to have first and second place winners."

      "title": "Obtain authorization before you announce it if you plan to hold the weight loss challenge at work.",
      "content": "Obtain authorization before you announce it if you plan to hold the weight loss challenge at work. Supply someone in management with all of the challenge information and guidelines. Additionally, you should speak with someone in the Human Resources department about the contest. When announced, it should be stressed that participation is completely optional. Enlist the HR department's help in announcing the contest, as well as monitoring employees for any unsafe or negative behavior. Consider having the HR department speak to everyone as a group about safety. Since crash diets can affect work performance, HR will need to help monitor the staff for any behavioral or performance changes. If anyone on staff is uncomfortable with the contest because of past (or current) eating disorders, or for any other reason, let the group know when the contest is announced that the employee should speak to the HR department privately about it. If there are any major protests or problems reported, have HR help you shut down the competition. Wait for the official go-ahead from management and Human Resources before announcing anything about the competition to your colleagues. Since the challenge will encourage employees to be healthier, find out if your employer would be willing to help cover expenses and provide the cash prize."

The most accurate way to track weight loss is by setting a routine day and time (preferably in the morning before breakfast) each week to record the measurements.

Make sure that everyone knows the dates and times for the weekly weigh-ins for the remaining duration of the challenge.
