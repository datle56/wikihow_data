      "content": "Candle magic is a tool for manifesting your desires. The exact origins of candle magic are uncertain, but since ancient times, in cultures all over the world, fire has been used in magic rituals, and that includes candles. By lighting a candle, voicing a wish, and interpreting the candle’s flames, you may be able to manifest your dream life."

      "content": "Clarify your intention. What do you want to achieve using candle magic? Is there any negative energy you wish to expel, or positive energy you want to attract? Sum your intention up in one sentence: “I attract wealth” or “I have found my dream job.” Medium, spiritual director, and life coach Jennifer McVey says, \"Write [your affirmation] in the present tense. You want to make it clear, concise...and positive.\""

These could be items that carry specific magical properties, or they could just be things you find meaningful or aesthetically pleasing."

Jennifer McVey says, \"I would do [the spell] in a circle...[in] a sacred space.\" What qualifies as \"sacred\" is up to you: it might be out in nature, in your living room, or somewhere else you find peaceful and meaningful. As for when to perform your spell? Plan for the next new moon, McVey says: \"[A]s the moon grows, your idea would grow...[and come to] fruition.\""

      "content": "Dress your candle in oil. Cover your candle with oil from bottom to top to expel anything you want to get rid of (for example, financial stress). Rub the candle from top to bottom to attract what you want more of (like money, for instance). Any oil you’ve got around the house is fine—like avocado oil, jojoba oil, or essential oil."

      "title": "Voice your intention, and light the candle.",
      "content": "Voice your intention, and light the candle. Take deep breaths and visualize your goal. When the moment feels right, sing, chant, or merely speak your vision aloud, and light the candle. Some people opt to speak or pray their wish into existence, while others chant or sing it. Go with whatever feels right! Jennifer McVey suggests writing your spell down ahead of time and \"bury[ing] [it], or rip[ping] it up\" during the ritual. McVey also cautions, “My only warning would be to be sure [not to] set anything on fire.”"

      "title": "Interpret the movement of the flame, and blow out the candle.",
      "content": "Interpret the movement of the flame, and blow out the candle. Stare at the fire: by interpreting the dance of the flames , you can tell whether your spell worked or not, and perhaps receive messages from supernatural energies. Once you've finished, blow out the candle. Jennifer McVey says, “[It’s like] looking into a crystal ball…. Unfocus your eyes a little bit… [Clear] your mind, [relax] your body…and then look at the flame and see what you see.” Common flame interpretations include: A tall flame: The ritual was successful. Congrats! Popping or sizzling: A spirit is trying to communicate with you! What “words” do you hear in the crackling of the flame? The candle refuses to light: Negative forces may be interfering with your spell—try again later."

      "content": "Different colored candles are believed to carry specific magical properties. To help ensure your spell is successful, pick the appropriate candle color —or even combine multiple colors! Pink candles represent self-love, friendship, romance, femininity, and kindness. Use pink candles in love spells, friendship spells, spells to make others kind to you, and more. [1] X Research source Blue candles symbolize inner peace, forgiveness, and clarity. Use blue candles to alleviate anxiety or stress, to make you feel calmer and more self-assured, and even to help with sleep problems. Green is associated with wealth, luck, fertility, and personal growth. Light a green candle to protect yourself from misfortune, increase your wealth, or make your next venture lucky. Purple is the color of psychic growth and mystical awareness. Light a purple candle to foretell the future, promote healing and compassion, or increase your passion and motivation. Red is the color of passion, lust, power, and courage. Use a red candle to boost your confidence and sexual attractiveness, make you more fertile, or increase your stamina or physical strength. Orange represents fun, success, joy, excitement, and energy. Light an orange candle to boost your motivation, confidence, and energy and to help you look on the bright side of things. Yellow is associated with vitality, creativity, clarity, positivity, and confidence. Light a yellow candle to feel more in control, to know what you want, to boost creativity, and to attract positive vibes. [2] X Research source Black is about protection, stability, and endurance.

If you’re feeling discouraged or unwell, lighting a white candle can cleanse your energy and attract positive vibes. Brown is the color associated with balance, security, and material needs.
