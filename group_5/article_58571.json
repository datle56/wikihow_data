      "content": "It’s easier to stay awake when you’re well-rested before the shift. When you restrict your sleep by working all night and then staying up during the day, your body accrues “sleep debt,” meaning your exhaustion builds up over time. Set aside 7 to 9 hours daily for sleep, and pay off existing sleep debt before your overnight shift by getting plenty of rest and taking naps if needed. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Avoid products that contain alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine before you go to sleep. They can keep you awake and make it difficult to get restful sleep. If you have a few days before your first shift, ease yourself into sleeping during the day. Start going to bed and waking up incrementally later, and sleep in as late as you can the morning before your shift. Take a nap the afternoon before your shift, especially if you haven’t yet gotten into the habit of sleeping all day. A 30- to 40-minute nap can really help you feel rested before work!"

      "content": "Protein and whole grains provide a continual release of energy for you. Eat dinner before heading off to your night shift. Enjoy plenty of protein (lean meats, poultry, fish and seafood, eggs, beans, dairy products, and nuts) and whole grains. [2] X Research source Try whole-grain bread, pasta, oatmeal, cereal, buckwheat, or brown rice. This should be your main meal of the day. Be sure you also eat a light meal right after you get off work so you don’t go to sleep hungry."

      "title": "Caffeine keeps you alert, but too much interferes with regular sleep.",
      "content": "Caffeine keeps you alert, but too much interferes with regular sleep. Caffeine acts as a stimulant for your central nervous system, making you feel energized for hours after drinking it. However, drinking lots of caffeine throughout the shift will make it difficult to go to bed afterward. Instead, have 1 caffeinated beverage (like coffee or tea) at the beginning of your shift and switch to non-caffeinated drinks after. A caffeinated beverage can give you an energy boost for up to 6 hours, which is why 1 is usually more than enough for an overnight shift. Don’t drink more than 400 mg of caffeine daily. Caffeine is safe in moderate amounts, but drinking more than that can cause negative side effects."

      "content": "Re-energize yourself throughout the shift with light snacks. One large meal in the middle of the shift can make you sleepy, but eating smaller snacks throughout the shift will keep you energized, alert, and full. Bring some fruits or veggies, nuts (which are full of protein), granola and yogurt, crackers, or any other snacks you like. To get the most energy, ensure the majority of your snacks are nutritious. [3] X Research source You can also enjoy a light “lunch” halfway through your shift, but don’t overeat all at once! Bring your favorite foods to help boost your mood and make your shift enjoyable."

      "title": "Water helps you avoid dehydration, which worsens fatigue.",
      "content": "Water helps you avoid dehydration, which worsens fatigue. Everyone should drink water throughout their day to stay healthy—regardless of their schedule! Generally, women need about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of water daily, and men need 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water. If you’re up for most of the evening and night working a late shift, continually drink water for the duration. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Drink ice-cold water throughout your shift to help you stay awake. Bring your favorite drinks so you have a treat during your shift. You don’t have to drink only water to stay hydrated. Milk, juice, and herbal teas are also made mostly of water! A good portion of your daily intake should be water, but you can enjoy other beverages too. Dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired because you don’t have enough water if your body to maintain normal functions—which is why it’s so important to drink up throughout the shift."

      "title": "Quick 20-minute power naps can give you a big energy boost.",
      "content": "Quick 20-minute power naps can give you a big energy boost. If you have the option, take a power nap in the middle of your shift. First, set an easily audible alarm to guarantee you’ll get up at the end of the nap. Find a secluded, comfy place to doze off and nap for 20 to 30 minutes. You’ll wake up feeling refreshed with enough energy to finish out your overnight shift. [5] X Research source Be careful not to sleep longer than 30 minutes, or you might wake up feeling even more tired. Exercise self-discipline and get up right when your alarm goes off. If you struggle with hitting the “snooze” button, try setting up the alarm device in a spot out of arms’ reach, so you have to get up to turn it off. Not every work environment allows napping. Get approval from your manager before planning to take a nap during work hours, even if you do it during a scheduled break."

      "title": "Movement gives you more energy and combats sleepiness.",
      "content": "Movement gives you more energy and combats sleepiness. Get up and walk around if you start feeling drowsy partway through your shift. Even better, climb a flight of stairs, do a quick set of jumping jacks , try some stretches , or play music and dance for a couple of minutes. The more you get your body moving, the more alert you’ll feel. [6] X Research source If you’re nervous about working overnight, some quick exercise can help you feel calmer and happier in addition to being more alert. Whatever you do, ensure it won’t disturb anyone else in your workplace. For example, it’s easy to do some jumping jacks in an empty break room, but jogging around the workplace might distract coworkers."

      "title": "Light stimulus helps your brain stay awake even while it’s dark outside.",
      "content": "Light stimulus helps your brain stay awake even while it’s dark outside. When it gets dark out, your body instigates drowsiness by releasing melatonin. However, you can trick your body by exposing yourself to bright light throughout your shift. This makes your body react as though it’s still daytime and delays the release of melatonin. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source On the way home from your shift, try wearing sunglasses and suppressing your exposure to light as much as possible. This can help you fall asleep faster when you get home."

      "title": "Chat with colleagues or bring a book to read if you have downtime.",
      "content": "Chat with colleagues or bring a book to read if you have downtime. Letting yourself get bored on the night shift can very quickly lead to getting sleepy. Bring a couple of activities from home that you can use to stay alert during downtime, like a book, a sketchbook for drawing, or a journal . Get to know your colleagues, too—a friendly conversation stimulates your mind! [8] X Research source It’s okay to be nervous before your first shift, especially if you’re not used to staying up at night. Make a quick list of ways to wake up if you feel tired during your shift. It’s often helpful to rely on your colleagues for support (and vice versa). They also need ways to stay alert, so you can help one another out and chat during the shift. If you get really sleepy, you can also run to the bathroom and splash some water on your face for a quick pick-me-up."

      "content": "Driving is risky when you’re tired and sleep-deprived. You’re at greater risk of falling asleep at the wheel, and your awareness (and reaction speed) is limited while fighting off sleep.

Go to source Check out public transportation options to see if there’s a bus or train you can use for your commute. Otherwise, call a taxi or use a rideshare app like Uber or Lyft to get home. If you have a colleague used to overnight shifts and comfortable driving afterward, you could also ask them to give you a ride home."

      "content": "Earplugs, blackout curtains, and temperature control will help you sleep. Having trouble sleeping during the day is normal, but a few simple changes can make it easy. Install blackout curtains in your bedroom and invest in quality earplugs to block outside noises. Use your air conditioning (or a cooling unit ) to keep the temperature comfy and cool. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Turn off all televisions, computers, and electronics that might distract you from sleep. If it’s still hard to fall asleep, try a relaxing activity beforehand to decompress you, like yoga or a warm bath."

      "content": "Having a consistent schedule makes it easier to get enough sleep. Make a daily schedule that includes your work hours, sleeping hours, chores, free time, and social plans. Aim for consistency and schedule several overnight shifts in a row to help your body adjust faster; working overnight and daytime shifts back-to-back can cause you to lose sleep. [11] X Research source For example: Set a single bedtime and wake-up time you can adhere to on days with overnight shifts. On off days, try to stay up until around 3 AM and sleep until noon, so there’s still some overlap in sleeping times every 24-hour period. Plan meals at a particular time every day too. If you have chores, pick a day you’ll do each one consistently every week. Make time for fun, friends, and family! Taking care of your mental health and maintaining your social life while working the night shift is important."
