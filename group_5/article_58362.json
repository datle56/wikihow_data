      "content": "Use a set of traditional karuta cards . Karuta cards come in 2 different decks. Yomifuda , or “reading cards,” have poems or clues written on them in Japanese. Torifuda , or “grabbing cards,” have pictures, answers, or the last lines of a poem that match one of the yomifuda. [1] X Research source Both yomifuda and torifuda cards come in decks of 100 cards, but you can use any number of them during your game. Karuta cards typically are written in Japanese, so they’re great for practicing your reading and speaking skills. If you don’t know Japanese, look for versions of karuta cards in your native language. In a pinch, you may use traditional playing card decks. Because the sets come in decks of 52, you will need one deck to replace for \"reading cards\" and another deck for the \"grabbing cards.\""

      "title": "Choose a player to be the reciter.",
      "content": "Choose a player to be the reciter. Karuta requires at least 3 people: 2 players who face off against each other and one more person to recite the reading cards out loud. Pick someone with a clear speaking voice that the other players can easily hear. [2] X Research source You’re not allowed to be the reciter if you’re one of the two players because it can give you an unfair advantage. Matches of karuta only last about 5–15 minutes (45-60 minutes with traditional cards), so you can easily switch between being the reciter and playing the game."

      "title": "Shuffle and deal 25 grabbing cards to each player.",
      "content": "Shuffle and deal 25 grabbing cards to each player. Shuffle the deck of grabbing cards so they’re thoroughly mixed. The players will take grabbing cards 5 at a time until they both have 25. [3] X Research source The other 50 cards in the deck of \"grabbing\" cards will not be used. If you’re using a standard card deck, shuffle them and give each player 13 cards."

      "title": "Shuffle the reading cards into a face-down stack.",
      "content": "Shuffle the reading cards into a face-down stack. The reciter shuffles all 100 reading cards together so they’re randomly mixed. After shuffling, the reciter places the deck face down in front of themselves. [4] X Research source When you use regular playing cards, shuffle a second deck and place them next to the reciter."

    {
      "title": "Flip and arrange the grabbing cards into rows.",
      "content": "Flip and arrange the grabbing cards into rows. Both players flip over their 25 grabbing cards so that they are face-up in front of them. Each player places their cards into 3 rows - they can arrange the cards however they like within these 3 rows. Leave about 1 centimetre (0.39 in) between each row. [5] X Research source Use a space that’s about 37 cm × 87 cm (15 in × 34 in), like on a large table or on the floor. A player’s 3 rows are considered their “territory.” The players' territories should be 3 centimetres (1.2 in) apart."

    {
      "title": "Have players sit or kneel behind their territory.",
      "content": "Have players sit or kneel behind their territory. It doesn’t matter which position the players choose as long as they aren't obstructing the field or distracting the other player. Players must keep their body behind their territory until the reader starts reading. Traditionally, players would sit on a tatami mat during the game, but they are not required for the game."

      "title": "Take 15 minutes to memorize the position of the grabbing cards.",
      "content": "Take 15 minutes to memorize the position of the grabbing cards. With the grabbing cards visible, give players a chance to look at and memorize the positions of all the grabbing cards. During the last 2 minutes, players can practice quickly swinging for the cards but should try to avoid touching them. [6] X Research source As a player, keep your eye on cards in your opponent’s territory too because you will have to reach for them."

      "title": "Have the reciter draw a reading card and read it out loud.",
      "content": "Have the reciter draw a reading card and read it out loud. The reciter chooses a card randomly from the deck and slowly reads it out loud to the players. When they’re finished reading the card, they discard it into a separate pile. [7] X Research source If you are using regular playing cards, just read the suit and rank of the card, such as “Ace of Spades.”"

      "title": "Have the other players race to touch the matching grabbing card first.",
      "content": "Have the other players race to touch the matching grabbing card first. Once the reciter starts reading what’s on their card, both players search for the grabbing card that has the matching image or last lines of the poem. When a player finds the card, they quickly try to be the first to touch it. [8] X Research source The player that touches the correct grabbing card first takes the card and places it face-down in a pile, to their left side if they are right handed, and vice versa. If you are using regular playing cards, find the playing card that matches the suit and rank of the reading card. The players can also win the card by pushing other cards from the same territory into it, indirectly pushing it out of the playing field. As long as the player causes the card to leave the playing field, or the player touches the card directly, they win it. If the player won the card from their opponent's territory, they can choose any card from their territory and send it to their opponent, who will move it into their arrangement."

      "title": "Continue reading and picking up the remaining cards.",
      "content": "Continue reading and picking up the remaining cards. After the first card, the reciter chooses a new reading card to start the next round. Players continue trying to find the matching grabbing card until one of the players gets rid of all their cards. [9] X Research source If the reading card doesn’t have a matching grabbing card in play, then the players must wait for the reciter to read the next card."

      "title": "Understand how fouls work.",
      "content": "Understand how fouls work. If the reading card's matching grabbing card is in your opponent's territory and you touch cards in your own territory, you have committed a foul. Likewise, if the reading card's matching card is in your territory and you touch any cards in your opponent's territory, this is a foul. If you commit a foul, your opponent can send you a card of their choice. If you and your opponent both commit a foul, no cards are sent. If you touch the wrong card, but all the cards you touch are from the same territory as the correct card, it is not a foul. If the correct card is in your territory and your opponent wins it, but you touch a card in their territory committing a foul, they get to send you two cards: one for the foul, and one for winning a card from your territory. If the reading card doesn't have a matching grabbing card in play and you touch any card, this is a foul. If you touch cards in both your territory and your opponent's territory, it's a double foul and your opponent can send you two cards (as long as they didn't also commit any fouls)."
