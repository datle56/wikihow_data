      "content": "You'll capture his curiosity if he keeps seeing you around. This doesn't mean you should stalk him, but if you know he likes to go to the café across the street from campus before his afternoon class, make it a point to go there around the same time. When he sees you, make eye contact and acknowledge him. He'll definitely remember you next time you cross paths.

I sit two rows behind you.\""

Bounce ideas off of him, then hit the hardware store together for supplies. Many Virgos are known for their craftsmanship, but be careful—if your Virgo guy has skills and experience, he'll tend to want to control every aspect of the project and micro-manage every detail. If you know he knows way more about it than you do, though, you might be just fine with that. You might also go to a hardware or craft store and see what catches your eye that the two of you could build something with. You'll end up creating something that's yours alone.

[18] X Research source For example, you might say, \"Thanks so much for helping me build that bookcase. I never could've gotten those shelves to sit right without you!\" On the other hand, Virgos are often suspicious of straight compliments, so keep those at a minimum. Compliment him for something he does , rather than how he looks."

      "content": "Because Virgo is a mutable sign, he might change things a lot. Scorpio is a fixed sign, which means you're usually more comfortable in a routine. You like to make a plan and stick to it—you only change course if something happens to make your original plan impossible. Not so with Virgo—he's typically more of a \"go with the flow\" type. Your relationship will go more smoothly if you show that you're willing to accept small changes that don't make much of a difference. [19] X Research source Be ready for him to bring something up at the last minute—if you can keep your plans a little loose, you can accommodate his 11th-hour changes without it derailing your day. For example, you might be headed to a park for a picnic when he sees a shop that he wants to stop and check out. If you have your food packed in coolers, it won't go bad while you browse for a few minutes."

It's not that he thinks your feelings aren't important—he just thinks logic and reason are more reliable. [20] X Research source If you have a problem, it's usually better to hash it out with a more intuitive friend first. Once you've gotten to the root of the problem, you can go to your Virgo guy for advice and he'll have some ideas for you."
