      "content": "Top off the containers with water. Use as little water as possible - just enough to cover the parsley so you can make ice cubes. If you would prefer frozen parsley that has a stronger flavor when thawed, opt for olive oil (or another neutral flavor cooking oil) instead of water. While this means you'll add both oil and parsley to whatever dish you end up using it for, the parsley cube will melt into your dish faster when added directly, thereby reducing the risk that some parsley leaves will overcook while others are still frozen.

Making pesto is a great way to preserve the bright flavor of parsley in the form of a convenient sauce that can be used to top pasta, salad, meat, or fish. To make pesto, do the following: [7] X Research source Wash and chop 2 cups of parsley. Blend 1 cup walnuts or cashews, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 3 cloves garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor. Add 1/2 cup olive oil while the processor is running.
