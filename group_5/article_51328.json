      "content": "Establish a budget. Knowing how much you're willing to spend on an iPhone will narrow your options from the beginning. For example: setting your budget at $600 will eliminate the option of purchasing the pricey iPhone 7 Plus at retail price from your options. If you intend to buy a phone on using Apple's payment plan , you'll want to set a monthly spending budget instead of a total spending budget. To do this, add $129 (the cost of Apple Care) to your phone's full price and divide the total by 24 (the number of months in a two-year plan)."

      "content": "Decide on the type of phone you'd like. As of January 2017, you can purchase a brand-new iPhone SE, iPhone 6S/6S Plus, and iPhone 7/7 Plus directly from the Apple store. You can even compare their specifications in order to get a general idea of the phone that offers the best fit for you. Apple also sells new versions of older phones, such as the iPhone 5/5S and the iPhone 6/6 Plus, through third-party retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. Some phones, such as the iPhone 4, are too old to support the newer versions of iOS (for example, the iPhone 4 only supports up to iOS 7.1.2)."

      "title": "Understand the difference between \"unlocked\" and \"no-contract\" phones.",
      "content": "Understand the difference between \"unlocked\" and \"no-contract\" phones. When a phone is \"locked\", it means you can't use it with another carrier's network without your current carrier's permission. Purchasing a phone with a carrier affiliation doesn't mean you're purchasing a contract, however, and purchasing an unlocked phone doesn't guarantee a better deal: [1] X Research source An unlocked phone has no affiliation with a carrier, meaning you can change carriers as you go. This is beneficial if you move frequently, travel internationally, or simply like knowing that your phone is 100 percent yours, but it can be more expensive than a no-contract phone. A no-contract phone is locked to a specific carrier (e.g., AT&T), but--as suggested by the name--there is no contract for use. This means that you pay only for the data that you use on a monthly basis. Depending on the carrier you choose for a no-contract phone, your pay-as-you-go rate and terms will vary. You can unlock a carrier-locked phone if you meet your carrier's unlocking criteria. Usually, you have to have paid off a certain amount of your phone's contract, and you'll probably have to pay a fee on top of that."

      "content": "Consider purchasing a pre-owned phone. Some sites, such as Best Buy, sell \"certified pre-owned\" devices in both carrier-locked and unlocked formats. These are typically cheaper than retail prices for brand-new models, though you may have to settle for an older model of phone than you initially wanted."

      "title": "Decide on a carrier.",
      "content": "Decide on a carrier. Unless you decide to get a SIM-unlocked phone, you'll need to buy a phone licensed by AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon. Purchasing a carrier-licensed phone does not enroll you in a contract--it simply determines the cellular network you'll be using. Consider the popular coverage in your area. If you live in an AT&T hotspot, you might want to opt for an AT&T phone. If you travel a lot, you may want to use a Verizon phone due to optimal coverage. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Review the different cellular frequencies.",
      "content": "Review the different cellular frequencies. Your iPhone will use one of two cellular data frequencies: CDMA or GSM. Verizon and Sprint phones use CDMA, while AT&T and T-Mobile phones use GSM. Even if you're buying an unlocked iPhone, there are several things to consider since you'll eventually use one network or the other: [3] X Research source Whether or not you travel internationally . GSM offers better international coverage than CDMA. GSM phones also permit you to switch out your device's physical SIM card, meaning you can switch carriers as quickly as you can swap SIM cards if your phone is unlocked. [4] X Research source Your preferred carrier . If you have a carrier preference to which you're sticking, you'll have to settle for that carrier's cellular frequency. Whether or not you use other networks . You can buy unlocked versions of carrier-licensed phones (e.g., a Verizon phone), but you'll only be able to use that phone with another phone using the same cellular frequency (in Verizon's case--CDMA--the only additional network you could use is Sprint). Also note that GSM is more widely-used throughout the world than is CDMA. [5] X Research source"
