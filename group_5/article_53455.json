      "content": "Swim your usual backstroke. This part is crucial as you will be counting strokes. Since you are on your back, you will not be able to see if you are near the wall or not. If there are not flags hanging above your head, turn your head to a lane line and look for the last color block, that is were the flags would be. Swim backstroke from a few yards past the flags to pick up speed, and count your strokes as soon as your eyes pass the flags. This is how many strokes to a finish, subtract one for strokes for a turn."
