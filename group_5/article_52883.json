      "title": "Clean the infected area at least 3 times a day.",
      "content": "Clean the infected area at least 3 times a day. Wash your hands gently, then soak the infected area in warm water with an antibacterial soap or plain warm water. You can also use a solution of 1 US qt (0.95 L) of water mixed with 2 teaspoons (10 g) of table salt to remove any pus and loose scabs from the wound. Let the infection soak for at least 10 to 20 minutes each time. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source After you've finished soaking the area, carefully and gently pat it dry. If you have a cut or open wound that needs to be covered with a bandage, allow the infected area to dry thoroughly before you put the bandage on."

      "title": "Apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound after you finish cleaning it.",
      "content": "Apply an antibiotic ointment to the wound after you finish cleaning it. This will help to treat the infected finger while also protecting it and promoting healing. Apply a thin layer over the infected area of your finger. [3] X Research source If the ointment causes your skin to break out in a rash, wash it off immediately and stop using it. This is uncommon, but it’s important to check."

      "title": "Bandage open cuts or wounds to prevent bacteria from entering.",
      "content": "Bandage open cuts or wounds to prevent bacteria from entering. You typically don't want to bandage an infection for the sake of exposing it to plenty of oxygen and keeping it dry. However, if you still have a cut or an open wound, cover it with a clean, dry bandage. This will keep it clean so the infection doesn't worsen or spread. [4] X Research source Make sure the area is completely dry before you apply the bandage. If you're using an adhesive bandage, the bandage part should entirely cover the wound so that you're not getting any of the adhesive on broken skin."

      "title": "Immobilize your finger with a splint if a joint is affected.",
      "content": "Immobilize your finger with a splint if a joint is affected. If you have any swelling or redness around any of the joints of your fingers, put on a padded splint to keep your joint from moving. This will help the infection heal more quickly and keep it from spreading. [5] X Research source You can buy finger splints at pharmacies and discount stores without a prescription. Make sure you get the right size for your finger. Don't put it on so tight that it cuts off the circulation in your finger."

      "title": "Try over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic ointments.",
      "content": "Try over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic ointments. You can get OTC antibiotic ointments at any pharmacy or discount store without a prescription. After washing your hands, apply the ointment gently so that it covers the infected area and the skin immediately surrounding it. [6] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If you're applying the ointment to someone else, make sure your hands are clean or wear gloves when you apply it. If you need to bandage the area, allow the ointment to dry before you apply the bandage."

      "title": "Drain the pus gently if necessary.",
      "content": "Drain the pus gently if necessary. Often an infection will build up a small bubble or blister of pus. This pus typically will start to drain on its own as the infection starts to clear. If you see the area oozing pus, gently press around the area to assist in draining the pus. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Wear rubber gloves any time you're touching infected skin and be gentle. Be careful not to break the skin, which could spread the infection. Wash the infected area gently after draining the pus, then pat dry and cover the open wound. Do not puncture the skin any further to release the pus. See your doctor if you feel the infected area needs to be drained."

      "title": "Call your doctor immediately if you develop a fever.",
      "content": "Call your doctor immediately if you develop a fever. A fever may be a sign that the infection has spread to your bloodstream, where it can cause serious problems. If you have even the slightest fever or start to feel sick or queasy, call your doctor right away. Typically the infection can be treated with oral antibiotics. However, these need to be started as soon as possible to be effective. If you have a fever and delay seeking medical treatment, the infection may require more serious intervention that necessitates a hospital stay."

      "content": "Monitor the infected area to see if it spreads or worsens. As you treat the infection, make sure the infected area doesn't get any larger. If the swelling increases or the skin grows redder or changes color, have a doctor look at it as soon as possible. [8] X Research source If the infection is near your nail, monitor the nail for changes in color or thickness. If the nail grows discolored or thickens, this may indicate that the nail is also infected. A doctor will be able to further assess the condition and determine whether the nail needs to be removed."

      "content": "Wait 4 to 5 days to see if the infection goes away. If you keep the area clean and use OTC antibiotic ointment, the infection should go away within a few days. However, if it doesn't seem to be getting any better after 4 or 5 days, seek medical treatment even if you haven't noticed any other symptoms. [9] X Research source If the infection seems to be getting worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms you didn't experience before, have a doctor look at it."

If you have a puncture wound from glass, a nail, or another piece of metal, particularly rusty metal, get a tetanus shot as soon as possible to prevent an infection from developing.

      "content": "Trim your fingernails with clippers after showering. After a shower, your nails are at their softest. This is the best time to trim them. Use sterile clippers and avoid cutting them too short. Never trim your cuticles, which can leave your nail beds open to bacteria, leading to an infection. [12] X Research source Never bite your nails or cuticles, or pick at your cuticles with your fingers. This introduces bacteria to the area, which can result in infection."

      "content": "Wear rubber gloves when washing dishes, gardening, or doing chores. Exposing your hands to continual moisture can weaken and damage your skin, allowing for the introduction of bacteria. Moist conditions allow bacteria to grow and increase the risk of infection. Wear rubber gloves that are lined with cotton to help keep your hands dry and clean. [13] X Research source Wear rubber gloves any time there's a risk your hands might come into contact with chemicals, such as if you're cleaning the kitchen or bathroom."

Wash the area gently with warm water and anti-bacterial soap, then pat it dry. Apply a sterile bandage that completely covers the wounded area. [16] X Research source For deeper cuts, it may be necessary to irrigate. Run warm water gently into and over the wound to clean it out. If you notice any debris in the wound, you may want to get a tetanus shot just to be on the safe side. Change the dressing on cuts at least once every 24 hours, or whenever you wash the area."
