      "content": "Yes, honey, lemon, and herbs can help mask the salty taste. Some people have a hard time gargling salt water simply because they don't like the intense salty taste in the back of their throat. Experiment with other flavors to help blunt the taste of plain salt water. [4] X Expert Source Andrea Rudominer, MD, MPH Board Certified Pediatrician & Board Certified Integrative Medicine Doctor Expert Interview. 13 April 2020. Honey has natural antibacterial properties that work along with the salt water to soothe a sore throat. Just squirt about 2 tablespoons (about 30 mL) of honey into an 8-ounce (about 236 mL) glass, add salt and water, then stir. The honey will mix better with warmer water. [5] X Research source You might also try a little lemon juice. Lemons have lots of vitamin C and also work to break up mucus and provide pain relief. Remember that lemon juice is strong, so a little goes a long way—a couple of drops is all you need. [6] X Research source Clove, chamomile, and peppermint are herbs that help mask the taste of salt water as well as soothing a sore throat. Steep a teabag in your salt water for 2-3 minutes before gargling. If you can't handle gargling, you might also try herbal teas with these ingredients for relief. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Take a mouthful of salt water and tilt your head back. Lean back to about a 45-degree angle so the salt water runs down into your throat—but don't swallow! Instead, exhale through your throat, producing bubbles in the salt water. Gargle for 30 seconds, then swish and spit. If you aren't used to gargling, you might not be able to do it this long at first, but don't worry! Try gargling for 10-15 seconds at first, then spit and do it again. After a few tries, you'll get the hang of it."

      "content": "Gargle as often as once an hour or as needed to relieve pain. [8] X Research source Gargling with salt water is totally safe (as long as you aren't swallowing it—that can cause dehydration), so feel free to do it as often as you like! At the same time, if you feel like you need to gargle every few minutes, you might want to find a more efficient remedy. Make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids in the meantime to keep yourself well hydrated. The temperature doesn't matter, so drink warm or cool fluids, whichever feels better and is easier to swallow."

      "content": "No, gargling with salt water doesn't prevent viral infection. While gargling will help soothe a sore throat, it won't do anything to \"wash away\" a virus or stop infection. This claim is frequently spread on social media following the outbreak of new respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. There was one study in 2010 that showed gargling with salt water might prevent respiratory tract infections in some circumstances. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bottom line? Gargling with salt water is safe and inexpensive, so using it as a preventive measure won't hurt—but don't rely on it exclusively or instead of taking other common-sense precautions, such as wearing a face mask and observing social distance."
