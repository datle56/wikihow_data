      "title": "Tall flowers can stick out of the vase and look a bit off.",
      "content": "Tall flowers can stick out of the vase and look a bit off. Use scissors to trim your flowers and greenery until they just stick out of the top of the vase. This will ensure they don’t topple over, too! [1] X Research source Try to cut your flowers at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area so they can take in more water. If you cut your flowers a little too short, that’s okay. You can disguise the short ones by putting them in with the taller ones."

      "content": "Smaller vases can look overdone with a huge bouquet. You could fill it with water and simply add 1 bright flower or succulent to the center for a delicate, understated centerpiece. [2] X Research source Try using a bright flower, like a dahlia or an azalea, to draw attention to your vase. If you’re going to use a succulent, add potting soil instead of water to your vase."

      "content": "Larger, heavier flowers might flop down to the side anyway. You can use this to your advantage by putting the bigger flowers on the bottom. Lilies, dandelions, and peonies all create a nice base layer around your square vase. [3] X Research source This works well if you have a larger square vase. For a smaller one, you could stick to daintier flowers. Adding flowers to the corners of the vase helps to fill it out and make your bouquet look robust.

      "title": "Use tall, long-stemmed flowers to add contrast to your bouquet.",
      "content": "Use tall, long-stemmed flowers to add contrast to your bouquet. If you’re using roses, irises, or any flower with a stiff stem, cut it so it’s about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) taller than the ones around it. Then, stick it in the center of your vase. [5] X Research source This is a great method for centerpieces since it gives them a little depth."

      "title": "If you’re working with 2 to 3 flower types, spread them out.",
      "content": "If you’re working with 2 to 3 flower types, spread them out. [6] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. As you add your flowers in, try to put them on all 4 sides of the vase evenly so it looks beautiful from every direction. [7] X Research source Square vases are meant to be viewed from all 4 sides, especially if they’re centerpieces. Since square vases are usually shorter than typical vases, you’ll probably be able to see the whole bouquet at once."

      "title": "Use a variety of flower colors and types to make your bouquet pop.",
      "content": "Use a variety of flower colors and types to make your bouquet pop. Try using white flowers as a base, like baby’s breath, lilies, or orchids, then adding in pops of color with roses, magnolias, forget-me-nots, or foxgloves. [8] X Research source Feel free to mix and match with flower size, too. You could arrange some smaller flowers on top of larger ones for a fun pop of color and texture. [9] X Expert Source Rachel Cho Floral Designer & Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021. Don’t be afraid to add in a little greenery, too!"

      "title": "Large, heavy flowers may need a little help staying upright.",
      "content": "Large, heavy flowers may need a little help staying upright. Use 6 to 8 pieces of floral tape in a grid pattern on the top of your vase to make 1 in (2.5 cm) openings. Slide 1 to 2 flowers into each square to keep it pointing upright instead of falling to the side of the vase. [10] X Research source If you don’t have floral tape, you can use duct tape instead. Just make sure the outside of your vase is really dry before you add the tape. Floral tape is optional, and you don’t necessarily need it for bouquets with smaller, daintier flowers."

      "content": "Use sprigs of myrtle, ivy, or fern as a base layer for your flowers. Add these greenery pieces around the edge of your square vase to droop down over the sides. [11] X Research source Adding greenery really helps make your flowers pop. Greenery is optional, but it’s a great way to accentuate bright, bold flowers."

      "title": "Disguise clear vases with a large, green leaf.",
      "content": "Disguise clear vases with a large, green leaf. Pick out a leaf that’s about as wide as your vase. Slide it in widthwise to cover the inside of the vase and hide any flower stems inside. You don’t have to add a leaf to your arrangement, but it’s a fun way to spice up your bouquet with a little greenery. [12] X Research source Banana leaves and palm leaves are perfect for this! You may have to wrap the leaf over itself a few times to get it to fit, which is fine."

      "content": "Tiny square vases might be too small for flowers with long stems. Instead, fill them with a layer of potting soil and decorative pebbles for a cute, colorful display that you can put succulents or flowers on top of. [13] X Research source You can plant live succulents straight into the potting soil, or you can perch fake succulents on top of the decorative stones. If you’re using flowers, trim the stems and push them straight into the dirt for an easy display."
