Companies like CheckPeople make money by harvesting your personal information and charging people to access it. While you can delete yourself from these types of websites, there's no way to remove your information from the public records they used to gather your information. However, there are a few simple ways to maintain your privacy and make it harder for people to find your address, phone number, and other data: When registering a domain name , make your registration record private. Rent a private mailbox or PO Box and use it as your mailing address. Search for your name and city on Google often. If you find your info on a people finder site, look for an \"opt out\" or \"remove me\" link at the bottom of its homepage and submit a request."
