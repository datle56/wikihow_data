Expect to go in for a touch-up in 6-12 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows. Relaxing treatments can cost $45-$100."

      "content": "Use a deep conditioner and steam to straighten your hair. First, apply a deep conditioning mask to your hair, focusing especially on the ends. Turn your shower on as hot as you can get it, then pin your hair up so the ends of your hair are exposed. Sit as close to the steam as you can without touching the hot water and relax for 20-30 minutes. When you’re done with the steam treatment, adjust the shower to a comfortable level, then rinse the conditioner out of your hair. This is a great method to help restore moisture to your hair after a professional straightening treatment. The reason this is so good for your hair is because the steam opens the cuticles on your hair, allowing the conditioner to penetrate the strands."
