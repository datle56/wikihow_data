      "content": "The average tip for valet service is between $2 and $5 at most venues. There’s no strict rule about this, but like any service provided to you, a tip of at least a few dollars is seen as a common courtesy when a valet attendant does a good job. If the attendant is polite and professional, treats your vehicle with care and respect, and opens the door for you, consider tipping closer to $5 (or more for exceptional service). [1] X Research source For exceptional service like retrieving your car quickly, handling your car in bad weather, or maintaining a professional demeanor during a very busy time, consider tipping $10. If you’re parking in very upscale areas and venues, like resorts or luxury hotels, consider tipping 10-15% of the total cost of service (or as much as 20% or more for special services like assisting you with your luggage)."

      "title": "Tip the valet attendant every time you pick up your car.",
      "content": "Tip the valet attendant every time you pick up your car. It’s most common to tip them as you’re leaving since the attendant is bringing your car back to you in a timely manner. If you're staying at a hotel or resort for multiple nights and are driving in and out, tip each time you pick up your vehicle (rather than tipping once at the end of your stay) since you’ll likely have different attendants each time who deserve a token of appreciation. [2] X Research source Some people tip the attendant when they drop off their car as well. This is less common, but can incentivize the attendant to park closer for a speedier pickup or take extra special caution with expensive, luxury vehicles."

      "title": "Yes, a tip is generally expected even when the service is complimentary.",
      "content": "Yes, a tip is generally expected even when the service is complimentary. Etiquette experts suggest tipping the average rate ($2 to $5) even when parking is free. The valet attendant is still providing you a service and safely parking your car (which is probably one of the most expensive things you own!). [3] X Research source For private events with complimentary value, the host or organizers may tip out the valet at the end of the evening. If so, they’ll usually communicate that you don’t have to tip ahead of time. If you’re unsure, have some cash on hand just in case."

      "content": "Tidy up your car a bit beforehand. You don’t need to drive through a carwash or meticulously vacuum the interior of your car, but pick up any trash that might be on the floor or seats and put away any tangly phone charges, aux cords, or other items you keep in the car in the glove compartment or console. A quick cleanup is a courtesy to your valet attendant (and can save you some embarrassment from having a messy car). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure you have cash on hand before you leave for your event.",
      "content": "Make sure you have cash on hand before you leave for your event. Get cash from an ATM or grab a few dollars from your secret stash so you have money to tip with. Valet attendants typically don’t have card readers on hand, so you won’t be able to tip with a credit card. [5] X Research source If you’re staying at a hotel, the valet service will probably be charged to your room. However, still grab cash to tip your individual attendants."

      "content": "Follow the attendant’s directions when you pull up to the drop-off. When you’re using a valet service , stay alert and follow their directions to drop your car off in the loading zone. Valets typically have a tight system in place for getting drivers in and out quickly, so keep your eyes and ears open for instructions on where to go. [6] X Research source Valet drop-offs are frequently crowded, fast-paced environments, and a slow drop-off could back up traffic into the street (especially in tight, urban areas near a busy road)."

      "content": "Take what you need from the car and stash anything you’re leaving. Grab your phone, wallet, purse, jacket, and any other items you’ll need for your event or stay. If there’s anything valuable you’re leaving, like a laptop or musical instruments, place them under seats or in the glove compartment so they won’t be visible and tempting to steal. [7] X Research source Valets do a good job of keeping an eye on your vehicle when you’re away, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible for someone to steal something out of your car. Make sure anything you definitely want to keep is hidden or taken with you."

      "content": "Park your car and keep the engine running. Put the car in park and leave the keys in the ignition for the valet attendant. Taking the keys out or turning off the car will only slow the valet down and potentially cause a backup behind you. [8] X Research source If you want to incentivize the attendant to take extra special care of your car, like parking it nearby, leave a tip at this point. Otherwise, wait to tip until you pick up your car later. Depending on how nice of a venue it is, the valet may open the car door for you (especially if you’re a woman). If you’re a man driving with a female passenger, the valet will likely open the door for her to exit first. Generally, the male driver will exit on his own at the same time."

      "content": "Tell the attendant about any special quirks about your vehicle. For instance, mention if the car may take more than one attempt to start or if there’s a mirror that won’t adjust (the valet will likely move your seat and mirrors slightly so they can drive safely). Also mention anything special about your pickup, like if you’re only going to be at the event for an hour and will pick up the car relatively soon. [9] X Research source Letting the valet know these things helps them operate your car safely and make your pickup process easier and faster."

      "content": "Hold on to the claim ticket you’re given. In most cases, the attendant will give you a ticket with a code or number on it. Don’t lose this! You’ll need this to prove ownership of the car when you pick it up on your way out. [10] X Research source If you do misplace your ticket, speak to the head valet director as you leave. You’ll likely need to provide your license plate number, the make and model of the car, and a photo ID to claim your car. Your pickup will take longer and be more complicated, so consider tipping a bit extra for the trouble."

It might take a valet as long as 10-20 minutes to fetch your car and bring it back to you, so this can save you some wait time. [11] X Research source If you’re at a restaurant or other venue, you might be able to ask the valet director in person to start grabbing your car in advance. They’re usually stationed near the entrance to the venue. If you can’t call ahead, wait patiently while the valet fetches your car, especially if it’s a busy day and there are people in front of you waiting."

[12] X Research source Hand them your ticket and let them know you’re ready to pick up your car. If the valet service wasn’t complimentary, then pay for the service at this time (typically in cash). Valet service usually costs a flat fee of about $10 to $20. [13] X Research source Depending on the service and location, the rate may be higher depending on how many hours you’re leaving your car or if you’re parking overnight. The exact cost of valet parking depends on the venue, event, and location of the service (for example, a swanky hotel in New York City or Chicago will cost more than a restaurant in a suburban area or smaller city)."

[17] X Research source However, many make less than this and rely on tips to bring home a livable wage at the end of the night. A few tip dollars may not seem like a huge deal, but that small token of your gratitude makes a difference when it’s time to pay rent."
