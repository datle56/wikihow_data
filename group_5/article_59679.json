Just don’t forget the accented á at the end—in Spanish, “papa” (also pronounced pah-pah) means “potato.” [1] X Research source When talking to your father, make sure to put an extra emphasis on the second “pah” of “papá.” [2] X Research source Example: “¡Hola, Papá!” (oh-laa pah-PAH) means “Hello, Dad!” In Puerto Rico, “papá” is a slang word for “man” or “dude.” In Chile, “papa” (without the accented á ) can be a slang word for a baby’s bottle or a hole in a sock."
