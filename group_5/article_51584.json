It should also keep the puppies warm and protect them from being squashed if their mother lies on them. [1] X Research source The Book of the Bitch. Evans &amp; Kay. Publisher: Henston The box should have 4 sides and a base. Choose a length and width that allows the mother to lie down with her head and legs extended. Add half her height again to the width of the box, which will be used to create a space for the puppies. Make sure the sides are tall enough that puppies will stay in but the mother can jump out without difficulty. You can buy a whelping box at most pet stores. You can also use a cardboard box, or you can make a box out of hardboard or plywood. Acquire 2 large, stiff boxes, such as television or appliance boxes. Cut one end out of each box and push them together to make one longer box."

Evans &amp; Kay. Publisher: Henston An alternative to a heat mat is a heat lamp, angled towards one corner of the box to provide a warm spot. However, a heat lamp provides dry heat, which can dry out the puppy’s skin. If you have to use a lamp, be sure to check the puppies regularly for flaky or red skin. Remove the lamp if this happens.
