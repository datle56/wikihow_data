However, they’re also very sociable and charismatic, and love being the center of attention. While most deities in the Egyptian zodiac are benevolent or flexible in their morality, Seth embodies the malevolent and disordered aspects of life. This sign’s constant quest for perfection and change can backfire on them and their loved ones if they’re not careful. Seth signs have the most in common with the Western zodiac sign Gemini.

      "title": "The Egyptian zodiac has 12 signs named after deities (except The Nile).",
      "content": "The Egyptian zodiac has 12 signs named after deities (except The Nile). The Egyptians assigned their own gods and goddesses to the Greek zodiac system sometime after the invasion of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE. Before that, the Egyptians measured the movements of the stars and planets to predict their effects on the Earth and seasons. They considered astronomy to be a divine skill, but hadn’t really applied the placement of the stars to human characteristics until the Ptolemaic Period (304–30 BCE). [3] X Research source Astrology was very popular during this time. Egyptians decorated their tombs with zodiac signs and included horoscopes on pottery. Some temples even have zodiacs painted on their ceilings, which is significant since typical Egyptian temples rarely showed any foreign or outside influences. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "People inherited traits from the deity whose sign they were born under. Rather than the stars and planets influencing a person’s character themselves, the Egyptians believed someone’s personality resembled that of the god or goddess they were born under. For example, those born under Seth were believed to be inherently chaotic and driven like him, while those born under Isis were considered naturally nurturing or caring."

      "title": "Each sign covers up to 30 days a year, but the days aren't consecutive.",
      "content": "Each sign covers up to 30 days a year, but the days aren't consecutive. Unlike Western zodiac signs, which reign supreme for about a month at a time, Egyptian zodiac signs recur 2 to 3 times throughout the year. This is because of how the Egyptians measured time—each Egyptian month was 30 days long and split into three 10-day periods each called decans. This results in 36 annual decans, each represented by one of 36 asterisms (small groups of constellations and stars) that rose over the Egyptian horizon every 24 hours. [5] X Research source Each zodiac sign may cover several decans or other groupings of days, but they are not necessarily consecutive on the calendar. The decan system only accounted for 360 days of the year, so the remaining 5 days were considered a special month for festivals and celebrations. The Egyptians were also the first to adopt a 24-hour day."
