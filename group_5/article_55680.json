      "title": "Option 1: Pinch the stem with your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger.",
      "content": "Option 1: Pinch the stem with your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger. Use your thumb and forefinger to grip the stem about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the base of the glass. Let the rest of your fingers settle comfortably along the lower half of the stem, with your middle finger sitting on the stem just above the base. [1] X Research source Only your thumb, index, and middle fingers should come into direct contact with the stem of the glass. Your remaining two fingers should naturally rest on top of the base. This is the standard way to hold a wine glass. Holding it in this manner should provide plenty of stability while keeping your hands away from the bowl of the glass."

      "title": "Option 2: Pinch the base of the stem with your thumb and forefinger.",
      "content": "Option 2: Pinch the base of the stem with your thumb and forefinger. Wrap your index finger around one side of the stem’s base, then support the other side of the stem with the tip of your thumb. Curl your remaining three fingers into your palm in the form of a loose fist. [2] X Research source Generally, your remaining fingers shouldn’t touch the base of the glass, but it's fine if they brush against it slightly. If necessary, use your middle finger to support the glass from beneath by extending it outward along the underside of the base."

      "title": "Option 3: Grip the middle of the stem with your index finger and thumb.",
      "content": "Option 3: Grip the middle of the stem with your index finger and thumb. Clutch the stem of your wine glass as if you were gripping a mug by its handle. Wrap your index finger completely around the midpoint of the stem and use your thumb as a support. Curl up the rest of your fingers into a fist around the stem. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Option 4: Lever the base of the glass between your thumb and fist.",
      "content": "Option 4: Lever the base of the glass between your thumb and fist. Keep your thumb on top of the base while supporting the underside with your index and middle fingers. Curl your index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers into your palm as you use the top portions of your index and middle fingers to support the base. [4] X Research source None of your fingers actually touch the stem of the glass when using this technique. Note that this holding style is socially acceptable, but it's also the least stable. It's best to practice it when you're by yourself before using it in polite company."

      "content": "Grab a stemless wine glass toward the base of the bowl. Grasp the base of the glass between your thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Let your remaining fingers rest on the bottom side of the glass. [5] X Research source Avoid touching the middle or top of the wine glass and minimize contact as much as possible—try holding the glass only when taking sips and setting it down when you’re not actively drinking. [6] X Research source You can wrap your thumb and all four fingers around the glass if you need to do so for the sake of stability. If you're hanging around wine connoisseurs or trying to make a good impression on someone new, it's best to put the stemless glasses away and opt for the traditional glass type instead."

      "title": "Handling your wine glass properly improves the taste and look of your wine.",
      "content": "Handling your wine glass properly improves the taste and look of your wine. Using a proper hold avoids “any heat or anything else beginning to change the wine as you’re drinking [it],” says Perng. [7] X Expert Source Murphy Perng Certified Wine Consultant Expert Interview. 31 January 2023. When any wine warms up—but especially a white wine or champagne that’s meant to be chilled—the raised temperature will affect the taste and make it more difficult to detect the wine’s intended flavor profile and characteristics. Plus, holding a wine glass properly allows you to swirl your wine properly, which aerates the beverage and enhances the flavor. Following the proper technique for holding a wine glass also keeps the bowl clean of greasy or oily fingerprints. Not only will this allow drinkers to appreciate the true color and clarity of the wine, but it also avoids any unsightly or unhygienic smudges. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Serve whites and rosés chilled and reds at just below room temperature. Refrigerate a white or rosé bottle of wine for a few hours before opening, then serve it within 10-15 minutes of removal from the fridge. [9] X Research source Red wines are best stored in a slightly cool or dark room and can be served immediately. [10] X Research source Serve sparkling and semi-sparkling wines at 40-45 ºF (5-10 ºC). [11] X Research source Chill the bottle for 30 minutes in ice water or for up to 3 hours in the refrigerator. Serve dessert wine between 45-55 ºF (7-13 ºC). Chill the bottle in the fridge for an hour or in the freezer for 20 minutes before serving, or until the bottle is cool to the touch but not icy."

      "content": "Rest the glass when needed. If you are unable to set your glass down and feel the need to support it in between sips, rest the base of the glass on the palm of your non-dominant hand while continuing to hold the glass by its stem with your dominant hand. When you need to set the glass down at your dinner table, place it to the right of your water glass. If you don't have a water glass, place your wine glass in the upper right corner of your place setting where the water glass usually sits. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Sip from the same spot every time.",
      "content": "Sip from the same spot every time. Try to drink from only one spot along the rim of the wine glass. [13] X Research source Doing so can improve the scent and appearance of your wine. If you sip from too many different places along the rim of the glass, the excess contact can actually taint the scent of the wine. Since scent and taste are closely linked, this could also degrade the taste of the wine. Additionally, your lips leave a print on the glass like your fingers do, even if you aren't wearing lipstick, balm, or gloss. Sipping from only one spot makes the top of your glass look cleaner."

      "title": "Keep the glass partially full.",
      "content": "Keep the glass partially full. As a general rule, keep your glass one-third full when drinking red wine and half full when drinking white wine. When drinking champagne or sparkling wine from a champagne flute, keep the glass three-quarters full. [14] X Research source By only filling part of the glass, you minimize the risk of accidental spills. Full-to-the-brim glasses can get heavy, and since you can only support the glass by its stem instead of the bowl, your hand may weaken and slip beneath the weight of the wine."

      "title": "Look into your glass as you drink.",
      "content": "Look into your glass as you drink. As you go to take a sip of your wine, direct your gaze into your glass instead of focusing on another person or object. Looking at someone else as you sip your wine is considered especially impolite, regardless of whether or not you're in active conversation with anyone. On the other hand, you should maintain eye contact with someone when making a toast. Lock eyes with whoever clinks glasses with you. Doing so is polite, and superstition holds that failing to do so can mean seven years of bad luck. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Examine the wine color while tilting your glass. If you want to study the appearance of the wine, tilt the glass slightly while holding it up to the light. [16] X Research source Use natural light when possible. If you aren't able to get a good view of the color and clarity, position your glass against a white or pale background to make the viewing process easier."

      "title": "Swirl your wine carefully before you drink.",
      "content": "Swirl your wine carefully before you drink. Keep a firm grip on the stem of the glass as you swirl it, and only continue swirling for 10 to 20 seconds. If you have a loose grip, move the glass too forcefully, or swirl the glass for too long, you run the risk of accidentally spilling your wine. [17] X Research source Swirling your wine is socially acceptable as long as you don't get carried away. The key is to gently swirl the glass in small circular movements while keeping the base on a flat surface. Swirling your wine allows it to “open up a little bit and get a little bit of air into that glass of wine,” explains Perng. [18] X Expert Source Murphy Perng Certified Wine Consultant Expert Interview. 31 January 2023. “The juicy, fruity aroma is able to be more apparent,” continues Perng, “and notes of petrol or gasoline are able to disseminate a little bit.” [19] X Expert Source Murphy Perng Certified Wine Consultant Expert Interview. 31 January 2023."

      "content": "Hold the glass directly to your nose when smelling. When checking the scent of a particular wine, tilt the glass slightly and place your nose directly inside. [20] X Research source Alternatively, hold your nose roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the top of the glass instead of sticking it directly inside. Some people are able to detect more of the scent by doing it this way, while others prefer the traditional technique. Either way is socially acceptable."
