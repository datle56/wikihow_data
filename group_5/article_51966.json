Resist the temptation to smile in the picture. You want to be able to figure out your face shape in its most natural position, and smiling might make it harder to tell. [1] X Research source If you're having trouble taking a self-portrait with your camera, see if it has a timer. Set the timer, then pose for your photo. Alternatively, ask someone to take your picture if your camera isn't conducive to taking self-portraits."

      "content": "Trace your face shape on a mirror alternatively. If you don't have a camera, stand in front of the mirror and use an old lipstick or a dry erase marker to trace the shape of your face. You should trace the entire shape of your face—around your chin and around your hairline. Look at this tracing while you determine your face shape."

      "content": "Determine the widest part of your face. If your forehead is the widest part of your face, then you likely have an oval face shape. You may have a round face shape if your cheeks are the widest part of your face. A wide jaw means that you have a square face shape. There’s still a chance, however, that you may have a heart-shaped face, so move on to checking your jaw. [2] X Research source"

If your face is longer than it is wide, this likely means that you have an oval, square, or heart-shaped face. If your face is as wide as it is long, you have a wide face shape.

      "content": "Get long, wavy layers to lengthen and contrast your features. Longer cuts look great with round faces because they tend to lengthen the features that are typically shortened. You can grow your hair out if it is already long, or if it is already long, ask for it to be cut into layers. For example, consider long wavy layers because they contrast round features.
