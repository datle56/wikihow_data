You can spot backhanded compliments by comparisons (“Your new haircut looks so much better than before!”) and qualifiers/unnecessary details (“You look great, for your age”).

[10] X Research source Take the compliment as genuine: “Oh, thanks!” Point out the insult. For instance, if they say, “You look so much better with dyed hair,” say “Ouch. I think I looked good before, too. But thanks!” Ask for clarification: “What do you mean by saying I’m ‘smart for a girl?’”"
