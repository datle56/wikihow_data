The oil can end up being too much for your hair if it isn’t especially thick."

      "content": "It will help lock in moisture but it's important to rinse it out thoroughly. Coconut oil does not moisturize on its own (no oil does—oil and water don’t mix). However, oils are occlusive, meaning that they lock in whatever is in your hair. When you moisturize or condition your hair, work a scoop or two of coconut oil into your hair. Then, wait at least 15 minutes before rinsing your hair thoroughly. Your hair will be super conditioned!

While this might not be a huge deal for you, it can make your scalp and skin oily or lock debris in your pores. Over time, this can cause you to break out. Overdoing it with the oil can also make your hair feel greasy, which can be unpleasant. [8] X Research source Using it a few times a week is probably okay, though. You can always just do this whenever you wash your hair in the shower if you only wash your hair a few times a week. You should be able to feel if you’re using too much. If you start getting pimples around your hairline, your skin feels greasy, or the texture of your hair feels kind of off, just cut back on how often you use coconut oil."
