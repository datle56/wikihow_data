      "content": "VSCO does not notify for screenshots. There are no circumstances in which VSCO will notify a user that their photo has been screenshotted. You can take a screenshot as you normally would, secure in the knowledge that a notification will not be sent. There is no way for a user to see who has screenshotted their photos, even with third-party tools that may claim to do so. This contrasts with an app like Snapchat, where both the native app and other tools make it possible to find out who has screenshotted a photo. Neither the VSCO app nor website sends a notification for screenshots."

      "content": "VSCO does not notify for screen records. The same rules apply across both screenshotting and screen recording. Always be mindful when screen capturing photos of another person. Do not share intimate or vulnerable photos without that person's permission, and NEVER repost another user's photos without their consent."

      "content": "Users cannot see who has viewed their VSCO. There is no way for a VSCO user to see who has viewed their profile. Additionally, viewers cannot see how many times their profile has been visited. VSCO aims to provide a photo editing and sharing experience in which the \"social media\" aspect is de-emphasized, so very little information about other users' activity is available. VSCO only sends notifications for follows, favorites, and reposts. [1] X Research source"
