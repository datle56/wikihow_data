If you’re dealing with stubborn moss or other tough stains, just pour 3/4 cup (180 ml) of bleach into a plastic bucket and add 1 gallon (4 l) of water. Then, saturate the stained areas with the bleach mixture. You can pour, spray, or sponge on the mixture—do whatever works best for you. [4] X Research source"
