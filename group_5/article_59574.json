      "content": "Make your towels look like they’re straight out of a hotel. Spread the towel flat on a table, then fold it in half widthwise (or hamburger style). Fold the towel in half one more time, going widthwise again, to make a long rectangle shape. Finally, grab one of the short ends of the towel and roll it tightly in on itself. [2] X Research source You’ll be left with a tightly rolled towel that will hold its shape no matter where you put it! This trick works best on bath and shower towels. It’s not so great for smaller hand towels or washcloths."

      "content": "This is a slightly more secure way to roll your towels. Fold your towel in half widthwise, then grab one of the corners and bring it across the towel to create a triangle. Flip the towel over and then fold the corners in thirds, creating an envelope shape with the towel. Flip the towel back over, then start rolling from the bottom flat edge. When you get to the top, tuck the pointed edge inside of the towel itself. [3] X Research source This is a great way to roll towels if you’re storing them for a long time or you won’t be stacking them on top of each other. They’ll stay tightly rolled no matter where you place them."

      "content": "Your linen closet just got a whole lot roomier. Once all your towels are rolled up, stack them in a pyramid shape on a shelf in the closet. When you need to grab one, just pull from the top of the stack and replenish it as it gets low. [4] X Research source This is a great way to make your shelves a little more beautiful (and a lot more organized)."

      "content": "Who says you can’t show off your towels? Hang up 2 or 3 wicker baskets on your bathroom wall and place your rolled towels in each one. Your guests will feel like they’re on a beach vacation! [5] X Research source If wicker doesn’t really match your style, try going for metal baskets instead."

      "content": "Make your bathroom feel like a luxury spa. Get a small table or cart with at least 2 shelves on it. Place your rolled towels on the bottom, then add candles, bath salts, flowers, and a loofah to the top. You’ll feel like a VIP every time you step out of the tub. [6] X Research source You can find carts or tables like this at most home goods stores."

Carefully slide a rolled towel into each slot for easy-to-access storage. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of counter space, try a free-standing wine rack instead."

      "content": "Maximize your space with a wicker storage space. Buy a large wicker basket and place your rolled towels in there, stuffing as many in as you can. Place the basket somewhere out of the way, like under the sink or beside the toilet. [8] X Research source Large baskets can usually hold up to 5 rolled towels at a time."

Place 2 diagonal dividers into each bin to create 4 separate slots in a diamond shape. Then, put a rolled towel into each slot. [9] X Research source You can leave the bins free standing or put them in your linen closet for easy storage."
