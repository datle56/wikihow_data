      "content": "Grindr does not notify of screenshots. You can safely take a screenshot or screen recording of someone's profile, photos, album, or chat without them knowing. More things you can do on Grindr without worrying about notifications: Grindr won't notify your contacts when you join. Grindr won't tell someone you've added them to your favorites. Grindr won't notify someone if you view an album they shared, though if they subscribe to Grindr Xtra or Unlimited and have read receipts enabled (and you're not Incognito), they can see that you've opened their message. Grindr won't notify someone that you've blocked them , although because they'll no longer be able to see your profile, they may be able to figure it out."

To opt out, just go to your Grindr settings, scroll down to \"Show Me,\" and toggle off \"Show Me In Viewed List.\" This will also disable your Viewed Me list and delete your Viewed Me history.
