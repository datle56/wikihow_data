      "content": "Pray thankfully and praise God and end your prayers positively. Overcome attitudes like unnecessarily emotional begging and pleading to God 'at bedtime' because - for example, this might cause upset sleep and bad thoughts can lead to bad dreams; be a peacemaker in your own mind. How? Believe that God already knows and wants for you what you need and rightly desire (not coveting or envying). Then give thanks in advance, expecting good results (that's trusting). There is, of course, a time and a place for that pained, pleading and begging. \"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling\", anytime you like, but bedtime is not always the best time. Though, happiness is not the goal rather ask for joy in whatever you experience for trying to stop anxious thoughts or bad dreams, ask the Lord to show you the root cause of these and take them to Him in meaningful prayers (personalized), believing. Colossians 4:2, \"Continue in prayer, and watch [for results] in the same with thanksgiving.\" Everyday thanksgiving can bring peace into your life.

Jesus said, \"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you\" (Matthew 6:5-6). Jesus also said, When you pray, do not keep on babbling like Pharisees, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him\" (Matthew 6:7-8). Pray with right motives, not self-serving. Let your thoughts be of good reasons, and when you pray, ask yourself whether it is going to bring glory to God or not (James 5:3)"
