      "content": "Conversation flows easily between Cancer and Virgo friends. These two signs form a sextile (a positive aspect due to the 60-degree distance between them), which means their energy tends to naturally take on a buddy vibe. While this could be a problem if they were trying to date each other romantically, it's not with two platonic friends. [3] X Research source Cancer: Work on being more open in conversations.

      "title": "Both Cancer and Virgo are pretty shy and can take a while to open up.",
      "content": "Both Cancer and Virgo are pretty shy and can take a while to open up.

Both signs need to feel that they can trust each other before they're willing to let the other in, but once their walls come down, their bond will only get stronger and stronger. Cancer: Show your reliability to your Virgo friend and they'll feel safer opening up to you. They just need to know that they can depend on you no matter what.

[4] X Research source Cancer: Try not to take what your Virgo friend says too personally. Remember that they only want the best for you and everything they're saying is coming from a place of love. Virgo: Have patience with your Cancer friend, who might not be as direct as you would like. Let them know that nothing they say will ever come between you and you're always open to feedback, even if it's negative."
