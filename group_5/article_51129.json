      "title": "Because they hate confrontation, Geminis usually prefer to be dumped.",
      "content": "Because they hate confrontation, Geminis usually prefer to be dumped. In fact, they’re known for their tendency to break up over the phone or just ghost. Don’t expect her to be the one to call it quits. She’s much more likely to try to drive you away so she doesn’t have to open up about her feelings. A Gemini will go to great lengths to avoid opening up about how she feels. She’d rather just distract herself until the feelings go away."

      "title": "Unlike other signs, she doesn’t need a long in-person conversation.",
      "content": "Unlike other signs, she doesn’t need a long in-person conversation. If she had her choice, she wouldn’t have to talk it out at all. Once your relationship is over, she just wants to move on to what’s next. If you haven’t been together long, you might just break up over the phone. If you’re dating long-distance, a well-written message or short phone call is definitely the way to go. There’s no need for an awkward video call. Reader Poll: We asked 949 wikiHow readers who've ended short-term relationships, and 64% of them agreed that the best way to break up is by text. [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Geminis are very intellectual and don’t want a dramatic breakup.",
      "content": "Geminis are very intellectual and don’t want a dramatic breakup. She’ll be super uncomfortable if you get emotional, so just stick to the facts. Tell her your relationship isn’t working out, and you want to break up. She’ll respect your honesty and directness. Say, “We’ve had a lot of fun together, but I’m not feeling a connection with you anymore. I think it’s best if we break up and go our separate ways.” You could also try, “You’re such a fun, exciting person, but I’m just not seeing a future together. I think we’ll both be happier if we just end things now.” Since Geminis are ruled by Mercury, they value good communication. Just tell her point-blank that you want to break up rather than trying to soften the blow."

      "title": "A Gemini hates being wrong, so she’ll be really hurt if you blame her.",
      "content": "A Gemini hates being wrong, so she’ll be really hurt if you blame her. Your breakup will go much easier if you don’t tell her all of the reasons she’s not the one for you. Fortunately, she’s not the type to confront you about why you want to break up, so it’s easy to make a clean break. Say, “I don’t feel like this is working out,” not “We’re not working,” or “You’re not the one for me.” This keeps the focus on how you’re feeling, not on her."

      "title": "A Gemini might want to complain about your faults during the breakup.",
      "content": "A Gemini might want to complain about your faults during the breakup. She wants to feel like you're the one to blame. Give her a chance to have her say so she can move on quickly. Unfortunately, she might start complaining about you. It’s okay to excuse yourself if she starts being mean. You could say: “I’m sorry you’re upset, but I’m not going to listen to insults. Maybe it’s best if I go.” “I understand you’re hurting, but I don’t think I deserved that. I’m going to leave, but I wish you the best.”"

      "title": "Geminis sometimes think you're joking when you're serious.",
      "content": "Geminis sometimes think you're joking when you're serious. Worse, she might use her intellect to try to change your mind. Tell her you’ve made your decision and it’s final. You might say: “I’ll hear you out, but I’m not changing my mind.” “I’ve thought this through, and I’m not going to change my mind.” “I know this is the right decision, and I wish you the best.”"

      "title": "Geminis struggle with emotions, so she’ll pretend to be okay.",
      "content": "Geminis struggle with emotions, so she’ll pretend to be okay. She may seem like she doesn’t care, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Her heart is hurting, but she doesn’t feel comfortable sharing how she feels. She likely won’t let you see her cry, but she’s hurting on the inside. [1] X Research source Give her space to process her feelings and release them in her own way. You may see her laughing and smiling, but that’s just how she copes."

      "title": "Geminis are social butterflies and need attention from others.",
      "content": "Geminis are social butterflies and need attention from others. Additionally, she’ll crave a distraction while she’s working through her feelings about your relationship ending. She’s going to be on the prowl pretty much immediately after your breakup. Don’t be surprised if she has a new partner on her arm right away. [2] X Research source Again, this is how a Gemini copes with heartache. It doesn’t mean she’s totally over you or that she wasn’t fully invested in your relationship. She probably was, but she needs someone else to take her mind off her heartbreak."

      "title": "After a breakup, Geminis post everything they’re doing on social media.",
      "content": "After a breakup, Geminis post everything they’re doing on social media. She’s not going to cry into a tub of ice cream after your breakup. Instead, she’ll be seeing friends, having fun, and keeping herself busy. She’s going to post photos of all the fun she’s having. It might be easier to deal with your breakup if you aren’t seeing her in your feed. [3] X Research source Geminis love the single life, so she’s going to live it up. Even though you know your relationship isn’t working out, breakups are always super hard. Take time to care for yourself right now."

      "title": "Geminis have trouble being friends with their exes, at least at first.",
      "content": "Geminis have trouble being friends with their exes, at least at first. Remember, she doesn’t want to open up about her emotions or deal with confrontation. She needs time away from you to truly move on. For at least two weeks after the breakup, don’t call or text her and avoid places where you think you might run into her. In the future, she may be open to reconnecting as friends. Because Geminis are a mutable sign, they’re able to learn from the past and be super flexible—even with relationships. [4] X Research source Sometimes, they’re able to shift their feelings from love to friendship."

      "title": "A talkative Gemini will tell everyone about your breakup.",
      "content": "A talkative Gemini will tell everyone about your breakup. She’s going to be spinning stories about what happened immediately after it happens. She might even live tweet it! [5] X Research source Since she’s ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, talking things out is how she processes them. Don’t be surprised if you hear rumors about what happened. You could always share your version of events if you feel like she’s going too far. Don’t worry too much about the gossip. It’ll blow over quickly as she moves on to a more interesting topic. Remember, she gets bored quickly."
