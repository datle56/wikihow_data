      "content": "Choose adhesive hooks for objects up to 8 pounds (3.6 kg). These hooks have adhesive backings that stick to walls, so you won't have to drill a hole. This is definitely a plus for concrete walls, since they can be pretty difficult to drill into. Just make sure to weigh the object first, so you can pick a hook that will properly support it! [1] X Research source Adhesive wall hooks come in various sizes, and the packaging should specify how many pounds each will hold. The largest of these hooks hold 8 pounds (3.6 kg), and the smallest are rated for only 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight. As a result, this option tends to work best for lightweight items, such as smaller framed photographs, posters, or art prints."

      "content": "Clean the wall with rubbing alcohol for a better hold. Use a clean rag or paper towel and some rubbing alcohol to scrub the area of any debris. This will ensure that the adhesive will stick firmly to the wall. [2] X Research source If you don’t have rubbing alcohol, you can use some warm soapy water instead. Just be sure to wipe the spot dry after cleaning."

      "content": "Make a small pencil mark where you want the center of your hook to be. If the item you’ll be hanging has a wire on the back, be sure to consider the length of the slack. Test this by pulling the center of the wire tight toward the top of your object. If you are using 2 hooks for an object that has two hangers on the back, make sure to measure the distance between the two hangers and make your marks on the wall accordingly. If you are using 2 hooks for a single wire hanger that runs across the entire back of a frame, measure the width of the object you are hanging and divide that number by 3. Your marks on the wall should be that distance apart."

If the item pulls the adhesive hook off the wall even after you’ve waited, check to make sure you’re using a hook that is appropriate for the weight of your item."

Hardwall hangers are made specifically for cement and brick walls, and they can handle a lot more weight than adhesive hooks. Each hanger comes with four sturdy pins that will anchor the base of the hook to the wall. You can also use 2 hardwall hangers to hang one heavier object if you want extra support. You will need a hammer to install hardwall hangers."

If the item you are hanging has a wire-hanger in the back, be sure to consider the slack when determining where you want it to hang. If you are using 2 hardwall hangers, measure the distance between the two hooks on the back of your object to determine where to place the marks. If your object has a single wire running along the back of it, measure the width of the object and divide that number by 3. Your two marks on the wall should be this distance apart."

      "content": "Choose masonry anchors to hang objects over 25 pounds (11 kg). Masonry anchors , also called concrete screws, are generally plastic and come with the screws that you insert into them. To install them, you will need a drill and a masonry bit the same size as the anchors. [3] X Research source You can purchase masonry kits that include anchors, screws, and the correct size masonry bit. For added support, you can also use two masonry anchors to hang 1 item. Since this method can hold the most weight, it works well for heavier pieces of artwork or very large framed photographs."

      "content": "Use a hammer drill for the best results. A standard electric drill will work with a masonry bit, but it will be slow-going, and there is the chance you will create a hole much larger than you want. If you don’t have a hammer drill , consider renting or borrowing one for the best results. [4] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020.

Make sure your grasp is firm, and check to see that the bit, the drill shaft, and your arm are all parallel to the floor. As you drill, press firmly into the wall and maintain your position.
