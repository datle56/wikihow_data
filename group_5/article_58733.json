      "content": "Wiggle the tooth to make sure it moves easily. When you're trying to decide whether the tooth is ready to come out, ask your child to try to wiggle it around. Have them push it back, forward, and side-to-side as far as they can. If the tooth is loose enough to pull, it should move easily, and you shouldn't see any blood. Also, double-check with your child to make sure they don't feel any pain when they wiggle the tooth—if they do, it isn't ready. [1] X Research source Your child can use their tongue or their fingers to wiggle the tooth, or you can wiggle it yourself. Just make sure you or your child wash your hands thoroughly if you use your fingers. Pulling out a tooth before it's ready can be painful for your child and it can damage their gums. [2] X Research source It might also cause your child's permanent teeth to be crooked when they grow in.

      "title": "Encourage your child to wiggle the tooth every day if it isn't ready.",
      "content": "Encourage your child to wiggle the tooth every day if it isn't ready. The easiest way to help a loose tooth along is to have your child wiggle it frequently. At least once a day, remind your child to use their tongue or fingers to wiggle the tooth back and forth and side-to-side. [4] X Research source Brushing and flossing can also help the tooth loosen more. Just be gentle, because the gum might be tender in that area. You can also give your child foods that are hard to chew, like apples and cucumbers, to help naturally loosen the tooth."

      "title": "Grip the tooth with a tissue or a piece of gauze.",
      "content": "Grip the tooth with a tissue or a piece of gauze. Teeth can be slippery, making them hard to grip—especially super-small baby teeth. To help you hold the tooth firmly, put a folded piece of tissue or gauze over the tooth before you try to grab it. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before you put your fingers in your child's mouth. You can also wear a pair of rubber gloves to help you get a better grip on the tooth."

      "title": "Squeeze the tooth firmly and tug.",
      "content": "Squeeze the tooth firmly and tug. Using the gauze pad, grasp the tooth and pull up firmly but gently. You can also add a slight twisting motion as you pull. If it's ready, the tooth should come right out. [5] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If the tooth doesn't come out easily, it isn't ready yet. Try again in a few days. Work quickly—the faster you pull the tooth, the less it will hurt."

      "content": "Talk to them about the tooth fairy. If your child needs a little encouragement, try talking to them about what the tooth fairy will bring them in exchange for their tooth. This might help them be excited enough to let you pull their tooth. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wait until they're ready.",
      "content": "Wait until they're ready. Don't force your child to pull their tooth or let you pull it—the tooth will likely fall out on its own without any help at all. However, if you want to help it along with a little pull, talk to your child first. If they want your help, then you can go ahead. In most cases, your child will be able to remove the tooth on their own just by playing with it. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a numbing cream on the gums.",
      "content": "Use a numbing cream on the gums. If your child's tooth is loose enough, pulling it shouldn't be painful at all. However, if your child is nervous that it will hurt, you can ease their mind by asking their doctor or dentist to recommend a safe over-the-counter anesthetic. [8] X Research source Simply rub a dab of the ointment onto your child's gums and wait a few minutes for it to take effect, then pull the tooth."

      "content": "Give your child a cold treat to help numb their mouth. For a quick at-home option, have your child suck on some ice before you pull their tooth. You could also give them a cold treat like a popsicle or a snow cone—this might be just the trick to help put a nervous child at ease. [9] X Research source If you use ice cubes, remind your child not to chew on them, as that could damage their teeth."

      "content": "Yes, you can use floss, but only if the tooth is ready to fall out. If the tooth is ready to fall out and you're having trouble getting a grip on it, slide a piece of floss around the tooth right at the gumline. Then, have your child pull forward on the floss with a quick yank. This could help the tooth pop right out. [10] X Research source Do not tie the floss to a doorknob. If the tooth isn't ready, this approach can cause your child a lot of pain and bleeding. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Stop the bleeding with a sterile piece of gauze. Even if the tooth was very loose, there will likely still be some bleeding. Take a fresh, sterile piece of gauze and press down on the tooth socket. Have the child bite on the gauze piece for 15 minutes or so. This will help to control the bleeding and help the wound heal faster. [12] X Research source If the bleeding doesn't stop after 15 minutes, call your child's dentist."

      "title": "Keep brushing and flossing as normal.",
      "content": "Keep brushing and flossing as normal. Your child's gum might be a little tender where they lost their tooth. However, they'll still need to brush and floss the rest of their teeth the way they usually would. Just remind them to be gentle when they brush in the area where their tooth fell out."

      "title": "Get emergency treatment if the socket bleeds longer than 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Get emergency treatment if the socket bleeds longer than 15 minutes. It’s totally normal for the socket to bleed a little after you pull the tooth, so try not to worry. However, the bleeding should stop after about 15 minutes, especially if you're pressing gauze into the socket. If the socket is still bleeding after 15 minutes or so, go to the doctor, an urgent care center, or the emergency room so a doctor can stop the bleeding. [13] X Research source This likely means that there is a slight tear in the gum—the dentist will likely treat it much the same way they would treat a patient after a tooth extraction. However, they may also check to make sure there isn't something else going on, like a bit of tooth fragment left behind in the socket."

      "content": "Go to the dentist immediately if there are any tooth fragments. You likely won’t need to worry about this, but if you think your child's tooth broke off when it fell out, you should see a dentist right away. The fragments could cause pain or lead to an infection, the dentist will need to remove them. [14] X Research source Fragments usually occur if a tooth falls out after an injury, rather than when you pull a loose tooth. However, if you pull the tooth before it's ready, sometimes the roots can remain. [15] X Research source If your child has pain or swelling in the days after the tooth was removed, a piece of the root may have broken off. [16] X Research source"

If your child's permanent teeth start coming in but the baby teeth haven't fallen out yet, you might notice that the double row of teeth looks like a shark's teeth. However, there's nothing to worry about. In most cases, the baby tooth is going to fall out on its own before the permanent tooth comes in all the way. [17] X Research source If the permanent tooth is completely out and the baby tooth isn't loose yet, you'll probably need to take your child to the dentist for an extraction."

If you notice that your child's tooth is a little wiggly, but months pass and it hasn't really changed much, it's a good idea to set up an appointment. The dentist will be able to check whether their permanent teeth are developing properly and whether any extra help might be needed.
