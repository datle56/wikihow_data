      "content": "You should wait at least 4-6 weeks before having sex. It will take at least that long for your surgical scars to heal and for any bleeding or discharge to stop. [1] X Research source However, some doctors may advise you to wait 8 weeks or more before you have sex (including using sex toys inside your vagina), so be sure to follow your healthcare provider's aftercare instructions closely. [2] X Research source Typically, your doctor will perform a vaginal exam to make sure you're completely healed before they'll clear you for sex. [3] X Research source It's okay if it takes longer than this before you feel ready for sex again, so don't pressure yourself to be intimate before you're comfortable. Your healing time will depend on the extent of your surgery and the removal method that was used. For instance, you'll likely heal more quickly after a laparoscopic procedure."

      "content": "Yes, you can still enjoy sex and have orgasms. Women experience 3 types of orgasms: clitoral, vaginal, and uterine. Since your uterus will be removed during your hysterectomy, you won't experience uterine contractions during orgasm after your procedure. However, you can still experience clitoral orgasms, and many women will still have vaginal orgasms, as well. [4] X Research source Ask your partner to focus on your clitoris, labia, and the entrance to your vagina to help you achieve orgasm."

      "content": "Some women do notice a difference during sex. These changes might include feeling less sensation during penetration, experiencing dryness during sex, and having less intense orgasms. Also, if you normally experience contractions in your uterus during an orgasm, you likely won't feel this anymore, since your uterus will be gone.

      "content": "Over-the-counter lubricants and hormone replacement are helpful for dryness. Some women have trouble with vaginal dryness after a hysterectomy. Sexual lubricants are very helpful with this—try experimenting with different brands to find one you like. You might even find that this adds a fun new element to your sex life! [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Your doctor might also recommend hormone replacement therapy, like the use of an estrogen cream—especially if your libido was affected after the surgery. This is more common if your ovaries were removed during the procedure. [8] X Research source If you find that vaginal tightness is an issue, talk to your doctor about using a vaginal dilator kit to make sex easier. These kits include plastic tubes in various sizes—you start by inserting the smallest dilator, then gradually working up to the larger ones as you feel comfortable. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Do pelvic floor exercises to help improve sensation during sex. During your recovery, your doctor or physical therapist will advise you when to start doing pelvic floor exercises to help restore strength to the area. Pelvic floor strength is important for things like bladder control, but it will also help you experience more sensation during penetration. [10] X Research source For instance, your doctor may recommend that starting a few weeks after your surgery, you should squeeze the muscles in your pelvic area (like if you're trying to stop urinating mid-stream) for several seconds at a time."

      "content": "You may find that your libido is affected, especially at first. You might be hesitant to get back into the bedroom because you're nervous that it will affect the healing process. In that case, don't rush; it's important to wait to have sex until you feel comfortable. Also, if you had your ovaries removed, your body will go into menopause—and many women find that they have less interest in sex during menopause due to the hormonal changes that are happening. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Your doctor may recommend treatments for the symptoms of menopause, like hormone replacement therapy, that may help restore your sex drive.

Ask them to be patient with you as your body adjusts to the changes you're going through. If you feel like it's becoming a problem, though, talk to your doctor or even a couple's therapist."

      "content": "No, you should talk to your doctor about this. Bleeding can indicate that you weren't completely healed from the procedure, so you need to see your doctor right away to make sure nothing's wrong. Your doctor will likely do a vaginal exam to check on your healing, and they'll talk to you about how to treat the problem. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The bleeding might also be due to a small tear in your vaginal wall, which can happen if there wasn't enough lubrication during sex. If your doctor has given you the all-clear for sex, you can help prevent this by going slow and using an over-the-counter lubricant.
