      "content": "Start with a large piece of origami paper, patterned-side down. Small works, too -- it's just a bit harder to fold."

      "content": "Fold the paper in half, forming a triangle."

    {
      "title": "Open the paper up and fold both sides into the crease.",
      "content": "Open the paper up and fold both sides into the crease. You should now have what looks like the beginning of a paper airplane. It also sort of looks like an ice cream cone -- the cone will be the patterned bit and the underside (the blank side) will jut out on top in a triangle shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the exposed underside over the patterned side.",
      "content": "Fold the exposed underside over the patterned side. In other words, you know the ice cream cone shape you just had? Fold the \"ice cream\" bit over the \"cone\" bit. If you're using patterned paper, every bit should be showing you the patterned side. You should be looking at a smaller triangle on top of a larger triangle. The paper, as a whole, is one giant, perfect triangle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the flap (ice cream) 2/3 of the way back.",
      "content": "Fold the flap (ice cream) 2/3 of the way back. You should be creating a small triangle going the opposite direction; the triangle is the underside (non-patterned) of your sheet. This will eventually be your tail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the paper over and grab your scissors.",
      "content": "Flip the paper over and grab your scissors. Starting at the thinnest point in your big triangle, cut 1/3 of the way down the middle crease. This will create your head and ears."

      "title": "Fold it in half, folding the cut 1/3 up at a 90-degree angle.",
      "content": "Fold it in half, folding the cut 1/3 up at a 90-degree angle. Fold them up on both sides. That's the head and ears, there's the body in the middle, and that little triangle you made a few steps ago? That's the tail!"

      "title": "Grab an index card or other rectangular paper like origami paper.",
      "content": "Grab an index card or other rectangular paper like origami paper . Anything will work, so long as it isn't square. You can use other things like business cards, a dollar bill, or a whole piece of paper. Do note that a small paper will be more likely to hop, but a bigger paper will be easier to fold. Origami paper is best, especially because it comes with neat patterns. Two differently colored sides can sometimes make mistakes easier to see."

      "content": "Fold the two sides of the \"house\" inward, so that they meet in the center. The sides will go under the points of the triangle on top. It's fine to leave a small space in between the edges. Now the \"house\" should look like an arrow."
