This is especially the case if you have come across a vehicle accident or you are in a place where there may be serious health and safety hazards present. If the deceased was found in the middle of a road, do not attempt to move the body to a safer location. Instead, stay with the person until the paramedics arrive, and signal to other commuters to divert around the scene. If the deceased committed suicide via electric shock, be mindful of any live currents that could potentially be fatal to you as well. If you find the deceased in the bath or similar location, having shocked themselves, it's best to wait outside of the house for professionals to arrive and remove the hazards."

You're certainly not the case detective, but you can do your own research so that you can convey the information accurately to the professionals involved in the case. You might find that the individual had an asthma inhaler close by, was reaching for medication or in more cases than you would expect, they were in the bathroom. If the deceased committed suicide and/or are hanging (due to asphyxiation) or there is a copious amount of blood, avoid attempting to pull the body down onto the floor by yourself. Keep your distance and perhaps wait outside for the medical professionals or coroner to arrive and do their business. Avoid removing, shifting or touching any objects in the room or at the scene of the death - in case the coroner finds the tragedy as suspicious. [3] X Research source"
