If you have text and pictures, be sure to have plenty of white or negative space. Negative space allows the content to breathe and will draw the audience in easier. Limit the number of bullet points per slide. Don’t force people to read a lot while listening to you speak. In general, avoid being text heavy in your slides. [10] X Research source Limit the number of words for each bullet. If a bullet has two or more lines of words, there are too many words for that bullet."
