      "content": "Push a ruler in between the box springs and mattress. If your bed has a bedspread on it, lift it away so you can see the box springs and mattress. Slide a rigid ruler or piece of sturdy cardboard horizontally in between the box springs and mattress so it sticks horizontally out from the edge of the bed by at least 3 inches (7.6 cm). [1] X Research source If your mattress isn't on the box springs at this point, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Measure from the top of the box springs to the ground to find the drop length. Hook the end of a flexible measuring tape to the ruler or cardboard that's sticking out between the box springs and mattress. Then, pull the measuring tape down to the ground and write down the measurement. This is your bed skirt drop length. [2] X Research source The most common bed skirt drop length is 14 inches (36 cm), but this can vary greatly, especially if you have a tall box spring. You can adjust this measurement later when you're buying a bed skirt."

      "content": "Shop for a bed skirt that matches your bedding style. While most bed skirts come in solid colors, you might find prints like stripes or a floral pattern. Pair the bed skirt with the style of your bedspread. For example, if you have a floral bedspread, choose a solid color that complements the color of the flowers. [5] X Research source Most bed skirts are made of cotton or a synthetic-cotton blend. This makes them easy to wash whenever they start looking dusty. Decide if you want the bed skirt to hang straight down the sides or if you'd like it to have a ruffle. For a modern style, choose a white bed skirt that hangs straight or has pleats. Go with a colorful ruffled bed skirt for a romantic or traditional look."

      "title": "Subtract up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) for a shorter drop length.",
      "content": "Subtract up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) for a shorter drop length. If you don't want your bed skirt to skim the ground, subtract 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) from your bed skirt drop length measurement. For example, if your drop length is 14 inches (36 cm), subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) to get a 13 in (33 cm) drop length. Keep in mind that things under your bed might be visible if the bed skirt doesn't reach the ground."

Most companies offer slightly different sizes for their products, so it's always a good idea to find your brand's size chart. This is usually on the back of the package, but you can also look them up online. [6] X Research source If you're still shopping around, look up the size chart for each bed skirt you're considering."

      "content": "Wash and dry the bed skirt before you put it on the box springs. Although most companies launder their products before selling them, it's not a bad idea to wash new bedding. If you're sewing your own bed skirt, wash the fabric before you cut and sew the pieces to prevent the bed skirt from shrinking the first time you wash it. Washing and drying the bed skirt is also a good way to get rid of wrinkles and creases that form while it's in the package."
