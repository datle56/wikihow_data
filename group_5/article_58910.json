      "content": "Empty nest syndrome is the lost feeling parents get when their kids leave home. When your kids have all grown up and left home, you can start to feel as though you've lost your purpose. Your kids were your focus for at least 18 years and now that they're gone, you don't know what to do with yourself. Initially, this can make you feel lost, adrift, or without purpose—and this is totally normal! If you focus on yourself and your own needs, these feelings will dissipate in time. [1] X Research source Empty nest syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis, but it's a very real issue that affects a lot of parents. Characteristics of empty nest syndrome include feelings of grief, loss, sadness, and loneliness. The good news is that this is a transitional phase that typically only lasts for a month or two."

      "content": "Allow yourself to grieve rather than deny your feelings. You might be telling yourself that you should feel good about your kids growing up and going out on their own, but this is a complicated transition and it doesn't always work that way. Treat yourself with kindness and express those emotions rather than trying to push them down. You'll recover a lot more quickly if you let yourself go through the normal process of grieving. [2] X Research source Journaling about the situation can help you process your feelings so you can cope with the transition better. Talk to people you know who are also empty nesters. They'll help you feel less alone because they can understand where you're coming from."

      "content": "Accept that your role as a parent has only changed, not ended. If you see your kids being gone as a gaping hole in your life, you'll feel much worse than if you choose to see it as an opportunity to revive some of your own interests. Remember that even though your kids are off on their own, they'll still need your help from time to time.

Rituals can help you get some closure and come to terms with the changes that are happening in your life. For example, you might redecorate your child's room or plant a tree in the backyard in their honor."

      "content": "Take up a new hobby to keep yourself busy. Now that your kids are out of the house, you'll likely find that you have a lot more free time than you did in the past. If you just mope around feeling bored, that will likely make the empty nest feelings worse. Instead, look for something you can do that will help fill your time and also engage your mind. Here are some suggestions to get you started: [5] X Research source Join a club that suits your interests, such as a book club, a sewing club, or a crafting club Play a community league sport Try out for a local community play Start writing a blog Take up photography"

Check with local colleges and universities to find a class you can audit. You might also check with local libraries or museums, which often host lecture series.

You also have a lot more time to be spontaneous without having to worry that the kids might walk in and interrupt the moment. [8] X Research source Plan date nights to help you both ease back into this new phase of your relationship. If your relationship is on the rocks, it might get worse without the kids there to act as a sort of buffer. But this is also an excellent time to have those tough conversations with each other or even seek out a couples counselor to help. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Reconnect with friends and family members. When your focus is on your kids, a lot of your relationships with other adults tend to take a back seat. Reach out to your old friends and let them know that you'd like to get together for coffee sometime. You might even throw a dinner party or host a game night to help rebuild some of these connections. [10] X Research source If your parents are still in your life, you can now relate to them in a new way, because they already went through this with you. Talking about the experience with them will help you understand it in a new way and can bring you closer together."

      "content": "Get active and focus on your physical and mental health. Along with staying busy, make your health a priority. Activities such as walking or jogging also stimulate your body's production of feel-good chemicals so over time the empty-nest feelings will start to fade. [11] X Research source Try yoga or meditate to restore your sense of mental calm. Going through a life change is stressful (even if it's a positive change) so do what you can to ease that stress. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things! For example, if you've always wanted to try a more plant-based diet, now is a great time to try a new recipe without having to worry that the kids won't like it."

[12] X Research source You might also consider having a spa day or getting a makeover.

If you don't feel like going somewhere far away, even playing tourists in your hometown gives you the opportunity to see familiar things in a whole new light. [13] X Research source You might also think about taking a day trip to a neighboring town or a visit to friends or family that live further away. A romantic weekend getaway with your partner is another great idea that can help distract you from your empty nest feelings as well as give you an opportunity to rekindle that romantic spark."

It can help to schedule a weekly call-in time. Let your kids take the lead in contacting you more often and don't call them unless it's urgent. Video calls are another great way to see and connect with your kids once they've left the nest. You might also create a family group chat so that everyone can stay connected to each other."

      "content": "Decide what roles you play that you'd like to expand. Make a list of all the roles you currently have in your life—you might be a partner, an employee, or a coworker. You have other family roles too, as a sibling or child. Look over this list and decide which roles you want to lean into more when you're no longer spending as much time parenting. [15] X Research source For example, you might decide that you want to put yourself up for that promotion at work that you always turned down because you needed time to care for your kids. You might decide that you want to add new roles as well. For example, if you want to go back to school, you'd be adding \"student\" to your list."

Now is the time to jump into all those things you've always wanted to do but thought you wouldn't have enough time and energy while you were caring for your kids. You put their interests first for decades and now you have the freedom to do what you really want to do. [16] X Research source If you find that you're stumped and are having a hard time coming up with things, that's okay! It's hard to transition into thinking about what you want when you're used to putting your kids' wants and needs first. Think about things that you enjoyed doing in the past that you let fall by the wayside after you had kids. Are there things that you could pick up and start doing again? Talk to your friends and family about what they started doing when their kids grew up and left the nest. You can get lots of ideas this way that you might want to try out for yourself."

      "content": "Reach out to other people who share your interests. Check on social media or sites such as Meetup to find people locally who are involved in the kinds of things you want to be involved with. Making connections with these people gives you a way to start doing some of the things you want to do once you have more time to do them. This will make the empty nest transition easier if you already have these connections in place before your kids move out. [17] X Research source If you have an interest that there doesn't seem to be a local outlet for, why not create your own? For example, if you have a few local friends who love to read, you might start a book club with them."

      "content": "Start exploring new roles and interests before your child leaves. Even though your kid is still at home, they're likely a lot more self-sufficient now than they were just a few years ago. This gives you the freedom to explore some of the things you want to do in a limited capacity before they're gone so you won't feel as much of a void when they leave. [18] X Research source This assumes that you know pretty far in advance when your child is going to be moving out. If they spring it on you and you don't have a lot of time, don't worry! You can still start exploring as soon as possible."

While your kids are still at home, show them how to do the things that they'll need to do but have possibly never really thought about. Providing them with this guidance can help the transition to adulthood go more smoothly and then you won't worry about them as much. [19] X Research source Helping prepare your kids to leave the nest also helps you transition into your new role as the parent of adult children. You'll get used to giving them advice or guidance when they need it but letting them do things on their own."

      "content": "Talk to your kids about their experiences growing up. Having an open conversation about the feelings your kids have about your family dynamic and parenting style helps smooth their transition to adulthood. Being open and honest with each other paves the way toward treating them more like a fellow adult and less like your child. [20] X Research source Avoid getting defensive if your child brings up things about your parenting that they disliked or disagreed with. Instead, listen to their concerns and validate their feelings . Then, apologize sincerely for anything you did that caused them hurt or frustration."

A lot of people view children leaving home as a normal part of life and don't see it as upsetting. They might not understand why you're taking it the way you are. This is when a professional can help because they'll take your thoughts and feelings seriously. [22] X Research source Try not to begrudge people for not understanding what you're going through. Everyone handles this transition differently. If you have a lack of friends who empathize with you, a support group for empty nesters can help you feel less alone. Sometimes it helps to talk to others who are going through the same thing you are."
