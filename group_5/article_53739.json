      "title": "Go for a formal gown.",
      "content": "Go for a formal gown. If you are attending a formal dance like a winter formal or prom, you should go for a formal outfit. This means a formal dress that is floor length or no shorter than three inches above your knee, with a modest neckline. You may go for a strapless dress or a dress with a halter top as long as it fits your upper area properly. [1] X Research source If your dress has slits, the slit should be no higher than three inches above your knee. Try to go for a dress made of flowing fabric, as your school may not allow you to get into the dance if your dress is skin tight or made of spandex. Fabric like chiffon, nylon, and silk are all good options for a formal dress. Avoid exposing your midriff for formal dances and if your midriff is exposed, make sure you are showing no more than two inches of skin below the inseam. If you plan to dance a lot, you may want to opt for a gown with straps and no train."

      "content": "Look for a gown based on your body type. Though you may be looking for the latest, trendy look for your formal gown, you may also want to consider dressing based on your body type . There are four main body types for high school girls: [2] X Research source Straight: This body type appears as a straight line, with very little definition between your bust, waist, and hips. Empire waist gowns fit straight body types well, as well as fitted sheaths. You may go for a one shoulder detail on your gown to add some drama. Pear: This body type is smaller on the top and fuller at the hips and butt. You may go for a fitted strapless gown or a halter top gown, as they will draw the eye upward. A full skirt or an empire waist will also help to show off your figure. Hourglass: This body type is curvy, with a full bust, a defined waist, and full hips. Look for gowns for a fitted waist, as this will enhance your curves. Adjustable waist styles, such as wrap dresses, are also ideal for this body type. Apple: This body type is apple shaped, with the narrowest point of the body located above your waist, just below your ribs. Go for a gown with an empire waist, with neck details like straps or a halter top. A gown with a full skirt or an A-line skirt are also idea for this body type."
