      "content": "Avoid unnecessarily causing stress to your quail. Quail are shy and sensitive birds that don't like being handled on a daily basis, unless they are tamed and use to the human hand. They usually do not like being picked up, but can be hand fed or spoken to in hushed tones. Having pets or loud noises in the same room as you cage can also stress them out."

      "title": "Feed your quail a limited amount of treats.",
      "content": "Feed your quail a limited amount of treats. Quail are picky so they might not like everything you give them, but they will eat what they like and leave what they dislike - thus you will soon pick up on what to feed them. What they can be fed is listed below: Fresh fruits including apple, banana, strawberry, melon, etc. Make sure you chop these up into small pieces so that the quail can eat them. Fresh vegetables including broccoli, corn, cucumber, salad leafs, sprouts, etc. Chop these up as well as the fruits. Bugs including mealworms, millipedes, spiders, woodlice, etc. Make sure you keep the bugs small so that the quail will have no trouble eating them. Table scraps including pasta, rice, noodles, cereal, etc. Quail will eat most types of food but make sure to only give them a small amount. Never feed quail avocado, chocolate, alcohol, stems and leaves of tomato plants, uncooked potato or egg, citrus fruits, lettuce and salty treats. These are all toxic to quail."

      "title": "Provide more space.",
      "content": "Provide more space. Quail are naturally ground-dwelling birds that roam around, foraging for food throughout the day. More space will help to not only make your quail a lot happier, but also encourage mental stimulation, exercise and discourage fights between the flock. You can purchase or build a run which is a great amount of space to keep your quail in during the day time."

      "content": "Pot plants in the quails habitat. If your quail live outside on the ground consider planting a few shrubs in their enclosure depending on how big it is. They’ll love pecking around at the plants but make sure they aren’t poisonous to the quail. Although you must be aware of the many poisonous plants there are to quail, you probably won’t come across these anyway. And quail will avoid plants that are poisonous to them."

      "content": "Make the quail’s closure more exciting. If you have a lot of spare space in the quail’s cage, add some extra items that they’ll love such as logs, rocks, rodent huts, hiding spots, plants etc. The hiding spots will give any bullied quail a place to retreat to when chased, and it also increases the chance you can have males housed together."

      "content": "Get rid of things that make your quail unhappy. There are many things that can cause unhappiness to quail, some can be seen below: Too much sunlight or little sunlight. Quail need 13-15 hours of light per day, if they lack this consider providing them with a few light bulbs hung above their cage. However, the quail should always have access to shade if they become too hot. Predators including pets. Racoons, birds, dogs, cats, rats and snakes are all predators of quail. Make sure the cage is predator proof and that no pets can get inside the quails room. Lack of space. Provide your quail with at least 1 square foot of floor space, more will be even better. Hot or cold temperatures. Bring the quail inside a warm room during winter and keep them in the shade during summer depending on how cold/hot it gets in your area. Cold quail will huddle up and hot quail will pant."
