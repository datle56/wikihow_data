    {
      "title": "Fill a jar with the water.",
      "content": "Fill a jar with the water. To make the starch spray, you’ll need a jar with a lid that is larger than a pint (473 ml). Open the jar, and add 1 pint of distilled warm water. [1] X Research source You can make the spray in a bowl if you prefer. However, you’ll have to mix it by hand rather than shake it to combine the ingredients. You can use tap water for the spray, but it’s better to use distilled, especially if you have hard water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the cornstarch and shake the jar.",
      "content": "Add the cornstarch and shake the jar. Once the water is in the jar, sprinkle in 1 heaping tablespoon (8 to 10 g) of cornstarch. Secure the lid on the jar, and shake the mixture vigorously to combine the water and cornstarch. [2] X Research source You don’t have to be precise with the amount of cornstarch. As long as it’s approximately 1 generous tablespoon (8 to 10 g), the spray will be effective."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sprinkle in the essential oil.",
      "content": "Sprinkle in the essential oil. If you want the spray to have a fragrance, add 1 to 2 drops of your favorite essential oil to the jar. Shake it again to ensure that the oil is fully incorporated. [3] X Research source You can use any essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lemon and lavender are particularly nice, though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour the mixture into a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. When the spray is fully mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. Label the bottle so you know what it is and store it with your laundry supplies. [4] X Research source You may have an easier time transferring the spray to the bottle if you use a funnel. The spray typically lasts for two to three months, though it may start to degrade. Discard it if you notice it becoming discolored or developing mold."
    },
    {
      "title": "Heat the water in a pan.",
      "content": "Heat the water in a pan. Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of water into a small saucepan, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the water to heat. [5] X Research source You can use distilled or tap water for the spray."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix in the cornstarch and bring the mixture to a boil.",
      "content": "Mix in the cornstarch and bring the mixture to a boil. As the water is heating, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch to the pan. Use a whisk to mix it into the water, and allow the mixture to come a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. [6] X Research source By heating the mixture, you allow the cornstarch to melt into the water so you don’t have to worry about it separating as much."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir in the vinegar.",
      "content": "Stir in the vinegar. After you’ve taken the pan off the heat, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vinegar to the pan. Use the whisk to fully incorporate it into the cornstarch mixture. [7] X Research source Vinegar naturally disinfects clothing, which is ideal if you’re using the starch spray between washes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the essential oil.",
      "content": "Add the essential oil. If you want your starch spray to have a pleasant scent, you can also mix in some essential oil. Use 10 drops of your favorite oil, and whisk it into the mixture so it’s evenly distributed. [8] X Research source Use an essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lavender, grapefruit, or rosemary are good options."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle.",
      "content": "Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle. When the spray is completely mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. For best results, keep your homemade starch spray in a cool, dark spot. [9] X Research source The spray should keep for 2 to 4 months."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake the spray before each use.",
      "content": "Shake the spray before each use. The cornstarch in a homemade spray has a tendency to settle at the bottom of the spray bottle when it’s sitting on the shelf. Before using the spray always give the bottle a good shake to ensure that the ingredients are mixed. [10] X Research source The cornstarch is less likely to separate if you use the heated method to make it, but it’s still a good idea to shake it before each use."

      "title": "Mist the fabric with the spray.",
      "content": "Mist the fabric with the spray. Lay the item of clothing or fabric that you want to smooth out on flat surface. Lightly spray the item with the cornstarch mixture across the entire surface. [11] X Research source A little bit of the spray goes a long way so don’t oversaturate your fabric."

    {
      "title": "Run an iron over the fabric.",
      "content": "Run an iron over the fabric. After you’ve applied the spray, run your iron over the fabric to smooth it as you normally would. Work until you’ve removed all of the wrinkles and added whatever creases you’d like to the fabric. [12] X Research source Be careful when using a hot iron. It’s easy to burn yourself."
