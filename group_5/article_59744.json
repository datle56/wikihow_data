Both rosemary and thyme can stand up to the stronger flavors of roasted salmon. Sprinkle on a bit of dried herbs with olive oil, or tuck a few pieces of fresh rosemary or thyme under the fish while it roasts."

      "title": "Sprinkle on your favorite seasoning blend.",
      "content": "Sprinkle on your favorite seasoning blend. Salmon is robust, and it can stand up to a variety of spices. Try sprinkling on taco seasoning, for instance, or Italian seasoning. It also does well with jerk seasoning, curry powder, Cajun seasoning, a Moroccan blend, or Chinese 5 spice. Just sprinkle the seasoning on the fish, and cook it how you'd like, by pan frying it, roasting it, or grilling it. If the blend doesn't have salt, consider adding a sprinkle to heighten the flavors. To brighten the fish, squeeze on some citrus juice at the end."
