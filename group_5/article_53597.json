      "title": "Place a warm pad or washcloth over the draw site.",
      "content": "Place a warm pad or washcloth over the draw site. Warmth causes the veins to dilate, making them easier to spot and stick. To heat up the veins, apply a warm compress over the draw site for 2-3 minutes, and be sure to disinfect the area with 70% alcohol afterwards (before you draw blood). [2] X Research source Alternatively, soak the arm in warm water or place it under a running faucet."

      "content": "Palpate the patient’s arm to help raise the vein. Difficult veins aren’t visible to the naked eye, but you can locate them by touch. Gently massage the draw site to make the vein more visible, then use your index finger to find one that feels spongy yet firm. [3] X Research source Nurses in movies and TV shows often slap the arm to find difficult veins, but this is actually a poor technique that can result in a hematoma. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask the patient to swing their arm clockwise to expand the vein. When you increase blood flow to the arm, it can increase the veins and make them more visible. Tell the patient to gently swing their arm in a clockwise direction, or have them perform a light exercise like jumping jacks or bicep curls.

      "content": "Tell the patient to take deep breaths to relax the vein. If the patient is nervous or has a needle phobia (trypanophobia), it becomes more difficult to draw their blood. Stress can compress their veins and negatively affect the results of their test, especially for biochemistry panels. Reassure the patient that the pain is very brief and minor, and have them breathe deeply to calm down. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You could also help them feel at ease by chatting about their day or turning on some relaxing music (if possible). [8] X Research source If you think the patient might faint, have them lie down on their back to improve blood flow to their head. This also reduces their chances of falling and injuring themselves if they do pass out.

      "content": "Advise the patient to drink water before their appointment, if possible. Most blood tests don’t require fasting, so the patient can eat or drink before coming in. If that’s the case, ask the patient to drink lots of water to hydrate their veins and make them more accessible. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may want to advise the patient to avoid caffeinated drinks 24 hours before their test to prevent dehydration.

      "content": "Apply a tourniquet to help you find the vein. A tourniquet increases the amount of blood in the vein to make it stand out more. To apply a tourniquet, place it approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) above the draw site, and make sure that you do not tie it too tight or for more than 2 minutes. If the tourniquet is tied properly, the vein will feel resilient or slightly bouncy when you palpate it. [14] X Research source A tourniquet also helps anchor the vein so it doesn’t roll around as much, making blood draw less painful for the patient and injection easier for the phlebotomist. [15] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a blood pressure cuff that is inflated to 40–60 mm Hg.

      "content": "Locate the median cubital vein. In general, the inside of the elbow is the preferred draw site because the median cubital vein is usually visible. This vein runs between the muscles and often looks like a blue bulge in the inside of your elbow. It’s also relatively easy to access because the tissue around the vein prevents it from rolling away from the needle. [17] X Research source If you can’t see the median cubital vein, gently massage the area to feel for it. Do not draw blood from a place where the veins divide or join together—doing so increases the risk of a hematoma.

[19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Alcohol is a better disinfectant than iodine because if iodine gets into the blood, it can alter the test results.

Hold still while collecting blood, and attach the necessary tubes or syringes to remove the proper volume (as specified by your laboratory).

If you cannot find the vein in the inside of the elbow in either arm, move down the forearm to search for the basilic or cephalic vein. These veins are usually visible through the skin, and you can ask the patient to lower their arm and make a fist to make them more prominent: [26] X Research source The cephalic vein runs along the radial side of the forearm, and it is the second most common draw site after the median cubital vein. The basilic vein runs along the ulnar side. The basilic vein is less frequently used than the cephalic, and it is more likely to roll away from the needle than the cephalic vein because it is not held as tightly in place by the tissues around it. If you can’t access those veins, find the metacarpal veins on the back of the hands. They are usually visible and can be palpated. However, do not use them for elderly patients because the skin is not as supple and does not support the veins as well."

Occasionally, you may encounter problems with the needle, such as going too far into the tissues or inserting it at too low of an angle (so the bevel is against the wall of the vein and impedes blood flow). To fix this, pull the needle back a little bit without removing it from the skin, and change the angle of the needle while it is still under the skin so that it can be inserted into the vein.
