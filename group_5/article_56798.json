      "content": "Install Replay on your PC or Mac. This free app makes creating an AI cover song on your computer easier than ever. Replay has many AI vocal models from famous artists, including 21 Savage, Drake, Kanye West, Britney Spears, and Freddie Mercury. You can even choose non-singers, like politicians and actors. Replay is only available on computers, as mobile devices don't have the processing power to run these sorts of models. To get the app, go to https://www.tryreplay.io and click the download link for your Mac version. Note that if you have a Mac, there are separate download links for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install. If you're using a phone or tablet, check out our list of web-based AI song tools , some of which have free tiers."

You can download audio files or create your own! The Replay app works best on more powerful computers. If you have a separate GPU or a very powerful CPU, you can generate an AI cover quickly. The app will work with 8 GB of RAM, but 16 GB or more is recommended. Alternatively, you can find a song you want to use on YouTube and allow Replay to download it. You won't have to separate the vocals from the backing track, as Replay will do the work for you."
