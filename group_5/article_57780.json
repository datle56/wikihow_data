      "content": "Because the \"U\" buttons on Midjourney no longer upscale images, use a third-party tool. By default, Midjourney produces 1024x1024 resolution images for you. However, there are tools that you can use to increase this resolution, including Gigapixel AI - Topaz Labs' Gigapixel AI is perhaps the best, most professional tool out there that you can download. However, that means that you'll need to pay to use the service. If this is your first time signing up for Gigapixel, you'll be eligible for a free trial! You can upscale up to 600%, or 6144x6144, with Midjourney images. chaiNNer - If you don't need that professional touch, try this free open-source software on GitHub. Pixelcut - You don't have to download software to use this service. Just upload your AI image in a browser and download the upscaled result. It's free and simple to use, so why not give it a try? BigJPG - This is another browser-specific AI upscaler that you can use for free or pay to unlock bigger uploads and faster speeds. You can also create an account to see your activity history, even after you close the browser window. Clipdrop.co - Yet another browser-based service that will upscale your Midjourney AI art 2x for free or 16x for paid accounts. You can also download the mobile app on Android, iPhone, and iPad. Upscayl - You can download the Upscayl Desktop app to easily upscale your Midjourney AI images for free. Upscayl Cloud, which offers faster and better results, is in beta, so you'll need to join a waiting list to join. Upscayl intends to rival Gigapixel."

      "content": "1024x1024, which equates to 1 megapixel. That's the default output from Midjourney V5, and it cannot be changed. If you want to upscale your image or make it a higher resolution, you'll need to use a 3rd party tool. [1] X Research source If you're using V4, there's an upscaling button (U1-U4) that changes your resolution from 512x512 to 1024x1024. You can use the legacy version by adding \" -- v 4 \" to your text. [2] X Research source"
