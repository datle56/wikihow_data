      "content": "Separate your recyclables into 2 categories. Mixed paper and cardboard go together in one category, which includes egg cartons, lightly soiled pizza boxes, smooth cardboard (such as food and shoes boxes, tubes, file folders, and cardboard from product packaging), and corrugated cardboard boxes (like moving boxes). The second category includes glass, metal, and plastic. [2] X Research source Paper with staples or window envelopes can be recycled with the rest of your mixed paper.

Check your takeout and pizza boxes for any leftover food, soft or spoiled paper, wax paper, or plastic-coated paper products. Cut away any soiled pieces before collapsing and recycling your cardboard boxes. If the cardboard is greasy or heavily-soiled, throw it away with your regular trash. [3] X Research source For example, to recycle a pizza box correctly, discard the soiled liner and recycle the plastic supporter with rigid plastics. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove all tape, then flatten and tie your cardboard into bundles. Take off as much tape as possible from your cardboard boxes and packaging. Collapse and fold large boxes or sheets of corrugated cardboard, then tie them up with twine . Bundles of flattened cardboard should be 18 inches (46 cm) tall or shorter. [5] X Research source Always use twine, not tape, to secure the cardboard bundles—it’s more easily recyclable and eco-friendly. If you don’t have twine, cut your cardboard into small pieces and place them in a clear, untinted bag or your recycling bin."

Make sure your bag or bin weighs less than 60 pounds (27 kg). [6] X Research source Do not use cardboard boxes as bins. If you use a bin, make sure it’s durable, leak-proof, and has a tight-fitting lid. Sanitation provides decal labels for free, which you can order through their website . Use green stickers for cardboard and mixed paper, and blue stickers for metal, glass, and plastic. [7] X Research source"

If you’re recycling cardboard in a bin with a secured lid, place it on the curb in front of your building between 6 PM and midnight on the night before collection. If you’re using a plastic bag or tying your cardboard into bundles, place them on the curb between 8 PM and midnight. [8] X Research source If your scheduled collection day falls on a holiday, Sanitation will collect it the following week. Make sure your recycling doesn’t block the street, and only put it on the curb the night before your collection day to avoid a fine. There’s no limit to the amount of recyclables you can put out for collection, so stack your recycling materials as high as you need to."
