      "title": "Check the school's website.",
      "content": "Check the school's website. Each year of school will be slightly different, as the students and dates will be different. The staff may change every few years too, so check the website to see updates. You may find teachers you have seen in school and some new teachers (or a lot depending on how long ago you graduated). For example, you may see some new middle school faculty instead of the teachers you saw when you were there."

      "title": "Look through your yearbooks.",
      "content": "Look through your yearbooks. Some kids have parents that get them a yearbook every year (so they end up having yearbooks throughout their school life- from elementary school to high school graduation), whereas some choose which years. Others choose the graduation years of yearbooks (5th grade/6th grade, 8th grade/9th grade, 12th grade), as these are the most important years. Check your yearbooks. You may find some old friends that you may still contact, and old classmates that you've lost contact with. You may find old crushes or romantic interests."

    {
      "title": "Try contacting old classmates.",
      "content": "Try contacting old classmates. If you have graduated recently, you probably still have their contacts (whether it's by a social media handle, phone number, Discord username, etc.), so try to contact them whenever possible. If you are still in school (in middle school or high school), try texting them after school. Their schedules may differ from yours, so they may get off school later. Ask them about their schedule to make sure you won't disturb them during class. If you have graduated for a while, look up your classmates' names on social media, or look through phone number books and contact lists on your phone."

    {
      "title": "Visit your old schools.",
      "content": "Visit your old schools. Once you have graduated a school, you may miss it at first. When you have the time, go back to your old school if you can. Plan to visit during a break you have. For example, go during teacher development day, where students have a day off. Or, if your current school has a break that your old school didn't have, utilize that break time to go. If you can get a day off work, go to your old schools. You may think of good memories, as well as embarrassing ones or bad ones."

      "title": "Attend school reunions.",
      "content": "Attend school reunions. If your school hosts school reunions, try going to one when you have time. School reunions are events which old alumni of a school (from a particular year) go there and meet their old friends to reconnect. At the school reunion, find your old friends and teachers and talk to them to update them about your life. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Go through pictures of yourself from school.",
      "content": "Go through pictures of yourself from school. Your parents probably took pictures of you when you were a kid. They probably took pictures of you when you achieved important milestones. The first days of elementary school, middle school, and high school (as well as the last days), and graduation of all those school stages are usually important school milestones. You may have a ton of photos from these times. Look through your picture albums and see how you've changed."

      "content": "Go through your childhood wardrobe. Did you love pink and ruffled clothing, or did you wear jeans and T-shirts? Was your hair curly or straight? Long or short? Look through pictures of yourself in school to see how much your style has changed. For fun, you can dress like your childhood or preteen self and to see how much you've changed since then."

Think back to what comfort foods you ate back then, and prepare the same thing to eat.
