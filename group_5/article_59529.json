      "content": "Sand the painting with 120-grit sandpaper to remove any texture. Apply firm pressure to the canvas, but not so much that you tear through the canvas. Work in circular motions around the painted areas that have a raised or bumpy texture. Keep rubbing them with the sandpaper until they are level with the rest of the canvas’ surface. [1] X Research source You don’t need to sand the canvas if it doesn’t have any raised textures. If you don’t sand the canvas, the original texture will still be visible through your painting and cause it to look uneven."

      "content": "Apply a thin coat of white acrylic paint to the canvas. Dip the end of a 2 in (5.1 cm) natural-bristle brush into your paint and spread it out on your canvas. Work in long back and forth strokes going either horizontally or vertically for your first coat. Spread the paint so the canvas has a thin even coat covering the original painting. [2] X Research source Avoid repainting over dark pieces of art since it will be hard to hide the original colors. Don’t apply the paint too thick or else it will take a long time to dry. It’s okay if the original painting still shows through the first coat."

After about 30 minutes, test the dryness of the paint by touching it with your finger. If there isn’t any paint on your finger, then you can move on. Otherwise, let it dry longer and check it again in 15-–20 minutes. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Paint another layer of white going in the opposite direction. If you painted the first coat vertically, then apply the second coat in horizontal strokes. Try to fill in any spots that you missed on the first coat or areas where you can still see the original painting. Make sure the second coat of paint creates a thin, even layer on the canvas. Let the second coat dry to the touch, which will take around 30–60 minutes, before painting on it. [4] X Research source If you still see the original painting through the second coat, then apply a third coat once it’s dry."

      "content": "Soak the canvas in rubbing alcohol for 1 hour to loosen the paint. Look for a container that’s large enough to hold the entire canvas, and place it outside or in a well-ventilated area. Fill the bottom of the container with 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of rubbing alcohol and put the canvas in it so the painted side is face-down. Leave the canvas alone for at least 1 hour. [5] X Research source You can also use turpentine or ammonia in place of rubbing alcohol if you want. If you don’t have a container for your canvas, spray the rubbing alcohol across the surface of the painting with a spray bottle."

Shake off any excess liquid and set it on a flat work surface. Place the putty knife along the edge of the canvas and slowly push it away from you to lift any loose paint from the surface. Continue scraping the paint until there aren’t any thick, textured areas. [6] X Research source The paint may have stained the canvas, so your canvas won’t look perfectly clean when you’re finished. Don’t apply too much pressure to the putty knife, or else you may rip through the canvas."

      "content": "Put on a second layer of gesso going in the opposite direction. Putting the gesso on in a different direction helps the canvas have a smoother finish and fills in spots you missed more effectively. If you put the first coat on horizontally, then use vertical strokes for the second layer. Continue brushing the gesso on until there’s a thin layer and you can’t see the paint underneath. Let the gesso dry for at least 1–2 days before you start painting on it. [16] X Research source If you need to apply additional layers of gesso to hide the underlayer of paint, then wait for 20–30 minutes before putting on another coat. You cannot use acrylic paints on oil-based gesso since it won’t adhere as well and could cause the painting to crack."

Bend the edges of the canvas around the frame and pull it tightly onto the back side of the frame. Hammer a nail or place a staple through the canvas in the center of the frame’s side to secure it in place. Rotate the frame and canvas so you can nail or staple the other long side so it’s pulled tight. Repeat the process on the 2 short sides.

Start your first coat of gesso going in either horizontal or vertical strokes using a 2 in (5.1 cm) natural-bristle paintbrush. Once you have a thin layer of gesso, let it dry to the touch for 20–30 minutes. When the first layer is dry, you can put on a second layer using strokes in the opposite direction that your first coat. You can also cover the painted side on the back of the canvas with gesso if you want to hide it."
