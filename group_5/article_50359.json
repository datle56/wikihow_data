      "title": "Set the fixed left edge on the sprinkler head.",
      "content": "Set the fixed left edge on the sprinkler head . Before you adjust the watering direction or distance, you will need to set the starting point for the water rotation. Find the center cap on the rotor case. Move it all the way to the right until it stops and you can no longer turn it. Then, move it to the left until it stops. Rotate the entire rotor case to line up the left edge in the correct position. [1] X Research source Do not rotate the rotor case past the left edge, as this can damage the case. The instructions to set the fix left edge will work for the Rain Bird 2SA, 42SA, 42SA+, 52SA Series."

      "content": "Move the sprinkler head by hand to adjust the watering direction. Grip the spray head between two fingers. Then, rotate it by hand so it is aimed at the direction you want the water to spray. [2] X Research source For example, if you want the water to spray towards the right, rotate the head to the right. If you want the water to spray more to the left, rotate the head to the left."

      "title": "Adjust the spray distance using a flat-bladed screwdriver.",
      "content": "Adjust the spray distance using a flat-bladed screwdriver. You can have the water on or off when you adjust the spray distance, though it may be easier with the water off. Take a flat-bladed screwdriver and place it on the center screw on the head. Then, turn the screw clockwise to decrease the spray distance up to 25 percent. [3] X Research source Be careful not to turn the screw so far that it goes into the head. It should sit just in front of the nozzle so the head is secure. The spray distance on Rain Bird models is 19 to 32 feet (5.8 to 9.8 m). If you want the distance to be any higher or shorter, you will need to change the rotor nozzles or adjust the water pressure ."

      "content": "Twist the collar to the left or right if you have an adjustable sprinkler head. If you have a Rain Bird sprinkler model that has an adjustable head (the 18/15/12 AP series), you can use your fingers to twist the collar. It can be adjusted from 0-360 degrees. To increase the spray pattern, move the threaded collar to the left. To decrease the spray pattern, move the threaded collar to the right. [4] X Research source Adjust the spray pattern while the sprinkler is on so you can determine how much of an increase or decrease you want. Adjusting the spray pattern is useful if you want to water a certain area of your lawn or spray only to a certain point in your yard."

You can also remove the nozzle and check the filter screen if the water dribbles or does not spray properly. You can then clean it or change it."
