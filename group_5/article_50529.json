This distance is called an inconjunct or a Quincunx aspect (in other words, the two constellations are far apart and don’t have much in common). This creates tension since quincunx signs struggle to really understand each other. As a result, Cancer and Aquarius don’t make a great match. Cancer is a cardinal water sign ruled by the moon and Aquarius is a fixed air sign ruled by Uranus. Cardinal signs are more flexible and intuitive than fixed signs, which can be stuck in their ways. Emotional water signs and intellectual air signs can get along if they prioritize communication and work to balance feelings and logic in their relationship."
