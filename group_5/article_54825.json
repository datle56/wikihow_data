      "title": "Take a milk bath.",
      "content": "Take a milk bath. Close the bathtub's drain, run the hot water, and add in 1–3 gallons (3.8–11.4 L) of milk. When in doubt, more is always better. Make sure to leave enough room so that when you get in, the bath doesn't spill over! Rest in the milk for 15-20 minutes. If you do this every day for a week, your skin will be brighter and more radiant. If Cleopatra did it, it's gotta be good, right? Always wash off after! You want naturally glowing skin, not skin that's glowing with a milky residue."

      "content": "Create a purifying mask. Milk is a natural source of lactic acid, which is an alpha hydroxy acid (found in over-the-counter acne washes) as well as fat, which can soothe your skin. [1] X Expert Source R. Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 14 May 2021. You can mix a couple of tablespoons of milk with a tablespoon or two of honey, lemon juice, baking soda, or all three. Break open a vitamin E tablet for additional purifying power. Apply it to your face (or whatever area you choose) and let it stiffen -- this should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Then rinse off with warm water. Your skin should feel smoothed and refreshed."

      "title": "Make an exfoliating scrub.",
      "content": "Make an exfoliating scrub. To get rid of that top layer of skin and expose a brand new you, use milk to exfoliate. Take 1 cup of milk and 3 tablespoons of oatmeal and apply it to your skin, gently rubbing it in. The oats provide the grittiness while the milk provides the nourishment. Allow it time to dry. Then rinse it off with warm water, scrubbing gently. If you'd like to make this in advance, make it with powdered milk and store in your refrigerator. Or you can soak 1/2 cup of almonds in milk overnight. Then in the morning, grind 'er up into a paste and apply to your skin, following the same drying and washing routine."

      "title": "Use a cotton ball on dark patches.",
      "content": "Use a cotton ball on dark patches. Just as lemon juice is said to lighten skin, the lactic acid in milk is said to work in a similar manner. If you have dark patches on your skin, take a cotton ball, soak it in milk, and apply it to the desired area. Allow it to dry overnight and then wash it off in the morning."

      "title": "Use it as a toner.",
      "content": "Use it as a toner. If you're not crazy on the idea of soaking your face in a layer of milk overnight, just use it as a toner. Apply milk to your face with a saturated cotton ball, leave it on for at least 15 minutes, and rinse well. With repeated use, it can bring out your skin's natural glow. Some say that milk lightens the skin. While it may or may not, keep this in mind if you choose to use milk to tone your skin. Overuse may have results you weren't looking for."

      "title": "Use it to shrink your pores.",
      "content": "Use it to shrink your pores. It isn't just milk that can do your skin good -- it's all those dairy products, too. If you're looking to shrink your pores, get sour -- with sour cream or buttermilk. All you need do is apply a thin layer to your skin and let it soak in for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse it off with warm water and rinse it well -- you don't want to be smelling like a sourpuss in the morning!"

      "title": "Don't just stick to cow's milk!",
      "content": "Don't just stick to cow's milk! It's the first thing many of us go to when we think of milk, but there are so many varieties out there. Full fat cow's milk is great, but goat's milk is super good too -- in fact, goat's milk has a pH level that's close to our skin's natural level, so our skin takes to it very well. And for you animal activists, the good news is that rice, soy, and almond work similarly! But don't forget powdered milk! It's easy to store and doesn't go bad nearly as fast. 5 tablespoons or so in any concoction will get the job done."

    {
      "title": "Always go full fat.",
      "content": "Always go full fat. Just for the record, if you're using milk, don't scrimp on the fat. The thicker and creamier it is, the better. It hydrates your skin even more, moisturizing it with the vitamins and proteins from the fat. For this reason, whole fat goat's or cow's milk is probably best (though others can work in a pinch). This goes for yogurt and other dairy products, too (buttermilk, sour cream, etc.). You can totally substitute these for milk if you're out -- or saving it for your bowl of cereal come morning."

      "title": "Try premade products.",
      "content": "Try premade products. Milk baths and the like are so popular that many beauty companies have caught on -- you can actually buy pre-mixed milk bath powders that make the process even easier. They're a bit more expensive though and can't be drank if you're thirsty!"

      "title": "Add in extras.",
      "content": "Add in extras. That milk bath can be made even more enjoyable if you add a little extra something to it. Namely, herbs, dried petals, salts, or essential oils. We're getting aromatic up in here, folks. It's not just good for your skin -- it's pleasing to your nostrils and uber-relaxing to boot! Bath salts can help exfoliate while dried petals, herbs, and oils are just plain soothing and relaxing. There are dozens and dozens of options out there, so take a trip to your local scent shop and try a few out for scent."
