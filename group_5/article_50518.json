      "content": "Unfocused With their head in the clouds, an Aquarius Pisces cusp can be spacey and forgetful. This cusp is so focused on their dreams to change the world, that they can lose track of what’s going down on Earth below them. They might show up late to a friend’s birthday party or miss a dentist appointment entirely because they’re so caught up in their thoughts. [3] X Research source As an air sign, Aquarius can clash with Pisces, leading to disorganization. Pisces is a sensitive water sign who tends to overthink. When combined with Aquarius’ analytical mind and flighty tendencies, it’s no wonder they get lost in their own thoughts.

      "title": "Detached",
      "content": "Detached An Aquarius Pisces cusp is so focused on things bigger than themselves, that they sometimes come across as aloof. While this cusp is one of the most empathetic signs in the zodiac, their perspective can be so macro that keeping in touch with friends and making small talk falls off their radar. If you’re an Aquarius Pisces cusp, make time to keep in touch with your family and friends. If you send a daily text, organize monthly video calls, and make weekly hang-out plans, you’ll still have plenty of room in your schedule to focus on the big picture."

      "content": "Moody Empathy often comes at a price, which can cause Aquarius Pisces cusps to absorb more energy than they can deal with. There’s so many people and causes they want to help, so they often feel overworked and mentally drained. This cusp can then turn inwards, making them seem gloomy and testy as a result. [4] X Research source As an Aquarius Pisces cusp, it’s okay to take a step back and make time for yourself. Take a breath and de-stress by going for a calming walk, drawing up a bubble bath, and curling up with a good book—bonus if it’s about self-help!"

      "content": "An Aquarius Pisces cusp’s soulmates are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. These 3 earth signs are drawn to an Aquarius Pisces cusp’s sensitive soul. They will gladly look after this cusp when they get overwhelmed and patiently listen to their wild dreams. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn help ground the flighty side of an Aquarius Pisces cusp, while they in turn teach these earth signs how to enjoy the mysteries of life. [5] X Research source An Aquarius Pisces cusp also gets along with the other air signs. Gemini and Libra can keep up with this cusp's thirst for knowledge and will love starting lively debates. Water signs also make a great pairing for this cusp. Cancer and Scorpio are brimming with dreams and creativity, and also deeply understand this cusp’s sensitive side. Love between this cusp and the passionate fire signs of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius often burns hot, but fizzles out quickly. If these fire signs learn to appreciate this cusp’s sensitivity, while they in turn live more on the wild side, they can work out."
