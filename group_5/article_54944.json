      "content": "Sweep up any berries or nuts that fall to the ground. Chipmunks will munch on any fallen berries or nuts that they find in your yard. If they become accustomed to a constant food source, they will keep visiting. Sweep up any nuts or fruit as soon as you see it so that it doesn’t attract new chipmunks. [1] X Research source If you have a birdfeeder, sweep up any seeds that fall to the ground."

      "content": "Remove any rocks, vines, or piles of debris where the chipmunks may hide. Chipmunks will look for areas where they can easily hide from predators and people. If you don’t have any trees in your yard, they will hide under rock piles, shrubs, and piles of wood or sticks. [2] X Research source Sometimes, chipmunks will even create tunnels under the piles of debris which makes them harder to locate.

      "content": "Cut overgrown shrubs and grass to eliminate potential chipmunk hiding spots. Avoid planting a row or group of shrubs in a continuous area in your yard because chipmunks will target these locations to make a home. Chipmunks may also hide in high patches of grass if it goes uncut. Keeping the shrubs and grass short around your house will limit the amount of space that the chipmunks have to hide.

      "content": "Spray a taste repellent on your plants if the chipmunks keep coming back. Repellents like bitrex, thiram, and ammonium soaps will make the plants in your garden or yard taste bad and prevent chipmunks from eating them. You can purchase these repellents online or at some gardening stores. Fill a spray bottle with the repellent according to the instructions and spray the solution generously onto any plants the chipmunks have been targeting. It may take repeated applications of the spray for it to start working. No taste repellent has a 100% chance of repelling chipmunks."

Chipmunks can squeeze in between cracks and crevices in your home. Use caulk or construction foam to close up any cracks on the outside of your house. Use rubber or plastic stripping to close any openings around doors or windows. If you have an open vent or hole that leads to the outside of the house, cover the area with wire mesh.

Installing wire mesh in an L shape under the ground against house foundations, decks, and other structures can prevent chipmunks from burrowing under your structures. Purchase 1 by 1 inches (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) wire mesh from a hardware store or online and install it around the structure you want to protect in an L shape. Bury the mesh at least 1 foot (30 cm) into the ground and bend the bottom in a 90-degree angle. This will stop the chipmunks in their tracks.

If you notice that chipmunks have already made a home in your attic or another room in your house, sprinkle 4–5 pounds (1.8–2.3 kg) of flakes for every 2,000 square feet (190 m 2 ) of space. Keep in mind that moth flakes give off a strong odor and could irritate humans and pets."

Look online or in the yellow pages for an exterminator. You can request that they use humane methods if you don’t want to kill the chipmunks. Laying down poison could cause the chipmunk to die in the walls or roof of your home and leave a foul odor. For this reason, it's best that you contact a professional instead of trying to kill it yourself."
