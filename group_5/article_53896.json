      "content": "Track your meals . When attempting to eliminate a certain food group or type of food, it will be helpful to journal your current eating habits. This will help you be more aware of what types of processed foods you're eating, when you're eating them, and how frequently you're eating them. Purchase a journal or download a journaling app on your smartphone. Ideally, track a few weekdays and a few weekend days. You might find that your eating habits are different on a weekend day compared to a work day. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Many times people choose processed foods out of convenience — they're late to work, don't have time to cook, or didn't have another option handy when they were hungry. Try to dig up any patterns in your diet. For example, you're typically late for work and go through the drive-through for breakfast."

As you remove different foods from your regular meal plan, you can add in a more whole, unprocessed foods to replace them. A written meal plan can help you visually plan everything out for your week. Spend some time writing up your ideas for all meals and snacks in your free time. This can also be the basis for your grocery list. When designing your own meal plan, make sure you take into consideration the amount of quick meals that will be necessary for the week. When you plan in advance for quick and easy or on-the-go meals, you might be less tempted to grab a processed food."

      "content": "Clean out your kitchen. Before you overhaul your diet, think about what you typically buy from the grocery store and what you have stocked in your kitchen. Go through your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry and throw out any processed foods you find, removing the temptation. Items to look for include: sweets like ice cream, candy, cookies or snack cakes; chips, crackers or pretzels; cereals; sauces, dressings or marinades; deli meats and cheese; and frozen entrees or microwavable meals. These items are generally full of preservatives and loaded with sodium. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Since most foods do go through some processing, decide what your limit is for \"tossing\" or \"keeping.\" For example, canned beans are a processed food, but are a great source of fiber and protein. [5] X Research source In addition, as long as you rinse and drain canned beans, they're considerably lower in sodium. [6] X Research source Foods like these might be items you want to keep. Other processed foods that you may want to keep include no-salt-added or low-sodium canned vegetables, 100% whole grain foods (like 100% whole wheat pasta or brown rice), pre-washed/pre-cut vegetables (like bagged lettuce), or all-natural nut butters. If you feel bad about throwing all of that food away, either donate it to a food shelter or eat it in smaller doses until it's gone and you are mainly eating whole foods."

      "content": "Restock your kitchen with healthy foods. Go grocery shopping and leave out the processed snacks. Stick to the outside aisles of the store or perimeter of the store — that's typically where you will find the most whole, unprocessed foods. Aim to purchase the majority of your food from these sections: the produce section, fresh meat counters, dairy, and egg case. Frozen items are also found on the perimeter of the store and contain both highly processed and minimally processed foods. As long as items are not prepared in sauces or gravies or have a lot of additives, they can be considered an acceptable and nutritious choice. Be wary of what foods you choose when shopping the aisles. Purchase healthy, nutritious processed foods such as canned beans, 100% whole grains or canned vegetables. Also, make sure these items have few added ingredients as well. For example, purchase plain 100% whole wheat pasta instead of a pasta with a seasoning or sauce mix included or purchase plain, low-sodium canned vegetables instead of canned vegetables that contain a sauce or other flavorings. If some of your favorite processed foods live in the aisles and are tempting to buy try to skip those aisles completely. For example, don't walk down the candy and chip aisle so you're not tempted to throw something processed in your cart."

      "content": "Read the food label on all packaged foods. Since the processing of foods can vary widely, reading the food labels will give you the most detailed and accurate information on how processed a food is and what has been changed or added to it. The ingredient label on packaged foods allows consumers to know exactly what's in the food. It lists all ingredients from the highest quantity to the lowest quantity present in the food. In addition, you'll find any additives, preservatives or flavorings present in the food. There are a variety of tips or tricks to help consumers decide what level of processing is acceptable. It's typically recommended to not purchase foods with ingredients that you cannot pronounce. For example, some processed foods include ingredients like diacetyl (a butter flavoring) or potassium sorbate (a chemical used to prolong shelf life). [7] X Research source Note that if a company has a proprietary blend (of things like spices or flavorings), they are not legally required to disclose those ingredients. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If you see this listed on an ingredient label, you may not want to purchase this item. Note some additives can make a food more nutritious. For example, some companies add in vitamins or minerals to their foods. Even though these additives may not be familiar, they actually improve the nutrition content of the food."

Tofu, tempeh, and seitan are vegetarian protein sources but are typically considered more processed.

Do not choose pre-cooked, \"microwave\" or quick cooking items as these have been processed further to help decrease home cooking times. Avoid processed grains including white rice, plain pasta, white bread, desserts, cakes, cookies, and pies."

      "content": "Cook meals without processed foods. Once your kitchen is stocked, you can begin preparing meals without processed foods. Make the basis of each meal whole foods like protein (poultry, red meat, pork, seafood, low-fat dairy or legumes), fruits, and vegetables. An easy way to start cooking a meal is with the main protein or main dish. Pair this with one to two side items like a fruit, vegetable, or 100% whole grain for a complete meal. Avoid processed meals like TV dinners, frozen pizza, canned soup, lunch-ables, and pre-packaged sandwiches. An example of a day of meals with minimized processed foods would look like: 2 scrambled eggs with spinach and feta cheese at breakfast, a salad with home cooked grilled chicken with a homemade salad dressing for lunch, 1/3 cup of homemade granola and an apple for an afternoon snack, baked salmon with steamed broccoli and 1/3 cup brown rice for dinner and grilled pineapple with a drizzle of honey for dessert."

If you don't have an unprocessed snack handy, more processed foods become an easy, fast, and tempting bite to eat. Pre-prepping healthy snacks to take with you is essential if you want to avoid overly processed foods. Try to keep healthier, unprocessed snack foods handy whenever possible. For example, keep shelf stable fruit (like apples), nuts or homemade granola in your work desk drawer. If you have access to a refrigerator, stock up with items like plain yogurts, raw vegetables, and homemade hummus or hard boiled eggs. Avoid common processed snacks like: candy, chips, crackers, snack cakes, portion-controlled cookie packs or granola/protein bars. If you forgot your homemade snack or don't have access to one, stick with the least processed snack foods available. For example, many vending machines sell packages of roasted peanuts or trail mix."

Although menu options have improved in the last few years, it will be much more difficult to find whole, unprocessed foods at these types of restaurants. Hamburgers, french fries, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, pizza, and other similar foods are examples of foods that are commonly available at convenience or fast food restaurants. These foods are not only highly processed but when eaten on a regular basis can put you at risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity. If it's necessary to eat or find food options at a fast food restaurant, try to choose items that are as whole and unprocessed as possible. Salad with grilled chicken is an example of a less processed item you could order."

Choose wisely and decide what \"moderation\" truly is for you. If a few of your favorite foods are processed, instead of eliminating them permanently, maybe you decide to have them every Friday night or just once a month.
