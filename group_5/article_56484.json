A good night text is a clear message that you were on his mind as he was winding down his day and getting ready to go to sleep. Both messages are huge signs that the guy can’t stop thinking about you. [1] X Research source It could be something simple like, “Good morning!” or something a little more flirty like, “Hey beautiful.
