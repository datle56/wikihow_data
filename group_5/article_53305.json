      "content": "Don't forget that, above all else, an autistic child is a child. Any given child has their own preferences, quirks, behaviors, and reactions. Any child has things they don't like, and things they do. Being autistic doesn't change this. Any discipline techniques you use should approach difficult behavioural situations with understanding. Focus on providing your child the support they need to control themselves and turn \"naughty\" behaviour into more constructive actions. All kids misbehave sometimes. They may break rules (accidentally or on purpose), and have trouble controlling themselves when they're upset. It's important to be understanding but firm in teaching them how to behave better. Remember to be fair. It's not right to punish a child for \"acting autistic\" (like stimming or avoiding eye contact), nor is it fair to punish an autistic child (or any child for that matter) for breaking rules that other kids can get away with breaking."

With time, with use of the strategies covered below, your autistic child will learn better ways to behave. This won't happen overnight. Remember that autistic children experience extra challenges. Sensory issues, communication difficulties, strong emotions, and other issues can be very frustrating to handle. Keep in mind that autistic children's listening body language may look different from the listening body language of non-autistic children. Stimming , looking in other directions, and not appearing to respond doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't listening."

      "content": "Handle meltdowns with care. A lot of what you might think of as \"bad behaviour\" in autistic children comes in the form of meltdowns. This can be particularly difficult to react to with younger children or others who don't use verbal communication to express when they're upset. What may look like a \"bad behaviour\" tantrum in some can actually be an attempt to express their needs, deal with unsettling sensory experiences, or handle stress. Ideally, you want to create a plan to help teach the child to avoid meltdowns themselves. Classic \"disciplinary\" tactics that focus on punishment, like time-outs, can make things worse by upsetting the child further and removing any sense that they have control over their decisions. Instead, teaching a child to take a “break” and introduce self-calming techniques empowers the child to manage their time and emotions and encourage the child to self-regulate. Our articles on How to Deal with Autistic Children's Meltdowns and How to Reduce Meltdowns and Tantrums in Autistic Children can offer more detailed advice on helping reduce and manage meltdowns."

Create set places where activities occur. This can help the child stay calm and feel in control of things. Routines also make it easier to narrow down why the child might be acting out. For example, if they always cry when you ask them to do homework after school, it might be that school tires them out too much and they need to relax first, or that homework is a source of major stress for them."

Picture schedules are wonderful tools parents can use to help guide some autistic children through different activities they will undertake during the day. It helps improve structure in a child’s life particularly because autistic children often have difficulty keeping an overview of their daily activities. Some ideas for ways to use picture schedules include: [4] X Research source Rapin, I. &amp; Tuchman RF. (2008) Autism: definition, neurobiology, screening, diagnosis. Pediatric Clinician North America 55(5):1129–46. You and your child can keep track of tasks by “ticking off” completed activities. You and your child can keep a clock or a light-up timer near the activities to determine the time frame for each activity (if this helps the child). Help your child to design and draw these pictures so they feel more of a connection with the images. Keep the images in a book or on a board or wall so that your child can refer to them whenever they please."

While the schedule should remain relatively consistent, this does not mean there is no room for development of your child’s activities and discipline as your child makes their natural progression in development and growth as an individual. For example, bath time may turn into shower time once your child learns to shower independently. Make changes to help fix issues as needed. For example, if you schedule exercise time after lunch, and the child often gets a stomachache during exercise, it might be that they need time for the food to settle. Talk to the child about the schedule issue, and brainstorm how to rearrange things (like exercising before eating, or having 30 minutes of free time in between)."

Autistic children can be especially vulnerable to stress, so it's critical for them to get enough \"down time.\" Down time is particularly relevant when your child feels there is too much going on and their senses have been overloaded. When your child becomes distressed or upset because of this over-stimulation, this indicative of the need for down time. Simply take your child to a safe, quiet place and allow your child to ‘relax’ in a simple environment under casual supervision. Try to plan relaxation time after activities that tend to be stressful. For example, if the child usually comes home from school stressed or tired, then they should have at least half an hour of free time to unwind. If the child isn't old enough to go unsupervised, you can offer casual supervision. For example, the child could rock back and forth and draw pictures in a corner, while you read a book or do something on your phone."

Since stress can be a problem for autistic kids, relaxation time is especially critical. Self-directed play helps the child stay happy and emotionally balanced. Keep in mind that your idea of \"fun\" might be different from the child's idea. For example, a noisy party might be stressful for an autistic child. And lining up toys or walking in circles might be an enjoyable way for an autistic kid to spend time. If the child likes it, then it counts as fun, even if you don't understand it. Being bossed around by an adult usually doesn't count as fun, even if the adult is telling the child to play. If you play with the child, let them take the lead."

Before you can discipline your child, you must understand why your child is acting out. If you don’t understand the cause, you may discipline them in a way that, to them, actually reinforces the bad behavior. For example, if your child is acting out at bedtime and you are not sure why, you may choose to put her in time out. However, a “time out” could in fact be rewarding the child if her goal is to put off going to bed for as long as possible. Through discipline without understanding the cause, you are actually showing her that if she misbehaves at bedtime, she will get to stay up later. Sometimes children act out because of an external stressor that they don't know how to handle (e.g. screaming and crying because of loud music that hurts their ears). In these cases, it's best to remove the stressor, discuss coping and communication strategies, and forego punishment."

For example, your child may want to avoid something or a situation so they may “act out” to avoid the situation. Or, they may be trying to get attention or gain something else. Sometimes it can be hard to tell which is your child’s end goal--you will have to observe your child to fully understand. Sometimes children act out without any particular goal; they simply don't understand how to handle their stress.

If the child is behaving ‘unusually’ for an activity they typically enjoy, then this could be indicative they’re seeking more attention. For instance, your child may “act out” when it is time for a bath. If she does this right before or during bath time, you can conclude that she is acting badly because she does not want to take a bath. Or she may simply be bothered by an odor or the temperature of the water."
