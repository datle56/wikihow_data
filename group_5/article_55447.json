      "content": "Send 🤝 as a greeting, especially if you’re “meeting” someone new. Just like in real life, a handshaking emoji over text, on social media, or even on a dating app is a way to politely say hello to or meet a new acquaintance. Send the emoji along with a short message along the lines of “Hello!” or “Nice to meet you!” to be friendly and kick off the conversation . Use the 🤝 emoji with friends or in casual encounters—it’s probably not considered “professional” to send an emoji to your boss, for example (even though it’s very professional to shake hands in person).

Whether you were playfully bickering with a pal about where to grab dinner or negotiating with your partner about who has to take the dog out after work, send 🤝 to say “you’ve got a deal” or “I accept your terms.” In a group chat setting, send 🤝 as a shorthand way to support a suggestion or acknowledge a group consensus (similar to using the ✋ (hand) emoji ).

If you and a pal have been going back and forth in a light argument or you just want to have peace between you after a small misunderstanding, use the 🤝 emoji to say “let’s put this behind us.” Keep in mind that an emoji is usually only good for silly or very minor disagreements (a serious, relationship-altering argument probably needs a face-to-face conversation).

Remember that a truce doesn’t have to mean everything’s A-OK, but it lets the other person know you’re committed to finding a resolution or moving peacefully forward. Include a short message with your emoji, or send a 🤝 by itself to acknowledge the truce. Them: “I promise I won’t spread any more rumors about you, and I’m sorry I hurt you. Truce? 🤝” You: “Of course, I forgive you. Truce! 🤝” Them: “OK, no more pranks at school! Lol you win! Let’s have a truce 🤝” You: “Haha, gotcha! Fine, truce it is 🤝”"
