      "content": "Measure the longest side of the package that has a flap to find the length. Identify the longest side of the package that has a flap attached to it. Hold a ruler or tape measure up to the edge and read the length of the box from one end to the other. Round your measurement to the nearest 1 in (2.5 cm) or 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). [1] X Research source Jot down the measurements on a scrap piece of paper so you can refer to them later. Many shipping services only handle packages up to a certain size, which is typically noted in whole inches or centimeters. The actual length of your package might vary by 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm)."

      "content": "Measure the other side with a flap to find the width. The width is the distance from one “wall” of the shortest side of the box to the opposite wall. Stretch your ruler or tape across the package from edge-to-edge, then round to the nearest 1 in (2.5 cm) or 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). [2] X Research source The actual width of your package might vary by 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm)."

Round the box’s height dimension to the closest 1 in (2.5 cm) or 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). [3] X Research source The actual height of your package might vary by 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm)."

      "content": "Multiply the length, width, and height of the box to find its volume. Volume is the same as cubic size, which indicates the amount of space inside the box. If you have a package with a length of 12 inches (30 cm), a width of 8 inches (20 cm), and a height of 4 inches (10 cm), its volume, or cubic size, would be 384 cubic inches (6,290 cm 3 ). [4] X Research source Or if you have a box with a length of 12 inches (30 cm), a width of 3 inches (7.6 cm), and a height of 17.5 inches (44 cm), its volume would be 630 cubic inches (10,300 cm 3 )."

      "title": "Divide the volume by the shipping carrier’s divisor to find its dimensional weight.",
      "content": "Divide the volume by the shipping carrier’s divisor to find its dimensional weight. Many major shipping companies use the dimensional (dim) weight to calculate shipping costs. [5] X Research source The dimensional weight is based not only on the package’s size but its destination and shipping carrier. Contact your preferred shipping carrier to find out their specific divisor. Here are the divisors (for Imperial measurements) for a few of the common carriers in the U.S.: FedEx: For U.S., Puerto Rico, or international shipments, divide the cubic size by 139. [6] X Research source UPS: Divide the cubic size by 139 for Daily Rates and 166 for Retail Rates. [7] X Research source USPS: If the volume of the package goes over 1,728 cubic inches (28,320 cm 3 ), divide the cubic size by 166 and round up to the next whole number. [8] X Research source For example, if the volume of your box is 384 cubic inches (6,290 cm 3 ) and you’re shipping with FedEx (139), its dimensional weight is 2.76 cubic inches (45.2 cm 3 ). To find the dimensional weight of an irregularly-shaped package, multiply the volume by an adjustment factor of 0.785, then divide the answer by the shipping carrier’s divisor. [9] X Research source Keep the dimensional weight exact to give you a rough estimate of the box’s shipping costs—try to avoid rounding."

Record the weight without rounding it up because you’ll compare it with the package’s dimensional weight to see how much you can expect to pay for shipping. [10] X Research source You can request to have your package measured at the post office if you don’t own a postage scale."

      "content": "Compare your package’s actual weight to its dimensional weight. If the dimensional weight is greater than the actual weight, you’ll pay the dimensional weight price. Most shipping carriers charge whichever of the two weights is greater to maximize their profits per shipment. [11] X Research source It’s important to know the actual weight of your package as well as its dimensional weight since the dimensional weight is only an estimate, not a precise measurement."

      "content": "Double the width and height and add them together to find the girth. After you find the length, width, and height of the package, multiply the width and height dimensions by 2. Then, add the doubled width and doubled height together. The number you get is the girth of the box. [12] X Research source If your box is 12 inches (30 cm) long, 4 inches (10 cm) wide, and 6 inches (15 cm) tall, doubling the width and height would give you 8 inches (20 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm). When you add 8 inches (20 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm), the girth is 20 inches (51 cm). The term “girth” refers to the total distance around the thickest part of the box. [13] X Research source This only applies to the area encircling the shortest side of the package, so the length isn’t required."

      "content": "Add the combined length and girth to get your total package size. When shipping ground packages, you might be asked to provide the overall size of the package. To do this, simply add the length and girth measurements together. If you add a length of 12 inches (30 cm) to a girth of 20 inches (51 cm), you’d get a total size of 32 inches (81 cm). If the package you’re shipping is larger than 105 inches (270 cm) in combined girth and length, you may be charged an additional special handling fee. [14] X Research source The maximum size for most packages is 130 inches (330 cm). The maximum weight is 70 pounds (32 kg) for international packages and 50 pounds (23 kg) for U.S. ground packages.
