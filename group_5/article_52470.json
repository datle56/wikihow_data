If you only have one Fire TV device, it should link to Alexa automatically as long as they are both signed in to the same Amazon account. Voice commands should already work. Skip ahead to the next part for more on specific commands to use. While multiple Alexa devices can control each Fire TV (though not simultaneously), each Alexa device can only be linked to one Fire TV. So if you want to control multiple Fire TVs with Alexa, you will need at least one Alexa Device per Fire TV."
