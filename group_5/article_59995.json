Starting with the player on their left, the dealer gives either 2 or 3 cards to each person. For playing a standard 5-player game, deal the cards out so each player has 6 cards in their hand.

If someone chooses to take the blind, they become the “picker” and take the 2 face-down cards into their hand. Then, they set 2 cards face-down in front of them to “bury” them. [8] X Research source Strategy Tip: If you have 5 cards of the trump suit or have 1 Queen and 3 other trump cards, pick up the blind because you have a strong hand. Taking the blind signals that you feel confident that you’re able to win 61 or more points during the round and that you want to compete against the other players. If no one takes the blind, then players work individually to try earning the least amount of points during the round."

The remaining players form the opposing team. [9] X Research source Whoever is holding the Ace of the called suit does not reveal themselves to the picker right away. The picker only learns who their partner is after the called Ace has been played later during the round. Variation: Instead of calling a fail suit, the picker’s partner is whoever has the Jack of Diamonds in their hand."

They’ll play against the other 4 people at the table without any help. [10] X Research source Going alone doesn’t give any bonus points at the end of the round, but it does prevent a partner player from earning points. Strategy Tip: Only choose to go alone if all of your cards are high-ranking in the trump suit because you’ll have the best opportunity of winning the round."
