It begins with \"I feel...\" after which you immediately state your feeling. Then, you state the action that led to that feeling. Lastly, you explain why you feel the way you do. For example, you may be inclined to say something like, \"You yell all the time about my grades because you think I'm stupid. It's really mean because you know I try hard.\" This sounds very hostile, and it could put your dad on the defense right away. You can use an \"I\"-statement to better express that feeling.
