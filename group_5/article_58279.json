But you might be easily hurt by Gemini’s communication style. You know she cares about you, so try to remind yourself, even when you feel triggered. If she says “I feel suffocated,” this isn’t a reflection of you, but her fears about relationships generally. Gemini: It’s hard for you to share feelings all the time. Focus on communicating goals and desires instead. You might never think to say “I feel scared of commitment and need time to process,” but “I want more time to explore, but I don’t want to hurt you” might roll off the tongue more easily."

      "content": "Vulnerability Pisces has no issue with vulnerability, but for Gemini, this might be a helpful area to focus on. Oftentimes, Gemini’s a heartbreaker because she avoids truly opening herself up to others (so she hasn't risked anything emotionally). But to find a meaningful connection, taking a risk will be necessary. Gemini: Start small and work your way up. At first, get comfortable sharing little things, like stories from your childhood. Then eventually, share bigger, deeper emotions to feel a true weight lifted and a genuine connection form. Then, afterwards, reflect on how that felt. It was scary, sure. But don’t you feel closer to Pisces now that you’ve been brave and open? You can trust that Pisces will feel infinitely closer to you too."
