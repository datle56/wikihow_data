If you don't want to use the emoji keyboard, or if it doesn't work, click the grinning (😀) emoji to the right of the GIF and Nitro Gift buttons. It will change emojis when you hover over it and will open the built-in Discord emoji keyboard when clicked. You can then scroll through emojis there and click away when you're done! You can also change the skin tone of the emojis shown by clicking the OK hand (👌) to the right of the search bar and magnifying glass. It will show a drop-down menu of skin tones. Select a skin tone for the OK hand (👌) and all of the emojis with skin tones will be changed."

      "title": "Use a semicolon :",
      "content": "Use a semicolon : followed by the emoji name and another semicolon : to directly type emojis. If you want to skip the emoji keyboard altogether or already remember an emoji's name, use two semicolons (:) and type the emoji name in the middle. For example, the grinning (😀) emoji would be :grinning:. To change the skin tone of typed emojis, type the emoji name and end it with the corresponding skin tone code: No code for the classic yellow skin tone (👌). :skin-tone-1: for the light skin tone (👌🏻). :skin-tone-2: for the medium-light skin tone (👌🏼). :skin-tone-3: for the medium skin tone (👌🏽). :skin-tone-4: for the medium-dark skin tone (👌🏾). :skin-tone-5: for the dark skin tone (👌🏿). To use the skin tone codes, put the emoji name in the form of :emoji_name:. Then, add another semicolon (:) and put the skin tone code, ended with another semicolon (:). An example is :ok_hand::skin-tone-1: for the light skin tone OK hand (👌🏻) emoji. Some emojis have multiple codes. For example, :laughing: and :satisfied: are the same emoji (😆), as well as :skull: and :skeleton: (💀)!"
