The reason you're only adding your own address here is so members of the group cannot see each others' names and email addresses. This also prevents peoples' responses to your message from being delivered to everyone on the list. Alternatively, if you want your mailing list to be an ongoing discussion in which everyone can reply to all members, you can type the group name into the \"To\" field instead. Keep in mind that these will make all group members' names and email addresses visible to everyone who receives the message. This is not recommended because there's no way to \"unsubscribe\" from a group message like this."

Most mailboxes cannot handle attachments larger than 2 GB in size. If you need to attach a large file, use a cloud service like Dropbox or Google Drive . To use one of Yahoo's colorful stationery options, click the icon of a book with a heart inside at the bottom of the message.
