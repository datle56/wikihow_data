      "content": "Count up high-card points from aces and face cards. High-card points, or HCP, are a way to determine the strength of your hand during a round. Before you make your first bid in a game of bridge, look for face cards and aces you have in your hand. The points for each card are: [1] X Research source Ace: 4 HCP King: 3 HCP Queen: 2 HCP Jack: 1 HCP"

      "content": "Add extra HCP if you have suits with more than 4 cards. When you have more than 4 cards in a single suit, you are “long” in that suit and it makes your hand stronger. If you have 4 cards of a suit, earn 1 HCP for each additional card in that suit. Add the HCP to any points you have from aces and face cards. [2] X Research source Example: If you have 7 cards that are hearts, the suit is worth 3 HCP. If you also have 2 Kings and a Jack, you’d have a total of 10 HCP in your hand."

      "content": "Count points for short suits if you have a trump fit. If you believe you and your partner have 8 cards of the same suit, your team has a “trump fit.” Your short suits become more valuable when your team has a majority because you can easily make it the trump suit, or the suit that is stronger than any other. Points for short suits are: [3] X Research source Void (no cards of a suit): 5 HCP Singleton (1 card of a suit): 3 HCP Doubleton (2 cards of a suit): 1 HCP"

      "content": "Open with 1 no-trump if you have between 15 and 17 HCP. A no-trump bid means that you want to play the hand without any trump suit. A no-trump bid also tells your partner that you have a balanced distribution of cards in your hand with 15 to 17 high-card points. [4] X Research source A balanced hand means you have about the same number of cards in each suit. Your hand is balanced if it has no voids or singletons, and at most one doubleton."

If you say 1-Heart, then you’re communicating that you have 5 or more hearts in your hand. Make sure you have at least 12 HCP in your hand before making your bid. [5] X Research source Spades and hearts are considered the major suits in bridge, so it’s important to let your partner know if you’re holding a lot of them in your hand."

      "content": "Bid 1-Club or 1-Diamond if you have 13-21 HCP and 3 cards in suit. Clubs and diamonds are considered minor suits, so they aren’t considered as strong in a bridge game. If you have 3 or more cards in clubs or diamonds, choose the longer suit for your opening bid. [6] X Research source This bid is also known as a “convenient minor” because it tells your partner you have high-card points in your hand but don’t meet the requirements for the other higher bids."

Even if you don’t have a lot of cards in the club suit, bidding a 2-Club right away lets your partner know you have a high number of HCP in your hand. [7] X Research source Example: If you have 3 Aces, 2 Kings, 2 Queens, and 2 Jacks, your hand would contain 24 HCP. If you have a balanced hand and exactly 20-21 HCP, then bid 2-No-Trump instead."

If you only have 11 or 12 HCP in your hand, it’s usually best to pass the bid unless your hand meets specific requirements. The suit you bid on depends on the exact cards you hold, but the criteria to look for includes: [8] X Research source You have 2 or more quick tricks. An ace-king set counts as 2 quick tricks, an ace-queen counts as 1 ½, an ace or king-queen set counts as 1, and a single king counts as ½. Open in the suit you have the most quick tricks in. You have high-ranked cards in long suits. For example, if you have the ace, jack, 10, 9, and 8 in spades, you could safely make a 1-Spades bid. You have long, strong major suits. When you have HCP cards in spades or hearts, you have a stronger hand. Bid with your next longest minor suit to see how your partner responds."

Rather than risking it on a bid, pass right away to let your partner know you don’t have a lot of high cards. [9] X Research source Example: If your hand includes 1 Ace, 1 King, 1 Queen, and 1 Jack as its only high-card points, then your total would only be 10 HCP and you should pass."

If your partner opens the bid on the 1-level of a major suit, check if you have at least 3 other cards in the same suit. If you have 6-9 HCP in your hand, raise the bid to a 2-Heart or 2-Spade to show you can support the suit.

When your partner opens with 1-Club or 1-Diamond, they’re saying they don’t have a lot of points in the major suits.

[11] X Research source Example: If your partner bid 1-Diamond but you have 5 spades in your hand, then say “1-Spades” for your bid.

How you bid depends on the HCP and number of cards you have in each suit, but you'll usually let your partner know what suit is the strongest in your hand. Use the following strategies to determine the best bid for you. [12] X Research source Bid 1 of a new suit if you have at least 4 cards in that suit and 6+ HCP. Bid 2 of a new minor suit when you have 4 or more cards in the suit and 10-11 HCP. Bid 2 of a new major suit if you have 5 or more cards and 10-11 HCP.

Raise the minor suit from your partner’s bid by 1 level if you have 4-5 cards in that suit, 6-10 HCP, and no major suits with 4+ cards.

If you bid 2-Clubs to a 1-No-Trump opening, it’s called a Stayman . This bid is asking your partner if you have major suit cards. If your partner bids 2-Diamond in response, then they don’t have enough cards in a major suit. If they bid 2-Heart or 2-Spade, it means they have 4 cards in that suit."

At this point, it’s time to start the game and players can play tricks, or putting down cards. [21] X Research source Example: If a team makes a bid of 2-Diamonds, then they must win a total of 8 tricks with diamonds as the trump suit. The player who names the final contract suit first is called the “declarer” and their partner is the “dummy.” The dummy puts their cards face-up on the table and sits out for the round, while the declarer plays from both their and their partner’s hand."
