      "content": "Develop a healthy weight goal and weight loss plan with your doctor. Instead of trying a crash diet or some other weight loss fad you saw online, schedule an appointment with your doctor. They’ll determine whether you would benefit from losing weight, then work with you to choose the right goals and methods based on your individual circumstances. While your body mass index (BMI) can help indicate whether you’d benefit from losing weight, many factors go into determining your ideal weight range. Your doctor may take your medical history, family history, and current fitness level into account, for instance."

      "content": "Aim to lose about 1 lb (0.45 kg) per week. This slow, steady weight loss pace is widely considered to be the healthiest and most sustainable method. Also, going at this slow and steady pace enables your skin to adjust more consistently to the changes in your body composition. [1] X Research source Your doctor will likely recommend that you not lose more than 2 lb (0.91 kg) per week, with half that amount being the ideal. On average, cutting or burning an additional 500 calories per day (3,500 per week) will enable you to lose 1 lb (0.45 kg) per week. Losing weight more slowly can’t eliminate the possibility of getting loose skin, but the odds are much improved versus undergoing a rapid weight loss. Know that it also takes time. It's going to take you an additional six to nine months to maintain that weight for your skin to have its elasticity kicked back in."

      "content": "Work to maintain a total body fat range of between 14% and 22%. This is the recommended healthy body fat range for most adults.

      "content": "Make strength training is a key part of your weight loss exercise program. While doing regular aerobic exercise is critical to losing weight in a healthy fashion, don’t shortchange strength training exercises in the process. Lifting free weights or using weight machines 2-3 times per week will not only help burn calories, but also tighten and tone your muscles. This, in turn, gives your skin a tighter appearance. [3] X Research source Talk to your doctor before beginning a strength training regimen. Lifting weights isn’t the only option for strength training. You can also build muscle tone through activities like yoga and Pilates . Make changes to your diet before starting to train. After a few weeks of getting your nutrition in order, you'll start to feel like you really need to get to the gym because you feel great."

      "content": "Quit smoking (if you smoke) to improve your health. While smoking poses many more serious health dangers, it also makes it more difficult for your skin to regenerate itself. If you quit smoking—or at least cut back—your skin’s texture, elasticity, and overall health should improve over time. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Work with your doctor to develop the best smoking cessation strategies for you. You might, for example, employ a combination of nicotine replacement therapy, individual therapy, support group therapy, and stress reduction techniques. It can be a challenge to quit smoking and lose weight at the same time. If necessary, quit smoking first, then turn your focus to your weight loss goals."

      "content": "Use sunscreen and other sun-protection measures. No matter if it’s a sunny or cloudy day, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen that’s rated at 30 SPF or higher. Sunburns damage your skin’s cells, making them less able to repair and tighten your skin as you lose weight. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source As added protection, wear a broad-brimmed hat and long sleeves and pants when you’re out in the sun. Even when using these measures, try to avoid spending time outdoors around mid-day, when the sun's rays are strongest. Avoid using tanning beds as well. Damaged skin cells are less able to produce collagen and elastin, both of which help tighten your skin."

      "content": "Hydrate your skin by drinking water and using moisturizer . Hydrated skin is less likely to develop deep wrinkles, which will make your skin appear even more loose as you lose weight. The easiest way to hydrate your skin is to drink enough water—have a glass in the morning, at night, and before meals, and take sips throughout the day before you feel thirsty. Using a daily moisturizer will also hydrate your skin. Choose a moisturizer that contains vitamin C or retinoids, since these may help boost the amount of collagen in your skin. If possible, consider using a combination sunscreen and moisturizer. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

If you choose to have surgery to remove excess skin, the plastic surgeon will lift, tuck, reshape, and remove skin as needed to make it appear tighter and more contoured. This may be a fairly simple inpatient procedure, or it may be more complex, based on your particular circumstances. After the surgery, make sure to follow the rest and recovery procedures outlined by your healthcare team. For example, you may need to take pain medication, limit physical activity, and take additional skincare and sun protection measures."
