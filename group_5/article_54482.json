      "content": "Let your beard grow out for at least a month without trimming it. Letting your beard just grow freely gives patchy areas time to fill in and catch up to areas with denser or faster growth. Rivas says “You should let the beard grow for a couple of weeks on its own…and just see what it does. If you like how it grows in, maintain it by edging up areas that you don't want it to grow in to give it a uniform shape.” According to Rivas, the exact amount of time you have to wait is “really different for everybody. There are a lot of genetic limiting factors in that.” If you’re getting impatient, Rivas adds “don't get discouraged because hair grows in various stages. It's a four-week cycle for hair growth. Some hairs grow back immediately after a clean shave and you get that 5 o'clock shadow. Then, those [hairs] will grow in within a week, and then you'll notice some patchy spots. Those will fill in in about 2 weeks. And then the last phase of growth occurs about 4 weeks into the growth cycle. So if you really are interested in growing a beard, give it at least a month to see how your beard grows.”"

LoBiondo warns “Don’t get it trimmed or shaped until it grows longer than you want it.” This way, you won’t risk accidentally trimming it too short and re-exposing the thin or patchy areas. The exact length and style you choose is up to your preference and the size and location of the patchy areas you want to hide. For example, if you have cheek patches, you may want to keep your beard longer to keep those spots covered (instead of going for a close or tight beard)."

      "content": "Beard shampoo and conditioner Look for beard shampoos for beards specifically. Rivas says that while you can use shampoo for your hair on your beard, “they do have shampoos that are really catered to your beard and are designed for the skin around your face. Your hair follicles create more oil on your scalp versus the follicles on your face, so [the shampoos] are specially designed to be more sensitive to your skin.” To wash your beard , LoBiondo says to “Use the shampoo and conditioner on your beard as you would your head hair. Do not shampoo too frequently (about once per week is fine for most people)."

      "title": "Beard balm or pomade",
      "content": "Beard balm or pomade Beard balm works like a leave-in conditioner to make your beard softer, more moisturized, and easier to style. Rivas recommends “staying away from heavily scented items if you want to have a scent. I personally always like to recommend unscented products with a thicker base because then it'll last longer throughout the day and it's not so shiny looking. It helps to really tame the beard and keep it moisturized.” To apply, warm up a pea-sized amount of balm in your hands and work the product into your beard with your fingertips while it’s still slightly damp. Apply after washing and trimming and before styling. Rivas adds, “ if you have a fluffy beard and you put a good amount of pomade or balm in it, you can flatten it out a little bit and make it look more tamed.”"

      "title": "Beard oil",
      "content": "Beard oil According to Rivas, “adding beard oil gives the beard a fuller, more uniform look and it maintains the straggly hairs. So, it gives a neater appearance, and then the pomade really helps with holding it.” He adds that beard oil helps fight beard dandruff, too: “It will moisturize your skin under the beard. I've noticed some guys that don't use beard oil come into the shop for a slight trim and a line around the jaw. They do tend to have dandruff in their beard. So, beard oil does help with that.” To apply, wet your beard, lather up your hands with half or three-fourths of a dropper full of oil (use more or less depending on your beard size), and massage the oil into your beard all the way down to the skin. Comb or brush your beard to distribute it evenly. [2] X Research source"

A beard brush also helps distribute oils (natural and added) from the base of the hair to the tip for healthier hair and growth. [3] X Research source Brush your beard after showers to detangle it, or throughout the day whenever you need a touch up. For long beards, a wide-tooth beard comb is probably more helpful right out of the shower than a brush."

      "title": "Consider your face shape when you pick a beard length or style.",
      "content": "Consider your face shape when you pick a beard length or style. Before picking a specific look, think about what aspects of a beard will flatter your facial features. According to Rivas, “a person with a more rounded shape should wear their beard a little bit tighter in the area where it grows by the ears. In the cheekbone areas, trim it down with slightly more of a blend so the face doesn't look as round. If you have a round face and you have a puff of hair coming out, it's going to make your face look even rounder.” Rivas advises the opposite for someone with a slimmer or more angular face. “You might want to have it a little bit fuller in the cheek area so your face fills in a little bit more and gives you more of a fuller look.”"

Just let your sideburns connect to your beard along the jawline and chin, creating a continuous “strap” of hair along the edges of your face. Use a trimmer to line up your beard and shave your cheeks for a smooth, sharp contrast. [4] X Research source A chin strap look works with or without a mustache."

To trim a goatee , grab a pair of trimmers and outline the end of your chin and around any facial hair near your lips (so your mustache extends down into your chin hair). Then, shape the lower lip hair (the “soul patch”) into an upside down triangle and square your sideburns just above the openings of your ears. [5] X Research source Then, shave away any remaining facial hair along your jaw and cheeks. There are many different kinds of goatees like the classic goatee (hair on your chin only), a full goatee (chin hair with a mustache and soul patch), the Van Dyke (when the mustache and chin don’t connect), and more."

      "content": "Go for a 5 o’clock shadow if you don’t want to worry about shaping. Stubble is another easy style that disguises patches; since the hair all over is so short, patches are hardly noticeable. This one’s extra low-maintenance: just trim your entire beard and mustache down to a length where patches aren’t super visible (maybe a #1 guard), then shave clean lines around the edges of your beard for a clean, intentional look (if desired). Having stubble all over gives the illusion that you can grow a full, thick beard (even if it starts getting patchy when you grow it out in reality)."

Topical hair fibers are made of keratin (like your real hair) and cling to existing hair on your beard, making sparse patches look more dense and full. Choose a color that matches your beard and apply to dry hair according to the instructions on your specific product. It may take some time to find the exact right shade and amount of fibers to use. [7] X Research source Topical fibers are another temporary and cosmetic fix that won’t do much to stimulate hair growth. Topical fibers can sometimes look messy when you’re new to applying them. They also look less natural across large patches and work better for smaller coverups."

A dermaroller uses lots of very tiny needles to puncture the uppermost layer of skin (microneedling) to improve blood flow, increase collagen and keratin production, reactivate hair follicles, and promote the elasticity and health of your overall skin, all of which can help stimulate new, thicker hair growth in your beard. [8] X Research source To use one, just roll the needle cylinder gently over patchy areas of your beard for a minute each day.

Just apply according to the directions on the box and you’re in the clear! Rivas advises not to wash your beard as frequently as normal if you dye it. “You probably don't want to wash it as much because you want the beard dye to last longer, and that way you're not reapplying it so frequently and putting those chemicals on your skin as often.”"
