      "content": "Frequent breaks give your eyes a chance to rest and recover. Experts recommend following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet (6.1 m) away for 20 seconds. By looking at something far away, it forces your eyes to relax, leading to less strain over time. Use this break as an opportunity to blink, too. Normally, we blink 12 times a minute, but when looking at a screen, it slows down to 3 or 4 times a minute. This can cause irritation and dryness."
