Your stand can comfortably be built up to 3 feet (0.91 m) high, while the length and width of the frame should be equal to the size of your aquarium with 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) added to each side. For example, if your aquarium measures 10 inches (25 cm) by 20 inches (51 cm), then the sides of your stand should be 10.5 inches (27 cm) and 20.5 inches (52 cm). Remember that your aquarium will also be holding several gallons of water which will add on weight. Make sure your stand will be sturdy enough to support the filled tank.

For example, for an aquarium stand that you want to be 3 feet (0.91 m) tall, 3 feet (0.91 m) long, and 1.5 feet (0.46 m) wide, you’ll need to cut 2 2x4s to be 36.5 inches (93 cm), 4 2x4s to be 18.5 inches (47 cm), and 8 2x4s to be 36 inches (91 cm)."

Place 2 of the smaller 2x4s along the top and bottom of the thin side of the longer 2x4 and place the 2 other smaller pieces in the middle. Then, use a power drill to attach the smaller 2x4s to the larger piece using 2.5 in (6.4 cm) construction screws. [3] X Research source Make sure the 4 smaller 2x4s (which will serve as cross braces for the frame) are set at equal distances apart from each other. You may also want to use wood adhesive to ensure that the 2x4s are securely attached to each other."

You should install all 8 of your height-cut 2x4s, using a power drill and construction screws to drill the 2x4s together. You can also use finishing nails or wood glue to help secure these 2x4s to the frame. Install these vertical posts so that their long sides run parallel to the cross braces on your frame."

Trace the exact shape and measurement of your frame onto a large piece of plywood and use a jigsaw to cut out this shape. Then, use wood glue to fasten this bottom piece to the tops of your vertical posts. Once this glue has dried, flip the frame over so that the plywood is on the bottom. [4] X Research source You may also opt to use finishing nails to complete the installation. Allow the wood glue to dry for at least 2 hours before moving forward. If you have the extra time, though, you may want to wait 24 hours just to make sure it’s completely bonded."

Measure the front and both sides of your aquarium stand, then use a pencil to trace 3 rectangles matching these measurements onto a piece of wood sheeting. Then, cut out these shapes with your jigsaw. Make sure to cut spaces in the front piece of wood sheeting for any doors you plan to install in your stand. You don’t need to attach sheeting to the back of the stand unless it will be visible or you plan to store a lot of items in the stand that might fall out of the exposed back."

Then, use a hammer and finishing nails to make sure each piece is securely fastened to the frame. If the visible nail heads are unsightly, you can shove them deeper into the wood with a countersink punch, then fill the holes with wood putty."

      "content": "Sand all areas of your stand so far to smooth them out. This is very important not only for making your finished stand smoother and less jagged in appearance, but will also make the finish look nicer. Use a fine grit sandpaper (around 220) to get the best result. Avoid using a coarse or medium grit sandpaper to sand your stand, as these may actually do some damage to your wood."

Apply at least 2 coats of stain with a stain brush and allow it to dry completely. Then, use a paintbrush to paint your stand in your desired color. You should apply at least 1 coat of paint to your stand (if you intend to paint it), but there’s no harm in applying 2 coats overall."

Unless otherwise instructed, attach the hinges to the front of the stand first, then attach your doors to these hinges. Make sure your doors have been stained and painted before attaching them. [6] X Research source Store-bought doors have probably already been stained and painted, so you only have to worry about this if you’re making the doors yourself."
