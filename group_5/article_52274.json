However, the beach cowgirl look had been popular long before it took off on the app. Fashion designers like Ralph Lauren and Natalie De Banco have incorporated both Western and coastal elements in recent fashion lines and runway shows. [2] X Research source The rise of the coastal cowgirl trend may have also been influenced by Coachella, the long-running music festival set in the desert close to Los Angeles.

More recently, major pop culture moments like the popularity of TV series Yellowstone and Daisy Jones and the Six may have influenced the immense resurgence of beachy, bohemian, and cowboy-inspired looks all rolled into one. Even after hitting its peak on TikTok in 2023, coastal cowgirl has definitely remained in style. It continues to persevere as a popular aesthetic and has transitioned into new trends and seasons.
