      "content": "Play the game: Mr Wolf turns their back so they cannot see the kids. The row of children chant: \"What's the time Mr. Wolf?\" Mr. Wolf will turn around and answer a time (for example, 4 o'clock). The children advance the number of steps called out and then repeat the chant, waiting for a response and so on. Eventually they will be standing very close to Mr. Wolf. Mr. Wolf can, at any moment once the line of children is close, respond \"Lunch Time\" in a loud growl, instead of giving a real time. This is the cue for lots of screaming (remind them not to scream) and running because now Mr. Wolf has to chase the rest of the children and tag one of them."
