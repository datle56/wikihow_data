      "content": "Gather your materials. You'll need to draw a system of squares that will end up \"inscribing\" the spiral, acting as guide lines for your drawing. Gather your materials, making sure that you have everything––the list of what is needed is found in the Things You'll Need section below all the steps."

      "title": "Draw squares using the Fibonacci sequence.",
      "content": "Draw squares using the Fibonacci sequence. This works by adding the two previous numbers: You get the next one starting from 0 and 1; so, it goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc. The length of one side of each square should equal a number in the sequence (the 0 is not needed for drawing any of the square), but the beginning point can be called (0,0), if we set it up that way. You will have a 1X1 square (use any unit of measurement you want, at any size, just be consistent) with a second 1X1 drawn next to it on the left side of the first, then down to put 2X2, and right for 3X3, then up for 5X5, and then left to fit 8X8. Below all that, put 13X13 and so on, to as large a square as your paper can fit."

      "content": "Turn the compass. Put your compass, pivot point and pencil, as shown in the picture, with its length set at one unit (side of the first square) long. Turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the compass.",
      "content": "Adjust the compass. Adjust the compass so it is now two units long. Again, turn it 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Then 3, then 5, next 8 and continue this process until the squares each have the curving spiral through them."

      "title": "Ink your spiral.",
      "content": "Ink your spiral. Ink your drawing with pen when you are ready, carefully tracing along the penciled curve. If you're shooting for exceptional accuracy, you can use a French curve to help you."

This new rectangle can be used as a basis for drawing your spiral. You can improve your artistic skills by reading about art. Making plenty of sketches. Finding a teacher who can help you to look at things from an artist's perspective."
