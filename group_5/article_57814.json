      "content": "The 💰 (money bag) emoji can mean someone has lots of money. When someone wants to flaunt that they have a bit of extra cash or are simply swimming in riches, they might send 💰 to let others know. In many cases, people usually send this emoji as a joke and add a bit of sarcasm to their message to let the other person know they’re not actually bragging. [1] X Research source “I found a $10 bill on the ground. I’m rich!!! 💰💰💰” “Coffee’s on me today ☕️💰” “Now that I’m working full time, I’ve got money to spare 💰💰😎” The 💸 (money with wings) emoji and 🤑 (money-mouth) emoji can also mean someone has a lot of money."

      "content": "A person might send 💰 if they’re earning more money. If someone’s business is doing well or they’ve received a nice bonus, they might send 💰 in a message to you to let you know about the good news. For example, a friend who’s just received a raise at work will likely want to let you know and add 💰 for a bit of flair. “My boss just talked to me about a promotion!! 😆 You know what that means 💰💰👀” “My company’s sales were super high this last month so looks like we’re all getting a bonus 📈💰🎉” “I just sold a bunch of my art! 😁💰”"

      "title": "Someone who just spent a lot might send 💸.",
      "content": "Someone who just spent a lot might send 💸. Sending this emoji is like saying that you’re money is flying away from you. If someone just made a pretty hefty purchase or is simply sad about having to spend money, they might send you 💸 along with a text bemoaning their significantly lighter wallet. [2] X Research source “Just bought tickets for the concert 💸💸 RIP my money 🙃” “Why are groceries so expensive?? 😭💸” “Just spent like $60 on gas 🤠💸”"

      "title": "A person might send 💸 when they send you money.",
      "content": "A person might send 💸 when they send you money. Think of 💸 as an emoji symbolizing money leaving your friend’s hand and coming your way. This is a particularly popular emoji to use when sending money via a money transfer app like Venmo or PayPal. “Thanks for getting dinner! I’ll send you the money now 💸🥰” “What’s your Venmo? I’ll transfer you the money 💸” “I sent you $5 for the coffee 💸☕️”"

      "title": "Someone might send 🤑 when they want to buy something expensive.",
      "content": "Someone might send 🤑 when they want to buy something expensive. The dollar sign eyes and green tongue give this happy face a bit of a delirious and excited look. This is probably exactly how someone’s feeling when they see something they know will cost them but is just too nice to pass up. [3] X Research source “Look at this Chanel bag 🤑😍 I want it 😭” “Thinking about buying the new phone that just came out hehe 🤑🤑” “Aren’t these shoes cute? They’re expensive but I think they’re worth it 🤑👀”"

      "content": "🤑 can also mean someone found a new way to make money. Who doesn’t love adding a bit more to their monthly earnings? Someone texting you might send 🤑 as a way to let you know that they’ve just found a way to earn a little more money, whether it’s through a new job, starting their own small business, or making money through hobbies they enjoy. “I just applied for a part-time job so I can make more money on the weekends 🤑🤑” “Just opened my Etsy shop 🤑🎉 Tell all your friends lol.” “Thinking about doing some freelance coding 🤑 What do you think?”"

They’ll definitely appreciate your lovely words. “OMG that’s so awesome!!! 🤩 Proud of you! 😘” “You definitely deserve it 🥳🎉” “That’s awesome! We need to celebrate 😍🥳”"

      "content": "Send comforting words if they’re sad about spending money. Having to give up some of your money (even if it’s for things you need or really want) isn’t always the best feeling. If you get a text from someone who’s mourning the loss of some of their hard-earned dollars, be there to offer them a bit of sympathy and comfort. “Ikr? Literally everything is so expensive 😢” “Dinner was a bit expensive but it was totally worth it right? 😋” “You’ll earn that money back in no time don’t worry! 💰💰”"

      "content": "Convince them not to buy something expensive. If your friend is coming to you gushing about something really amazing they want to buy that you know will take a considerable chunk out of their savings, do what you can to talk them out of the idea. Do they really need it? Or do they just want it? “It’s cute but do you really need it? 🤨” “I think you should wait. They might come out with something even better later.” “If you buy that you’re not allowed to eat out for the next month 😇”"
