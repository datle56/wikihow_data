      "content": "Download and install a Nintendo DS emulator. Since Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are fan-made mods of HeartGold and SoulSilver, they can only be played through a Nintendo DS emulator. You can install an emulator on your computer, or you can install it on your Android or jailbroken iOS device. There are several emulators available depending on the operating system and device you are using. Regardless of what you install your emulator on, you'll still need to use a Windows computer to build the game file. [1] X Research source Windows and Mac - The two most popular Nintendo DS emulators are DeSmuME (Windows and Mac) and NO$GBA (Windows only). You can download DeSmuME from desmume.org/download/ , and NO$GBA from problemkaputt.de/gba.htm . Android - There are several DS emulators available for Android, including DraStic, nds4droid, and Open NDS Emulator. All of these are available on the Google Play Store. iOS - You'll need a jailbroken device in order to download and install nds4ios, which is a port of DeSmuME. Jailbreaking your device will void your warranty and can cause problems with stability. If your device is jailbroken, you can get nds4ios from the cydia.myrepospace.com/Gamer6401/ repository in Cydia."

The ROM file will download in RAR or ZIP format. [2] X Research source Both Sacred Gold and Storm Silver allow you to get all 493 Pokémon without trading. This means that there's no real difference between using HeartGold or SoulSilver, outside of a few small encounters. In many regions, it is illegal to download a ROM file for a game that you don't own. This process must be done on a Windows computer, as the patching tool was designed for Windows."
