      "content": "Tinker with different devices for a firsthand look at electronics in action. There’s no better way to master a technical craft than to get your hands dirty. Gather up any old or unused electronics you have lying around and practice taking them apart and putting them back together. This will give a chance to examine their inner workings and make sense of the complicated relationships that exist between them. [1] X Research source As your knowledge grows, you can play around with modifying, upgrading, and switching out components, which will serve as a valuable introduction to building your own electronics from scratch. Think of figuring out how things function as solving a puzzle. The best electronics specialists tend to be people who excel at problem-solving. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Read electronics textbooks to absorb the fundamentals in your spare time. Scour new and used bookstores for textbooks that deal specifically with the diagnostic and repair aspects of electronics. One of the major advantages of textbooks is that they present a thorough overview of important ideas. Most textbooks are also laid out in a way that makes it easy for you to follow along at your own pace. [3] X Research source Start with books on general concepts and theories before proceeding to ones that cover more specific projects and procedures. Other non-textbook titles like Getting Started in Electronics by Forrest M. Mims III and The Art of Electronics by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill also come highly recommended by electronics enthusiasts.

      "content": "Get familiar with the tools of the trade to prepare to tackle your own projects. As an electronics technician, you’ll need to know your way around a few universal implements and instruments, such as soldering irons, multimeters, oscilloscopes, breadboards, and wire strippers. Pore over tech manuals and video tutorials to get a sense of how these items work and what they’re used for. This sort of technical know-how will come in handy once you’re ready to apply what you’ve learned. [10] X Research source You can purchase most of these tools online, or from stores that sell electronics and laboratory supplies. Exercise caution when handling items like soldering irons, live wires, and power supplies. While electronics isn’t an inherently dangerous field, some pieces of equipment do come with the risk of burns or electrocution if handled incorrectly."

      "content": "Obtain an electronics technician certification as an alternative to school. If you don’t have the time, money, or desire to go to college, a more expedient option is to look into a third-party certificate program. There are many such certifications to choose from, most of which can be earned by simply completing a few short modules or courses and passing an exam. Run a quick search for “electronics repair certification” plus the name of your town or city to find a program near you. Narrow down your search results to programs offered by reputable schools, trade academies, or tech companies. It’s not always easy to tell what you’ll be getting, so it’s best to stick with certifications issued by accredited bodies and organizations with national recognition. Certifications are available for a wide variety of skills, systems, and vocations. Choose one that conforms most closely to your individual interests. Keep in mind that certifications may vary from state to state. Check-in with your local licensing offices to be sure.
