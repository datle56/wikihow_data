      "content": "Use funnel immediately. This funnel can be easily crushed or changed so it’s best to put it to use right away. Place a paper towel underneath the receptacle to avoid dripping (in case the funnel fails or liquid drips). Also place a paper towel underneath the funnel after removing it from the bottle. Push the funnel deeply into the bottle when transferring liquid to reduce the possibility of spillage."
