Pour the baking soda directly into the empty drum of your washing machine (not the detergent dispenser), then add your dirty clothes. Next, add your laundry detergent to the dispenser, and run the washing machine cycle as normal. [1] X Research source Your clothes will be even cleaner and fresher than usual! [2] X Research source If you use laundry detergent pods instead of liquid detergent, place them into the drum along with the baking soda before adding your clothes."

      "content": "Enhance the power of bleach For top-loading machines, add ½ cup (136 g) baking soda to the drum before adding clothes. For front-loading machines, you’ll only need ¼ cup (68 g). Next, place your bleach-safe white clothes in the machine, then pour laundry detergent and bleach into their dispensers. Finally, run the wash cycle as normal. The baking soda will make the bleach more effective and boost its whitening power! [3] X Research source Always check the care label to make sure it’s okay to use chlorine bleach on your clothes! If the clothing item is bleach safe, you’ll see an outline of a triangle. A triangle with an X through it means the item is not bleach safe, and a triangle with two lines inside means you should only use non-chlorine bleach. [4] X Research source If your clothes aren’t bleach safe, simply add the baking soda to your laundry load and skip the bleach. Baking soda can still brighten your white clothing and make colored clothing more vibrant on its own, without any risk of pesky bleach stains! [5] X Research source"

Simply find a small, unnoticeable area of the clothing item, and apply a bit of baking soda solution (equal parts baking soda and water) to the area. If you don’t see any changes in the color or fabric, you’re good to go!"
