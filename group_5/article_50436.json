Interest rates may also compound quarterly (4 times per year), monthly, or weekly. If your compounding rate is anything other than annually, you should go to annualizing a compounding interest rate to calculate your rate. Credit cards, for example, may advertise monthly interest rates, like 1 or 2 percent, but they have to show borrowers the annualized rate when they sign credit contracts. This will be listed as the annual percentage rate, or APR, on the contract. [1] X Research source"

For example, you might pay 1 percent per month in credit card interest. This is your period interest rate. For the purposes of calculating the annualized rate, you will have to know your period interest rate expressed as a decimal. You can find this value by dividing the stated period interest rate by 100. For example, 1 percent would be 1/100, or 0.01."

For a stated monthly interest rate, there would be 12 period in a year. Similarly, a loan or investment using a weekly interest rate would have 52 periods in a year and one with a quarterly rate would have 4. Alternately, a bond payment may make semiannual interest payments. This would be 2 payment period per year."

      "content": "Calculate the annualized percentage rate. The annualized percentage rate can be calculated using the following formula: n ∗ r {\\displaystyle n*r} . In the formula, n represents the number of periods in the year and r represents the period interest rate. For example if you were quoted a rate of 1 percent per month (r=0.01, n=12), compounded annually, your annualized interest rate is 12 ∗ 0.01 = 0.12 {\\displaystyle 12*0.01=0.12} (or 12%). This calculation should be used if the rate compounds annually, rather than quarterly, monthly, or some other frequency."

Understand if your rate compounds annually only (meaning that interest is calculated and accumulates only once per year) vs monthly (or over a different period). If your interest rate compounds at a frequency other than annually, use annualizing a non-compounding interest rate to calculate your annualized rate. Otherwise, use the method for annualizing non-compounding interest rates. [2] X Research source"

For example a monthly interest rate of 1 percent would be a 1 percent period interest rate. If you assume that the interest rate will remain the same for the rest of the year, you can annualize this percentage. Note that in order to calculate the annualized percentage, this number will have to be converted to decimal form. You can do this by dividing the stated period interest rate by 100. For example, a 1 percent period rate would be expressed as 0.01 (1/100)."

After adding these numbers (1 + 0.01), your equation should look like this: ( ( 1.01 ) 12 ) − 1 {\\displaystyle ((1.01)^{12})-1} Solve the exponent. This is done by entering the lower number (1.01 in this case), pressing the exponent button (which is usually x y {\\displaystyle x^{y}} ), entering the higher number (12) and pressing enter. The equation should now be: ( 1.127 ) − 1 {\\displaystyle (1.127)-1} The result, 1.127, has been rounded to make calculation simpler. Keeping more decimal places will make your calculation more accurate. Subtract the one. This gives: 0.127 {\\displaystyle 0.127} . Represented as a percentage, by multiplying by 100, this is 12.7 percent. So, an interest rate of 1 percent compounded monthly gives an annual percentage rate of 12.7 percent. [5] X Research source"

In this case, you will have to use year-to-date calculations to annualize your rate of return. This is not a useful calculation for determining an annualized rate for interest payments or calculating any interest rate that compounds during the year. However, it is useful for getting a better idea of an investment's performance on an annual basis so that it can be compared to other investments. [6] X Research source"

[10] X Research source For the previous example, this number would be the percentage return, 4 percent, multiplied by the time factor, 1.5, to get a 1.5*4, or 6 percent, year-to-date return. So, for an investment with a value of $20,000 that has earned $800 up to the end of August, the annualized yearly return would be 6 percent."
