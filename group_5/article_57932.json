      "content": "Yes, you can identify as both nonbinary and as a lesbian. Sexuality & attraction and gender identity are distinct parts of being human, and how a person identifies is up to them. Even though the term “lesbian” has long been associated with women’s attraction to other women, many argue that “lesbian” is a gender-nonconforming term. A person can use whatever label they’d like to, and there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer for how they should identify. Labels and language are always changing and shifting. Although “lesbian” is typically used to describe women who are attracted to other women, inclusive transgender and nonbinary movements have made it more common for gender-nonconforming people to identify as lesbian or queer. Additionally, many folks assigned female at birth, regardless of how they identify their gender, have strong affiliations with and find comfort in, queer women or lesbian spaces. If you identify as a nonbinary lesbian, it doesn’t automatically mean you’re straight. Sexuality & attraction are about who gives you butterflies so there isn't always a concrete label, especially when you don’t fit into the male/female gender binary. There are tons of labels people use beyond lesbian and straight, like bisexual, queer, gay, pansexual, etc. Only you get to decide which labels make sense for you."

In history, the line between gender and sexuality was often blurred, especially for women. Many lesbian women dressed in gender-nonconforming ways to enter male-dominated and queer spaces.

      "content": "Gender bending has been an aspect of lesbian culture for years. As far back as ancient Egypt, women dressed as men to get opportunities, including access to male spaces and relationships with other women. In early 20th-century Paris, androgynous-looking lesbians were often dressed in traditionally male clothing, and as early as 1950, women dressed in more masculine clothing often identified as or were called butch lesbians or butch women.

      "content": "Trans folks grew more visible as the modern-day gay and lesbian civil rights movement evolved. In the 1990s, tensions between trans and lesbian activists were high because some lesbians believed that the inclusion of trans men in “women born women only” spaces threatened women’s safety and independence from men. However, attention to gay and lesbian issues also gave space for trans and nonbinary individuals to tell about their experiences. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Although there isn’t a pride flag for nonbinary lesbians yet, the dark orange stripe on the 5-striped and the more widely-used 7-striped lesbian flag represents gender nonconformity, which includes lesbians who identify as transgender, genderqueer, nonbinary, etc. [7] X Research source Today, gender and sexuality are vibrant and diverse in both expression and language. Lesbians can use labels such as genderqueer, transmasculine, nonbinary, or gender-nonconforming to describe their gender identity."

Nonbinary is often used as an umbrella term that encompasses other gender identities, such as agender, bigender, genderqueer, or gender-fluid. Nonbinary people can identify as being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or neither. [8] X Research source Terms like “transgender” and “nonbinary” refer to gender identity or expression, which are separate from sexuality and attraction. This is why people who identify as transgender or nonbinary can also identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc. Terms like “transgender” and “nonbinary” refer to gender identity or expression, which are separate from sexual orientation.

However, scholars have tracked the term’s origins all the way to the 1960s, when it was used in medicine and by early trans activists like U.S. Army veteran Jorgensen and Transvestia magazine publisher Virginia Prince. Additionally, trans and gender nonconforming folks have existed across time and cultures, including before Western notions of and words around identity were created."

In zir 1992 pamphlet, Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come , the term “transgender” took on a new meaning as a wider, political term for all kinds of gender variations. Under the “transgender” umbrella, people coined terms like “genderqueer” and “nonbinary” to more accurately describe their identity. [10] X Research source Language is always changing and growing to accommodate the growing gender spectrum. Today, sexual orientation is considered separate from gender identity, which means you can identify as nonbinary, genderqueer, transgender, etc., and also identify as gay, straight, bisexual, etc."

It’s totally normal to be curious about and continue to try on new identity terms to describe your sexuality, attraction or gender identity. It’s also completely normal to try out different labels to see what fits you the best. [11] X Research source Remember to respect the labels that others choose for themselves. You don't need to understand why someone identifies a particular way as long as their identity makes sense to them. If you don’t know what name or pronoun to use, don’t be afraid to ask with respect and curiosity. It’s also completely okay to use no labels at all. Labels can be comforting, but for some people, they can feel restricting. Do whatever feels best for you!"
