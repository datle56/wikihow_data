      "title": "Hydrate your lips with coconut oil or raw cocoa butter.",
      "content": "Hydrate your lips with coconut oil or raw cocoa butter. For best results, rub a generous amount of the oil or butter on your lips just before bed every night. This will give your lips a full night to absorb the nutrients and hydrate naturally. When your lips are properly hydrated, they generally appear fuller and healthier and, therefore, more beautiful. Look for coconut oil that is labeled raw, virgin, and/or unrefined, or cocoa butter that is labeled raw. These coconut oils and cocoa butters retain more nutrients than processed coconut oils or cocoa butters. Hydrating your body by drinking plenty of water will also help your lips stay healthy and beautiful. Petroleum jelly is also a great option for hydrating your lips overnight. Both coconut oil and petroleum jelly can help heal cracked, dry lips and prevent chapped lips in the future."

      "content": "Plump your lips naturally with a coconut oil and peppermint oil balm. Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of coconut oil with 5 or 6 small drops of peppermint oil in a small bowl. Use your finger to apply a small dab of the balm to your lips. Store the remaining balm in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 years. Peppermint oil is technically an irritant, so it works as a natural lip plumper by stimulating blood flow to your lips and causing mild swelling. [4] X Research source You should also be cautious when applying peppermint oil to your lips since it has been known to cause allergic reaction in some people. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because peppermint oil is a hot oil, mixing it with coconut oil will help you avoid any burning or irritating side effects while adding hydration. If you do experience any adverse side effects, however, immediately wipe off the balm. If the side effects continue for more than an hour, contact your doctor or take an antihistamine if you know it is safe for you to do so. You can also use cinnamon extract instead of peppermint oil, though it might sting for a bit.

Hyaluronic acid simultaneously adds volume and moisturizes your lips, making it a popular ingredient for lip plumping products.

Hyaluronic acid plumpers are a relatively gentle alternative to plumpers that contain irritants since they work by enhancing hydration. That said, they aren't as dramatically plumping as other options since they don't penetrate very deeply into the tissue of your lips.

      "content": "Choose lip products with collagen peptides for long-term results. Collagen peptides are known to promote cellular growth and rejuvenation, making your lips fuller and more beautiful over time. While collagen peptides promote beautiful, plump lips long-term, without additional plumping ingredients, lip products with collagen peptides may not produce noticeable immediate results. Similar to hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides won't penetrate the tissues of your lip very deeply on their own, so your lips won't absorb much. This is part of the reason they won't produce noticeable immediate results without the addition of other plumping ingredients. [11] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Products containing collagen peptides may also help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on and around your lips.

[12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Unlike some other temporary lip plumpers, such as a capsicum and cinnamon, caffeine does not usually cause much burning or irritation.

[17] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Apply your regular foundation or concealer on top of your lips. Use a blending brush or sponge to blend away any harsh lines, particularly along your lip line. Build on more product and blend as needed until your natural lip line is concealed. While natural lip plumpers and products can both make your lips fuller and healthier, there is a limit to how much they can do. If your lips are particularly thin or if you are looking for a more dramatic change, using foundation or concealer to hide your natural lip line allows you to create a new, larger lip line."

Fill in your lips with the pencil, or with a lipstick in exactly the same color. Using a lip liner that is just 1 or 2 shades darker than your natural color will make it appear natural while allowing you to cover up your natural lip line.
