The bottom side is the side facing you. These are the possibilities: The Dot The Hook The Bar The Cross (the ideal scenario) Below is the solution for each case, find the one you have and follow the instructions. If you already have a cross, proceed with the next part: solving the corners. Note that one or more corners may or may not be solved. This doesn't affect the following steps."
