      "content": "How often do you think of him? This is another easy way to tell if you have a crush on him. Why would you spend a lot of time thinking about a guy if he wasn't special to you? If you find yourself thinking about the guy every few hours, or just wondering what the guy is up to all the time, then you probably have a crush on him. Here are some ways to tell if your thoughts say you have a crush: If you catch yourself daydreaming about the guy in class or anywhere. If you think about the guy as you drift off to sleep. Bonus points if you ever dream about him, even if it isn't in a romantic way. If you find yourself always wondering what the guy is doing or what he's up to. If you're always wondering what the guy would think about certain things. What would he think of your new dress, your new haircut, the movie you just saw, or the restaurant you just tried? Notice how often you think about the guy each day. Once a day? Maybe not. Once an hour? Probably a crush."

      "title": "Are you having trouble concentrating?",
      "content": "Are you having trouble concentrating? A lack of concentration is another sure-fire sign that you have a crush on a guy. If you're completely focused on yourself, your grades, and your friends, then you don't have time to think about a crush. But if you can barely read a page of your book for homework because your thoughts keep drifting to him, then this is a sign that you are crushing hard. If you're feeling so distracted by the thought of your guy that you can't even hold a conversation with one of your friends for more than five minutes, then you have a crush. If you can't read more than a paragraph of your homework assignment without picturing your guy's face, or wondering if he did his homework, then you have a crush. If you find yourself drifting off with thoughts of your guy in the middle of a movie, or even during a thirty-minute TV show, then you have a crush. If you're so distracted that you can't focus on taking notes in class and find yourself doodling the guy's name, then you are definitely crushing."

      "title": "Have you had these feelings before?",
      "content": "Have you had these feelings before? Chances are, this isn't your first crush, so think of another guy you've crushed on in the past and compare it to that. Though no two relationships or crushes are the same, if you've thought about a different crush the same way before, then chances are, this guy is your new crush. Try to remember if you thought about a different crush this way before. What kind of thoughts did you have? If you're having similar thoughts about a new boy toy, then it's likely that you have a crush. Know your crushing style. Were you also in denial when you were falling for your previous crush? If so, then this is a sign that this is your way of easing into a crush. If you've never had a crush, then you may not have anything to compare your crush to. If this is the case, then you probably do have a crush and just don't know what it feels like!"

      "title": "If you find yourself thinking about him, you probably do.",
      "content": "If you find yourself thinking about him, you probably do. If you're asking yourself whether you have a crush on a guy and care enough to do some research on the topic, then chances are, you probably do. You may be second-guessing yourself because the guy is an old friend, or an unlikely target for your affection, or because you're just plain confused. But don't overthink it -- having a crush on someone doesn't mean you want him to be your soul mate. It just means you like him and want to spend more time around him."

    {
      "title": "Examine your feelings.",
      "content": "Examine your feelings. If you're excited to be around your guy and only feel your excitement build after you spend more time together, then chances are, you have a crush. If the guy made you feel too relaxed instead of excited, then this would mean that you're comfortable around him but probably don't see him as crush material. If you can't stay still when you're around him, then you may have a crush. If your hands shake, or you can't stop talking, or you just keep gesturing when you speak, then your energy level is higher than usual because you have a crush. If you're so excited that you laugh at everything he says even if it's not that funny, you probably have a crush. If you like the guy, you're more likely to think that every word that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. If you're so excited that you can't sleep at night because you keep thinking of the guy or replaying your conversation in your head, then you have a crush. If you feel a jolt of excitement or butterflies in your stomach when he greets or texts you, then you have a crush."

      "title": "Notice if you're nervous.",
      "content": "Notice if you're nervous. If you have a crush on the guy, then you won't feel completely comfortable around him. Instead, you would feel nervous because you're worried about what he thinks about you and don't want to say the wrong thing. If you're nervous, it means you care what he thinks about you, and if you care what he thinks about you, then -- you guessed it -- you have a crush. [1] X Research source If your hands tremble, your knees shake, or your voice wavers when you're around him, then he's making you nervous. If you're so nervous that you keep rambling when you talk to him or just completely clam up because you can't think of anything to say, then you have a crush. If you're so nervous that you bump into things around him, walk into tables, or drop all of the contents of your purse in front of him, then you have a crush. If you're so nervous that you always feel embarrassed, or constantly blush when you're around the guy even though there's no reason for it, then you have a crush."

      "title": "Admit how you feel when he is with others.",
      "content": "Admit how you feel when he is with others. If you have a crush, then it's natural for you to not want the guy you like to be dating, talking about, or maybe even hanging out with other potential partners. If you're cool with him having a partner or flirting with a lot of people, then you probably don't have a crush on him. [2] X Research source If the thought of the guy dating others makes you cringe, you probably have a crush. If the thought of the guy just hanging out with other potential partners makes you feel squeamish, then you definitely have a crush. Just try not to make this a problem in the future or you may be facing some jealousy issues. If he has a partner and you think he has a great relationship and are happy for him without any complications, then you probably don't have a crush."

      "title": "Be aware of what you say.",
      "content": "Be aware of what you say. The things you say to the guy, or even the things you talk about when you're not around the guy, can be a big indication of whether or not you have a crush on the guy. Here's how to know if the things you say mean that you have a serious crush: If you find yourself always teasing the guy. If you always end up poking fun at the guy without meaning to, it means you have a crush. If you talk really fast or stutter when you say anything to the guy, it means you have a crush. If you're careful about not saying anything that might make you look like a ditz or dumb in front of the guy, then you have a crush. And if you feel like everything you say to him does make you sound like a ditz, then you probably have a crush. If you can't talk to one of your friends for more than ten minutes without mentioning the guy, then you have a crush. If you have a crush, your friends may be able to pick up on it before you do."

      "title": "Notice your actions.",
      "content": "Notice your actions. You can learn a lot about whether or not you have a crush on the guy based on how you act around him, or even how you act when he's miles away. Here are a few ways to know if your actions mean you've been bitten by the crush bug: If you go out of your way to hang out with him, then you have a crush on him. If you've never watched baseball in your life but are suddenly going to all the school games because you know he'll be sitting in the bleachers, then you have a crush. If you want to be near him whenever you do hang out. If you find yourself drifting toward him when you're in a group of friends, or even touching him in a playful way whenever you can, then you have a crush. If you can't stand being around him when he's flirting with others, then you have a crush. If your heart falls when you show up to a place where you thought he'd be and he isn't there, then you have a crush."

      "title": "Consider whether you are starting to pay more attention to your looks.",
      "content": "Consider whether you are starting to pay more attention to your looks. It may not be a coincidence that you're suddenly spending twice as much time in front of the mirror whenever you know you'll see the guy. Here's how to know if your grooming habits and attention to your looks say that you have a crush on the guy: If you try twice as hard to look good if you know you'll see him. If you wear your best outfit, best hairdo, and most amazing eye makeup when you know he'll be there, then you have a crush. If you find yourself experimenting with new makeup looks or jewelry to see if he notices, then you have a crush. If you find yourself not caring at all about how you look if you go somewhere where you know you won't see him, then you have a crush."

      "title": "Be aware of changes to your personality.",
      "content": "Be aware of changes to your personality. Let's say this guy is the athletic, typical-boy type. You might find yourself practicing basketball and soccer, or buying Nike shoes, so your guy can get interested in you. And if you want your guy to get interested in you, that basically means you have a crush on him and will kind of do anything for him."
