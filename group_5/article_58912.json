      "content": "Immediately stop saving to the affected drive. When you notice that you've accidentally delete or overwritten a file, do not save anything else on that hard drive. Avoid running programs as well. Whenever new data is written to the drive, there's a chance that it could be set to override the data from the old file. Not saving anything increases the chances that you'll be able to recover the file."

It isn't pretty, but it can do a lot of the same things that expensive file recovery programs do. You can download PhotoRec for free from www.cgsecurity.org as part of the TestDisk utility. PhotoRec is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux. For another Windows file recovery option, check out our steps to use Recuva below. Make sure to do this on another computer to avoid overwriting the file you are trying to recover. You can also download PhotoRec to another drive on your computer, but it's safest to get it on another computer."

      "content": "Insert a blank USB drive. Ideally, you'll want to use a USB drive that is big enough to hold both PhotoRec and any files that you want to recover. This is because recovering the file to its original drive increases the chances that the recovery will write over the original, corrupting it in the process. PhotoRec is only about 5 MB in size, so any size USB drive will be able to hold it."
