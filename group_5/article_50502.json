      "content": "Spread the charcoal mask on your face. Squirt a quarter-sized amount of the mask into a small bowl. Dip a clean brush into the mixture and spread it evenly across your skin. You can apply it over your face or just on blemish-prone areas. Consider spreading it on your t-zone (between your nose and forehead) if you have acne or blackheads. You can use a wide, flat foundation brush or one made specifically for applying masks. If you don't have a brush, you can use clean fingertips to apply the mask. Try to be as gentle as you can when you spread the charcoal mask on blemish-prone areas to avoid irritation."
