      "content": "Fill a jar with 1 cup (240 mL) of hot tap water. Pour 1 cup (240 mL) of water into a pot on the stove and heat it until it boils. Then, turn off the stove, let the water sit until it stops boiling, and pour it into a glass jar with a wide mouth that you can balance a pencil on. As the water cools, the Borax will attach to fibers, like a string or pipe cleaner, to form hard crystals. [1] X Research source It’s important to use the right amount of water in proportion to the Borax so you can make a “supersaturated” solution. This means that there are more solid particles in the water than the water can dissolve. If you use more than 1 cup (240 mL) of water, add more Borax to ensure the solution is supersaturated."

      "content": "Add 3 tbsp (77.8 g) of Borax to the jar, stirring until it dissolves. Let the borax settle at the bottom. Then, combine the water and Borax with a spoon or a glass stirrer. You should see white powder floating in the water after stirring for 5-10 seconds. [2] X Research source If you don’t see the powder floating in the water after you stir, add another 1/2 tablespoon (13 g) of Borax to oversaturate the water. Be sure to purchase the powder borax from the laundry aisle of the supermarket. Other forms of Borax, like borax soap, won’t work for making crystals."

Remember to stir the solution for a few seconds to distribute the color evenly throughout the jar. [3] X Research source The more drops of food coloring you add to the water, the brighter the color will be. However, if you add too much, your crystals may be smaller because the water becomes less saturated as you add the food coloring."

Attach a short piece of pipe cleaner to the top of your shape by wrapping it around the top point. Wrap the other end of the pipe cleaner around a pencil. [4] X Research source The pencil will allow the pipe cleaner to dangle in the water without touching the sides of the jar. You may want to coordinate the pipe cleaner color with the color of your crystals. Opt for a blue pipe cleaner to make a blue crystal."

[16] X Research source After 12 hours, you should be able to see sizable crystals on the shell, and you can leave them in the solution for up to 24 hours to grow a larger geode. The eggshell should be able to rest at the bottom of the container, with the inside facing up.
