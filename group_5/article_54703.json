Instead, take a deep breath and reply from a level head. A reply can consist of your understanding or view of the situation. For example, if you promised to pick a friend up from the airport and at the last minute you can’t and they say, “Fym you can’t?” Respond by saying, “I know it’s super last minute, but my sister had an emergency. I’d be happy to split an Uber with you instead if that’s cool.” Remember, the person on the other end of the phone may be experiencing heightened emotions, like anger. Don’t add fuel to the fire."
