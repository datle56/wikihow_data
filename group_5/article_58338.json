The system will give you 22 players plus a loan player who is mostly coming from the country you chose before – A loan player comes with a limited number of matches (usually a 5-game contract), When you are prompted to sign a loan player, make sure you go for the goal-scoring option. You need a goal scorer (striker) to kick off your ultimate team. So, now you have your first-ever starter team in FIFA 23. Firstly, you want to get those players in the right position. Don't put the goalkeeper as your striker. Sometimes, you may don't have the proper player for the proper position."

      "title": "Understand the Chemistry system.",
      "content": "Understand the Chemistry system. Chemistry? What is that? Team chemistry describes how well your players harmonize with each other. In FUT, chemistry is a factor that determines the compatibility of a player in his position with his squad’s formation, the relation with his teammates in other positions, and the team manager. The higher player and team chemistry rates your squad can score, the better compatibility and relationship you will have amongst your players and manager. The player’s chemistry rates in FUT are shown as 3 diamond-shaped icons underneath their cards, where the more diamonds are in blue, the better chemistry the player gets."

      "title": "Apply Tactics.",
      "content": "Apply Tactics. Formations and tactics go hand in hand. You can choose to play with the default 433 formations. The 4-3-3 tactic is a formation using a line of four defenders, consisting of two central defenders and two fullbacks, placed behind a line of three midfielders. In the most common configuration of midfielders, there is one player in the back, the pivot, and two other inside players slightly advanced on either side. The attacking line consists of two wingers, each playing on one side, and a single central striker. To reach the top, it is essential to use a combination of the formation and the best tactics. You hop on, switch to one of your favorite formations, build a team around it, set up set-piece takers, captain, pressing tricks, high back lines, and team press orders. You can always change your tactics after each game if your team doesn't perform well."

Once the bidding duration of an item is due, the highest bid price will win the auction."
