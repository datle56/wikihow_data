    {
      "title": "“I really like your friend, can you give me her number?”",
      "content": "“I really like your friend, can you give me her number?” Why beat around the bush? If you like her friend, just be upfront about it. Ask for her friend’s number so you can get in touch with her. [1] X Research source If her friend likes you too, she might just tell you!"

      "title": "“I think your friend is gorgeous—can you give me her number?”",
      "content": "“I think your friend is gorgeous—can you give me her number?” She might feel protective of her friend and may not give her number out to just anyone.

[2] X Research source You could also say something like, “I’d really like to talk to her to get to know her better.”"

    {
      "title": "“I really like your friend, can I get her number so I can call her?”",
      "content": "“I really like your friend, can I get her number so I can call her?” Play it cute and tell her that you have a little crush on her friend.

    },
    {
      "title": "“Hey can I have your friend’s number?",
      "content": "“Hey can I have your friend’s number? Totally cool if not.” Play it safe and don’t put any extra pressure on her to give you her friend’s number. If she doesn’t feel like you’re forcing it, she might be more comfortable giving it to you. Just act like it’s no big deal if she doesn’t want to do it. [5] X Research source Another option is to try something like, “Hey, no pressure at all, but would you mind sending me your friend’s number? Really, it’s no big deal if that’s not cool.”"

      "title": "“I lost my number, can I have your friend’s?”",
      "content": "“I lost my number, can I have your friend’s?” Sure, it’s goofy and a little ridiculous, but sometimes that can be effective! Don’t be afraid to get silly with it.

    {
      "title": "“Hey, can you pass along my number to your friend?”",
      "content": "“Hey, can you pass along my number to your friend?” Try asking her to give your number to her friend so you can avoid putting her on the spot.
