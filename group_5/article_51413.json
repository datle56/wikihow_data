In some places, you may punch a time clock when you enter and leave. Others may have you record tasks on time slips and enter them into a computer system. Whichever system your employer uses, make sure you know how to record your time. You may want to keep a private record in addition, to compare with your paycheck. [2] X Research source If you receive different pay rates for different working times, you should keep separate records. For example, if you earn one rate for weekdays and a higher rate for weekends, you should count your weekday hours and your weekend hours separately."

For example, if you get overtime after 40 hours each week, and you worked 50 hours, then you would have 40 hours at your regular rate and 10 hours at your overtime rate. [3] X Research source Alternatively, some people might earn overtime after 8 hours on one day. If, during one week, you worked 10 hours, 10 hours, 8 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours, you would have 34 hours at regular time and 4 hours at overtime."

If you have additional hours at a second rate (overtime or weekend, for example), multiply those hours times that rate separately. Then add the two numbers together. [4] X Research source For a simple example, suppose you worked 32 hours in one week at the federal minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour. Calculate your wages for this week as 32 ∗ $ 7.25 = $ 232.00 {\\displaystyle 32*\\$7.25=\\$232.00} . For a slightly more complicated example, suppose you worked 40 hours at a rate of $9.00 per hour, and you worked overtime for 12 hours at a rate of $13.50 per hour. This calculation will be: ( 40 ∗ $ 9.00 ) + ( 12 ∗ $ 13.50 ) = $ 360 + $ 162 = $ 522 {\\displaystyle (40*\\$9.00)+(12*\\$13.50)=\\$360+\\$162=\\$522} ."

If you want to understand your personal deductions completely, you should talk with your employer’s bookkeeper. Some online sources offer “wage calculators.” These are websites where you can enter your number of hours worked, your pay rate, and your number of dependents. The site will then calculate your weekly, monthly and annual wages. Bear in mind that any deductions are probably going to be estimates. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Estimate your annual wages. If you work for an hourly rate, you can estimate your annual salary, especially if your hours are fairly regular. Assuming that you work a full-time, 40 hour per week schedule, simply multiply your hourly rate by 40, to calculate your weekly pay. Then multiply that result by 50 to estimate the number of working weeks per year. This will allow for some unpaid vacation or sick time during the year. For example, if you earn the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, you would multiply $ 7.25 ∗ 40 hours week ∗ 50 weeks year = $ 14 , 500 {\\displaystyle \\$7.25*40{\\frac {\\text{ hours}}{\\text{ week}}}*50{\\frac {\\text{ weeks}}{\\text{ year}}}=\\$14,500} annual salary.

This is calculated by starting at the regular minimum wage of $7.25 and subtracting a credit of $5.12 per hour. Essentially, the government is assuming that you will earn at least $5.12 each hour in tips. Eight states do not make any deduction to the minimum wage for tipped employees. Twenty-eight states or territories do apply a tip deduction, but still have minimum wages higher than the federal rate. Eighteen states use the federal tipped employee minimum of $2.13.

At the end of each day, you should count and record the amount of tips that you received. Because tips often come in cash, it is tempting just to grab the money and go at the end of the night. But if you are concerned with counting your wages, you should keep a record. Customers who pay with credit cards will often tip that way as well. You need to learn your employer’s system for crediting you with these tips. For example, the credit card tips may just be calculated in the computer and added to your paycheck each week."

Your base pay is therefore 40 ∗ $ 4.08 = $ 163.20 {\\displaystyle 40*\\$4.08=\\$163.20} . If you want to estimate your annual pay, multiply this result by 50 weeks per year.
