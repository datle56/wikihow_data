      "title": "Soak your nails in warm, soapy water for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak your nails in warm, soapy water for 15 minutes. Fill a bowl or sink basin with warm water and a little gentle hand soap. Place your hands in the bowl or basin so that your glue-on nails are completely submerged in the water, and keep them there for about 15 minutes. The soap and water will soak into the nail glue and soften it, making it easier to remove the nails. You can also soak your nails in a little pure acetone to soften the glue, but be aware that acetone is much harsher on your skin, nails and cuticles than soap and water. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Alternatively, soften up your nail glue by putting a few drops of cuticle oil on each false nail and letting it soak in for a few seconds.

      "content": "Pry off the fake nails gently once the glue has softened. Look for a spot where the nail has already begun to detach, and gently begin prying off the nail from that spot. If you can’t find a loose spot, carefully work the tip of a nail file under the edges of the fake nail to loosen it. Don’t try to yank the nail off if it doesn’t pry loose easily. Soak the nail in soapy water for a few more minutes if you need to soften up the glue a little more."

      "title": "Use a nail buffer to carefully file off excess glue.",
      "content": "Use a nail buffer to carefully file off excess glue. Once the false nails are off and your natural nails have dried out a bit, use the “buff” side of a nail buffer block to buff away most of the glue. When you’re satisfied that you’ve removed most or all of the glue, rinse away the powder with water. [3] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. If you like, you can then use the “shine” side of the buffer to polish up your nails after buffing them."

      "content": "Take off any remaining glue with acetone. Soak a cotton ball in acetone and rub it on each fingernail to remove any residual traces of nail glue. Wash your hands with soap and water to rinse away the acetone and any other residues on your hands and nails. If your nails feel dry after you’ve rubbed them with acetone, apply a little nail moisturizer or cuticle oil.

      "title": "Trim your false nails down as far as possible.",
      "content": "Trim your false nails down as far as possible. Acrylic nails are made of materials that adhere directly to your natural nails instead of being stuck on with glue. Use a pair of nail scissors or clippers to trim the false nails down to a short but comfortable length, without cutting off any of your natural nails. This will make the rest of the removal process quicker because there will be less material to dissolve. [5] X Research source Don’t trim down into your nail bed as this will be painful. This process works for SNS (dipping powder nails), and acrylic nails."

      "title": "File off the glossy surface of the false nail.",
      "content": "File off the glossy surface of the false nail. If the acrylic nails are still attached to your natural nails, use a nail file to remove the shiny surface. Rub the file back and forth across your nails until the glossy surface is gone and the nails look matte. Try to rub each part of the nail evenly. This will make the removal process quicker and more effective. [6] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020. If you see any of your natural nails coming through under the fake nails, stop filing that spot. If you continue to file, you risk damaging your natural nails."

      "content": "Wipe off any dust with a clean, dry cloth. A microfiber cloth is an inexpensive and effective option; however, any clean cloth will work. Remove any dust from your nails to make it easier for the acetone to penetrate the remaining acrylic."

      "title": "Rub petroleum jelly on the skin around your nails.",
      "content": "Rub petroleum jelly on the skin around your nails. This will help to protect your skin from the acetone. Apply a thin layer to your nails beds and the skin below and around your nails. [7] X Research source If you have dry or sensitive skin, apply the petroleum jelly liberally."

      "title": "Wrap each of the nails on 1 hand in a cotton ball dipped in acetone.",
      "content": "Wrap each of the nails on 1 hand in a cotton ball dipped in acetone. If your acetone comes in a dripper bottle, gently squeeze it onto the cotton pads. If the acetone comes in a regular bottle, you will need to pour it into a small disposable bowl and then dip the cotton pads into the bowl. Place each soaked cotton pad over 1 of your nails. [8] X Research source If you don’t have cotton pads, cotton balls will also work. Purchase acetone and cotton pads from a pharmacy or a supermarket. If you have sensitive skin, choose an acetone-based nail polish remover that is designed for sensitive skin. The fumes from acetone can be toxic, so always use it in well-ventilated areas."

      "content": "Wrap a piece of aluminum foil around each nail and cotton pad. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil that is approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) x 2 inches (5.1 cm). Check that the cotton pad is in place and then wrap the foil around the nail and cotton pad. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The aluminum foil will help trap warmth and moisture so the acetone doesn’t evaporate before the glue has a chance to soften. This speeds up the removal process. Repeat the process for all the nails on 1 hand, and then move to the other hand. If you find it difficult to work on your opposite hand while your original hand is still soaking, ask a friend to help you or wait until you have removed the foil and cotton pads before attempting to start the other hand.

      "content": "Remove the foil and pads after 20 minutes. Set a timer for 20 minutes and let the acetone work its magic. Unravel the foil around your nails and remove the cotton pads. You should notice that that the glue has dissolved and that the false nails have become squishy. [11] X Research source If the first nail is still covered in glue or the false nails are still firmly in place, leave the foil and pads on for another 15 minutes. Be careful not to place the used acetone pads onto wooden or plastic tables as the chemicals will damage the surface."

      "content": "Push off the squishy false nails with a tea towel. Use a clean kitchen towel to clean off the dissolved residue from the false nails. Apply pressure to the tea towel as you clean the nails but stop if your natural nails start hurting. Replace the acetone-soaked cotton balls and foil if the false nails don't come off easily."

      "content": "Give your nails a breather between manicures. If you wear false nails a lot, your natural nails will benefit from taking a break between applications. After you remove the false nails, give your real nails a few days to a week to recover before adding any new false nails or paint. [15] X Research source Try taking a week-long break every 8 weeks between manicures. Consider applying fake nails without glue next time, to see whether this works better for you than having to deal with nail glue removal."
