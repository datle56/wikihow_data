      "content": "Send the host a polite text about if you can attend. If the host texted you directly or has their number on the invite, text them a polite RSVP whether you’re able to go to the event or not. If the invite says you can bring guests, let the host know how many people are coming with you. Then, express your excitement if you can attend and express your regrets if you’re not able to go. Some example RSVP texts for a birthday party may be: [1] X Research source Can attend: Hi Jenny, thanks for the birthday invitation! Frank and I would love to come celebrate with you, so count us both in! We can’t wait to see you! Cannot attend: Hi Jenny, thank you so much for the birthday invite. Unfortunately, Frank and I won’t be able to make it to the party next Friday. We hope you have so much fun celebrating!"

      "content": "Use the number and keyword on the invite for automated RSVP services. If you received a physical invitation, check the RSVP section for a phone number and keyword in quotes, like “hello” or “party.” Send the keyword in a text message to the phone number to start the automated RSVP chat. The chat will ask you questions like your full name and how many people you’re coming with. Follow the prompts on the screen and send your replies until you get a confirmation text. The automated messages may also ask additional questions, like your food preferences or if you’re bringing any children with you. Some questions with multiple options list numbers for each choice. Reply with the corresponding number rather than typing out your answer completely."

      "title": "Sending a text is appropriate if the host texted you or requested a text.",
      "content": "Sending a text is appropriate if the host texted you or requested a text. If you got a casual text invite, then it’s okay to shoot a text their way in response so they quickly know your answer. When you get a physical invitation for an event, read it over carefully to see if the host requested that you RSVP through text specifically. If they list a different way for you to respond, then use their preferred communication method instead of texting. Fill out an RSVP card you received for a wedding or formal event and mail it back as soon as possible. Send an email RSVP if you originally received an email or if they provide an email address in the invite. If you’re given a website on the invite, follow the link to complete your RSVP. Reader Poll: We asked 190 wikiHow readers to tell us the best way to respond to an informal dinner invitation, and only 4% of them said an in-person conversation was ideal. [Take Poll] For informal events, it's totally appropriate (and in fact, probably preferred) to text or mail your answer instead of seeking out an in-person conversation with the host. You're in the clear!"

      "content": "Use an automated texting service to gather RSVPs neatly. When you sign up for the service, they’ll provide a phone number to list on your invite.

      "content": "Request text RSVPs on your invite along with your phone number. If you’re planning a smaller event with friends and don’t mind if your guests have your personal number, list it on your invitation and specifically request that people RSVP through text. Be sure to include what info you’d like them to respond with on the invite so you don’t have to ask everyone follow-up questions. Example : Please text the number of guests and your meal choice to 555-555-1234 to RSVP. If you only want people to RSVP if they can not attend, write “Regrets only” on the invite. [2] X Research source Follow up with a personalized text message after they RSVP. You may say something like, “Thanks for your quick response, James! I can’t wait to celebrate with you!” or, “Aw sorry you can’t make it, Alan. We’ll miss you there!” If people aren’t responding to your RSVP, shoot them a text about 1–2 weeks before the event and remind them. You may say something like, “Hey! I noticed you didn’t RSVP to my party yet, and I’d love to have you there. Are you planning on coming?”"
