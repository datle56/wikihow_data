      "content": "Examine the base of your knob to determine what kind it is. There are two main types of doorknobs with hidden levers. These hidden levers can be in the form of a thin slot or a pinhole. Determine which kind of knob you have, because each knob will detach from the door differently. [1] X Research source These hidden levers are also called detents. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a tool to press down on the secret latch. You'll have to apply pressure to the detent at the base of your doorknob. If your doorknob has a thin slot at the base of it, you need to use a flathead screwdriver to press down on the hidden latch inside of it. If there is a pin hole at the base of your knob, you'll need to use a thin object like a pin or paper clip to disengage it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Pull and twist on the knob until it comes loose. With the hidden lever still pushed, pull on the doorknob. It should come loose. If you're having problems removing the knob from the latch, you may have to twist it or wiggle it back and forth. You should be able to remove both knobs from each side of the door.

      "title": "Pull out both of the doorknobs.",
      "content": "Pull out both of the doorknobs. After you've unscrewed both screws on each side of the knobset lock, the doorknobs will be loose enough to come out. Simply pull on them to disengage them from the rest of the lock. [6] X Research source If they are stuck, you may need to wiggle them."

Sometimes the latch will just come loose once you remove the other parts of the lock, and sometimes you'll have to unscrew two screws on the top and bottom to disengage it from the door. Pull the latch from the door and you'll have entirely removed a knobset lock."
