They stand between dangerous fugitives and the federal employees and citizens they are committed to protecting. They are in top physical shape. US Marshals are often required to run, crouch, physically restrain fugitives, and work in suboptimal conditions, such as extreme heat or cold. They may work for long stretches at a time without getting breaks."
