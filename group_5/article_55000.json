      "content": "While they look similar, the insects inside are much different. Wasp nests are gray or light brown, and they almost look like they’re made of wood. On the other hand, beehives have telltale hexagons that surround the entire structure. If you found a beehive in your roof and you want it gone, call a bee removal professional—they’ll be able to move the hive without killing the colony. [1] X Research source Bees are an important pollinator species, and some of them are endangered."

      "content": "That’s when the nests will be the smallest. If you find the nest in the late summer, you might want to call a professional for help. Large nests are hard to get rid of, and big colonies have a higher chance of stinging you during the removal process. If you want to take on the nests yourself, be sure to wear protection in case you get stung. [2] X Research source Most wasp nests will be empty from the fall until early spring. If you find an empty wasp nest, it’s a good idea to remove it while you can, since other insects will sometimes come in and borrow it."

      "title": "Most of the wasps will still be inside their nest, not flying around.",
      "content": "Most of the wasps will still be inside their nest, not flying around. Wasps don’t become active until the late morning or early afternoon, when they fly out of their nest. If you can, try to get rid of the nests in your roof as early as you can to avoid getting stung as much as possible. [3] X Research source Wasps are usually a little sleepier in the morning, so they might also be less aggressive."

      "content": "When you’re dealing with wasps, there’s always a chance you could get stung. Make sure you’re wearing long pants, close-toed shoes, long sleeves, and gloves. You can also wear goggles or safety glasses to protect your eyes if you’re worried. [4] X Research source If you’re allergic to wasps, don’t try to remove the nests yourself. There’s a high chance that you might get stung, so it’s not worth the risk. Call a professional instead to get the job done safely.

      "title": "If the nests are outside, you need to get to them safely.",
      "content": "If the nests are outside, you need to get to them safely. Extend a ladder that’s at least 3 ft (0.91 m) taller than your roof and lean it against your home. Have one person stand on the ground and hold the ladder steady as you climb up it. Once you’ve reached the roof, you can either stay on the ladder if you’re close to the nest, or you can carefully climb onto the roof for a steadier foothold. [6] X Research source Use extreme caution when climbing up the side of your house, and don’t step on your roof if it’s damaged. Make sure you have an exit route in case wasps fly out of their nest and start stinging you. It might be tough, but you need to climb down the ladder just as carefully as you climbed up it."

      "title": "Drenching the nests in insecticide kills the wasps almost instantly.",
      "content": "Drenching the nests in insecticide kills the wasps almost instantly. Pick up a bottle of wasp insecticide from your local garden or hardware store, and make sure it has either a nozzle or a spray attachment on it. Very carefully go up to the roof where the nests are, then point the nozzle or the spray tip as close to one nest as you can. Spray the nest liberally, and try to spray any wasps that fly out of the nest if you see them. Then, move onto the next nest. [7] X Research source This is not a great option to use if you have a wasp allergy. Nest drenching tends to stir wasp colonies up, and there’s a high likelihood you will get stung."

      "title": "Nest dusting is less risky for you, but it’s not quite as effective.",
      "content": "Nest dusting is less risky for you, but it’s not quite as effective. Pick up a package of insecticide that’s in powder or dust form. Head up to where the nests are and quickly sprinkle a thin layer of insecticide all over the nests and the surrounding area. Get out of there quickly, as the wasps may fly out and try to sting you. Keep reapplying the insecticide every day for the next 2 weeks until you don’t see wasps anymore. [8] X Research source Since the insecticide takes a longer time to kill the wasps, they’re less likely to get mad and fly out of their nest to sting you."

      "title": "Knock the nests down with a stick, then put them in a bag.",
      "content": "Knock the nests down with a stick, then put them in a bag. Wasps only use their nests for a season, so an empty nest doesn’t pose much of a wasp threat once they’re dead. However, empty nests are perfect homes for other pests, including other wasp species. You can throw the nests into the garbage once you’ve bagged them up. [9] X Research source If you can’t get to the empty wasp nests to knock them down, it’s okay. As long as you make sure other wasps can’t get to them by sealing off any entry points, it should be fine to just leave them alone."

      "title": "Make sure that wasps can’t get back into the area of your roof.",
      "content": "Make sure that wasps can’t get back into the area of your roof. Use a leaf blower to blow all the dust and debris off your roof, then grab a silicone or polyurethane sealant. [10] X Research source Patch up any holes or large gaps in your roof, especially near your gutters or your chimney. This will prevent the wasps from coming back and stop any wasp colonies in the future from building a new nest in your roof. [11] X Research source If you don’t want to go through the process of resealing your roof, you can also buy roof tape to patch and seal small areas."

Grab a can of insecticide and point the nozzle around the perimeter of your roof. Spray a thin layer all around your roof, focusing on the areas near the wasp nests. If any wasps come looking for a place to make a nest, they’ll avoid your roof and move onto somewhere else. [13] X Research source If you used the nest drenching method, you can use the same bottle of insecticide you already have."

Wasps are also usually more aggressive in the late summer and early fall, so you have a higher likelihood of getting stung if you choose to DIY your nest removal.
