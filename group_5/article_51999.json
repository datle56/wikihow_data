WikiArt Visual Art Encyclopedia , www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/charles-iv-of-spain-and-his-family-1800. If you viewed the painting on the museum's website, omit the name and location of the museum. Use the name of the website and URL instead. Place a period after the year, since it refers to the date the painting was created, not the date it was published on the website. For example: Goya, Francisco, The Family of Charles IV . 1800. Museo del Prado , www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-family-of-carlos-iv/. Include the medium and materials at the end of your entry if they are important or relevant to your paper.

Scholars believe this was a member of the family who was not present on the day the portrait was painted.\" If the painting is untitled, use your brief description of the painting along with the artist's name. For example, you might write: \"The Duchess of Alba was widely considered to be Francisco Goya's muse, as his many untitled portraits of her suggest.\""
