      "title": "Decide if you are going to use dark chocolate or white chocolate.",
      "content": "Decide if you are going to use dark chocolate or white chocolate. Use dark or milk chocolate if you are trying to get a nice jet black color. Otherwise, you will need to use white chocolate to make any other colored chocolate. Choose a white chocolate with a low viscosity, or that appears very thin when you melt it. Tollhouse's White Chocolate Chips are one of the better brands for coloring. Go for chips instead of bars, as the smaller the pieces of chocolate are, the faster they will melt. Candy melts are also a good option."

      "title": "Buy oil based coloring that is made especially to color chocolate.",
      "content": "Buy oil based coloring that is made especially to color chocolate. Never add a water based food coloring to chocolate. It causes the chocolate to seize, or turn lumpy and solid. You want to create colored chocolate that is smooth and easy to work with. So skip the cheap water based colors and go for oil or powder colors. You can buy oil based coloring and powder coloring at markets and online. One good brand is Americolor, which creates strong colors without having to add a lot of oil to the chocolate. [1] X Research source If you are trying to create a pale color like light blue or yellow, go for oil based colors as you only have to add very little coloring to the white chocolate to get the color you want. [2] X Research source If you are trying to create a more vibrant color, like a bright yellow or a bold red, buy a powder coloring or paste coloring. The more oil you add to the chocolate, the less smooth it will be. So using a small amount of powder coloring or paste coloring should create a vibrant color without adding too much oil to the chocolate."

      "title": "Get vegetable shortening, not vegetable oil.",
      "content": "Get vegetable shortening, not vegetable oil. Vegetable shortening usually comes in a round plastic tub and is hard in appearance, almost like butter. The shortening will help the chocolate to set properly on your candy or on a cake pop. It will also speed up the melting time of the chocolate. Vegetable oil will only make the chocolate more loose and limp, meaning you will end up with messy chocolate covered candies or limp cake pops."

      "content": "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, if possible. If you have access to a stovetop, a large metal bowl, and a pot with a handle, you can boil the chocolate on the stove instead of in the microwave. [3] X Research source The double boiler method works a bit faster and you have more control over the chocolate as it melts."

      "content": "Place the white chocolate chips in a glass bowl. Microwave the chocolate for no more than 30 seconds at a time on medium high heat. You may be tempted to microwave the chocolate for longer than 30 seconds to speed up the process, but don't do this. Any longer than 30 seconds at a time will heat the chocolate up too fast and cause it to become lumpy."

      "content": "Warm the coloring oil before you put it in the chocolate. Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature changes. So when you add the oil to the chocolate, its important that the oil is the same temperature as the chocolate. This will prevent the chocolate from seizing, or turning lumpy and hard."
