    {
      "title": "Recognize that a person with sensory processing disorder (SPD) will have a mix of traits.",
      "content": "Recognize that a person with sensory processing disorder (SPD) will have a mix of traits. Some senses may be over-sensitive, and some may be under-sensitive. Not all traits will apply to a person. For example, someone who is over-sensitive to touch may only fit half the bullet points listed. This is normal, and it is still worth getting an evaluation."
    },

      "title": "Be aware that SPD is not limited to childhood.",
      "content": "Be aware that SPD is not limited to childhood. People of any age may have SPD, and children do not necessarily \"grow out of it\" (although some do)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize that SPD is not emotional, but physiological.",
      "content": "Recognize that SPD is not emotional, but physiological. People don't \"do it on purpose,\" and trying to control their SPD would take tremendous amount of energy. It is best for people to be understanding and accommodating to a person with different sensory needs. Punishing a child with SPD will not magically make them sit still, eat chili without crying, stop finger flicking, et ceteraâ€”but it will cause a lot of stress and make them stop trusting you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize conditions that may co-occur or be mistaken for SPD.",
      "content": "Recognize conditions that may co-occur or be mistaken for SPD. Talk to a professional to consider and rule out anything that could be affecting the person. Most autistic people have SPD. Autistic people tend to experience passionate interests, confusion in social situations, repetitive movements, and disorganization. Sensory seeking could look similar to hyperactive type ADHD, and sensory sensitivity could look like inattentive type ADHD. (People with ADHD may also have SPD.) Visual under-sensitivity could be mistaken for dyslexia or other disabilities that impact reading and learning. Auditory under-sensitivity could be mistaken for being hard of hearing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to an occupational therapist, or someone else who specializes in SPD.",
      "content": "Talk to an occupational therapist, or someone else who specializes in SPD. While SPD is not an official diagnosis under the DSM 5, it can be identified and treated by a specialist. Expect to fill out a questionnaire about sensory responses. If a child is being evaluated, a parent/guardian will be given a form to answer about the child, and the child will be given one to fill themselves if they are old enough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize that SPD can be treated through a \"sensory diet\" and/or sensory integration therapy.",
      "content": "Recognize that SPD can be treated through a \"sensory diet\" and/or sensory integration therapy. A sensory diet means incorporating sensory activities into their lifestyle, to help reduce sensory issues. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy and can help come up with a sensory diet tailored to the person's need."
