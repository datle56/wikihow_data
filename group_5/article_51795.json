This method works for Excel for Microsoft 365, Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac, Excel for the web, Excel 2019-2007, and Excel 2019-2011 for Mac. If you open an Excel file that was sent to you and it opens but gives you a pop-up warning that read-only is recommended, you can click either Yes if you don't want to make edits or No if you want to make edits. To prevent that pop-up from appearing in the future, go to File > Save As > Browse > Tools > General Options and deselect \"Read-only recommended.\" Some files may not let you edit unless you enter a password. You'll be prompted for this password when you open the file; if you cannot type the right key, you will not be able to edit the file."
