      "content": "Open a folder on your server for both the page and the file. The easiest way to link a file is by placing the file in the same folder as the page's HTML file. Use the control panel file manager or the file browser in your FTP program to navigate to the folder containing the HTML file you'll be adding the link to. Your FTP client should already be configured to connect to your webserver since you've uploaded your site there before. If it isn't, see How to Use FTP for instructions on configuring your FTP client to connect to your server. If your web server has an online control panel, you can access your server files directly through the web management interface. You'll be able to access this when you sign into your site as an administrator. Once you're in the control panel, select the \"File Manager\" option. If you created your website using a website creation tool like WordPress, Weebly, or Wix, see the platform-specific instructions in the methods below."

Note that some servers may limit the size of the file you are allowed to upload, and large files can eat through your allotted bandwidth pretty quickly. Browsers may block potentially malicious files from being downloaded by your visitors, such as EXE or DLL files. To upload files using your FTP program, drag the file into the folder in the FTP window that you want to upload it to. It will begin uploading immediately. Your upload speeds will typically be much slower than your download speeds, so it may take a while to completely upload the file. If you are using the virtual control panel file manager, click the \"Upload\" button at the top of the window. Browse your computer for the file you want to upload. Large files may take a while to upload to your server."
