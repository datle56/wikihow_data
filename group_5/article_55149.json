In addition to that, bones can sometimes be found in temple, woodland mansion, or dungeon chests. [1] X Research source The tutorial world has bones in a chest sitting near the farm where all the animals are located in pens. If you are on creative, you can grab some bones from the creative inventory. The amount of bones needed varies. Each bone has a 1/3 chance of taming the wolf, so 6-9 bones should get the job done."
