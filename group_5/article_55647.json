      "title": "Don't panic.",
      "content": "Don't panic. Most likely nothing will happen and your lack of underwear won't be noticed by anyone because your clothes are covering your behind. You'll be just fine; the main thing is to be alert to anything that might happen if there is a gust, playing sports or getting something caught on your clothing. You could talk to someone in the school office, if you feel comfortable. They may have spare clean pairs of new underwear for just such a problem. If not, someone may come up with a solution, such as calling your parents, letting you go home to change or going to a local store to get you a pair, etc."

      "title": "Keep your clothing down at all times.",
      "content": "Keep your clothing down at all times. If this means you have to hold it down, then do so. Pay attention to sudden gusts of wind, getting clothing caught on things or pranksters lifting up your skirt or dress. If you've worn shorts or trousers, be careful of any pranksters wanting to pull them down. It's probably unlikely but you never know. If you're wearing a skirt or dress and it gets gusty or windy outside, try to stay indoors. When you go outdoors, keep one hand holding your skirt or dress down."

      "title": "Change to more comfortable clothing if possible.",
      "content": "Change to more comfortable clothing if possible. If you have your sport kit with you, you could put your shorts on and tell people that your mom had to sew them and you were forced to wear your gym kit. Or, just wear the sports shorts under your usual clothes as substitute underwear; it'll work for the day."

    {
      "title": "Avoid doing sports and activities that could cause your clothing to come up.",
      "content": "Avoid doing sports and activities that could cause your clothing to come up. Forget cartwheels and handstands for the day. Avoid playing sports games that could cause you to fall over, jump or somehow reveal your behind. You may need to confide in your PE teacher as to why you need to sit out."

      "title": "Avoid hitching up long skirts around your waistline.",
      "content": "Avoid hitching up long skirts around your waistline. Don't make long clothes shorter when you're missing underwear."

    {
      "title": "Wear your jacket or coat during the day.",
      "content": "Wear your jacket or coat during the day. If it covers your backside, this will be helpful. Another good solution is to tie your jacket or hoodie sleeves around your waist and have the jacket or hoodie hang down past your behind. This will provide added cover and probably help to keep your lower clothing in place."

    {
      "title": "Be careful with positioning yourself during the day.",
      "content": "Be careful with positioning yourself during the day. Some things to consider include: Sit carefully during the day if you're wearing a dress or skirt. Keep your legs closed whenever sitting, or carefully cross them without revealing anything. Don't put one leg up on anything when standing if wearing a dress or skirt. Keep both legs firmly planted on the ground all day, apart from walking with care. Avoid running unless you've really no choice."
