      "title": "Remove any screws",
      "content": "Remove any screws if the watch back has them. Some watch backs have a series of 4 small screws instead of notches or grooves. This type is easy to remove as long as you have a set of small watchmaker or jeweler screwdrivers. Turn the screws counterclockwise until they pop out, then slide off the loose watch back to access the stem. [1] X Research source Keep a small storage container nearby to hold the screws and watch back as you work. You can buy screwdrivers and other watch back removal tools online. Some hardware or general stores may also carry the tools from time to time."

      "title": "Pry the back off with a case opener if the notches are on the side.",
      "content": "Pry the back off with a case opener if the notches are on the side. If your watch has a smooth back and slots on its sides, you have a snap-off case. Use something sharp and pointed, such as a bench knife or a case opener, to pry off the case . Slide the edge of the knife into a notch to pull the back up and away from the watch. [2] X Research source If your watch back is stubborn, try striking the back end of the blade with a rubber mallet to force the watch parts to separate. To replace this type of back, line up the notch halves on the side of the watch. Press down on the cover to snap it in place."

      "title": "Use a rubber ball to remove the watch back if it has multiple grooves.",
      "content": "Use a rubber ball to remove the watch back if it has multiple grooves. This type of watch back, called a screw-down, has a series of 6 square grooves around its outer edge. The simplest way to remove it is by using a ball watch opener. You hold the rubber ball against the back of the watch, then twist it counterclockwise to pop off the cover. [3] X Research source Another option is to use a Jaxa wrench or case wrench. These tools have multiple prongs that grip the grooves on the watch back. Use them for stubborn backs you can’t remove with a ball. A few watch models have a ring of ridges like the edge of a coin instead of 6 grooves. Use a ball or a wrench as you normally would. This type of cover tends to be a little more stubborn, so be persistent. Replace the cover by twisting it clockwise until the grooves align and the cover locks into place."

      "title": "Find the small bolt screw holding the stem in place.",
      "content": "Find the small bolt screw holding the stem in place. The bolt screw is a little smaller than the ones holding the case together, so it is usually pretty easy to spot. Look for it near the stem, close to the edge of the watch. The bolt screw is about half the size of the other visible screws. [4] X Research source If you’re uncertain about which screw is which, try pulling the stem. When you move the steam, the bolt screw also moves a little. Push and pull the stem a few times until you’re certain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen the stem.",
      "content": "Turn the screw counterclockwise to loosen the stem. Slide the tip of a mini flathead screwdriver into the slot on the screw. You only need to rotate the screw about 1 ¾ times to free the stem. Work very gradually to avoid knocking other parts of the watch loose. [5] X Research source The screw can be removed if you keep turning it, but it is a pain to put back. You have to remove the front part of the case and the watch’s hands to fit it properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the watch stem out of the case.",
      "content": "Slide the watch stem out of the case. Pull the stem away from the watch to remove it. If you loosened the screw enough, the stem slides out without difficulty. If you can’t remove it right away, keep turning the screw until you are able to remove the stem. [6] X Research source Twist the screw a little bit at a time, testing it by attempting to remove it. This is helpful to avoid loosening the screw too much."

    {
      "title": "Replace the stem and tighten the screw to close the watch.",
      "content": "Replace the stem and tighten the screw to close the watch. When you’re ready to close the watch, slide the stem back into the hole and begin turning the screw clockwise gradually. If you feel any resistance, turn the stem clockwise until it is secure in its holding slot. Continue tightening the screw until you can no longer turn it. [7] X Research source If you tighten the screw before fitting the stem correctly, you may crush it and damage the watch. Adjust the stem’s positioning to situate it in its slot. Don’t give up as soon as the screw resists turning."

      "title": "Find the dimple near the stem if the watch doesn’t have a bolt screw.",
      "content": "Find the dimple near the stem if the watch doesn’t have a bolt screw. If the watch doesn’t have a small bolt, it has a spring mechanism holding the stem in place. The dimple looks like a small, circular indentation and is usually right next to the stem. It is often close to the edge of the watch, but sometimes it is between some of the screws holding the watch components together. [8] X Research source Double-check the cover for an indentation to push. Most, but not all, push-in watches have some sort of mark to help you remove the stem without damaging it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the stem to locate the bolt spring if you can’t find a dimple.",
      "content": "Pull the stem to locate the bolt spring if you can’t find a dimple. Some watches don’t have any visible indentations showing you how to remove the stem. If this is the case, reveal the metal tab locking the stem in place. Make sure you pull the stem out as far as possible to expose the bolt. The bolt may click when it unlocks. [9] X Research source Sometimes the dimple you need to press to release the stem is on the bolt spring, so if you don’t see it on the back of the watch, look there."
    },
    {
      "title": "Push down on the spring with tweezers.",
      "content": "Push down on the spring with tweezers. Keep the watch still with one hand as you apply the tweezers with the other. Press down on the indentation if your watch has one. If it doesn’t have one, press directly against the metal spring tab you exposed when you pulled on the stem. [10] X Research source Be gentle with the spring. Pushing it down too hard may cause it to come loose. If that happens, you have to take apart the dial and hands to repair it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the stem out to remove it from the watch.",
      "content": "Slide the stem out to remove it from the watch. Hold the spring down the entire time to prevent it from locking back into place, and use your other hand to pull the stem out and away from the watch. Once the stem is out, you can clean it or measure it to get a replacement. On some models, the spring locks as soon as you push down on it, so you don’t have to hold it in place the entire time. Usually, if the watch has an indentation, you need to maintain pressure on it to get the stem out."

    {
      "title": "Replace the stem in the slot when you’re ready to close the watch.",
      "content": "Replace the stem in the slot when you’re ready to close the watch. Slide the stem back into the slot on the side of the watch. Make sure you push down on the spring if you need to in order to keep it out of the way as you slide the stem back into place. Once the stem locks in place with a click, you can put the back cover on and set the time. [11] X Research source Be careful when moving and locking the stem to avoid bending it. Never force it in. Also, avoid snapping the spring lock into place unless the stem fits comfortably in the slot."
