      "content": "“Bot” is slang for someone who behaves suspiciously like a computer. The word is especially common in the video game scene, where AI bots (or robots) often stand in for real players in multiplayer games, and so human players who play poorly are sometimes accused of being bots. [1] X Research source On social media, users with odd posting habits or bland opinions may also be accused of being bots. Example: “Dude, you couldn’t hit a point-blank shot? You a bot?” Example: “She only ever posts about how much she loves that one pop singer. It’s like she’s a bot or something.”"

      "content": "Call out bad video game performances with “bot.” If you see someone playing badly in a video game, you might call them a “bot” to suggest they’re playing so bad that they may as well be a shoddily-programed computer. Just remember to keep your trash lighthearted and in good spirits, so you don’t ruin other players’ fun. Example: “Come on, guys, stop being bots. I want to win!” Example: “This is so easy, I feel like I’m playing against bots.”"

      "content": "Question bizarre social media presences with “bot.” Sometimes, people on social media act suspiciously like pre-programmed computers. Maybe they keep pushing a product, or maybe they keep posting the same thing over and over again. Calling them “bot” calls attention to their odd behavior. These days, you never know—they might actually be a bot. Example: “Are you a bot? Why do you keep saying, ‘Check out this cool new product’?” Example: “You gotta stop replying to every post she makes. You look like a bot.”"

      "content": "Comment on bland or dull lifestyles with “bot.” “Bot” can also be used to mean that someone generally acts like a computer. Maybe they work a 9-5 job with no hobbies, or don’t care about questioning the world around them. Often they seem like a drone, just going about life doing the same things over and over again—they might be described as “bots.” Example: “I tried talking to him, but he only wanted to talk about the weather. Total bot.” Example: “I work so much and have so little time to relax. I feel like a bot.”"

      "content": "A bot is any computer program that runs automatically. The word is short for “robot,” and like the name suggests, bots are made to perform a function without much supervision from their creator. They do all sorts of things, from retrieving information to selling products, and can be either helpful or malicious. [2] X Research source Some common types of bots include: Social media bots: These pose as regular social media users, and are often used to manipulate conversations online. Chatbots: These are AI bots that are programmed to mimic human conversation so that users can communicate with them. Web crawlers: These are bots that scan the internet, discovering web pages so search engines like Google can document them. Scrapers: These are similar to crawlers, except they retrieve content in order to harvest data or program AIs, often without user consent. Shopbots: These are bots that browse online storefronts and retrieve prices for things a user might want. One example is Shopify. Monitors: These track the usage of a website or other program in order to help programmers monitor its status and overall health. Knowbots: These bots automatically browse web pages in order to compile a knowledge database, so that a user doesn’t have to. Transactional bots: These are general-purpose bots made to streamline tedious tasks, like answering phones or performing shop transactions."

It’s become a slang word to describe someone who’s dull, repetitive, or doesn’t seem to have interest in questioning the world around them. Example: “Mike gives me NPC vibes, the way he just stands there waiting for someone to talk to him."
