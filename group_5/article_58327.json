A Lock Sign: If you can see the lock sign next to the room then the room is password protected and you need to contact the host for a password. Usually this kind of rooms are private. Description: The room's main descriptions. Usually the map, player's level, rules and restrictions are stated here. Here is a Description example: \"2 VS 2 No Rules No Newbies Fallen Empire\". in this example the host is willing to play a 2 VS 2 Game on the Fallen Empire Map and is disallowing New players to join."
