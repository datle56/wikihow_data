      "title": "Find a small flathead screwdriver.",
      "content": "Find a small flathead screwdriver. You will need a small, pointed object to pry open the mesh clasp. The type of screwdriver used to adjust eyeglass screws would work well. [1] X Research source A Phillips head screwdriver will not work, since it will be too large to fit into the clasp. If you do not have a small screwdriver, you could use a different small, blunt tool. For example, try one of the prying tools built into a Swiss Army knife. [2] X Research source Do not use a knife blade. The point of the knife could slip and scratch the watch, or you could accidentally cut your fingers with the blade."

      "title": "Hold the clasp steady.",
      "content": "Hold the clasp steady. Place the watch flat on a table or other firm surface. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the clasp firmly in position. [3] X Research source If you’re not near a table, it’s possible to adjust the clasp if you’re holding the watch in your hand. However, if this is your first time adjusting a mesh watch strap, doing it on a table will make the process easier."

    {
      "title": "Place the screwdriver head into the small hole on the clasp.",
      "content": "Place the screwdriver head into the small hole on the clasp. The front side of the clasp (which will be facing up when the watch is laying face-up) will have a small hole about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) wide directly in its center. You’ll use this hole to pry the strap open. Put the tip of your screwdriver—or other tool—directly into the hole. [4] X Research source The hole will be shaped and sized differently depending on the brand of mesh strap you’re adjusting. Some clasps may even have a small arrow pointing to the hole."

    {
      "title": "Pry the clasp upwards to open it.",
      "content": "Pry the clasp upwards to open it. There will be a small set of hinges at the base of the watch clasp, on the side closest to the watch’s face. Slowly exert pressure down on the screwdriver to pry the top portion of the clasp up and open. [5] X Research source If the clasp doesn’t fully open with the use of the screwdriver, use your thumb and index finger to open it completely."

    {
      "title": "Slide the clasp up or down the mesh strap.",
      "content": "Slide the clasp up or down the mesh strap. Adjust the clasp to accommodate your wrist. [6] X Research source Sliding the clasp farther up the mesh strap (towards the watch) will tighten the strap on your wrist, and sliding the clasp down the mesh strap (away from the watch) will loosen the strap. Be careful not to drop the clasp on the floor."

      "title": "Align the back of the clasp with a groove in the mesh watch strap.",
      "content": "Align the back of the clasp with a groove in the mesh watch strap. Due to its design, the back of the mesh watch strap will have a small groove every 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) or so. The back of the clasp will have a corresponding indentation that fits snugly into any of these grooves. [7] X Research source If you try to close the clasp without first having aligned it with a slot in the mesh strap, the clasp will be unable to close."

    {
      "title": "Close the clasp.",
      "content": "Close the clasp. Once you’ve found the best position for the watch strap and aligned it with a groove in the mesh strap, close the clasp to lock it in place. [8] X Research source You should hear a “pop” sound as the clasp snaps shut. At this point, the watch is ready to be worn."
