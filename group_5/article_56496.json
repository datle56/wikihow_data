      "content": "The \"Scorpio Stare\" is pretty famous in astrology. A scorpion is usually content to hang on the fringes of a gathering, but if she's into you, she's probably watching your every move. She's a master of observation and wants to learn everything she can about you before she makes a move. If she's shy or doesn't want to draw your attention (at least not yet), she'll probably look away if you turn to meet her gaze. But you felt her eyes on you before and you'll feel them again as soon as you turn away."

      "title": "If she likes you, she'll make you feel like you're the only person in the room.",
      "content": "If she likes you, she'll make you feel like you're the only person in the room. Scorpio women typically have pretty intense focus, so if you're out with her, she only has eyes (and ears) for you. She'll ignore everyone else, even if you're in a group with a lot of people talking. [1] X Research source For example, if you run into her and one of her friends in a café and start chatting, her friend might need to practically yell to get her attention, even though they're standing right next to each other. Pay attention to her phone as well. If her phone is chirping away and she doesn't make any move to look at it while she's talking to you, it's a safe bet that she's into you."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman is usually pretty intense and serious.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman is usually pretty intense and serious. She wears this intensity like a shield to potentially intimidate anyone around her and keep them at a distance. If she likes you, though, this shield cracks. She'll draw you in with her light, happy spark and encourage you to get closer. For example, she might laugh a little too loudly at your jokes and make silly comments about them. You can expect some physical playfulness too—a light shove coupled with a gently teasing remark, for example."

      "title": "The typical Scorpio doesn't talk to anyone she doesn't like.",
      "content": "The typical Scorpio doesn't talk to anyone she doesn't like. It might go along with her overall intensity, but Scorpios just don't do small talk. She's not going to have a conversation with you just because you happen to be standing next to her. If she strikes up a conversation with you (or better yet, several), that's a really strong sign that she's into you. She's going to want to talk about some pretty deep topics as well. No superficial chatter for the intense scorpion—she wants to dig in and find out what makes you tick."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman doesn't flirt for the sake of flirting.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman doesn't flirt for the sake of flirting. This might come as a surprise, given that Scorpios are known to be incredibly sexual people—but flirting is a different thing altogether. The Scorpio woman typically takes sex very seriously (like everything else) and she's not going to entertain the idea of having sex with anyone she's not emotionally bonded with. For example, if she's constantly sending you texts that are positively dripping with sexual innuendo, that's a really good sign that she's interested in taking things further with you. A scorpion also doesn't pass out compliments lightly, so if she tells you she likes something, she means it—and probably means she likes you as well."

      "title": "Scorpio women are usually deeply curious.",
      "content": "Scorpio women are usually deeply curious. If she likes you, she wants to know as much about you as possible. She'll ask the usual mundane questions to start—she wants to know about your family, your work, your education—but she also wants to know your philosophy of life. Her probing questions are designed to give her a window into your very soul. [2] X Research source For example, she might ask something like, \"What's your biggest regret in life?\" When you tell her, she might follow up by asking why you regret it, or what you would do instead if you had that moment to live over. Don't worry—if she likes you, she'll respond in kind and open herself up to you as well. But it might take the secretive scorpion a little longer to trust you. Your answers to her questions will help her decide if she really wants to let you in."

      "title": "Scorpio women are usually guarded and cold at first.",
      "content": "Scorpio women are usually guarded and cold at first. This defensiveness is necessary to her because, deep down, she's very sensitive and caring. [3] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. She feels her emotions intensely and doesn't want just anyone to have access to her inner vulnerability. But if she likes you, you'll start to see that nurturing side of her more often. For example, if you're walking in a park, she might point out a little boy playing with his dog and say, \"Look, isn't that just adorable?\" Sharing that sweet moment with you is something she'll only do if she's into you. When she does expose this other side, don't tease her about it. Even good-natured teasing can cause her to put her guard back up. She only reveals her softness when she feels safe with you."

      "title": "The secretive scorpion typically prefers privacy and solitude.",
      "content": "The secretive scorpion typically prefers privacy and solitude. She's usually not going to go anywhere if she doesn't have to for some reason. If a Scorpio woman is willing to go out with you, whether on an actual date or just to accompany you on a mundane errand, you can bet that she has a thing for you. [4] X Research source For example, suppose you're chatting and realize you need to stop at the grocery store to pick up a few things. You ask her to go with you and she says \"Okay, sure!\" She's probably into you and her desire to spend more time with you outweighs her preference for going home to be alone."

She wants the best for you and wants you to be happy. If something or someone gets in the way of that, you can be sure that she'll have something to say about it. She thinks you're great, and she'll tell other people how great you are as well. If a mutual acquaintance mentions that she said something complimentary about you to them, that's a good sign that she's into you. Reader Poll: We asked 485 wikiHow readers who are Scorpios what they value most in a relationship, and 69% of them agreed that loyalty is most important to them. [Take Poll] If you're interested in her, show her that you're trustworthy and dependable, too!"

      "title": "She normally wants to be in control of everything, but if she likes you, she'll let go.",
      "content": "She normally wants to be in control of everything, but if she likes you, she'll let go. It's not that she's a control freak (although she can be), but the typical Scorpio woman wants to do things her way. If she lets you take the lead and is willing to ease back and go with the flow, she likes you and trusts you in a big way. For example, if you mention that you'd like to hang out on Saturday, she might say, \"Oh yeah? What did you have in mind?\" Usually, she'd tell you something specific she wants to do, but if she's letting you take the lead and choose something, that's a sign that she's into you. She'll probably be more physically relaxed as well. If you notice her getting less tense when the two of you are alone together, she likes you enough to feel comfortable around you."

      "content": "She wants to know where you are and what you're doing at all times. She's doing this because she cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay—not necessarily because she's trying to control you. If she likes you, it's important that she always knows what's going on with you. She also wants to know if you need anything from her. She's not one to let a lot of people get close, but she's dedicated to those who do. If you ever need any help from her, she'll be there in a flash."

      "title": "A Scorpio woman usually hides her emotions unless she likes you.",
      "content": "A Scorpio woman usually hides her emotions unless she likes you. For a Scorpio, keeping feelings hidden is a protective instinct. She's very sensitive and doesn't want to make herself vulnerable. But if she's into you, she won't be so worried about that. Jealousy is a big feeling to look for from a Scorpio woman. For example, if her eyes narrow and she gets kind of clingy when another woman comes up to you and starts talking or flirting with you, that's a pretty clear sign that she's into you. It might take her some time to get to this point. If she has a crush on you but isn't confident in how you feel about her, she'll keep her guard up with you until she feels more comfortable. Scorpio is a fixed sign, so it's easy for Scorpios to get attached. [6] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019."
