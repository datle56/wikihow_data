Continue to be gentle as you run your fingers through your hair from root to tip, and squeeze portions of your hair to wring out water. Further absorb water by using a clean, dry towel to gently pat your scalp and squeeze your hair. You may need more than one towel if your hair is long or very thick.

      "content": "Apply the products that will help protect your hair from the heat and achieve the style you want. Reading the directions for your specific product will ensure proper application. However, typically when you apply your hair product, you will apply it to the roots of your hair, and then spread it along the length of your hair and to your ends. If you’re going for a classic straight look, you’ll apply a thermal protectant and a leave-in straightening treatment. If you want added volume, start by applying mousse. Apply it throughout your hair from roots to tips. Apply the volumizing spray to the roots of your hair only. Then apply the argan oil to the length of your hair that extends from the chin down. Argan oil is a very lightweight oil that will protect your hair from the heat. [3] X Research source The amount of product you use may differ depending on the length and thickness of your hair."

      "content": "Rough dry your hair. Rough drying your hair means instead of using your brush, you’ll use your hands along with your blow dryer to dry your hair. Start by placing your fingers against your scalp, finger-comb your hair upwards to create volume or downwards for a sleek straight hair, and follow with your blow dryer pointed at a 45-degree angle. Blow dry until your hair is about 80% dry."

      "content": "Section your hair evenly into one-inch sections. If you want to ensure added volume to your look, these sections should be no wider than the width of the brush or taller than the depth of the brush. Starting with your hair in the back, you’ll want to section your hair into one-inch sections using a rattail comb. Create a horizontal part near your ears to separate a portion of your hair right above the nape of your neck from the rest. Secure the top portion of hair to the top of your head with a rubber band or large hair clip. You can either divide the entire lower section of hair into one-inch parts using your rattail comb and hair clips before you begin blow drying, or you can divide your hair into one-inch parts as you blow dry. Section your hair by working your way up and around your head. You can either section all of your hair at once, or save time and hair clips by simply sectioning and blow drying your hair as you go along."

      "content": "Straighten your hair using your brush and blow dryer with a nozzle. You’ll need a flat paddle brush and a wide and narrow nozzle for your blow dryer. The nozzle will direct a concentrated blast of heat towards your hair. Which hands you use to hold the blow dryer and brush will likely be determined by what feels right to you, and whether you’re left-handed or right-handed. It is best to hold your brush vertical and your blow dryer horizontal to achieve a “modern wave. [4] X Research source"

Place your brush at the root of your hair, grip the handle of the brush, and turn it slightly to get a firm, but not painful or hair-breaking, grip on your hair. Slide the brush through your hair from root to tip at a downward angle. As you get towards the end of your hair, you can angle in whatever direction you would like for your ends to go."

You can choose whether you’d like to show off your new look by wearing your hair down or pulled back. You can also now part your hair how you like, either on the side or down the middle. Other style suggestions: slick your hair straight back, pin a portion in the front, or pull your hair into a ponytail."

      "content": "Straighten your hair section by section using a brush and your blow dryer with a nozzle. To create a straight look with added volume you’ll need a round brush that has a mix of nylon and boar bristles. You’ll also need to make sure your blow dryer has a wide and narrow nozzle to direct the heat towards your hair. Hold your blow dryer and brush in whichever hands feel most comfortable. This is usually dictated by whether you are left-handed or right-handed. Hold your brush vertical and your blow dryer horizontal for a more modern curl. Starting with the hair at the back of your head, position the brush at the roots and twist the brush to wrap your hair around the brush once. This creates the tension you’ll need for a smooth blow out. To get the volume you want, pull the brush upwards and back along the length of your hair, and allow the blow dryer to follow the brush. Once you finish the back section, part a thick section of your hair above it. Divide the hair into sections and blow dry it straight following the same method as before. Continue to work your way up and around your head, making sure to brush in an upwards motion to create volume and curl."
