If the serial number doesn’t correspond to the series, then you are dealing with a counterfeit . [1] X Research source If the bill is series 2009, then the serial number should begin with J. If the bill is series 2009A, then the serial number should begin with L."

      "content": "Check for color-change ink. There is a large copper-colored inkwell to the left of the bill’s serial number. Inside the inkwell is a bell, which should change color from copper to green as you look at the bill from different angles. [3] X Research source The numeral 100 beside the inkwell should also change color, just as it does on some older $100 bills."

      "title": "Hold the bill up to the light.",
      "content": "Hold the bill up to the light. An embedded thread runs just to the left of Franklin’s portrait. The letters “USA” and the number 100 alternate along the strip, which is visible from both sides of the note. If you hold the bill up to UV light, then the strip should glow pink. [4] X Research source You can also purchase a counterfeit detector which shines UV light, which might be helpful if your business handles a lot of bills. A popular option is the AccuBanker D63 Compact. It costs about $50."

      "title": "Check the blue security ribbon.",
      "content": "Check the blue security ribbon. Just to the right of Franklin’s portrait is a blue security ribbon. This ribbon is 3-D. Move the bill back and forth and check that you see the number 100 and tiny bells move from side-to-side as you move the bill. [5] X Research source This ribbon is woven into the paper, not pasted on. Accordingly, if the blue ribbon is peeling off the bill, then you have a fake."

      "title": "Check the date.",
      "content": "Check the date. The newest $100 bills are “Series 2009” bills, and they have many different security features. Older bills are being phased out of circulation to prevent counterfeiters from fooling people. Nevertheless, older bills are still legal tender, so if you get one you shouldn’t automatically assume it is fake. Check the date on the bill. [9] X Research source The average $100 bill stay in circulation for seven years. Accordingly, most of the older bills should be out of circulation by now. Nevertheless, you might have one or more stored at home that you want to check."

Also, bills should have slightly raised ink, which is a feature of the printing process. If you handle currency as part of your job, you should quickly develop familiarity with the feel of authentic money. [10] X Research source Using touch is not foolproof, however. The most successful counterfeiters will bleach real money and then print over it. Nevertheless, counterfeiters struggle to reproduce the raised printing, so feeling the bill is a good first step."

[13] X Research source For bills issued between 1996-2013, “USA100” should appear in the numeral 100 on the lower left-hand corner.
