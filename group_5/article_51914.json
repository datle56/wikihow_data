[2] X Research source There should be a nice blue spark that goes from the end of the wire you pulled out of the center of the cap to the metal clip. It should look and sound strong, and should be easy to see, even in daylight. If the spark looks thin and weak (yellow is weak, blue is strong), then the coil winding may be giving out."

[3] X Research source Remove all the wires taken off the terminals of the coil attach the positive and negative, red and black, wires of the meter to first the terminal 15 (positive) and 1 (negative) that are stamped on the coil. A reading of at least 3 - 4.5 ohms, indicates a good coil. A bad coil will show a higher reading then 3 - 4.5 ohms. Place the red or black lead from the meter to the center of the coil (secondary post), and to either one of the terminals, 1 or 15 on the coil. A reading of 9,500 - 10,000 Ohms, sometimes less, indicates a good coil. A reading of 11,000 Ohms or more, or a reading of zero indicates a bad coil."
