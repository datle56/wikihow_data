Then, write down the powers of two from right to left. Start at 2 0 , evaluating it as \"1\". Increment the exponent by one for each power. Stop when the amount of elements in the list is equal to the amount of digits in the binary number. The example number, 10011011, has eight digits, so the list, with eight elements, would look like this: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. [1] X Research source"

Now, just write 10011011 below the numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 so that each binary digit corresponds with its power of two. The \"1\" to the right of the binary number should correspond with the \"1\" on the right of the listed powers of two, and so on. You can also write the binary digits above the powers of two, if you prefer it that way. What's important is that they match up."

Then, draw a line from the second digit of the binary number to the second power of two in the list. Continue connecting each digit with its corresponding power of two.

The \"1\" to the left of the decimal point is equal to 2 0 , or 1. The 1 to the right of the decimal is equal to 2 -1 , or .5. Add up 1 and .5 and you get 1.5, which is 1.1 2 in decimal notation."
