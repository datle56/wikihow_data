      "title": "Register your business name.",
      "content": "Register your business name. Generally, you need a name for your business that isn't already being used by another business in New York. Choose a name that's catchy and indicates the products or services your business will offer. [2] X Research source Since you don't know if the name you choose will be available, come up with a list of 3 to 5 names that appeal to you and your partners (if you have any). Then go to https://www.dos.ny.gov/corps/bus_entity_search.html and search the name to see if it's already in use in the state. Check similar names as well. For example, if you want to go with \"Caroline's Crazy Cupcakes,\" you might also see if there are any other \"Crazy Cupcakes\" businesses that might be confused with yours. Once you've chosen your name, you can reserve it for up to 60 days with a fee of $20. Go to https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3414/ to reserve your name. The 60 days will give you time to finish forming your business before you register your name."

      "content": "Choose a legal structure for your business. In New York State, you can organize your business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC) , or corporation. Each of these legal structures has different tax implications and may impact your ability to expand your business in the future. [3] X Research source A sole proprietorship is treated as indistinct from you for tax purposes. You report the business income on your personal tax return and pay self-employment taxes. If your business goes bankrupt, you may be personally liable for your business's debts. A partnership is treated similarly to a sole proprietorship, except there are 2 or more people involved in the business. With a corporation, you are not legally responsible for the debts of your business. The corporation is considered an entirely separate legal entity and pays its own taxes. Corporations are more highly regulated than the other structures and can be more expensive and complicated to form. An LLC is, in some ways, the best of both worlds. You get the limited liability of a corporation but can also enjoy pass-through taxation by electing to be treated as a partnership. That way, your business doesn't have to pay corporate taxes. A limited liability partnership (LLP or Limited Partnership) is another form of LLC, typically among professionals, such as doctors or lawyers."
