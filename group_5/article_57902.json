Use a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser to prevent further clogging your pores. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Never steam your face before washing it.

      "content": "Fill a sink or bowl with hot water. Use any clean bowl, sink, or another water basin to steam your face.

[2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Clean the surface of the water basin thoroughly with soap and rinse it out before you attempt to steam your face. In the past, it was thought that antibacterial soap would be helpful, but newer studies have shown that antibacterial soaps can cause superbugs, which is why ordinary detergent or soap is recommended.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have sensitive skin or are prone to rosacea, don’t steam your face more than once a week.
