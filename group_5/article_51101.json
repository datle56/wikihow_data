      "title": "Incorporate foods that support your thyroid.",
      "content": "Incorporate foods that support your thyroid. Certain foods can help your thyroid work better. For any thyroid disease, make sure you include the foods that support your thyroid gland. These foods include: [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Berries, such as blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, blackberries, elderberries, salmon berries, and blackberries. Berries contain high levels of antioxidants which help boost your immune system and dampen inflammation. Lots of fresh vegetables. Include a wide variety of colors, such as greens, plus red, orange, yellow, and purple vegetables, and all types of vegetables, like leafy, stem, florets, and tubers. Fish, like salmon, mackerel and tuna. These fish are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Non-fish sources of omega-3 fatty acids are walnuts, borage, and flaxseed oils. Omega-3 fatty acids are important building blocks for naturally produced anti-inflammatory substances in your body. Foods with vitamin D. You can eat fish and mushrooms, or dairy products fortified with vitamin D. To increase vitamin D, you can also spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun. High-quality protein. Try to get one at every meal. Good sources of protein include poultry, beans, eggs, legumes, and nuts."

      "content": "Increase your intake of thyroid-supporting nutrients. You should increase the amount of foods with nutrients that boost the function of your thyroid. Try to eat at least one serving of food containing these nutrients each day. Eat more vitamin A. Foods high in Vitamin A include vegetables, like sweet potato, spinach and other dark leafy greens, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, red peppers, summer squash; fruit such as cantaloupe, mangoes, and apricots; legumes, meat, liver, and fish. [4] X Research source Tyrosine is essential for good thyroid function. You can find this in turkey or egg whites. Selenium also helps regulate thyroid production. [5] X Expert Source Anne Dunev, PhD, NP, ACN Certified Nutritionist & Naturopathic Practitioner Expert Interview. 2 September 2020. Brazil nuts are the best source of selenium. You can also find selenium in tuna, mushrooms, beef, sunflower seeds, halibut, and soybeans. [6] X Research source Check your iodine. [7] X Expert Source Anne Dunev, PhD, NP, ACN Certified Nutritionist & Naturopathic Practitioner Expert Interview. 2 September 2020. In developing countries, supplementing your iodine intake with iodine-based salt can improve thyroid function; however, in many developed countries, you may be at risk for an excess of iodine, which can cause autoimmune thyroiditis. Talk to your doctor about your iodine intake and if you need to adjust it."

      "title": "Limit thyroid-suppressing foods.",
      "content": "Limit thyroid-suppressing foods. If you are have hypothyroidism, that means your thyroid works slower than normal. Some foods may interfere with your thyroid’s function by suppressing it, which can make hypothyroidism worse. Limit certain vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, rutabagas, broccoli, and bok choy. These foods can interfere with iodine uptake in the thyroid. If you want to eat them, make sure to steam them and don’t eat them raw. It is recommended to limit peanuts/peanut butter as this can interfere with iodine uptake in our bodies. You should eliminate foods that have high levels of mercury, such as swordfish, mackerel, shark, and most tuna. These foods interfere with your thyroid."

      "title": "Minimize stress.",
      "content": "Minimize stress. Stress can have negative effects on your thyroid. Stress overworks the adrenal glands, which can accompany an underactive thyroid. Cortisol levels are also increased by stress, which affects insulin levels and hunger. [8] X Research source Stress also causes people to overeat or turn to junk food, which can negatively affect the thyroid. Learn stress-relieving techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, or tai chi. Other approaches can include meditation, massage, and getting enough sleep. Taking time off from your responsibilities can be very beneficial and restorative as well."

      "content": "Learn the importance of the thyroid. The thyroid gland plays a very important role in a number of critical functions. The thyroid helps maintain energy levels, normal temperature, weight, clear thinking, the response of the body to other hormones, and the synthesis of proteins. The thyroid is located at the base of the neck and wraps around the front of the neck, like a bow tie or a butterfly. Thyroid problems can develop suddenly or develop over the course of years. [12] X Research source Larson PR, Ingbar SH: The thyroid gland. In: Wilson JD, Foster DW, ed. Williams' Textbook of Endocrinology, ed 8. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 1992:367-487. The most common conditions that affect the thyroid are hypothyroidism, which is an underactive thyroid, and hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid. The most common form of hypothyroid disease is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder where the body is producing antibodies to the thyroid. This leads to the decreased production of thyroid hormones and an underactive thyroid."

      "content": "Recognize the risk factors. There are a number of factors that may put you at risk for hypothyroidism. Knowing the risk factors can help you determine if any symptoms you have may be related to your thyroid function. If any of these risk factors apply to you, talk to your physician about thyroid screening. Screening can help diagnose thyroid disease early. These risk factors include: [13] X Research source Age: As with many disorders, the risk of hypothyroidism increases as you age. Gender: Women are at greater risk for hypothyroidism. Family History: Thyroid disease tends to run in families. If a close relative has had thyroid disease, you are at greater risk. Autoimmune disease: The presence of any autoimmune disease increases the risk of thyroid disease. Medical history of radiation to the neck or chest."

Your doctor will take blood and test your thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) to determine if you are at risk. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, depression, difficulty concentrating, weight gain, slower heartbeats, dry skin, thinning hair, sensitivity to cold, irregular menstrual cycles, constipation, and swelling around the neck."
