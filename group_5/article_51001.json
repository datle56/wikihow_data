      "title": "Banks and credit unions",
      "content": "Banks and credit unions Before traveling, contact your bank or credit union to ask if they can exchange for the currency you need. Exchange rates at banks and credit unions are better than at airports and exchange desks in tourism hotspots, and you can usually place an order over the phone and pick up the money at the branch a few days later. [1] X Research source Some banks will even waive the fees if you convert a certain amount of currency. When you return from your travels, your bank may buy back any remaining foreign currency in your possession. Before exchanging, be sure to check the current exchange rates on Xe.com or Reuters . These rates are not the same as those a traveler will receive when exchanging currency; they are interbank rates that banks use as a reference for trading large volumes of currency electronically."
