      "content": "Water your mini orchids once a week when the potting medium dries out. Stick your finger or the point of a sharpened pencil 2 in (5.1 cm) into the potting medium. If the soil still feels wet, then leave your mini orchids alone for now. If the soil is dry, water your plant by pouring about 1.5 fluid ounces (44 ml) directly onto the soil. Let the water move through the potting medium and let the excess drain out from the bottom of your pot.

Then, lift the pot out of the bowl and let the excess water all drain out. You may also quickly flush running water through the top of the pot for a few seconds and let it drain out. [2] X Expert Source Rachel Guffey Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 5 August 2021. Overwatering can cause the roots to get soggy and kill your mini orchid, so always wait until the soil feels dry. Water phalaenopsis and paphiopedilum mini orchids just before the soil completely dries out. For cattleyas and oncidiums, let the soil get completely dry between waterings. [3] X Research source Even though it’s a popular trend, avoid watering your orchid with ice because the freezing cold can stress or damage the plant, which could decrease its lifespan. [4] X Research source During the winter months, reduce how much you water so the soil just feels damp. [5] X Research source"

[6] X Expert Source Harmony Corelitz Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021. Direct sunlight could cause your orchids to overheat and get sun-damaged otherwise. [7] X Expert Source Monique Capanelli Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 22 September 2020. When your orchids receive enough light, the leaves will look light and golden green. Dark green leaves mean your orchids need more light while yellow or red leaves mean they’re receiving too much. [8] X Research source Use fluorescent grow lights or high-intensity discharge lights if you don’t have a suitable place for your orchids. Position the lights 6–12 in (15–30 cm) away from the top of your mini orchids to prevent them from getting too much light. [9] X Research source Alternatively, place your mini orchids in a south-facing window and block out some of the direct sun with a translucent shade or screen in a southern window."

      "content": "Maintain a room temperature between 65–85 °F (18–29 °C). Mini orchids are tropical plants, so they thrive in warmer conditions. For best results, maintain the temperature on the high end of the scale during the day and drop it to the lower end in the evenings. Never allow the temperature to drop below 55 °F (13 °C) since this could stress out your flowers and keep them from blooming. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep the mini orchids at around 50% humidity. Mini orchids thrive in humid conditions, so try lightly misting the plant every 1–2 days to help increase the humidity. Alternatively, set a tray of pebbles and water underneath the water to naturally increase the humidity. If you need to raise the humidity even more for your orchids, run a humidifier in the same room during the day. [11] X Research source Keep a humidity meter near your flowers so you can easily track the moisture levels in the air. Avoid leaving your flowers near open windows or air vents since it could reduce the humidity around the orchids."

Mix 1 part fertilizer with 3 parts water to dilute the mixture to ¼-strength. Each week after you water your mini orchids, follow up with the diluted fertilizer to ensure the flowers grow in strong and healthy. [12] X Research source Avoid giving your orchids fertilizer when the soil is dry since you could burn the roots and prevent them from absorbing water or nutrients. Skip fertilizing your orchids during the winter months when they’re not actively growing so you don’t stress out your plant. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Prune phalaenopsis orchids above the stem’s second node for more blooms. Phalaenopsis, also known as teacup or darling orchids, is the only type of orchid that can bloom twice during the same growing season. Once the flowers dry out and shrivel, gently twist them to remove them from the stem. Then, use a sharp knife or gardening shears to cut just above the second node, which is where leaves or flowers grow from the stem. Within a few weeks, your orchid will have a second round of flowers. [16] X Research source If you leave phalaenopsis orchids without cutting them, flowers may grow back in the same spots as the old ones, but they may not get as large as before. Mini piccola, cattleya, and cymbidium orchids only bloom once for the season, so they won’t rebloom if you try pruning them."

If you notice that leaves are dying out more quickly or that “air roots” are growing out from the pot’s drainage holes or above the soil, then it’s time to repot your plant.

Measure the pot that your orchid is currently planted in, and choose a slightly larger one for repotting. Make sure the pot has drainage holes at the bottom so water can drip out and prevent the roots from becoming soggy.

Pour the boiling water into the potting mix and stir it together. Let the mix absorb the water and come to room temperature. After that, drain out any excess water. [21] X Research source The boiling water helps kill any bacteria that’s present in the potting mix.

Then, gently grab the base of the orchid with one hand and the pot with your other. Tip the mini orchid to its side or upside-down, and slowly squeeze or rotate the sides of the pot until the clump of roots comes free.

[24] X Research source If you notice any roots that look brown, black, or wilted, use a pair of gardening shears to trim away the unhealthy growths. [25] X Research source Leave healthy roots that are white or green and feel firm so your orchids can grow in strong in the new pot.

Then, set your orchid in the middle of the pot so that the base of the lowest leaf dips below the pot’s rim by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Slowly add the remaining potting mix around the orchids to fill in the container until the entire root system is covered. [26] X Research source Periodically tap the side of the container with your hand to help the potting mix settle it. Try gently lifting the orchids up by the stem after filling in the potting mix.
