      "content": "Pull out loose lint and other matter caught in the Velcro with your fingers. Pinch any large pieces of matter that are caught in the Velcro between your fingernails and pull them out. Think of how you would clean out hair from a hairbrush, and do the same for the lint, hair, and other things that are caught in the Velcro. [1] X Research source Velcro tabs consist of two parts called a hook and loop fastener system. The rougher side is called the hook, and the softer side is called the loop. The hook is generally the part that collects the debris because this is the part of the Velcro that grabs and sticks. It is possible that over time your Velcro will stop being sticky because the hooks get damaged. In this case, cleaning will only do so much and you may have to replace the Velcro if you cannot restore its grabbing power."

      "content": "Pick out lint and debris that you can’t reach with your fingers with tweezers. Hold the Velcro steady with a hand. Use a pair of tweezers with your other hand to pluck out pieces of matter that are caught further down in the hooks of the Velcro. [2] X Research source Be careful not to grab and pull on the hooks with the tweezers. You might damage them and cause your Velcro to be less sticky."

      "title": "Use a pin or needle if you don’t have tweezers to pull out matter.",
      "content": "Use a pin or needle if you don’t have tweezers to pull out matter. Slide the pointy end between the rows of hooks and underneath debris, then gently lift up to pull out the matter. Work in the same direction as the rows of hooks are facing on the Velcro. You can use any small, thin, and needle-like object for this method. Just make sure that it is sturdy enough to pull out debris that might be really stuck in the Velcro without bending."

      "content": "Scrape debris out of the Velcro with a fine-toothed comb instead of a needle. Hold the Velcro flat and securely in place. Slide a plastic, metal, or wooden comb along the rows of hooks to scrape out stubborn lint and other debris that you can’t pluck or lift out. [3] X Research source Make sure the teeth of the comb are not so fine and delicate that they could break as you scrape out debris."

      "content": "Brush the Velcro with a dry toothbrush after you pull out as much as you can. [4] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Use an old toothbrush that you don’t need for your teeth anymore. Brush the Velcro in 1 direction parallel to the rows of hooks to get out any remaining pieces of lint and other matter. [5] X Research source A stiff-bristled toothbrush works best, or you can use another kind of stiff brush like a dish brush or a pet brush. Be careful not to scrub too hard or you might damage the hooks on the Velcro. This is why it’s important to work parallel to the hooks so that they keep their form as you brush out debris."

      "content": "Keep Velcro tabs closed as much as possible so they don’t collect debris. Close the hook and loop fasteners on Velcro whenever you are not using it. This will protect the hooks from picking up stray matter like lint, hair, and other debris. [6] X Research source Velcro is designed to be sticky and will easily grab onto things like blankets or clothes from which it will pick up lint."

      "content": "Close Velcro tabs on garments before washing them. [7] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. When you wash Velcro it will pick up lint, hair, and anything else floating around in the washing machine. Keep the hook and loop fasteners closed when you wash Velcro to keep this from happening. Wash garments that contain Velcro separately from other items when possible."

      "title": "Let Velcro air dry instead of putting it in the dryer.",
      "content": "Let Velcro air dry instead of putting it in the dryer. Washers and dryers are full of lint that Velcro attracts. Leave garments that contain Velcro to air dry so the Velcro doesn't pick up lint from other clothing and fabric items. If air drying isn't possible, then keep the Velcro tabs closed and dry the garments in the dryer separately from other items."
