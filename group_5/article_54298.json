      "content": "Melon stems create melon seeds when destroyed. Whenever you find a wild patch of watermelons, look for an upright stem in an adjacent block. Destroying the stem (especially when it’s already attached to a watermelon) will generate 1-3 stacks of seeds. [1] X Research source Melon stems actually go through 8 total stages of growth, even if they look identical to fully-grown stems. If your destroyed stem doesn’t produce any melon seeds, it might’ve been too young."

Occasionally, a wandering trader (dressed in blue robes) and his llama will appear nearby, offering limited wares in exchange for emeralds. Sometimes, this trader offers a stack of melon seeds in exchange for 1 emerald. [5] X Research source You can trade for melon seeds up to 12 times before the option goes away. It’s possible to get emeralds by trading with regular villagers, or by mining emerald ore with a weapon that’s at least iron-level strength. [6] X Research source"

By those odds, you have a good chance of finding some melon seeds after exploring 5-6 chests. [7] X Research source Not sure where your nearest woodland mansion is?
