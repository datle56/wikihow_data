[1] X Research source The Metadata tab allows you to change the way the title, cover, author, and other descriptive info appears in the converted file. The Look & Feel tab lets you customize colors, text, and layout. MOBI output has format-specific options for ignoring margins, avoiding JPEG image conversion, disabling compression, and changing the MOBI version. By default, \"MOBI file type\" is set to \"old\" to ensure compatibility with all Kindles. However, if you have a newer Kindle (3rd generation or later, except Kindle DX), changing to New adds additional formatting features. The Heuristic Processing section is here in case you wind up with missing words or extra spaces in your MOBI file after converting. Since this option could mess up an otherwise fine PDF-to-MOBI conversion, don't select it at first. If the converted file has spacing issues, try converting again with this option selected."
