      "content": "Shuffle and deal 8 cards to each player. Take a normal 52-card deck and thoroughly shuffle it. One card at a time, deal cards to players starting with the player on your left. [3] X Research source In Crazy Eights (and, generally, in most card games), cards are always dealt starting with the player to the left of the dealer. If there are only two players total, only deal 7 cards instead of the usual 8. As mentioned earlier, if there are more than 5 players, combine 2 decks together."

This will become the discard pile. If an 8 starts off the draw pile, reshuffle and flip over a new starting card. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Match rank or suit with the top card to get rid of one of your cards.",
      "content": "Match rank or suit with the top card to get rid of one of your cards. To play a card, players must either match the rank (4, 10, K, A…) or suit (♣,♦,♥,♠) with a single card in their hand. This card is placed face-up on top of the discard pile and the turn passes to the next player on the left. In most standard card games, including Crazy Eights, the player to left of the dealer is the first to play a card after the cards are dealt. 8s are wild cards in this game. When you play an 8, you'll have to declare the new suit. Some versions of Crazy Eights restrict players from ending on an 8."

If you don't have any cards in your hand that match the rank or suit of the top card, draw cards from the draw pile until you get a playable card. After that, play the card and then continue as normal. [6] X Research source Some players only allow one card to be drawn per turn. Draw rules are often determined according to player preferences."

      "content": "Play cards one at a time until a player has none left. Once the player to the left of the dealer has played a single card, the next player to the left goes. In this fashion, players discard (or draw until they can discard) a single card at a time. The hand ends when a player has no more cards in their hand. If you’re playing one round, the person who discarded their cards first is the winner! If you’re playing multiple hands, move on to the winning and scoring section below."

This is a game-ending condition in Crazy Eights. The player with the fewest points (not necessarily cards) in their hand wins. Aces are worth 1 point. Numbered cards are worth the same amount as their number of pips. Court cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points apiece. 8s really are crazy with a value of 50 points!

However, doing this will decrease your draw pile, which could have the opposite effect and shorten your game. Because of this, you may want to play with two decks combined. [11] X Research source When adding more cards to your Crazy Eights deck, choose cards with the same design to prevent card counting. Add your second deck to the first by shuffling the cards together as you would normally. Take your time - since there are more cards, it can be difficult to shuffle."

Blocker cards can level the playing field. Play blocker cards after a draw card to cancel the effect of the draw card. 10s and Jacks work well as blocker cards. This way, it’s somewhat risky to hold onto these cards, because if you get stuck with one at the end, it’ll be worth 10 points against you."

Playing a 2 causes the next player to draw two cards. Playing the Queen of Spades causes the next player to draw five. [16] X Research source Some players allow forced draws to skip a person if an offensive card is played on top of an offensive card. So if a 2 were played, the next player could lay another 2, passing a four-card draw down the line."

      "title": "List and describe shifting cards.",
      "content": "List and describe shifting cards. Shifting cards change the order in which cards are played. There are three main shifting cards: 4s, Jacks, and Kings. 4s reverse the direction of play from left to right or vice versa. Jacks skip the next player’s turn. Kings allow you to continue your turn and play two cards. [17] X Research source If the direction of play is normal, it's always to the left. Playing a 4 reverses this direction until another 4 gets played. If a player skipped by a Jack also has a Jack, some rules allow the skipped player to use it. This results in two players being skipped - or more, depending on how many Jacks are played. Kings allow you to shed two cards in one turn. Some players insist that the card following the King must be the same suit, others allow any card to follow the King."
