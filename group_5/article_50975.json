      "content": "Bed rotting refers to lying in bed doing nothing all day. Bed rotting is a TikTok self-care trend that promotes staying in bed for hours and being intentionally unproductive. While the term may sound negative, TikTok mostly views it as a positive trend that rebels against Western society’s emphasis on productivity and hustle culture. [1] X Research source For example, “My class got canceled today so I’m going to bed rot and catch up on Netflix.” Bed rotting is especially popular with Gen Z, who may feel burnt out due to work, school, and family commitments. The term likely originated on TikTok in 2023 and has since gained billions of views on the app. While the exact origins of the term are hard to pinpoint, TikTok user @lifeasraven has gained over 67k followers for her advice on how to bed rot in peace and how to stop bed rotting when you need to be productive. Some common bed rotting activities include scrolling through social media, watching TV, reading books, eating snacks, and napping."

By the time the weekend rolls around, your exhaustion will likely catch up with you.

      "content": "It can help prevent burnout from work or school. In a society that values productivity, it’s easy to get so caught up in work, school, and other commitments that you forget or don’t have time to relax, which can lead to burn out. Bed rotting allows your mind and your body to relax so you can continue to do the things you need to do with a reduced chance of it becoming too much to handle. [3] X Research source"

In modern society, there’s often a pressure to be productive and on the go all the time, which can cause us to feel guilty if we actually take the time to rest. However, the bed rotting trend gives you permission—and encourages you—to rest, as it is a form of self-care that acknowledges how important downtime can be for our physical and mental health.

After a long week of social interactions, bed rotting can be a great way to calm down and spend some time to yourself, which can be especially beneficial for introverts. If you had a negative or stressful interaction with someone, spending a day in bed can help you calm down and prepare for the week ahead. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Bed rotting may impact your sleep schedule.",
      "content": "Bed rotting may impact your sleep schedule. Most sleep experts recommend using your bed only for sleep and intimacy, as anything else can cause your brain to associate your bed with wakefulness and activity rather than rest. If you lie in bed all day watching TV, scrolling on your phone, or even reading, it may be more difficult for you to fall asleep at night. [6] X Research source Staying indoors all day can also impact your sleep schedule. Being exposed to natural sunlight often helps you fall asleep faster, sleep longer, and get higher quality rest. Indoor lighting doesn’t have the same impact."

      "content": "Bed rotting may negatively affect mental health. If you bed rot for too long, you may start neglecting work, school, and other necessary tasks, which can ultimately make you feel even more stressed than you were before bed rotting. Lying in bed all day with few distractions also allows your mind to dwell and ruminate on any negative thoughts you may have. [7] X Research source If you bed rot regularly, you may be missing out on important social connection and interaction. This could contribute to social isolation, which often harms your mental health."

In addition to affecting your mental health, regular bed rotting can negatively impact your physical health, as well, as you may begin neglecting exercise and healthy meals. Excessive bed rotting can also lead to blood clots, as your veins cannot pump blood properly when you’re not moving around. [8] X Research source In extreme cases, prolonged bed rotting can lead to deconditioning, or loss of muscle strength, which can make you feel tired and weak. Deconditioning occurs from long periods of inactivity and is most common among those who are hospitalized or put on bed rest, but it can occur if you remain inactive and sedentary for other reasons, like bed rotting.

      "content": "Bed rotting may be linked to depression. While bed rotting is okay in moderation, if you find yourself bed rotting constantly and struggle to get out of bed, it could be a sign of clinical depression or anxiety. People with these conditions often report low energy and mood, as well as a lack of interest in activities they usually enjoy. [10] X Research source Even though bed rotting may seem appealing if you’re depressed, it can actually make you feel worse, as it may lead to a cycle of depression and anxiety."

      "content": "Set time limits for how long you can bed rot. Bed rotting for short periods of time has its benefits, but sometimes lying in bed all day can make you feel even worse. To prevent this, try to keep your bed rotting to a few hours a day if you’re trying to be more active or limiting all-day bed rotting to a couple of days a month. This way, your body can rest and you’ll still have time for other important things, like social interaction and exercise. [11] X Research source If you really feel like you need to spend a whole day in bed, just remember to take short breaks to move around now and then. Or, if you plan on bed rotting over the weekend, let Saturday be your designated bed rotting day, then plan to be more productive on Sunday, or vice versa."
