      "title": "Eat healthy foods.",
      "content": "Eat healthy foods. This means that you should follow the food triangle, particularly around the middle. Anything containing a lot of protein, carbs or vitamins is likely a healthy food. Even a little sugar and fat needs to be consumed to become healthy. You don't have to go on a diet, but you could as long as you don't starve yourself. Meat helps you build body strength. Carbs give you lots of energy. Fruits have many vitamins to boost your health and thus making it easier to get fit."

      "title": "Exercise.",
      "content": "Exercise. You have to exercise to be strong. A good way to achieve this would be to choose one sport to play, possibly weekly for 30 minutes a day - or just visit the gym on a regular basis. It can be tiring to exercise but you'll find that as time passes you'll begin to build stamina - and strength. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Build speed.",
      "content": "Build speed. This can be achieved by running quite frequently, and also sprinting. Go to your nearest running track and, with a friend, time your sprinting speed. Try to improve it, but remember to always have rests and bring water."

    {
      "title": "Do exercises that require strength.",
      "content": "Do exercises that require strength. Monkey bars, lifting weights, [2] X Research source and rock climbing are some choices. These exercises are very tiring once you do them for a while. If you're weak you won't last long. By now you should be quite strong though. This will build you more muscle and energy."

    {
      "title": "Get enough sleep.",
      "content": "Get enough sleep. When you get too tired, your body will get weak. This means that you should try to get 8-10 hours of sleep each day. [3] X Research source When your body is deprived of rest, it will start to lose muscle and you might even fall asleep during a sport!"

    {
      "title": "Drink lots of water.",
      "content": "Drink lots of water. When you go through so many exercises, you sweat. You will also get dehydrated and tired if you don't drink enough. Drink at least one whole cup of water after doing a sport for 30 minutes or more. Make sure to drink lots and lots of water, but don't bloat yourself. Try to drink at least five cups of water a day.

      "title": "Try some stunts.",
      "content": "Try some stunts. Now that you're strong, you can probably do lots of different stunts that you couldn't do before. If you're young, try swinging across monkey bars. If you like rock climbing and earned tons of upper body strength, try climbing with only your arms. Try some daring and fun new stunts that you couldn't do before. Fight your fears - you're super strong, so you can do it! It will improve your energy and strength, too."
