[2] X Trustworthy Source New York State Government Official website for the State of New York Go to source If you feel tempted to find physical and/or emotional intimacy from other people, you may need to reevaluate your relationship. Example of a healthy relationship: You feel close to your partner and comfortable getting intimate with them. You rarely feel any temptation to have an emotional or physical connection with someone else. Example of an unhealthy relationship: You feel like your partner isn’t satisfying your desires when it comes to emotional and physical intimacy, and you think about stepping out of the relationship to have these desires fulfilled. Important note: Being intimate with other people is fine if you and your partner have discussed and committed to an ethically non-monogamous relationship (e.g., polyamory). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Communication is an essential ingredient of any healthy relationship. Talking things out—both the good and the bad—is critical to the health of your partnership. Regular communication allows both you and your partner to feel heard and gives you a chance to express your needs , desires, goals, and dreams. [4] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable having any lines of communication open with your partner, you may need to think if this relationship is good for you in the long-term. Example of a healthy relationship: You and your partner set aside time daily to talk about each others’ days and discuss anything that’s on your minds. Example of an unhealthy relationship: It often feels like you and your partner are passing each other like ships in the night—you hardly ever speak or have meaningful conversations."

      "content": "Trust is the bedrock of any successful relationship. Without it, you’re constantly second-guessing what your partner says and does, and you’re unable to develop a meaningful connection with them. Trust doesn’t vanish overnight, though—it’s often a long-term experience that develops from doubt, suspicion, anxiety, and fear. [5] X Research source Example of a healthy relationship: Your partner is upfront about what they’re doing and where they’ll be, and you trust that they’re being open and honest whenever they communicate with you. Example of an unhealthy relationship: Your partner says they’re working overtime one night, but you discover that they left at their usual time. This may lead you to doubt your partner in the future, which can transform into suspicion, anxiety, and a need to withdraw."

While their opinions and judgment aren’t absolute, they could be a sign that your partner isn’t the best possible match for you. Example of a healthy relationship: Your friends and loved ones talk about how kind and respectful your partner is, and how they love spending time with them. Example of an unhealthy relationship: Your friends and loved ones mention how they have a “bad feeling” about your partner and have never felt like they’re a good fit for you."

Whatever the case, it’s not a good sign if you’re unable to enjoy any quality time with your partner —in fact, it might be a sign that it’s time to end things. [6] X Research source Example of a healthy relationship: You make intentional time to spend regular quality time with your partner, like having a weekly date night. Example of an unhealthy relationship: Setting aside time for your partner feels like a chore—spending intentional time with them is about as fun as pulling teeth."

[7] X Research source Example of a healthy relationship: You spend a few moments thinking about that dreamy individual, but you can easily push the thoughts out of your mind.
