While pressing on the canister, turn it to the right (clockwise) to twist it into place. [3] X Research source This setup method applies to older SodaStream models, like Source , Power , and Jet . The OneTouch model also uses this setup method, but has an additional power cord that needs to be plugged in. For Genesis models, press the button along the back of the machine to separate and remove the top portion of the machine. Set this top portion of the machine on its side, insert and twist the CO2 cylinder into place, and then reattach/reassemble the machine. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Research source Don’t overfill the bottle, or else it’ll overflow during the carbonation process. Some SodaStream models (like the E-Duo) use special carafes rather than bottles. Warning: Never carbonate your water with syrup in the bottle. This will cause it to overflow and create a sticky mess."

Newer SodaStream models have a built-in Snap-Lock to help you insert the carbonation bottle, while other models have a slightly different setup process. Here’s a quick rundown based on your SodaStream model: Terra, E-Terra, Art, Fizzi, OneTouch, Source, and Power: Pull out the Snap-Lock so it’s positioned at a 45-degree angle. Slide the bottle all the way up the Snap-Lock, and then press the Snap-Lock back so it’s vertical again. The bottle should be held steady by the machine. [6] X Research source E-Duo and Aqua Fizz: Glide the lever on the front of your machine all the way to the right to unlock the carbonating flask, a silver canister that tilts forward at an angle. Slip the carafe into the flask, push the flask back into place, push the top part of your machine back down, and then glide the lever back to the left to secure everything. [7] X Research source Gaia, Genesis, and Jet: Twist the water bottle clockwise to secure it into the machine. Some models, like Gaia, may click to indicate a solid connection. [8] X Research source"

Some SodaStream machines carbonate with the press of a button, while other machines have slightly different carbonation processes. Here’s a quick look at how to operate each model: Terra, Fizzi, and Genesis: Press the top button firmly in 1-2 second bursts. Press it once for mild fizz, 3 times for moderate fizz, and 5 times for major fizz. [9] X Research source For the Fizzi model, press the button in 2-second bursts. [10] X Research source Art: Pull down the lever for 1 second and then let it go. To get a moderate amount of fizz, do this 3 times; for major fizz, do this 5 times. [11] X Research source E-Terra, E-Duo, and OneTouch: Tap one of the 3 top buttons that correspond with the amount of fizz you want (1 dot equals mild fizz, 2 dots equal moderate fizz, 3 dots equal major fizz). The light flashes as the machine carbonates the water; once it stops, your water is ready to go. [12] X Research source Aqua Fizz, Gaia, and Jet: Firmly press the button on the top of the machine in 1-second bursts. Press it 1 time for mild fizz, 3 times for moderate fizz, and 4 times for major fizz. [13] X Research source Source and Power: Push down on the carbonating block in 1-second bursts, using the LED indicators on the front of the machine as a guide. Press until the single-drop LED icon lights up to get mild fizz; until the double-drop LED icon lights up to get moderate fizz; and until the triple-drop LED icon lights up to get major fizz. [14] X Research source For Power models, press the button continuously rather than pressing it in bursts. [15] X Research source"
