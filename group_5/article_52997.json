      "content": "Begin by fully understanding the actual problem you’re facing. Look for patterns in your neighbors' nosy behavior. Are they often nosy at certain times, like weekends, weekdays, or evenings? Think about whether they’re nosy due to something going on in their lives or are curious about something going on in yours. When dealing with nosy neighbors , it’s important to ask yourself the following questions: [1] X Research source How long has this been going on? How many of your neighbors are nosy? Do you live in a nosy neighborhood? How long do you plan to stay in that area?"

      "title": "Talk to your nosy neighbor to determine your next move.",
      "content": "Talk to your nosy neighbor to determine your next move. First, try to learn as much about them as possible without getting too involved. This will help you to identify if there is any malice in their questions, if they are just being nosy to pass the time, or if they are new and need help making friends. Then, decide next steps on whether to confront, avoid, or befriend your neighbors. If your neighbors seem lonely and bored, try talking to them, introducing them to other neighbors, and suggesting fun things for them to do. If your neighbors are always confronting you and asking you personal questions, then consider how you can avoid talking to them. If your neighbors are snooping around looking for trouble, including stealing your things or reporting your activities, consider upping your security. Ask them to stop intruding. If the situation becomes dangerous for your family or property, contact the authorities."

      "title": "Try ignoring them and going about your day.",
      "content": "Try ignoring them and going about your day. Just get on with your business, nonchalantly and happily. If they have nothing better to do than watch you all day, then they have wasted their own time, not yours; it’s a good way to help yourself stop worrying about a bad neighbor . For example, if you're busy and you don't have time to tolerate nosiness, keep your headphones in your ears while passing through common areas like corridors, lifts, and parks—anywhere you might encounter your neighbor. Another way to ignore them is to fake a phone call . Whenever they approach you, put your phone to your ear and pretend to be in an important conversation. Don't forget to smile and nod at them when on the phone."

      "title": "Avoid hanging out in plain sight of your neighbors.",
      "content": "Avoid hanging out in plain sight of your neighbors. Move to your backyard, or choose another spot where they can't see you. This works for some activities—you can just as easily host a cookout or play catch in the backyard as you can in the front—but it is not a permanent fix. It is an avoidance technique. If your neighbor is extremely nosy, they might find ways to snoop around despite your efforts to avoid it. Hiding in the backyard might work once or twice, but be prepared for more occurrences ahead. If the problem is this bad, consider confronting or ignoring your neighbors. It can be exhausting to expend all of your mental energy on simply trying to escape someone. Make a code name for them whenever you see them. For example, \"activity\" or \"spiders.\" This will cue your family to behave accordingly, whether you all agree to retreat to the backyard or begin making loud noises."

      "title": "Act like you're not doing anything.",
      "content": "Act like you're not doing anything. If your neighbors are always asking questions about what you're doing and why you're doing it, an easy solution can be to simply do nothing. Try your best to seem uninteresting. Resume your activities when your neighbors go away. If they do still ask you questions, share a small piece of information and then ask them how they are. If they say, \"So, Frank, buddy, what's up?\" ninety-seven times a day, it wouldn't hurt to respond once, \"Oh, just walking the dog,\" or \"I'm good.\" This isn't the most exciting reply, and it makes it hard to think up further questions. Then ask, \"How about you?\" This can unsettle nosy people who don't like the feeling that you are nosing around them. Bear in mind that if you look like you have nothing to do, some neighbors take it as license to strike up a conversation. When in doubt, it’s best to avoid or confront your neighbors rather than wait for them to leave. Keep in mind you don’t have to interact this way if you’re not sure of their intentions. Etiquette coach Tami Claytor suggests keeping things respectful unless you’re very uncomfortable by “just being very polite.”"

      "title": "Shut down their questions by being honest.",
      "content": "Shut down their questions by being honest. If you’re dealing with bullying neighbors who ask you a lot of personal questions, tell them that it makes you uncomfortable. The next time they do it, give them a straight, upfront answer, like \"That's not something I would like to share with you.\" Stare them down, and make it clear that you mean business. Then walk away. They'll hopefully get the message and back off. [2] X Research source This approach is blunt and straightforward. It may get the point across, but it may also offend your neighbor's pride. Bear in mind that nosy neighbors aren't always trying to be obnoxious. They might be asking questions out of genuine curiosity. They may not have the tact or the social skills to know which questions are too personal. Be empathetic, but do not put up with anything that violates your space. If you tell your neighbor to stop asking questions, but they continue, you may need to take more serious steps to address the problem."

      "title": "Catch them in the act of spying.",
      "content": "Catch them in the act of spying. If your neighbors like to spy on you, catch them and say something that will embarrass them. Discreetly inform everyone who is with you, and then out of nowhere say something like, \"Hey, Mrs. Jones, having fun there?\" Watch as their face turns red. If they deny it, then just ignore them and give them a cold shoulder. If they do it again, get them alone and ask them nicely to stop. Make jokes about them nosing. Say things like, \"Now don't you go spying on me!\" and they may realize that they are being too nosy. It might even make them stop. Life coach Eze Sanchez recommends saying something like “No offense or anything. I really like my privacy, so could you check in with me before you come onto my property?”"

      "title": "Consider informing the authorities.",
      "content": "Consider informing the authorities. If your neighbors get too nosy, you may find that your only option is to contact the local police or neighborhood watch force. If the neighbor just won't leave you alone, you may want to apply for a restraining order. If you find your neighbors snooping around on your property, stealing your things, or trying to break into your home, call the police so that you don't need to handle the situation on your own. Police captain Saul Jaeger, MS, notes you should “trust your instincts. You can actually put yourself in an unsafe situation because of societal norms and expectations. And it's really silly when you think about it.” He recommends taking steps that keep you feeling safe and secure in your home and your neighborhood. Consider involving a neutral third party if you’re not ready to contact the authorities. A neighbor with whom you both get along is a good place to start if you’re looking for someone objective to mediate."

      "title": "Use physical deterrents like a fence.",
      "content": "Use physical deterrents like a fence. If you want your neighbors to stop peeking, consider putting up a fence between your properties. Check your local bylaws—if the fence lies between your properties, you may need to ask your neighbors' permission to construct it. Make sure that you don't build onto their property, or else you may give them even more reason to intrude. [3] X Research source Dogs or small children make a great excuse to build a large fence around your property. Simply say that you didn't want the dog running loose. Consider whether you want to feel penned in just because your neighbors are nosy. Building a fence may solve your problem, but it may just inspire your nosy neighbors to get creative."

      "content": "Install light-filtering blinds, retractable screens, or curtains. There are many window treatments you can use to protect your privacy against nosy neighbors. They include light-filtering blinds that keep out prying eyes but let in sunlight, screens that retract to help soundproof your home (a tapestry on the wall will also help here), or curtains for more privacy. You can go one step further by getting reflective window tints to avoid having to close your curtains or blinds. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add more landscaping to block their view. If you don't like the idea of a fence, consider planting a hedge, a bush, or a stand of trees to block out their view . Bear in mind that these barriers will take years to grow into place. You can also try getting a trellis for flowers or other plants to climb, which helps protect your privacy when you’re in your backyard. [5] X Research source You can also use large potted plants placed on window sills to block their view into your home, or place larger potted trees like bamboo outside."

      "content": "Install a security system. This may be a wise choice if you think your neighbors are snooping around on your property. Keep your house locked. If you go on vacation, install a security system or video cameras. Ask another neighbor to keep an eye on your property while you're away, in case the nosy neighbor starts snooping around. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Bear in mind that, depending on the neighbor's situation, this approach may be bordering on paranoia. Perhaps your neighbors are actually sneaking onto your property while you're away; perhaps you are just giving them a bad rap. If you truly suspect your neighbors of entering your property without your consent, confront them and firmly ask them to stop. Warn them that the next time they do this, you will not hesitate to call the police."

Whether you notice your neighbors watching you from their front lawn, they’re likely nosy if you often spot them looking at you to see what you’re doing. It’s good to determine whether they’re nosy with all of their neighbors, or just you, and whether they seem to have general safety concerns or be more interested in what their neighbors are up to. [7] X Research source It’s also possible that you’re annoying your neighbors without even knowing you’re doing it—you may be dealing with a bad neighbor, but they may feel like they’re dealing with a noisy neighbor if you’re the one being loud late at night."

When dealing with over-friendly neighbors , you might find they may be just looking for friends they can depend on, and vice versa. If you’re unsure of their motivations, try asking yourself the following questions: [12] X Research source Are they new to the area and just trying to understand the culture of the neighborhood?
