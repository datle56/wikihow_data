      "content": "Use the “About Me” section to showcase your passions. Talk about the things that make you unique, like your hobbies and interests. You can also bring up accomplishments that you’re proud of and include some basic bio information. Here are a couple of good examples of a strong “About Me” section: “I am a mechanical engineer, and received my BTech from Manipal Institute of Technology. I have been working for more than 5 years in Mumbai, and am looking to find a woman who shares my interests in travel, cooking, and sports. I have 2 younger sisters, and am very close to my family. I have traveled to Europe, Singapore, and China, and am looking to visit more places with my future partner.” “I am a doctor who has been working in pediatrics and living in Chennai since 2019. I have some issues with mobility, and currently am using crutches to assist me in my daily life. I am still a very active and modern woman, who is looking for a man with similar values. I spend my free time doing charitable work for underprivileged children, and would like to meet a man who is also interested in helping take care of those in need.”"

      "content": "Straightforward photos with simple backdrops work best. Make sure all of your photos clearly show your face. Posting multiple photos of yourself in different outfits and in different locations can also help. There's no need for professional photographs, though! Normal pictures taken by a friend or family member work just fine. Include a headshot (just your face and shoulders) as your primary profile photo so users can see what you look like. Be sure to smile in your photographs! [1] X Expert Source Suzanna Mathews Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. This makes you look friendly and open, which is great for meeting people online. Use recent photographs. Anything older than 2 years might not be an accurate representation of what you look like now. Avoid professional pictures that would look good on a resume or a LinkedIn profile, as they don't come across as warm enough.

      "title": "Be clear about your preferences so others know what to expect.",
      "content": "Be clear about your preferences so others know what to expect. The more specific you can be about the things you enjoy, either in your “About Me” or in another section of your profile, the more you can show your uniqueness. Talk about your hobbies, values, and passion projects. Include some lighthearted information about things that bother you as well, which can help spark a conversation. For example: “I’m a foodie who likes trying out new recipes and visiting new restaurants. I’m not a big fan of sports, and would probably prefer a day at home over a crazy outdoor adventure.” Avoid making contradictory statements, like “I am a modern person who believes in traditional values.” This can confuse people reading your profile."

      "content": "Portray yourself accurately so you find the right match. Lying in a profile can cause a lot of problems down the line. It’s okay if you don’t have the best job, or if you have some issues in your family—these problems are fixable. It's not wise to start any relationship based on lies. Be proud of who you are. We all have imperfections and things we’re not proud of, but lying to impress others when dealing with something as important as marriage is dangerous. You will find someone who will accept you for being you."

      "content": "Ask yourself what qualities are deal breakers. Before you write the partner preferences section of your profile, make a list of things you need to have in a partner, things you'd like, things you'd dislike, and things you can't or won't deal with. Then, include this information in your profile. For example, you might write something like: “I am looking for a spouse who places a high-importance on family, both his and mine. It would be great if he is also ambitious and career-oriented. I do not smoke or drink, but would be okay if my husband does. I am a vegetarian, and want a husband who follows a similar diet.”"

      "content": "Matrimonial sites have a section for family background, so fill it out if you wish. Many people use matrimonial sites to find people of similar castes and backgrounds, but you shouldn’t feel pressured to include this information. More and more young people are open to inter-caste marriages, which is a sign of progress. [5] X Research source If you do decide to include this information, you might say something like, “I come from a Tamil Brahmin family, but am open to meeting people from different backgrounds.”"

      "content": "If you aren't sure what else to include, surf through other profiles for ideas. If you see other profiles talking about a hobby that you forgot to mention that you enjoy as well, it’s OK to go back and edit your own to add this information. Try and judge profiles from an outside perspective, and ask yourself what these profiles do well or not. Then, rework your own profile—remember that a profile is a work-in-progress. Don’t feel intimidated by other profiles. Everyone is putting their best foot forward, and it’s important to feel like you’re in competition. You are special in your own way, and you will find someone who appreciates you for this."

After you’re finished writing your profile, set it aside for an hour or so, then come back to it to make any corrections with a fresh pair of eyes. If you aren’t so confident with your writing skills, ask a friend or family member who is a strong writer to help you check for any mistakes in your profile."

      "content": "Working as a team can make your marriage profile even stronger. Keep in mind that many parents use matrimonial sites to find the right spouse for their child, so having your parents look at your profile can help you make a profile that appeals to parents and partners alike. Then, ask a friend what they think of your profile to get a viewpoint from someone of your own generation. [6] X Research source You can mention this to them in the course of a casual conversation. Try saying something like, “I’m working on my online matrimonial profile, and wanted to have your help making a good profile. Could we work on it together?” It can be hard to find the right words to describe yourself, and your family and friends can provide an outside point of view. Ask them how they would describe you, and include this information on your profile."
