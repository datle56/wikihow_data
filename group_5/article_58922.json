      "content": "Gather organic food waste and scraps. Collecting compostable material requires little additional work—you simply place organic items, such as food waste and scraps in a collection container separate from your trash can. While you may purchase a designated indoor compost bin, many people collect their food scraps and waste in repurposed plastic food containers, trash cans, or compostable bags. After preparing or eating meals, place your food scraps into a compost collection bin. Acceptable items include table scraps, fruit, vegetables, and eggshells. These items are considered “green” waste as opposed to “brown” waste. If you are participating in a public or private program, only place approved compostable materials in your bin. If you are composting in your backyard, do not save meat and fish products for your compost pile—these items attract rodents and pests. Store your collection bin under the kitchen sink, on the kitchen counter, in your fridge, or in your freezer. [1] X Research source"

In an effort to achieve this goal, these cities have established curbside composting programs. For more information on your community’s public program or to determine if your city provides this service, call your city’s waste management facilities of visit its website. Inquire about the cost of the service. Ask if the city provides indoor and curbside collection bins. Ask how frequently the city picks up compostable material. Do they collect it twice a week, once a week, every two weeks, etc.? [4] X Research source"

When you contact your city's waste management facilities or search its website, inquire about or look for instructions on signing-up for the service. Every city’s sign-up process will be slightly different. To join the program, you may need to fill out an online form or send in a paper copy of the contract. Before opting into the city program, renters, especially those in apartments, should contact their landlords. If your building already participates in the city’s program, your landlord may be obligated to provide you with all of the necessary equipment and information. They may also be required to provide tenants with a central composting location.

Once you have joined the program, your local municipality may provide you with the equipment and educational resources you need to start composting. The equipment provided may include an indoor collection bin, an outdoor bin, and/or compostable bags. The city may also provide you with a set of instructions, a list of approved biodegradable materials, and a list of unaccepted organic materials. The indoor collection bin is typically intended for your kitchen. Many people store this bin under the kitchen sink or on their kitchen counter. Line your inside bin with a compostable bag, newspaper, or a brown paper bag to keep it clean. If you are concerned about the smell or mess, you may also freeze or fridge all of your compostable food materials. The outdoor collection bin is emptied by city workers. If you live in an apartment building, you may be required to share this outdoor collection bin with other residents. If the city does not provide an indoor composting bin, you can find composting containers at many kitchen supply stores or purchase one online. You can also use takeout containers, food containers, pails with lids, or lined trash cans with lids. Read the guidelines for your city's composting program. Make note of the correct procedures and your city’s approved compostable materials. [6] X Research source"

You can also collect biodegradable materials in your home office, bathrooms, and bedrooms. When your biodegradable collection bins are full, add the contents to your outdoor compost bin. On your a designated compost pick-up day, leave your outdoor bin at the curb each week. Once the bin is emptied, bring it in from the curb. Your city may have specific requirements regarding the placement of the pin. If you live in an area that receives a lot of snow, you may have to shovel a path from the street to your bin. Officials may contact you if you fail to comply with the city’s procedures and rules. [7] X Research source"

This container should be placed in a shady location that is near a source of water. Types of containers include: Homemade Containers: Construct your own round or square composting container out of fence posts and wire mesh siding, fence posts and lattice, or brick and wood. Build a structure that is at least three feet wide and three feet deep. [8] X Research source Compost Bins: This product, also known as a compost digester, is enclosed on the top and sides. Its open bottom sits directly on the ground. While these bins are small and inexpensive, it is difficult to turn the compost pile inside of them. Compost Tumblers: These rotating composting containers are the most effective and mobile bins on the market. The rotating drum makes it easy to turn and aerate the compost. The drum also serves as insulation, which keeps the composting materials at the ideal temperature year round. The center paddle helps to aerate the compost and prevents the materials from clumping.

Organic materials must be placed thoughtfully and carefully in the compost pile. A well laid out compost pile will promote drainage and aeration while deterring clumping and rotting. Place your biodegradable materials in thin, even layers. Place brown waste, specifically twigs and straw, on the bottom of the pile to encourage drainage. This layer should be a few inches thick. Add alternating layers of moist and dry green and brown waste. Keep this layers thin to avoid clumping. Moist items include food scraps, food waste, coffee grounds, and tea bags. Dry items include straw, twigs, leaves, and untreated sawdust.

In order for the microorganisms to breakdown the green and brown waste into compost, the pile must remain moist, warm, and well aerated. Monitor your pile frequently. Your compost should maintain the moisture of a damp sponge. If it is too dry, add water to the pile with a hose or let the rain water it naturally. If it is too wet, your organic materials may rot instead of compost. Your compost pile should retain an interior temperature between 135° to 160° F. You can monitor the temperature with a thermometer. Covering your compost pile with a lid, carpet squares, wood, or a tarp will help regulate the temperature of the pile. In order for the compost process to work, your pile must have a sufficient amount of air. Add oxygen to your pile by turning it every two to four weeks. You can turn the pile with a pitchfork or rotate your compost tumbler.
