While there is no specific major required to go on to med school, demonstrating a passion for neuroscience through your undergraduate career can boost your application and give you a strong foundation for your graduate studies. If your school doesn’t directly offer neuroscience, you could choose a major like biology, physiology, or chemistry to gain a broader background in natural science and the human body.

Just keep in mind that it might be more difficult to prepare for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) without having majored in science. [12] X Research source If your school allows it, try to still take courses that will give you a broad scientific background. For instance, you should try to take courses in physics, human biology, inorganic and organic chemistry, and psychology.
