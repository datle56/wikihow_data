      "title": "Avoid collars, since they tend to trap small hairs.",
      "content": "Avoid collars, since they tend to trap small hairs. When you’re picking out a shirt to wear for your haircut, stick to a T-shirt or a crew neck that doesn’t have a collar. Not only will this make it easier for your stylist to cut your hair, but it won’t trap as many small hairs inside of your clothing. [1] X Research source If you do happen to be wearing a shirt with a collar, turn the collar inside of your shirt before your haircut. That way, it will repel hairs rather than catching them."

      "content": "Baby powder dries out your skin so hairs don’t stick to it. Before you leave for your haircut, sprinkle a thin layer of baby powder on the back of your neck. The dry powder will help repel hairs to keep you itch-free. Try to avoid putting on lotion or moisturizer right before a haircut. Lotions make your skin sticky, which can make irritating hairs even more likely to stick to your skin."

That way, you can leave the shop feeling a little less itchy than you normally would. [2] X Research source Some stylists might do this automatically, but if yours doesn’t, they shouldn’t mind if you ask."
