      "content": "Drip 1-3ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide into your ear. Draw up 1-3ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution with the dropper, and drip it into your ear canal. You may hear and feel some fizzing, which is perfectly normal. Though it may feel a little ticklish, try to relax. Let the solution stay in place with your ear still turned for 1 minute. [3] X Research source If helpful, you can pull on the top edge of the ear to open the ear canal more as you insert the drops. Don’t press the dropper down into your ear canal when administering the drops. Your ear canal is sensitive and prone to damage with too much pressure."

If you experience a blockage twice a year, clean your ears twice a week; if you experience 3 blockages a year, clean your ears 3 times a week.

      "content": "Avoid using cotton swabs in your ears. Earwax normally only coats the outer third of your ear canal, but cotton swabs actually push earwax deeper than it is meant to go. Over time, this can cause impacted earwax blockages near your eardrum that actually interfere with hearing. [8] X Research source Doctors also advise against using cotton swabs to clean your ears, as well as other objects such as hairpins."
