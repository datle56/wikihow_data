      "content": "Remove the bumper cover if it’s in the way of the headlight. The bumper cover is the long body panel on the front of your vehicle that hides the metal bumper. If the bumper cover overlaps your headlights, locate the bolts holding the cover to the body along the top edge. Use a socket wrench to rotate the bolts counterclockwise until you can pull them out. Then look underneath the bumper cover and unscrew any of the bolts there. Push a flathead screwdriver into the seams between the cover and the wheel wells to expose the hidden bolts so you can loosen them. Lift the bumper cover up and pull it away from your vehicle to remove it. Consult with your vehicle’s manual if you have any trouble finding the bolts on your bumper cover."

      "content": "Unplug the connectors attached to the back of the headlight to remove it. Wiggle the headlight loose and pull it straight out from your vehicle so you can reach your hand behind it. Follow the wires coming from your vehicle leading to the back of the headlight. [3] X Expert Source Duston Maynes Automotive Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. Find the square block connectors holding the wires and carefully pull them apart. Once you remove the 1 or 2 connectors, you can easily pull the headlight completely out of your vehicle. [4] X Research source Some wires will still hang out from the back of the headlight when you remove it. Don’t try to force the headlight out of your vehicle, or else you may damage the connectors."

      "title": "Remove any screws from the headlight.",
      "content": "Remove any screws from the headlight. Set your headlight upside-down on a towel or soft surface so you don’t scratch the lens. Look around the edges of the headlight to find all of the screws holding the lens to the backing. Turn the screws counterclockwise with a screwdriver to remove them. Set the screws in a small cup so you don’t misplace them. [5] X Research source Double-check for screws after you think you’ve removed them all. If you still have screws in the headlight when you try to open it, you could crack or break the lens. Some headlights may not have screws, meaning the lens and backing are only held together with adhesive sealant."

Pinch the base of the bulb and turn it counter-clockwise to make it loose. [6] X Expert Source Duston Maynes Automotive Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 14 July 2021. Pull the bulb straight out from the backing and set it aside somewhere where it won’t get damaged. Remove any other bulbs in the headlight using the same process. [7] X Research source You do not have to remove the bulbs if you’re not able to. You can leave the rubber housing caps attached. Since the headlight reaches a similar temperature when it’s in use, the caps won’t melt. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Put on disposable gloves and old clothes. After you heat up the headlight, the sealant will be extremely sticky and adhere to anything it touches. Wear a pair of disposable work gloves so you don’t get any of the sealant on your skin. Then put on an old shirt that you don’t mind getting dirty just in case sealant gets on it. [9] X Research source You may want to wear a pair of heat-resistant gloves underneath your disposable gloves so it’s easier to handle the headlight."

Move the oven rack to the lowest height before turning your oven on. Let it preheat completely before you place your headlight inside. [10] X Research source If you don’t have access to an oven, you can also use a heat gun and a cardboard box. Get a box that’s large enough to hold your headlight. Cut a circular hole in the bottom corner that’s the same size as the heat gun’s nozzle. Place the heat gun through the hole and turn it on to 250 °F (121 °C) to heat inside the box. [11] X Research source Avoid using the heat gun by hand since you won’t heat the sealant evenly and could risk breaking the headlight assembly. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Set the headlight on wood planks inside your oven.",
      "content": "Set the headlight on wood planks inside your oven. Wood doesn’t hold heat as well as metal, so it’s perfect for keeping your headlight safe when you bake it. Use 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) boards that are short enough to fit inside your oven. Lay the planks on the oven rack and set your headlight inside. Make sure the headlight doesn’t touch the rack or sides of the oven directly, or else it could melt. [13] X Research source If you don’t have pieces of wood, you can also use a cookie sheet lined with 1–2 layers of baking paper. Your headlight will not get damaged from the heat as long as it doesn’t make contact with metal."

      "content": "Pry the lens off of the backing with a flathead screwdriver. Position the tip of your screwdriver in the bottom corner of your headlight so it’s in the seam between the clear lens and headlight backing. Carefully push the screwdriver into the seam and tilt the handle down toward the backing to lift the lens out from the adhesive. After you make a small gap, try gently pulling the pieces apart by hand. If you need to, work the screwdriver around the seam to separate the pieces. [16] X Research source The sealant will harden as it cools down and make it more difficult to pull the headlight apart. If you need to, place the headlight back in your oven for another few minutes to soften it again. Be careful not to scratch the headlight lens with the tip of your screwdriver."

Run the screwdriver around the entire perimeter of the backing to work out as much sealant as you can. Wipe the screwdriver clean as it gets dirty so it doesn’t get stuck. [17] X Research source Removing sealant works best while it’s still warm and malleable. If the sealant solidified, try putting the backing in your oven for another 5 minutes to soften it. Avoid leaving the old sealant in the headlight since it may form air bubbles and won’t seal properly."

      "content": "Press new butyl sealant into the channel on the headlight backing. Butyl sealant is a flexible rubber material that’s used to make an airtight seal so moisture can’t get into the lights. Tear off a piece of the sealant and press it into the channel with your fingers. Continue running the strip of sealant around the outer edge of the backing so it’s flush with the surface. Once you’ve gone completely around the channel, cut the piece of sealant and press the edges down. [20] X Research source You can buy butyl sealant online or from an automotive parts store. Butyl sealant is stretchy and malleable, so you can mold it into the channel until it fits perfectly."
