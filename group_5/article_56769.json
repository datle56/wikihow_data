      "content": "Mmk is a combination of “mmm” and “okay” that usually indicates disapproval. It’s a humming, drawn-out way to say “okay,” with the added \"mmm\" usually adding a note of disapproval or some other negative feeling.

      "content": "Show disinterest. Let the person you’re texting know that you really don’t care about whatever it is they’re talking about and that you don’t have a lot of thoughts on the topic. “mmk sure if you want.” “mmk yeah sure, whatever you guys want, I don’t really care.” “mmk yeah, I mean it’s up to you. I’m free all weekend.”"

      "title": "Let them know that you’re agreeing, but tentatively.",
      "content": "Let them know that you’re agreeing, but tentatively. Slightly less enthusiastic than saying “Yes,” mmk lets the other person know that you’re agreeing to whatever it is they’re saying, but you’re still a bit hesitant. Let them know that you’re okay with the idea, just not bursting with excitement. “mmk. I have some work left to do, so we’ll see.” “mmk well, let me know when you get that figured out.” “mmk I mean, we haven’t seen them in like a year, but if you want to invite them go ahead.”"

      "title": "Let someone know you’re suspicious of what they’re saying.",
      "content": "Let someone know you’re suspicious of what they’re saying. Express your disbelief towards whatever was just said in a more passive-aggressive way. You’re not directly calling them out for being a liar or for exaggerating, but you’re making it clear that things seem a bit sus. “mmk yeah that makes total sense.” “mmk sure.” “mmk yeah I definitely believe that.”"

    {
      "title": "Let them know that you’re annoyed.",
      "content": "Let them know that you’re annoyed. Mmk can be used to let the other person know that you feel annoyed by whatever they just said, or that you feel seriously inconvenienced if they’re asking for a favor from you. “mmk I guess.” “mmk got it.” “mmk yeah I’ll be sure to do that.”"

    {
      "title": "Show some affection.",
      "content": "Show some affection. This is kind of a one-eighty from the other examples, but mmk can actually express a warm and affectionate feeling if used in the right context. It sounds much softer than just a standard “okay.” “mmk yeah. I’d really like that.” “mmk yeah I’m actually really excited.” “mmk just tell me a time and place and I’ll be there.”"

Of course, if you happen to be lying, this may not work, but if you mean what you say, then don’t be afraid to stick up for yourself. You : I almost beat him in our game yesterday! Them : mmk yeah I bet. You : It’s true! 😭 I have a screenshot of the final score if you want proof."
