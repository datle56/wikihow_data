      "content": "Take up a sport as a regular hobby. Almost any sport requires you to coordinate between your eyes and your hands. Pick up a sport that's interesting to you, and make it part of your regular weekly routine. Set a goal of play for an hour 3-4 times a week. [1] X Expert Source Peter Fryer Tennis Instructor Expert Interview. 5 July 2019. Look into intramural teams or classes in your area to help keep your practice consistent and make the process more fun. Sports that involve bats or sticks such as baseball, softball, hockey, and lacrosse are all common recommendations for those looking to improve their coordination. You could also consider getting a badminton net, volleyball net, basketball hoop, or ping pong table for your home if you want to practice on your own time. Boxing and many forms of martial arts are also great to help improve eye-hand coordination. Look into classes in your area for boxing, mixed martial arts (MMA), taekwondo, karate, krav maga, or any other form of martial arts that interests you."

      "content": "Play video games or online games. Video games require both motor skills and visual perception to execute gameplay. Play a game that requires precision timing, a sensitive touch, and/or great attention to detail, and you may find it helps improve your overall eye-hand coordination. Action games like Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can be particularly useful for this purpose. [2] X Research source Try different types of games, if you have the systems available. Console games, PC games, and VR games will all challenge you in different ways."

      "content": "Practice juggling . Learning to juggle is a common activity recommended for people trying to improve their coordination. Start by learning to juggle with 2 balls, then move your way up to three. Consult online tutorials and videos to help get you started, since juggling is often better understood visually. [3] X Research source Don't get disheartened if you're not a great juggler when you first start. This is an activity that takes a lot of time to master. Keep practicing and you will slowly start to see benefits with your overall hand-eye coordination."

This requires picking up specific pieces to analyze which ones fit together, using and improving both hand-eye coordination and reasoning skills. Challenge yourself even more with a 3D jigsaw puzzle, a Lego sculpture, or another building toy that allows you to think in 3D. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Practice switching focus with eye exercises. Try placing 2 similarly-sized objects, such as 2 books, at different distances from one. Place one about 18 inches (46 cm) from you, and the other about 10 feet (3.0 m) away. Focus on the closer object for 5-10 seconds, taking note of as much detail as you can, then quickly switch to the object further away and do the same. Continue this exercise back and forth between your eyes for 3-5 minutes at a time. [6] X Research source Exercises like this help you improve your reaction time by training you to quickly adjust focus to new subjects."

      "content": "Do dribbling drills. Dribbling drills like those you find in basketball practice are designed to help build hand-eye coordination. If you're new to dribbling, start by simply walking 10-20 paces in one direction, turning around, and walking back, all while continually dribbling. As you get better, start to vary it by dribbling at different speed and switching back and forth between your hands. [7] X Research source Challenge yourself by using smaller balls, such as tennis balls. These are more unpredictable when you dribble them, so they challenge your reaction time even more."

      "content": "Play balloon keep up. This same just requires an oxygen-inflated balloon. Gently toss the balloon up in the air, then follow it around and bump it up before it hits the ground. This game can be played by yourself or with a partner, and is a fantastic exercise in coordination and control. [8] X Research source Hitting the balloon too hard could send it too far or cause it to pop, so part of the exercise here is to practice applying a controlled amount of force while keeping your eyes on your target. This drill can also be a lot of fun for kids who are struggling to build hand-eye coordination."

      "content": "Try a game of catch while standing on one leg. Catch is often suggested to help build coordination in children, but adults can benefit from a game of catch, too. Instead of just tossing the ball back and forth, though, try standing on one leg while you play. This helps you improve both your balance and reaction time as you build your coordination. [9] X Research source Play catch with a friend or family member to make the exercise fun and social. If you don't have anyone to play with, you can always practice by bouncing your ball off of a nearby wall."
