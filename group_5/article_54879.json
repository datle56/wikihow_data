      "content": "Place your foot that is not strapped in on the stomp pad, located between bindings. Allow the chair to push you from behind to give you a boost. While being pushed, lean your entire body slightly forward (the front tip of the board), about 3-5 degrees, just enough to actually put some of your weight forward. This will keep you from falling backwards while moving down ramp of the lift. Look UP and straight ahead. Do not look down at the floor, look where you are going. Don’t try to move on your own. Go straight to clear the ramp."
