      "content": "Epic Dragons are rare dragons that are hard to breed. In the world of DragonVale, “Epic” is an umbrella term used for a wide variety of dragons, including many limited-edition/expired ones. While any of these dragons can be created using the standard Breeding Cave, an Epic Breeding Island or Epic Breeding Sanctuary may boost your odds of getting the dragon you want. [1] X Research source Rainbow, Double Rainbow, and Triple Rainbow Dragons require a breeding combination that encompasses at least 4 elements total. [2] X Research source A Hail Dragon (Cold/Lightning) and a Tree Dragon (Plant/Earth), for instance, have a small chance of producing a Rainbow, Double Rainbow, or Triple Rainbow Dragon. Seasonal Dragons need to have the Plant, Fire, and Air elements represented in both parents. For instance, a Willow Dragon and a Fire Dragon could potentially create a Seasonal Dragon.

      "content": "Opposite Dragons are bred with contrasting elements. The best way to breed this unique type of Dragon is by taking a primary elemental Dragon (like Fire, Water, Plant, etc.) and breeding it with a Hybrid Dragon. For instance, a Blue Fire Dragon is a combination of the opposing Fire and Cold Elements and can be bred with a Basic Dragon of a single element (like Fire), and a Hybrid Dragon of the opposing element (in this case, a Cold Hybrid Dragon like a Mountain Dragon.
