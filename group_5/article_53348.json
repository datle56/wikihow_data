Use the multiples of 2 to help you determine what this number is. [2] X Research source Place this number on top of the division symbol. For example, the greatest number of times 2 can divide evenly into 17 is 8, since 2 × 8 = 16 {\\displaystyle 2\\times 8=16} . So you should place 8 on top of the long division symbol."

When you divide an odd number by 2, you will always have a remainder of 1.

For example, 17 ÷ 2 = 8 r 1 {\\displaystyle 17\\div 2=8r1} . By turning the remainder into a fraction, you get 17 ÷ 2 = 8 1 2 {\\displaystyle 17\\div 2=8{\\frac {1}{2}}} .

So breaking up the number in this way helps you divide the number quickly, since an even number will have no remainder when dividing by 2. To break up the number into an even number +1, subtract 1 from the number. For example, if you are calculating 75 ÷ 2 {\\displaystyle 75\\div 2} , break up 75 {\\displaystyle 75} into 74 + 1 {\\displaystyle 74+1} ."
