      "content": "Free your imagination—your ritual can have as many steps as you like. If you're craving simplicity, you might choose to just light your candle and announce your intention. However, you may prefer a more elaborate ritual. For example, you may wait until the Harvest Moon, wear green clothes, and create an altar decorated with gold coins to cast a candle spell that attracts wealth and abundance. [3] X Research source Match your clothes to your candle to amplify an intention. Add framed photos or a vision board to your altar to manifest dreams. Track the phases of the Moon to benefit from lunar magick. Make a magick circle out of black salt to boost protective spells."

[4] X Research source Choose a smudge stick that complements your candle. For example, a bundle of lavender can amplify the calming qualities of a black candle. Say an affirmation to enhance your cleansing ritual. You may declare, \"I purify this room so it's a sacred space for my love spell.\""

      "content": "Add meaningful words or codes so the candle attunes to you. Carve a short message—like \"hope\" or \"soulmate\"—into your candle. If you prefer it, scratch a symbol onto the spell candle instead. For example, mark it with a \"sigil\"—a magical code you designed—that looks like a cursive 'S' and represents \"sincerity.\" This extra step infuses your spell candle with your energy. [5] X Research source Write a short intention on a piece of paper and put it far away from the wick. Scratch an ancient rune into the candle to invoke a deity. Carve the candle with freehand designs to bless it with spontaneity. Put your name onto the candle to bind it to you."

      "content": "Anoint your candle with an oil that will amplify the magick of your spell. Choose a natural oil —like an essential oil —that's aligned with your mystical goal. [6] X Research source To dress your candle with herbs, lightly dust them on at the base of the candle, away from the wick. [7] X Research source To add small crystals, place these stones on the top of the candle—most stones withstand heat and can be close to the wick. [8] X Research source Here are some examples of sacred blends to fan the flames of your imagination: Rosehip oil , rosemary , and rose quartz : Patience, friendship, and love Lemon oil , sweetgrass , and aquamarine : Vitality, optimism, and bliss Wild orange oil , vanilla beans , and tiger's eye : Courage, charisma, strength Think of a meaningful number to decide how many drops of oil to add. For example, maybe '8' makes you think of the infinity symbol, so you'll use 8 drops of nutmeg oil for eternal love."

      "content": "See how your candle's flame looks to detect a unique message. When you search for clues in candle flames, you're practicing \"pyromancy\"—a way to seek knowledge using fire.

However, you may prefer to repeat your ritual for 7 days. If that's the case, use a candle snuffer each night so you can replicate your spell. Your ritual will be complete when you feel the moment is right. [11] X Research source A candle snuffer makes sure you won't blow out the flame, which can disturb your spell. If you'd like to use your dressed candle for different spells, store it in a safe place. For example, place it in a decorative storage chest ."
