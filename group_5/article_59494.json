[3] X Research source A narcissistic person might also try to catch you off guard, coming up to you and yelling when you least expect it. Take a second to take a deep breath in before responding."

      "content": "Walking away may be your best bet. If you can, try removing yourself from the conversation or ignoring them completely.

      "content": "Shift some of the blame back onto them as they accuse you.
