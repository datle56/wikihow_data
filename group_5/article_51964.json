      "content": "Measure your bust, waist, and hips. Take off your clothes so you’re down to your bra and underwear. Grab a measuring tape and wrap it around each part of your body, aiming for the widest part of your hips and bust but the narrowest part of your waist. Write down the measurements so you don’t forget them. [1] X Research source To find your waist, wrap your tape measure around your midsection right around your belly button. The tape measure should sit above your hip bones but below your rib cage in the narrowest part of your torso."

      "content": "Compare the measurements to see which one is the widest. Your widest measurement will help you determine which body type you have. And if they’re all the same, don’t worry—there’s a body type for that, too! [2] X Research source Look at your body in 2 halves with your waist as the middle. The goal is to create balance between the halves. If your top is wider than your bottom you want to keep things on top fitted and create more volume on the bottom and vice versa for those who are wider on the bottom.

      "content": "Choose between apple, pear, hourglass, and rectangle. These are the 4 main body types that most of the fashion industry recognizes. Keep in mind that body types are approximate, and they might not describe your shape exactly. Just pick the one that matches your measurements the best. [4] X Research source Apple body type: your hips and waist are wider than your bust. Pear body type: your hips are wider than your bust and waist. Hourglass body type: your hips and bust are wider than your waist. Rectangle body type: all your measurements are roughly the same."

      "title": "Go for an A-line dress if you have an apple body type.",
      "content": "Go for an A-line dress if you have an apple body type. The volume on the bottom of the dress will highlight your slender legs while minimizing your torso. Also, a V-neck dress can help highlight your chest and give you the illusion of a longer torso. [5] X Research source You can also try a wrap dress or an empire waistline dress. Both of these emphasize your legs and draw your waist in, giving you the illusion of height."

      "title": "Wear patterns to camouflage your torso.",
      "content": "Wear patterns to camouflage your torso. If you want to minimize your upper body, patterns can help you do it! Vertical stripes are very slimming, as are small scale prints, like tiny polka dots or small florals. [6] X Research source As you pick patterns, go for darker colors to look slimmer. Lighter colors can highlight areas and give the illusion of extra bulk."

      "title": "Wear an off-the-shoulder dress if you have a pear body type.",
      "content": "Wear an off-the-shoulder dress if you have a pear body type. The cut of the dress helps draw attention to your shoulders and your upper body. You can also try a wrap dress to accentuate your waist and draw attention to your bustline. [7] X Research source If you want to wear a patterned dress, choose ones with patterns and bright colors on the bust and shoulders. It will draw attention to your upper body and minimize your lower body. A-line dresses also look great on pear body shapes because they camouflage your legs and highlight your upper body."

      "content": "Try a bodycon dress if you have an hourglass body shape. Show off your curves in a tight dress that highlights your figure. If you’d like to keep it a little more modest, pick one that hits just above your knees; otherwise, try a mini dress for going out. [9] X Research source If you want to go for a pattern, try a large, bold one, like tropical floral. It will emphasize your curves without overpowering your frame."

      "content": "Go for low necklines. V-necks and sweetheart necklines help emphasize your bust and show off your curves. If you want to show some skin, keep your skirt long (midi-length is great for this) and lower the neckline. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Go for lots of fabric and volume.",
      "content": "Go for lots of fabric and volume. Rectangle body shapes can usually handle busy prints and fabrics. Don’t be afraid to get bold and wear a patterned maxi-dress or a long, flowy skirt if you want to! [12] X Research source If you’re short, you might want to stay away from tons of fabric and volume. Elements like that can minimize your height and make you look even shorter. Try blocks of colors and prints to give the illusion of curves in your dress."

      "title": "Wrap dresses help accentuate your waist.",
      "content": "Wrap dresses help accentuate your waist. Dresses that wrap around your bust and tie in the waist are flattering on almost every body type. Wrap dresses are also flowy and usually mid-length, so they’ll lengthen your legs without clinging to them. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try an empire waistline dress.",
      "content": "Try an empire waistline dress. This waistline hits just underneath your bust so it cinches in at the smallest part of your torso.

      "content": "Pick a dress with a defined waist. Wrap dresses and fit and flares emphasize the smallest part of you, and they can also help you look taller.
