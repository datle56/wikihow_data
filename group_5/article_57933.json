      "content": "North node Capricorns are called to embrace their independence. Your north node reflects the ultimate goal or “brass rings” that you’re reaching for in your life journey. Trust and believe in yourself as you take the reigns and call the shots in your life. [2] X Research source You're more than capable of getting where you need to go! Technically speaking, your north and south nodes are the physical points in space where the Moon’s orbital path crosses over/overlaps with the earth’s orbital path as it circles the Sun. [3] X Research source The moon has to do with your habits—both the success of your actions based on your habit patterns, as well as the lack of success. Not totally sure what your north node is? Plug your birth info (including your birth time and birthplace) into an online calculator to find out. Your north node placement is represented by a symbol resembling an upside-down horseshoe. Did You Know? Idris Elba, Lena Headey, Jim Parsons, Emma Roberts, and Austin Butler are all north node Capricorns."

      "title": "Your south node falls in Cancer.",
      "content": "Your south node falls in Cancer. Your south node represents your “default setting”—it’s the old habits that are always there waiting for you. Having your south node in Cancer means that you like to focus on the past. [4] X Research source While there's nothing wrong with a little self-reflection, don't be afraid to leap forward and see what your future has to offer, too! If your north node is in Capricorn, your south node will always be in Cancer. Lunar nodes are always opposite of one another on a birth chart (e.g., Aries and Libra, Taurus and Scorpio, Gemini and Sagittarius, etc.). Understanding the natural instincts associated with your south node as well as the life goals associated with your north node can provide you with a helpful template for your future. Water signs like Cancer are known for being more in tune with their emotions, to a point where it can be overwhelming. [5] X Research source So, it makes sense that one of south node Cancer’s biggest challenges could be letting things go."

      "content": "Nurturing Believe it or not, your south node Cancer placement isn’t completely negative—the key is leaning into your south node-based traits in moderation. Take your nurturing nature, for instance. While your ultimate goal in life is to become more self-reliant , there’s nothing wrong with embracing some of your nurturing instincts in your day-to-day life, like whipping up a tasty meal for your partner. [9] X Research source Tip: Look for small ways to embrace your nurturing tendencies in a way that doesn’t impact your life overall. For example, you might do small chores around your home that benefit your entire household (like tidying up your kitchen or refilling your gas tank when it’s half-empty)."

Ideally try to create “SMART” goals , or goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Based. For instance, “I will walk for 30 minutes every day after dinner” is a much better goal than “I will exercise more this week.” [10] X Research source Tip: Try to set a variety of different goals , including process-, performance-, and outcome-based ones. Process-based goals focus on factors you can control (“I will go to the library twice a week”); performance-based goals are partially within your control (“I will get over 80% on my biology test”); and outcome-based goals are largely out of your control (“I will apply to and get the job I want by the end of year”). As an earth-based sign, it’s great to do tasks (like setting concrete goals) that help you feel grounded."

[12] X Research source Tip: Keep tabs on yourself to get a sense of how you’re feeling throughout the week. Once you acknowledge your feelings and experiences, you’ll have an easier time accommodating those difficult feelings.
