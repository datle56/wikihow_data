      "title": "Mark the date of your anniversary on your calendar.",
      "content": "Mark the date of your anniversary on your calendar. Make a note of what day your anniversary falls on. That way, you’ll have plenty of time to start pondering the important details, rather than being in a rush to come up with ideas at the last minute. Depending on what you have in mind, it might be wise to start planning as much as a month ahead of the actual date. [1] X Research source Most couples use the day that they met or began seeing one another as the official date of their anniversary. If you tend to be forgetful, set a reminder on your phone to notify you when your anniversary is approaching."

      "title": "Remind your boyfriend that your anniversary is coming up.",
      "content": "Remind your boyfriend that your anniversary is coming up. Giving him a heads up 2-3 weeks ahead of time will permit him to clear his schedule. Otherwise, you could run into prior commitments or other conflicts that threaten to put a damper on your special day. If you have a something special in the works, try dropping subtle hints to jog his memory without spoiling the surprise. You might say something like “How long have we been together now?” or “Can you believe it’s been almost a year since we were first introduced?” Be careful not to come across like you're testing him. He may not appreciate feeling like he's being grilled. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Schedule your celebration for a time that you’re both available. It may not be possible for the two of you to get together on the actual day of your anniversary if you’re especially busy. Instead, you might shoot for the day before or after, or wait until the following weekend when you’re both free. A Friday or Saturday evening may be more convenient if your anniversary falls in the middle of a hectic work or school week. On the flipside, you might decide to go for a weeknight when fewer people are out to improve your chances of getting into an exclusive restaurant or sold-out show."

      "content": "Hire a sitter for your child or pet. If you’ve got a young one (or a fur baby) at home, make arrangements for someone to watch them. You’ll be able to enjoy a carefree evening knowing that they’re safe and sound. Try to have a sitter lined up at least a week before your anniversary in case things fall through unexpectedly. Ask a friend or relative if they’d be willing to handle the sitting duties to ensure that your child or pet is in good hands. When hiring someone you don’t know, seek recommendations from people you trust or look up feedback from previous clients who have had good experiences with the sitter. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to dinner at your favorite restaurant. The classic candlelight dinner for two never loses its appeal. Since it’s a special occasion, don’t be afraid to go the whole nine yards—a bottle of wine, appetizers, a sumptuous main course, and something sweet to split for dessert. If the restaurant you have in mind accepts reservations, call the day before to make sure you’re able to get in."

      "content": "Dress up for a night out on the town. Throw on your finest threads before you head out for drinks or a show. This can be a good opportunity to dust off that cocktail dress or tailored suit that you don’t get many opportunities to wear. Your one year anniversary only comes along once—why not do it up in style? [4] X Research source Decide on a theme or color scheme for your attire so that you’ll both match. Take your boyfriend’s personal style into consideration. If he’s more the casual type, you might compromise by choosing a place where he can get away with wearing a polo shirt shirt rather than a suit and tie."

      "title": "Go back to the place where you first met.",
      "content": "Go back to the place where you first met. For a more sentimental touch, plan a special outing to where it all began. There, you can share stories about what was running through your mind the first time you laid eyes on one another and talk about how much has changed over the course of a year. [5] X Research source You could even make a stop at a favorite bar or night spot part of an evening full of festivities. A walk down memory lane for two doesn’t have to be limited to a restaurant or coffee shop. Couples who met at the gym, for instance, could partner up for a workout session."

[15] X Research source Your gift doesn’t even have to be an object—it could also be an experience, such as concert tickets or a trip to a theme park. Be sure to discuss whether or not you want to do gifts beforehand. While you’re at it, it may be a good idea to agree on a general price range so that one person doesn’t spend more than the other."
