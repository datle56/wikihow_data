      "content": "Cut each nail shape out of 6-10 layers of paper. You can use newspaper, magazine pages, construction paper, printer paper, or even tissue. However, you’ll get the strongest nails if you use something pretty thick. Cut out a piece of paper in the right shape and size for each of your nails. Then, use each nail you just cut as a guide to snip out several more layers of the same size and shape. [1] X Research source Stack the layers of paper together and put the guide on top, then cut around it to make the duplicate shapes. The more layers you use, the sturdier and thicker your nails will be. If you’re having trouble keeping all the layers of paper together after you cut them, try gently taping the stacks together or holding them together with paperclips until you’re ready to use them."

[2] X Research source This paste will harden as it dries, making your nails strong and sturdy. Alternatively, mix equal amounts of cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl until all the lumps are gone. Make about 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 mL) of this mixture. Slowly stir the paste into 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water, then let it cool and thicken.

      "content": "Glue the layers of the paper nails together with the paste. Use a small paintbrush to brush a thin layer of your flour or cornstarch mixture onto each nail-shaped piece of paper. Once you’ve coated one piece, press one of the same-sized pieces of paper on top of it. Keep doing this until you’ve glued together all the layers of one nail, then move on to the next one. [4] X Research source When you’ve finished each nail, paint the front and back of it with the paste to seal it. If you’ve ever made papier-mâché crafts, this process might seem pretty familiar. That’s because it’s the same thing—you’re just using it to make nails! [5] X Research source"

[6] X Research source A few hours into the drying process, use your fingers to gently curve the nails. You want them to be a bit arched in the middle so that they’ll fit the curve of your natural nails."

Unless you really like how the paper nails look on their own, choose an opaque polish so you can’t see the pattern underneath. [10] X Research source Paint the edges of the nails as well as the top to help seal them and hide the layers of paper. Feel free to get creative and do some fancy nail art! Add gems, decals, or some pretty painted designs to complete the look of your nails. These nails are not likely to last as long as standard acrylics, gel nails, or plastic press-ons. However, they can be a good option if you want fancy nails for a day or two. While a few layers of nail polish will help make your fake nails more water-resistant, it probably won’t make them completely waterproof. Water will still damage the paper if it leaks in. Wear gloves if you want to shower with the nails on, and be careful when you’re cleaning your hands."

These straw nails are pretty sturdy, so feel free to make the sections as long as you like! The straw nail will cover your entire fingernail from cuticle to tip, so cut each section long enough to go over each nail plus a bit of extra length for the tips. [11] X Research source If you want really long nails, you’ll probably need to use more than one straw. Any plastic drinking straw will work for these nails. However, if you’re using bendy straws, you’ll want to cut your sections out of the straight part of the straw and not the bendy part."

But even if you like the base color of the straws, you can still glam them up a bit! One option is to decorate the straw nails with acrylic paint or nail polish details before attaching them. Flatten the nails and attach them to a piece of paper with double-sided tape, then add your designs using a fine-detail brush or a nail art tool. [14] X Research source If you paint the nails, let them dry completely before you put them on your fingers so you don’t smudge your art.

Use a multi-ply paper so that each nail tip has at least 4 layers of paper in it, since this will create a stronger nail. Cut your paper into strips of the length you want for your tips, with enough extra length to cover about a third of your natural nail. [18] X Research source If you’re using craft tissue or single-ply tissue, you can also cut the tissue into long strips and then fold each strip up, accordion style, to create multiple layers.

[25] X Research source This mixture may dry a little harder than just glue and nail polish. Depending on how warm and dry it is in your work area, you may need to work fast before the glue starts to dry out.

Check the label for instructions on how to remove the tabs.

Nail tabs might not last as long as nail glue, but many brands claim they can keep your fake nails on for up to 5 days with proper care. Make sure you get adhesive nail tabs instead of nail guards, which are only adhesive on one side. With any adhesive product, it helps to start with clean nails.

Some of these guards are designed to work under gels and acrylics, but not under press-ons. Always clean your nails first with nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt, oils, or lingering nail polish. This will help the guards stick better. Check the packaging for instructions on how to remove your nail guards. Some brands come with special tools to help you peel the guards off when you’re done using them."
