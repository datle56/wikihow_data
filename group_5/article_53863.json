Preheat the waffle maker to 365 F (185 C), or setting three or four. [1] X Research source As the waffle iron heats up, you can make the batter. Most waffle irons will beep when they reach temperature."

      "content": "Mix together the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk everything together to remove lumps and combine all the ingredients. [2] X Research source For some additional flavor and spiciness in your waffles, add ½ teaspoon (1.3 g) of ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients. If you don't have any baking powder, substitute baking soda for it instead."

      "title": "Combine the wet ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine the wet ingredients. Crack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl one at a time. Add the milk and oil. Whisk until all the wet ingredients are incorporated and the eggs are light and fluffy. For even richer waffles, use melted butter in place of the oil. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the wet ingredients to the dry.",
      "content": "Add the wet ingredients to the dry. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix the batter with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula as you pour. Once you’ve added all the liquids, stir the batter until all the ingredients are just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can develop the gluten in the flour and make for chewy waffles. It’s ok if there are a few lumps left in the batter."

      "title": "Cook the waffles.",
      "content": "Cook the waffles. For waffle irons that don’t have a non-stick coating, spray the inside with cooking spray or brush it with a thin layer of oil. Measure between ⅔ and ¾ cup of batter, depending on the manufacturer’s instructions, and pour the batter into the bottom plate of the preheated waffle iron. Close the lid, secure the latch, and cook the waffles for four to six minutes. Some waffle irons will beep when the waffles are ready. For irons that don’t beep, cook the waffles until there's no more steam escaping from the waffle iron."

      "title": "Remove the waffle.",
      "content": "Remove the waffle. When the waffle is cooked, unlatch the waffle iron and open the top. Use a rubber spatula or silicone knife to remove the waffle without scratching the iron.

      "content": "Eat the waffle with a knife and fork. In many places, waffles are served and eaten with a knife and fork. Pierce the corner of the waffle with your fork, and use the knife to cut off a small, bite-sized piece. Use the fork to pick up the piece and bring it to your mouth. Wait until you chew and swallow before cutting another small piece. If the syrup drains off the waffle piece when you pick it up with the fork, dip it into the excess syrup on the plate before taking your bite. If your waffle has toppings life fruit and whipped cream on top, pick up a piece of fruit and cream with each forkful of waffle."

      "title": "Try the traditional Belgian way as an alternative.",
      "content": "Try the traditional Belgian way as an alternative. This method of eating works best for waffles that aren't garnished with fruit, cream, syrup, and other toppings that can fall off easily. Leave your waffle plain, or garnish it with some powdered sugar. Wrap the waffle in a napkin or piece of waxed paper, and eat the waffle by taking little bites at a time. In Belgium, there are two main types of waffles, Brussels and Liege waffles. While Brussels waffles are eaten with a knife and fork, Liege waffles are generally eaten with the hands. Liege waffles are sold as street food, and they typically aren't garnished the way other waffles are. Instead, Liege waffles have rocks of sugar in the batter, and the sugar melts and crystallizes when the waffles cook."
