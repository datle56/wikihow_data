      "content": "Choose a soft fur fabric for the exterior of your paws. You can make fursuit paws out of any fabric that you’d like, but your best bet is to buy faux fur designed specifically for fursuits. This fur tends to be easy to cut and comfortable to wear. Select a type of fabric based on the color of the fursuit that you’re designing. Buy your fabric online from a fursuit fabric manufacturer. [1] X Research source Most cosplayers and furries make the entire suit out of the same style of fabric and use 2-3 different colors. If you’re using more than 1 color, make your hand paws, feet paws, and belly the same color. Many people buy their fabric from community members on Etsy, but there are several larger fursuit manufacturers online. You need at least 3 by 3 feet (0.91 by 0.91 m) of fursuit fabric to create your paws. If you’re also making feet paws, double the amount of fursuit fabric that you buy. While some fursuit fabrics only have fur on one side, most fabrics are double-sided. You can always shave one side down with an electric hair clipper if you want. Fursuit fabric is designed to be easily shaved."

      "title": "Select a color of vinyl fabric for your paw pads.",
      "content": "Select a color of vinyl fabric for your paw pads. Vinyl fabric is tough, flexible, and easy to work with. This makes it ideal for paw pads. Purchase some vinyl fabric in the color that you want to use for the paw pads. Typically, paw pads are black, white, or gray, but you can make them whatever color you’d like. [2] X Research source Get 2 by 2 feet (0.61 by 0.61 m) of vinyl fabric for the paws. You’re going to cut some odd shapes out of these sheets, so you need a decent amount of fabric. If you’re making feet paws, double the amount of vinyl fabric that you buy."

      "content": "Draw a 4-fingered paw out on a piece of card stock. You can use standard paper if you’d like, but it can be kind of hard to trace. Cardstock is much easier to work with. Place your hand on the paper and put your ring and middle finger together. Draw around your hands, adding at least 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) around each finger. Draw your fingers to be roughly the same thickness so that your paw is symmetrical on each side. Make the wrist a little narrower if you want a tighter-fitting paw. [3] X Research source The paws can be whatever shape you’d like, but round finger pads tend to be more common. The fingers don’t have to be perfectly symmetrical, but making each finger roughly the same size makes the process easier since you don’t need to track which side the paw pads go on."

Trim the excess paper off and work slowly around the round edges to keep them as clean as possible. [4] X Research source If you find it hard to cut around the finger pads, it will be even harder to cut the fabric out. Consider making a rounder design if you find it hard to cut the template out."

Use a fabric marker or fabric chalk to trace around your template. Repeat this process 4 times. Orient each tracing so that the paw is facing the same direction on the fur. This way, the fur will rest in the same direction on each side of the paw. [5] X Research source If the fur is thick, brush it in its natural direction to smooth it down before tracing."

If you don’t want the paws to be hot when you wear them, or you want the inside of your paws to be thinner, grab some electric hair clippers. Put a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) hair guard on it. Turn the clipper on. Drag the clipper over each paw in vertical lengths. Remove a layer of fur from 1 side of each of the 4 paws if you want the inside of your paws to be smoother and more comfortable. [7] X Research source When you put the paws together, make sure that the shaved sides are facing one another. Always trim the fur off by moving the clipper in the same direction."

      "content": "Sew lining into the fabric if you want more comfortable gloves. If you want the inside of your gloves to be comfier, trace your template on a softer, separate fabric 4 times. Cut it out and use sewing pins to pin the fabric to 1 side of each paw. Use a sewing machine to sew the template into the fabric using a straight stitch. [8] X Research source When you sew the separate pieces of fabric together to make your paws, make sure that the sides with the lining on them are facing one another. Alternatively, you can use hot glue to attach thick, woven gloves to the center of 2 of the paws."

Starting at a corner near the wrist, place the paw under the needle. Plug the machine in and turn the knob or slide to set the machine to its lowest setting. Use the foot pedal or automatic setting to begin stitching the fabric together. Rotate the fabric under the needle to apply a straight stitch to the edge. Work your way around the paw and stop once you reach the wrist on the opposite side. [10] X Research source For a cleaner stitch, fold the edges on top of one another before stitching the sheets of fabric together. You can do this by hand if you prefer, but it will take some time to complete. If you want the fabric to look uniform, use a stitching thread that is the same color as your fabric."

Draw each shape so that it is smaller than the finger and palm where you plan on placing the pads. You can draw these shapes using a fabric marker or a standard permanent marker. If the fabric is black, you may need to use white fabric chalk so that you can see the shape. [12] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a standard oval for the large pad in the middle of the hand. The shape of the paw pads is completely up to you. Generally speaking, the paw pads should be small enough that there is 1 in (2.5 cm) of fur between the pad and the edge of the finger where you’re placing it."

Apply hot glue to the back of a paw pad and stick it into its corresponding finger. Smooth the pad out by hand and hold the pad in place for 20-30 seconds. Repeat this process for every other paw pad to finish your fursuit paws. [15] X Research source If your fur is thick, shave the location where you’re going to install the paws before adding them. Alternatively, you can sew the pads into the paws. If you do, make sure that you don’t sew through each finger and accidentally join them together."

      "content": "Cut an outline for your feet paws out of EVA foam. Get a 3 by 3 feet (0.91 by 0.91 m) sheet of EVA foam online or from a craft supply store. Draw a 4-toed outline for your foot paw using a marker. Use a heavy-duty pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut the template out. Once you’ve cut your first template out, hold the cut section of foam over another piece and trace it. Then, cut your second piece out the same way you cut the first piece out. [16] X Research source While your feet paws can be shaped however you’d like, most fur feet have round toes that lead back to the heel. Make the foam base at least 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) bigger than your shoe on each side, although they can be bigger if you’d like. You can use craft foam instead of EVA foam if you prefer, but craft foam tends to be a little softer and may not last as long. Like regular paws, fursuit feet paws typically have 4 digits. You can make a suit out of 5 or 3 toes if you prefer, though."

Remove the laces from the shoes and pull the tongue up a little so that you can easily slide your hand inside. [17] X Research source The shoes must be made of canvas fabric. Plastic and leather won’t stick to the foam you’ll use to pad the feet. To make fursuit feet paws without shoes, use thick, comfortable socks instead of shoes. It’s typically easier to use canvas shoes, though. It is extremely hard to make stable fursuit feet paws entirely from scratch without shoes or socks."

Then, turn each shoe over so that the sole is facing up. Apply a liberal amount of hot glue over each portion of the sole. For each shoe, stick your hand inside and press it into the center of the EVA foam. Hold each shoe in place for 20-30 seconds before weighing it down with a heavy object. [18] X Research source Since your templates are identical, it doesn’t matter which shoe goes on which sheet of foam."

      "content": "Outline your feet paws on upholstery foam and cut them out. Get a sheet of upholstery foam online or from your local craft store. Hold one of your shoes on top of the foam and trace it with a marker. Then, use an electric knife to cut the padding out. Turn the knife to its lowest setting and hold the foam up with your nondominant hand. Slowly and carefully cut around your outline. Repeat this process for your second foot. [19] X Research source You need at least 3 by 3 feet (0.91 by 0.91 m) worth of upholstery foam to complete both feet. Use a bread knife or scissors if you don’t have an electric knife. Hold your nondominant hand at least 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) away from the area that you’re cutting to keep your hands safe. If your foam is kind of thin, repeat this process a second time and glue the 2 cut-out portions together for each foot to double the thickness. The foam must be thicker than the height of your shoes for this process to work."

Then, use the electric knife to cut each set of upholstery foam in half, widthwise, over the marks that you made. This will make it much easier to carve out space for your shoes. [20] X Research source Cutting the foam in half gives you room to cut into the middle of the padding without worrying about puncturing the top of the padding, which must remain intact."

Then, use the electric knife to carve foam out of the middle of each portion so that your shoe fits inside. This is mostly a trial-and-error process, so cut small portions out and place the foam over your shoe to get a feel for how much you need to remove from each sheet of foam. [21] X Research source Keep in mind, the back half of each paw only needs to wrap around your heel. You’ll remove more foam from the front half of each paw. Cut out a small half circle where each pad sits over the opening of your shoe to give you room to put your feet inside. This doesn’t need to be perfect. Don’t worry if you remove a little excess foam."

Apply hot glue all around your EVA foam. The more glue you use, the more secure your feet paws will be. Once you’ve covered the EVA foam in glue, hold your upholstery foam over the EVA foam and press it down in place. Repeat this process for each shoe and glue your 4 pieces into place over your shoes. [22] X Research source Weigh each shoe down with a heavy, flat object for 3-5 minutes to join the 4 pieces of upholstery foam to the EVA foam. Don’t add glue to the outside of the canvas shoe when you do this. You need a little breathing room for your feet."

Use scissors to smooth down rough edges. Do your best to keep each toe roughly the same in terms of its roundness and size. Continue trimming the toes until you’re happy with their shape. [23] X Research source You can leave the heel as it is if you’d like. Alternatively, feel free to smooth the top out to make the heel lead up towards your leg.

To avoid this, run glue around the seam on each foot. To keep the seam in place while you glue, join the upholstery foam to the EVA foam using sewing pins. Place 1 pin every 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) in the space between each set of pins. Run a line of hot glue over the seam where the EVA foam meets the upholstery foam and remove the pins.

      "content": "Cut out strips of fursuit fabric for your feet paws. Since your feet paws are kind of oddly shaped, it is extremely difficult to sew a single sheet of fur over the padding. Instead, cut out 5-8 smaller shapes for each of your feet using scissors. Cut 1 rectangular portion out to wrap around your heel and 1 rectangular portion for the top of your foot. Cut 1-2 smaller portions out for each toe. Once you’ve cut out your fabric, hold each portion over your foot to ensure that you have cut out enough fur. [25] X Research source You do not need to add fabric to the sole of each foot. It’s perfectly fine if the sheets of fursuit fabric overlap. If you have any gaps or openings between the sheets of fabric, cut additional pieces out."

Trace each piece of fursuit fabric on the vinyl fabric and cut the vinyl out with sewing scissors. Use your sewing machine to sew the vinyl into the fursuit fabric. Use a straight stitch and work slowly to join fabrics together. [26] X Research source The vinyl fabric will make it easier to glue the fursuit fabric to the foam. Without the vinyl fabric, your fursuit fabric may peel off over time. You can use sewing pins if you want to make it easier, but it isn’t necessary if you have a steady hand. This portion of the fabric will be hidden, and you only need the vinyl to glue the fabric to the foam."

Cover every surface and use multiple glue sticks as needed. Press your sheets of fursuit fabric into the foam, vinyl-side down. Hold each piece in place for 20-30 seconds. Cover the foam in fur and repeat this process for your other foot to finish your fursuit paws! [27] X Research source The fluffy fursuit fabric will make it easy to hide any gaps in the upholstery foam if there are any. You can always cut out new pieces and layer them over the gaps if you’d like."
