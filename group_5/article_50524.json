      "content": "Aquarians are problem-solving and ambitious intellectuals. They can be shy or reserved at times but are typically energetic and well-liked. They tend to keep their feelings to themselves and sometimes seem aloof or standoffish because they are so logical and objective. Aquarians love all things new and exciting and rarely prefer to walk the beaten path. In general, two Aquarians are very compatible—if they can work on being warm towards each other, they’re bound to have an adventurous, stimulating, and fulfilling relationship. [1] X Research source People with a sun in Aquarius love helping others and value equality and the spread of knowledge. They’re typically far-sighted and driven to achieve their goals but can be derailed by their ego or stubbornness. Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac. People with their sun in Aquarius are born between January 20 and February 18. It’s a fixed air sign depicted as the Water Bearer of the zodiac."

      "content": "In general, a pair of Aquarians will have a great time in bed. They won’t hesitate to act out and fulfill each other’s sexual fantasies. Aquarians also like to experiment and try new things. As the oddballs of the zodiac, they don’t understand the taboos or restrictions society puts around various kinks and preferences. Two Aquarians will enjoy plenty of pleasure and fireworks together, especially in the beginning of their relationship. One Aquarius needs to make a point to let the other know they’re interested in them in a physical or sexual manner quickly. Otherwise, both might keep thinking about sex without acting on it. Aquarians are pretty emotionally detached from sex. The lack of vulnerability or intimacy will weigh on them after the initial spark and passion has faded. They may have a hard time bridging the gap from a physical relationship to something more serious. Their detachment and aloofness make for great friends-with-benefits, though."

      "title": "Aquarians won’t be outwardly romantic, even if there’s a love connection.",
      "content": "Aquarians won’t be outwardly romantic, even if there’s a love connection. An Aquarian keeps their emotions to themselves and their relationship might seem cold to an outside observer. One on hand, the lack of emotional depth might keep the relationship from long term success. On the other hand, Aquarians know that no one else will understand their detached style and might make it work. Two Aquarians might have trouble establishing a romantic connection at all. They blend love and friendships, so there may not be a clear line where one ends and the other begins. Of all the zodiac combinations, a pair of Aquarians is the most likely to decide they’re better off as good friends instead of lovers."

      "title": "Conversation between Aquarians is electric.",
      "content": "Conversation between Aquarians is electric. Their intellectual connection is unparalleled and they’ll never have a problem finding something interesting to talk about. They enjoy highly intelligent, artistic, and lofty topics that other signs may find difficult to understand or relate to. [2] X Research source Even though they don’t usually verbalize their feelings, the innate understanding between two Aquarians means they’ll often know how the other is feeling without having to say much."

      "title": "Aquarians share a mutual trust.",
      "content": "Aquarians share a mutual trust. They understand each other’s need for personal space and freedom and won’t normally feel threatened or jealous if their partner needs alone time. They both tend to be blunt and don’t typically feel a need to lie or hide things from each other since they’re both equally as eccentric."

      "title": "Two Aquarians will do anything together if it’s interesting enough.",
      "content": "Two Aquarians will do anything together if it’s interesting enough. From dates to vacations, they’re down for any activity as long as it’s exciting, new, or they’re learning something. When combined with their determination and ambition, this means they’ll also benefit from pushing one another to succeed. There’s little they’ll disagree on since they both value personal freedom for themselves and their partner. Aquarians tend to have rebellious youths, so they might develop opposing values based on the upbringing they rebelled against. This might cause some friction since they can also be stubborn or egotistical at times."

      "title": "Overall, this pair has great potential for a solid relationship.",
      "content": "Overall, this pair has great potential for a solid relationship. No one will ever understand an Aquarius like another Aquarius. They’ll go anywhere and do anything for each other for as long as they both have an interest in each other. They thrive in the extremes and can satisfy each other’s sexual needs without hesitation. When they can acknowledge their unique understanding of one another, they have a good chance of staying together long term. Tension can form between any couple, but Aquarians know what they’re up against. They can navigate most hardships because they’re great at drawing and respecting personal boundaries."

      "title": "The biggest challenge for this coupling is making the leap to lovers in the first place.",
      "content": "The biggest challenge for this coupling is making the leap to lovers in the first place. Aquarians have trouble forming close bonds. Since they struggle to differentiate friendship from romantic love, they will either stay friends forever or quickly return to friendship if there’s no strong love connection. [3] X Research source If one partner becomes possessive, the relationship will fall apart. Possessiveness goes against an Aquarian’s core belief in personal freedom and space. A clash of egos might cause a rift if a compromise is not reached. In case of a stalemate, both partners should step back and evaluate whether they’re giving each other the freedom they need."
