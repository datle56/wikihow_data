      "content": "Set up your unicycle properly. The seat height is critical: you should be able to reach the bottom pedal, with just a small crook in your knee. Get an extension on the post if needed. The post itself should be easily adjustable. Make sure the pedals are rubber (and not metal). It's hard enough to learn, without doing it on a cheap, poorly-setup unicycle! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Buy (and use) safety equipment. Heavy duty hand pads are a must! Knee pads are an option, but, you don’t want to restrict your movements either. Very well padded shorts are highly recommended: you are going to land on the pavement a lot at first! Depending on your athleticism, you may want to consider a helmet."

      "content": "Find a suitable site for learning to ride. Someplace you can hold on to, but, won’t get hurt (and won’t hurt someone else). Tennis nets, a wall, or a smooth fence, are good: you want a barrier where you can ride along and hold on to something safely. Holding on to a friend or a post is a very poor substitute, and not recommended (unless the friend enjoys getting his shins hit with your pedals)."

Step on that pedal with the foot of your weaker leg. Throw your leg over the seat, and sit on the uni. Then, step on the other pedal. Pull yourself up while holding onto something for support.

Rotate the wheels ½ turn forward and backward. All your weight should be, on the floor of your pelvis (and not on your thighs or calves). Trust me, you’re not going to ride off anywhere immediately! Just concentrate on getting the feel of your vehicle. [5] X Research source"
