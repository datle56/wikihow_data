      "title": "Choose organic, cold-pressed plant oil, if possible.",
      "content": "Choose organic, cold-pressed plant oil, if possible. Look to online stores or specialty markets to find 100% pure amla oil. Don't forget to check the ingredients list to make sure there are no dyes, fragrances, preservatives, and other additives (especially if you’re allergic or have a sensitive scalp). [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can buy amla in powder form as well, if you like. You'll have to make a paste out of it by adding 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of water for every 1/2 cup (64 grams) of amla powder before applying it to your hair."

      "title": "Do a spot test to check for any signs of an allergic reaction.",
      "content": "Do a spot test to check for any signs of an allergic reaction. Pour a dime-sized amount of amla oil onto your inner forearm or wrist. Then, wait 24 hours to see if you experience a rash or any redness. If you have a reaction, don’t use the amla oil. If nothing happens, it’s safe to use on your scalp. [3] X Research source If you do have a reaction, note that it could also be from any base oils in the blend like coconut, jojoba, or argan oil. Check the ingredients list if you have known allergies or reactions to oil-based products in the past."

      "title": "Dampen your hair and part it down the middle.",
      "content": "Dampen your hair and part it down the middle. Spritz your hair with water and comb it through until all of it is adequately damp. Then, use your fingers or a comb to part your hair down the middle. [4] X Research source Moisture raises the outer cuticle layer of the hair, allowing the oil to soak in deeper in a shorter period of time, so it’s best to apply it to damp hair. If you’ve already shampooed your hair in the shower, step out and apply the amla oil in place of your usual conditioner."

    {
      "title": "Massage your scalp with about 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) of amla oil.",
      "content": "Massage your scalp with about 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of amla oil. Pour about 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of amla oil into your palm and carefully pour it onto your scalp. Use your fingers to massage it in, running it down the length of your hair. [5] X Research source It’s normal to feel a slight cooling effect from the oil."

    {
      "title": "Use a palm full of oil on each section of your hair until it’s soaked.",
      "content": "Use a palm full of oil on each section of your hair until it’s soaked. Pour more amla oil into your palm and massage it into front, sides, sides, and back of your hair until all the strands have been covered. If you have areas where your scalp is dry, itchy, or balding, apply a little extra to those parts. [6] X Research source Make sure to coat the tips of your hair, especially if your hair is dried out and prone to split ends."

    {
      "title": "Wrap your hair in a warm towel for 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Wrap your hair in a warm towel for 15 minutes. Warm up a towel by putting it in the dryer on high heat for a few minutes. Then, wrap your oiled hair with the towel and let it sit for 15 minutes. This will help the oil soak into your strands and scalp. [7] X Research source You can also dampen a towel with hot water and then wrap your hair with it. Certain blends of amla oil call for leaving it on for up to 2 hours, so refer to the instructions on the bottle."

      "title": "Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water until all of the oil is out.",
      "content": "Rinse your hair thoroughly with warm water until all of the oil is out. Rinse the hair out with just warm water if you’re using amla oil in place of your conditioner. Use your normal shampoo and conditioner to rinse the oil away if you’re using the oil as a moisturizing treatment on previously soiled hair. [8] X Research source The oil is gone when you squeeze water out of your hair and don’t see any translucent swirls in the water. If you have dry or frizzy hair, use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to retain your hair’s natural oils."

      "content": "Condition your hair with amla oil 1 or 2 times per week for 16 weeks. If you’re trying to grow your hair out or repair dry, damaged hair, do an amla oil treatment once or twice a week. You can use it more often if you’d like, just note that your hair might appear oily and you might give off a particularly pungent scent! [9] X Research source It may take about 16 weeks before you notice an improvement. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can also do a mini-application between washes to tame frizz by rubbing a quarter-sized amount onto your hands and running your fingers through the tips of your hair."

      "title": "Part your dry hair down the middle with your fingers or a comb.",
      "content": "Part your dry hair down the middle with your fingers or a comb. Parting your hair will make it easier to apply the oil to each section (the sides and back). It will also help the oil concentrate at the top of your scalp, an area more prone to dryness and itching. [11] X Research source If you have a particular area of your scalp that is dry or flaky, part your hair so that part is exposed and you can focus the oil in that area."

      "content": "Pour 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of amla oil into your palm and massage your scalp. Cup your hand and pour as much amla oil into your palm as you can hold, which will probably be around 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL). Then, pour it into your scalp and let the oil soak into the roots of your hair. [12] X Research source If the amla oil came in a squeeze bottle, feel free to squeeze it onto your hair instead."

      "content": "Apply more oil until each strand becomes dampened with amla oil. Keep applying the oil until every strand is soaked from root to tip. If you have curly hair, it may help to comb it through with a wide-toothed comb. [13] X Research source Apply extra oil in areas that are particularly dry, itchy, or balding (like the roots near the crown of your head or the tips of your hair)."

      "content": "Bunch your hair up and cover it with a shower cap. Use clips or loose elastic bands to bunch your hair up. Then, cover your head in a shower cap to protect your pillowcase and sheets from getting oily. [14] X Research source The shower cap will also help retain heat coming from your head overnight, which will help open the hair follicles so the oil can soak in better."

Once you wake up, rinse the oil out of your hair with warm water until there’s no sign of the oil left in your hair. Then, apply your usual shampoo and conditioner. [15] X Research source Let your hair get saturated with water and squeeze a little out into your palm to see if you notice any translucent swirls in the water. If there are none, continue with your regular hair washing routine."

      "content": "Make a sugar scrub with amla oil to remove dead skin. Create an exfoliant by mixing 1 cup (240 mL) of amla oil with 1/2 cup (64 grams) of sugar and 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of rose water. Gently rub the mixture onto your face or body, then wash it off with warm water and pat your skin dry. [17] X Research source Avoid exfoliating on areas with open wounds, sores, or acne lesions because this may increase irritation and redness. Don’t harshly scrub your skin, especially the sensitive skin on your face! Do this treatment once or twice a week to keep your skin fresh and glowing."

Take a spa day for yourself and massage your face and body with a liberal amount of amla oil so that your skin is fully soaked. Do this either before or after you shower. If you choose to leave it on throughout the day, make sure you’re okay with the smell! [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Make sure to cover all of the areas that are prone to wrinkles, discoloration, or other signs of aging that you might be concerned about. Amla promotes the production of procollagen, a precursor to collagen to maintain healthy skin tissue, shrink pores, and repair damage."
