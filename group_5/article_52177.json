Hold the cap under the water to rinse it off, too. Then, pour out the water through the spout. This helps flush out bacteria and traces of the saline solution. [1] X Research source A preliminary rinse helps to wash away most unwanted contaminants in your neti pot. Always rinse and wash your pot after using it. Don't neglect cleaning the lid of the pot. While it doesn't come into direct contact with your nose, bacteria can infiltrate the lid and contaminate the pot."

      "content": "Fill the pot with hot distilled or filtered water, or previously boiled water. Regular tap water can contain bacteria and amoebas that are harmful when flushed through your sinuses. So, fill your neti pot with bottled distilled water or filtered water that’s been passed through a pore size of at least 1 micron. Or, boil tap water for at least 3 to 5 minutes and let it cool slightly. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Check your neti pot’s instructions to learn what type of filtered water is recommended for use. Some manufacturers recommend using a 0.2 micron filter. Filters that are labeled “NSF 53” or “NSF 58” or read “cyst removal” or “cyst reduction” are safe to use. Do not use boiling water in the pot, as the heat can damage the device. Allow the boiled water to cool slightly before pouring it inside."

      "content": "Add a few drops of dish soap to the water. It's recommended that you use a mild cleanser, like liquid dish detergent or antibacterial all-purpose soap, to sanitize a neti pot. Squeeze several drops of soap into the pot that’s filled with distilled, filtered, or previously boiled water. For best results, leave the soap solution to soak for a few minutes. [3] X Research source Never use soaps containing harsh chemicals or astringent agents, like bleach. Besides being hazardous to put in your body, these compounds can damage the neti pot."

Then, scrub the inside and outside of the lid. Finally, use the brush to clean the surface of the neti pot. [5] X Research source Scrubbing the pot loosens any saline solution buildup while the soapy water cleans and disinfects any bacteria and other contaminants. To sterilize your cleaning brush, run it through the dishwasher. Or, soak the brush in 1 c (237 ml) of white vinegar and a drop of dish soap for 1 hour.

When your neti pot is fully dry, use it again or store it in a clean, dry spot. [10] X Research source Leave the lid off the pot to prevent moisture from getting trapped inside. Excess moisture can lead to mold and bacteria growth. Alternatively, dry your neti pot with a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel.
