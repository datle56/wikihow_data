      "title": "Remove any flame-producing objects in the area.",
      "content": "Remove any flame-producing objects in the area. Isopropyl alcohol is extremely flammable, and it can catch fire very easily. Make sure there aren’t any lighters, stoves, or open flames that could cause a spark nearby. [1] X Research source If you can’t remove a flammable object, make sure it’s turned all the way off."

    {
      "title": "Open the doors and windows to ventilate the area.",
      "content": "Open the doors and windows to ventilate the area. The fumes from isopropyl alcohol can be dangerous when inhaled, and can cause dizziness and nausea. Before you start cleaning up, open up all the doors and windows that you can to let the fumes dissipate into the air. [2] X Research source If there aren’t any doors or windows in the area, try to work fast and take breaks while cleaning if you need to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on a pair of latex or nitrile gloves.",
      "content": "Put on a pair of latex or nitrile gloves. Isopropyl alcohol can cause skin irritation if it touches you. Pull on a pair of gloves to protect your hands while you’re cleaning up. [3] X Research source You can also use rubber gloves if you don’t have any latex or nitrile ones. If you don’t have gloves, try to touch the alcohol as little as possible and wash your hands with soap and water as soon as you’re done cleaning."

    {
      "title": "Wipe up the isopropyl alcohol with paper towels.",
      "content": "Wipe up the isopropyl alcohol with paper towels. Grab a roll of paper towels and lay a few sheets on top of the spill. Let them soak up the alcohol, then gather them up with your gloved hands. Then, use dry paper towels to wipe away the remaining alcohol. [4] X Research source If the surface is still slightly damp after you finish wiping up the alcohol, that's fine. Alcohol evaporates quickly, so it shouldn't take long to dry."

    {
      "title": "Put the paper towels and gloves in a hazardous waste container.",
      "content": "Put the paper towels and gloves in a hazardous waste container. Most state and local counties regulate isopropyl alcohol as a hazardous material. Dispose of the paper towels you used and your gloves in a hazardous waste container, if you can. [5] X Research source Check with your local landfill to see if they accept hazardous waste materials. Never wash isopropyl alcohol down the drain, as it can harm the living organisms in waterways."

    {
      "title": "Open all the doors and windows in the area.",
      "content": "Open all the doors and windows in the area. Large spills can produce a lot of fumes, which can be dangerous if inhaled over a long period of time. Ventilate the area as much as you can by opening all the doors and windows. [6] X Research source If there aren’t any doors or windows nearby, evacuate all personnel until the fumes have cleared out."

      "title": "Wait about 5 minutes for the alcohol to absorb.",
      "content": "Wait about 5 minutes for the alcohol to absorb. It won’t take long for the sand or dirt to soak in the alcohol. If you notice any areas need more sand or dirt, you can add it on top of the layer you already put down.

If there is any sand or dirt residue left on the floor, use paper towels to wipe it up and put it into the containers as well. [10] X Research source The containers must be sealed so that the alcohol doesn’t seep into the rest of the waste."

Most states and counties require that isopropyl alcohol be disposed of in a hazardous waste container, especially in large quantities. Place the containers into a hazardous waste bin with the lids on so they can be thrown away properly. [11] X Research source"
