      "title": "Find the ribbon spools.",
      "content": "Find the ribbon spools. First, carefully lift the top \"bonnet\" of the typewriter. Then, look for the typewriter ribbon wound around two metal or plastic spools: much like the sort that you'd use for sewing thread or rope. The spools are set up in an S- shaped configuration on two axles. The ribbon itself stretches between the spools and through an aligning scale. Remove your typewriter's cover by pressing it on both sides, next to the separating line. Press gently but firmly until the cover clicks open. [1] X Research source The spools may be covered up in newer typewriter models. Look for a small clasp or button to remove this cover."

      "content": "Remember the layout. Before you take your typewriter apart, make sure that you know how to put it back together. Consider taking a photo of the insides to remind yourself later on. If you have access to a physical or online PDF copy of the typewriter manual, then this document should include basic instructions on how to change the ribbon. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Disengage the ribbon.",
      "content": "Disengage the ribbon. The process depends on what type of typewriter you have. If you have a manual typewriter, then lift the spools directly out of the machine. On a cartridge typewriter, simply press the release lever to disengage the ribbon. [3] X Research source To disengage the spools: simply pull them straight up out of the typewriter. There may also be two additional spring-loaded metal pieces that hold the ribbon in place. They'll be located close to the ribbon spools. Apply pressure to finger-holds on these pieces, and you should be able to loosen the ribbon tension enough for you to pull it out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the ribbon and the spools.",
      "content": "Remove the ribbon and the spools. First, open the ribbon gate: the small piece of metal that holds the ribbon against the paper, where the keys will hit it. Then, pull the entire ribbon out of the machine. Be gentle so that you don't damage any of the components! Put the old ink cartridge to the side. Now, you are ready to install the new ribbon."

      "title": "Procure a new ribbon.",
      "content": "Procure a new ribbon. If you are using an older model of typewriter, then the hard part of this process will be actually sourcing an original ribbon that was designed for your particular machine. Search online for retailers that are selling compatible typewriter ribbons. Check eBay and other online marketplaces. You can usually find a reputable seller to send you an appropriate ribbon. Check around your town for shops that sell paper supplies and ephemera. Many manufacturers have ceased ribbon production due to last of orders. However, it never hurts to contact the company that made the machine!"

      "content": "Thread the new ribbon. Pull it through the wire that holds it in front of the roller. Look around the spools and make sure that it's right-side up. Be careful and precise when engaging the ribbon: it must be lined up correctly for the typewriter to function. If you are using a multi-toned ribbon, make sure that black stripe sits on top of the red stripe when you're installing the fabric. Check that there are no twists in the ribbon!

      "title": "Understand the function of the ribbon.",
      "content": "Understand the function of the ribbon. Classic typewriters use a silk ribbon as an inkwell for the keys. The ribbons have a quite long lasting time, as the keys are not constantly hammering them in the same place. The ribbon moves around the spools each time that you clack a key: first from the left spool to the right, and after the left spool is empty and the right spool complete, Your typewriter ribbon may only run black ink, or it may have a red portion. If you're mostly typing in black ink, then the black part of the ribbon will run out much more quickly."

    {
      "title": "Watch the ink.",
      "content": "Watch the ink . Notice when your typed words grow thin and pale. The ribbon won't wear through all at once â€“ you should begin to see sporadic faint patches in your text. You can type around this for a time by spacing back and double-typing over the inkless letters. However: you may as well change your typewriter ribbon once you begin to notice that the machine is running out of ink."
