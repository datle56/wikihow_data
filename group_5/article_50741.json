      "content": "Banishment is a 4th-level abjuration spell that can incapacitate foes. Magic users in D&D 5e have a huge library of spells available to them! Some may choose to learn the Banishment spell, which is a surprisingly powerful spell that essentially removes targeted enemies from the battlefield. However, it’s only available to spellcasters with 4th-level spell slots (or higher). [1] X Research source Range: 60 feet Target: One creature you can see within range Components: Verbal, somatic, and material (an item the target finds distasteful) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute Casting time: 1 action"

      "title": "Your target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.",
      "content": "Your target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. When you take an action to cast the Banishment spell in battle, your target (presumably controlled by the GM or Game Master) must make a Charisma saving throw against your character’s spell save DC . If they succeed, the spell fails. If they fail, they’re banished to a different plane of existence. [2] X Research source Your character’s (PC’s) spell save DC is based on their main spellcasting ability score. It determines how difficult it is for enemies to resist your spells. Charisma is an ability score that measures a creature’s force of personality—and, in the case of Banishment, the sheer determination to resist being magically exiled. In D&D, “planes” are basically worlds. Material planes (like Toril, Eberron, and Oerth) are where mortals live, and most adventures take place. However, there are many other planes, like the Feywild, Shadowfell, the Nine Hells, and Elysium."

      "title": "Targets native to the current plane are banished to a demiplane.",
      "content": "Targets native to the current plane are banished to a demiplane. The effects of Banishment vary based on the creature you target! When you banish a target that is native to the plane of existence you’re all on, they end up in a harmless demiplane and are incapacitated. They remain until the spell ends, after which they reappear in the same spot they left (or the closest spot). [3] X Research source While “planes of existence” are entire worlds, a demiplane is like a finite pocket realm. Beyond that, the GM can describe it however they like. The incapacitated condition simply means a creature can’t take actions, reactions, or bonus actions in combat. Keep in mind that when a banished creature returns from banishment, they’ll have the same initiative spot as before."

    {
      "title": "Targets native to a different plane of existence are banished there.",
      "content": "Targets native to a different plane of existence are banished there. If you successfully banish a target that isn’t native to the plane you’re both currently on, they’ll immediately return to their home plane. The target creature will reappear in the same spot if the spell ends before its duration. However, if the spell lasts for 1 minute (its duration), the banished creature won’t return. [4] X Research source For example, say your PC banishes a devil native to Avernus (in the Nine Hells). In that case, the devil would disappear and return to Avernus. If the spell ends early, the devil will return. However, if your PC maintains their spell for a full minute, the devil will be stuck in Avernus; it won’t be able to return, even when the spell ends."

      "title": "At higher levels, you can target multiple creatures.",
      "content": "At higher levels, you can target multiple creatures. When cast at its base level, 4, Banishment can remove 1 enemy from the battlefield. However, casting Banishment at the 5th level or higher lets you target an extra creature—1 for each spell slot level about 4th. [5] X Research source For example, you can target 2 creatures when you cast Banishment at the 5th level, 3 creatures at the 6th level, and so on. Spell slot levels in D&D 5e go all the way up to 9—which means you could potentially banish up to 6 creatures at the same time. Typically, all clothing and items the targeted creature is carrying vanish with them. This is also the case if your PC is banished by an enemy."

    {
      "title": "The spell will end if your concentration is broken.",
      "content": "The spell will end if your concentration is broken. In 5e, concentration determines your PC’s ability to focus on and maintain a spell. Banishment is a concentration spell, meaning your PC must “concentrate” to keep it going. You can choose to end the spell yourself—but it’s also possible for enemies to forcibly break their concentration. [6] X Research source Taking damage forces your PC to make a concentration save if they’re focusing on a spell (which is essentially a Constitution saving throw). If your PC fails their concentration save, their spell is lost. If they succeed, they maintain concentration. Spells like counterspell can also stop your PC from casting Banishment. However, the dispel magic spell can’t bring a banished creature back because it’s impossible to target them when they’re on a different plane."

      "title": "Banishment is considered super strong and effective in battles.",
      "content": "Banishment is considered super strong and effective in battles. No matter what class you’re playing or your PC’s build, Banishment is generally an excellent spell to add to their repertoire. After all, it can remove an enemy from battle for up to 1 minute—and battles rarely last that long (since a single round of combat amounts to about 6 seconds of time). [7] X Research source For example, if your PC was battling a group of bandits and their powerful leader, banishing the leader could make it easier to pick off the weaker enemies. Some players and GMs feel that it’s too powerful—but keep in mind that there are still restrictions that balance out the spell. DM Tip: If you’re a DM and you want to give a boss-level enemy a fighting chance against your players and their Banishment spells, you could create a foe with a high Charisma score (or simply give them Counterspell)."

      "content": "Clerics, wizards, sorcerers, paladins, and warlocks can cast Banishment. Some spells are limited to either divine spellcasters (like clerics and paladins, whose powers come from their faith in the gods) or arcane spellcasters (like wizards and sorcerers). Banishment, however, is more widely available! Even Eldritch Knights (a specific fighter subclass) can cast Banishment because it’s an abjuration spell. [8] X Research source"
