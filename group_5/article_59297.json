Gently press up on the tabs with your thumb to pop the front cover off of the case.

Hold the middle of the case firmly with your other hand. Gently push the side of the case down with your thumb until the disk tray pops out of place. [2] X Research source If the disk tray doesn’t fully pop out, then repeat the same steps on another corner. Once 2 corners are free, the others will come out easily. After the disk tray is free, simply lift the album artwork out from the back of the case. Once you’ve taken the album artwork out, toss the old, broken case into your trash can."

Once the disk tray clicks into place, put your CD back in. If the disk tray doesn’t snap in right away, try pressing down along the sides of the case. Just avoid applying too much pressure so the disk tray or cover doesn’t break."
