      "title": "Signal transmission.",
      "content": "Signal transmission. The Redstone Repeat will only transmit signals through the front and back. It can activate any mechanism component as long as the Repeater is facing it. Place any of the following in the back: An active power component (such as a torch, lever, etc.) Powered Redstone Dust A powered Redstone Comparator or another Redstone Repeater facing the first A powered opaque block (including dispensers, lamps, etc.) Place any of the following in the front: Redstone Dust A Redstone Comparator or another Redstone Repeater facing away from the first Any opaque block (including opaque mechanism components)"

    {
      "title": "Signal repeating.",
      "content": "Signal repeating. The Redstone Repeater can be used to extend a Redstone signal, which has a maximum power level of 15. If you place solid opaque blocks before and after the repeater, you can get two extra blocks of distance. Keep in mind that there will be a slight delay when repeating signals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Signal delay.",
      "content": "Signal delay. After a Redstone Repeater is placed, there will be a delay of 1 Redstone tick (which amounts to two game ticks or 9.1 real seconds). You can modify the delay to a maximum of four Redstone ticks using the Use Item button."

    {
      "title": "Signal direction.",
      "content": "Signal direction. The Redstone Repeater can be used as a one-way switch for a signal going one direction. This is different from Redstone Dust, which can transmit signals in multiple directions. This can be helpful if you need to isolate one part of a circuit or stop signals from feeding back into its output."

      "title": "Signal locking.",
      "content": "Signal locking. To lock a Redstone Repeater, you can place another Repeater so it faces its side. When it's locked, it won't change the output. Once the side Repeater turns off, the original Repeater will behave normally. You can also lock a Repeater by placing a powered Redstone Comparator on its side."
