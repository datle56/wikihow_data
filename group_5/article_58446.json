You can rise to the occasion without stooping to his level. Send a reasonable, honest response to tell him you care without totally losing your cool. Try something like, “Hey! I haven’t heard from you in a minute. I just wanted to let you know that I like you and would love to keep doing what we’re doing. But if you don’t respond, I’ll take the hint. Hope to talk soon.\" This way, you've set clear expectations, and you've totally let yourself off the hook.

When this happens, they may be impatient with the relationship's pace, wanting to dive right into emotional intensity. So, they'll make super dramatic, heartfelt promises, even if they can't keep them, just to draw their crush in. If you feel like your Scorpio is blowing smoke just to steal your heart, address this issue right then and there. Remind him that you like him, and over-the-top-promises aren't necessary, \"You know, I already like you. You don’t need to promise me anything super major right from the start!” By showing him that you aren't falling for his tricks, you'll keep your heart safe from broken promises, and you'll have him beat.

Yes, ideally, he'd just be honest about his expectations. But that's not a Scorpio's style! If your Scorpio guy asks you to do something he could do himself, he may be testing you. If he is, take a moment to decide whether or not you’re comfortable playing his game. [10] X Research source If you’re happy enough to go along with it, then feel free to blow him away. Handle the project confidently, and the Scorpio in your life will be thrilled. If you’re (totally understandably) not interested in jumping through hoops, feel free to just confront it head-on.

These guys will sometimes refuse to forgive – even if they actually really want to. They're super afraid of getting hurt, and when they do, they may be too prideful to accept your mistake. Overcome this by staying calm, being mature , and appealing to reason. [11] X Research source Apologize, tell him he's important to you, and remind him that though you'll work to be forgiven, you'll accept his choice either way. Finally, you can mention that you hope he won't let his pride keep him from a special relationship. Yes, Scorpios may withhold forgiveness as a mind game. But at the end of the day, this is a super logical sign. They may give in if you meet them with reason. And with that, you'll have won."
