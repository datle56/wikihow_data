      "title": "Choose a hair dye without ammonia or parabens.",
      "content": "Choose a hair dye without ammonia or parabens. Your pubic area is very sensitive and vulnerable to harsh chemicals. Read the ingredients list on the back of the box of hair dye to make sure it doesn’t contain ammonia or parabens that could irritate your skin. [1] X Research source Look for a dye that’s labeled “chemical-free,” “organic,” or “all-natural.” Use any color dye you’d like! Pick a color that matches your hair or, for a playful look, pick a bright color like pink or blue. Just keep in mind that if you have darker pubic hair, lighter dye colors likely won’t show. Never use bleach to lighten your pubic hair, as bleach can damage this tender, sensitive area of the body. We recommend using a semi-permanent hair dye to dye your pubic hair. This way, you can easily change up your look again in the future. Consider purchasing pubic hair dye if you’re worried about regular hair dye being irritating on sensitive skin. These products are designed to use on your pubic region, and some even include a safe pre-lightener.

      "content": "Apply petroleum jelly to the most sensitive areas to protect them. Petroleum jelly acts like a barrier between your skin and the dye, so it doesn’t stain or irritate certain spots. Rub a thin layer onto your labia, vulva, penis, or scrotum. [3] X Research source Avoid getting petroleum jelly on the hair you want to dye since the jelly blocks the dye. Alternatively, you can also use olive oil if you don’t have petroleum jelly."

      "content": "Put on plastic gloves and mix the hair dye according to the directions. Your box of hair dye will contain instructions on how to prepare the dye. It should also include plastic gloves. Place them on your hands before you begin working with the dye to protect your skin. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If your hair dye doesn’t come with gloves, you can buy them at any beauty store, grocery store, or online retailer. Test a small amount of dye on your skin before applying all over to make sure you don’t have an allergic reaction.

      "title": "Stir an equal amount of moisturizing shampoo into the dye.",
      "content": "Stir an equal amount of moisturizing shampoo into the dye. This dilutes the dye so it isn’t as harsh on your pubic area. Pour the same amount of shampoo as there is dye into the dye itself. Mix the 2 together with a spoon until thoroughly combined. [7] X Research source The exact amount of hair dye should be listed on the front of the box. Use that measurement for your shampoo. For example, if you have 3 ounces (85 g) of hair color, you’ll add 3 ounces (85 g) of shampoo. Choose a shampoo with hydrating ingredients, like argan oil, vitamin E, or Moroccan oil. Avoid one that has parabens, which will irritate your skin. This diluting technique works best when using semi-permanent hair dye."

Avoid rubbing the dye or letting it get into any super sensitive places, like inside your vagina. [8] X Trustworthy Source Go Ask Alice Medical advice site with content written by health promotion specialists affiliated with Columbia University Go to source Most boxed hair dye will come with an applicator brush. If yours doesn’t, buy one from a beauty store or an online retailer. You can also use a small paintbrush with bristles or a toothbrush instead of a hair dye brush. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the dye sit for about 30 minutes. This allows the color to fully soak into your pubic hair. Check the directions provided with the hair dye to find the exact processing time for that specific brand and type. [10] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Some dyes may be closer to 20 minutes. Wash off the dye immediately if you experience any burning or painful tingling sensations. [11] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Set a timer or use the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time. Don’t leave the dye on longer than the recommended time, or you could damage your pubic hair and skin."

Gently rub the area with a clean washcloth to get rid of any excess dye or petroleum jelly. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear. [12] X Research source If there’s any dye left on your skin after you dry off, dab the area with a cotton ball dipped in astringent or witch hazel to remove it. Once the hair dries, if you aren't satisfied with the color, wait at least 4 weeks before re-dyeing so you don't damage your hair. [13] X Research source"
