      "content": "Purchase a catheter. Most people will need to use a 14–16 French size catheter . [3] X Research source You can find Foley catheters at medical supplies stores, online, or through your doctor. Pediatric patients and adult males with congenitally small urethras will not tolerate catheters this large. They may need a 10 French size or smaller. [4] X Research source If you have an obstruction, call a professional. You will be using a three-way irrigation large catheter to deal with the obstruction, and it's important to know how to insert it without pushing against the obstruction, which is difficult for someone who isn't properly trained. This process isn't recommended for self-catheterization. Some catheters come in a kit with the catheter and an antiseptic solution that you pour on the catheter to sterilize it. Follow the procedures on the kit to make sure the catheter is sterile before you use it. Check the expiration date of kits when they arrive to make sure they are still usable. While using your catheter will be difficult at first, it will get easier and more routine over time. If you have any questions, consult a nurse who is trained to deal with incontinence."

      "content": "Purchase enough single-use catheters to use each one only once. Most catheters are single use because they need to be sterile. They will come in individual packages, making it easy for you to use them and then throw them away.

Discuss this with your doctor before trying to wash your catheters."

      "content": "Get water-based lubricating jelly. You will need the lubricating jelly to make the top of the catheter slick. This will make it easier to insert the catheter into your penis. [6] X Research source The lubricant for catheters should be sterile. It should not come in multi-dose packaging (such as a bottle), as once opened it must be thrown away and not used again in the future. Use single-dose packets only. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Make sure the lubricating jelly is water-based, as this will be less irritating to your urinary tract."

      "title": "Get medical gloves.",
      "content": "Get medical gloves. Always use medical gloves whether this is an in-and-out cath or an indwelling catheter. Your hands must be clean and protected during the insertion process. You can find medical gloves at a medical supply store or online. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Urinary retention already places individuals at risk for a urinary tract infection (UTI). Shoving a non-sterile instrument up the urethra practically ensures a UTI will occur. Sterile gloves and technique are preferred."

[11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Make sure your hands are clean and the area around you is clean before you take the catheter out of the package. Choose an area in your home that is open and free of obstructions, like the floor of your bathroom. Make sure the floor is clean.

You should have easy access to your penis with your hands. [12] X Research source You may also decide to stand in front of the toilet if it is comfortable for you to reach down and hold your penis.

Make sure the other end of the catheter is positioned in a container or in the toilet so the urine can be collected and disposed of properly."

Use a sterile syringe to inflate the collection bag with 10 mL of sterile water. The volume of water needed to fill the bag may vary depending on the size of the catheter you are using, so always check the packaging on the catheter for the exact volume. [17] X Research source Then, attach the collection bag to the catheter so it can hold the urine as you urinate. The inflated balloon should rest on the urethral opening of your bladder so the urine can be collected properly. Always make sure urine is flowing through the catheter before inflating the balloon."

[19] X Research source If the catheter is single-use only, throw it away and use a new one next time. Throw away any catheters that appear torn, hardened, or cracked.

You may need to remove it to determine this. If no urine comes out even after you rotate it, try coughing to encourage urine to flow."
