      "content": "Decorate your jeans with fabric markers. Fabric markers draw like ordinary markers, but are made with permanent inks that are designed not to wash out. Fabric markers are likely to work best on white or light-colored denims, although some are designed to show up on darker fabrics. Try drawing or writing free-hand designs on your jeans. You may wish to sketch in your designs with pencil before going over them with fabric markers. You can use lace to create a delicate marker pattern on your jeans. Just pin the lace to the part of the jeans you’d like to decorate, color over the part of the pattern you’d like to transfer with a fabric marker, and remove the lace when you’re done.

      "content": "Paint your jeans freehand. You can use fabric paint to create your own designs. You may wish to lightly sketch in your design with pencil before starting to paint.

Fabric paints come in a variety of textures and application types. Some come in tubes with applicator tips and are designed to be applied in a controlled line, while others are designed to be brushed or sprayed on. Keep in mind what sort of design you would like to do and select an appropriate paint for the job."

For brush-on paint, try using a foam brush with a small amount of paint on it so that your stencil designs don’t become runny or smudged. [2] X Research source"
