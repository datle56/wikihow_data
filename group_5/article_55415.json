      "content": "The 🔫 emoji symbolizes a toy water gun. Because the 🔫 (pistol) emoji depicts a bright green gun with red and yellow accents, it’s pretty clearly not a real gun; rather, the 🔫 emoji represents a water gun—which shoots out a stream of water when used. Thus, the 🔫 emoji generally relates to not only water guns but also any water-related activity, such as water fights (using the guns), swimming, and water sports. [1] X Research source “Omg, I just got the perfect toy for our pool party this week! 🔫” “Think I might need a 🔫 to stay cool in this weather!”"

      "content": "The 🔫 emoji conveys a joking or playful tone via text. Sometimes, people use the 🔫 emoji when they’re being teased or gently made fun of over text (usually by a friend). In response, they use the 🔫 emoji to jokingly scold their friend, as though saying, “Stop teasing me, or else!” Therefore, the 🔫 often has a playful, lighthearted feel to it.

      "content": "In the past, the 🔫 emoji represented a real gun (and gun violence). Even though the current 🔫 emoji does not depict a real weapon, the original version of the emoji did—and it used to represent guns, violence, frustration, and anger. Those meanings aren’t common now (since the emoji changed in 2016), but you might encounter them from time to time—especially since there are no other gun emojis. [3] X Research source “Learned how to shoot a real 🔫 at the range today.” Various platforms originally depicted this emoji as a classic handgun (normally a pistol or revolver), though most had changed to the water gun version by 2018."

Still, it’s possible to use the 🔫 emoji to talk about weapons rather than water toys; just make sure the person you’re texting knows what you’re really talking about!
