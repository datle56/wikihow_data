[2] X Research source If the degree of your polynomial is 2 (there is no exponent larger than x 2 ), you can find the axis of symmetry using this method. If the degree of the polynomial is higher than 2, use Method 2. To illustrate, take, as an example, the polynomial 2x 2 + 3x – 1. This highest exponent present is the x 2 , so it is a 2nd order polynomial, and you can use this first method to find the axis of symmetry."

To calculate the axis of symmetry for a 2nd order polynomial in the form ax 2 + bx +c (a parabola), use the basic formula x = -b / 2a. [3] X Research source In the example above, a = 2 b = 3, and c = -1. Insert these values into your formula, and you will get: x = -3 / 2(2) = -3/4."
