Consider using phytoestrogens in moderation to alleviate symptoms of low estrogen levels, or menopause. Avoid phytoestrogens if you're trying to conceive; they've been linked to infertility and developmental problems.

      "content": "Drink more coffee. Women who drink more than 2 cups of coffee (200 mg of caffeine) per day may have higher estrogen levels than women who don't. While caffeine may increase estrogen levels, it does not seem to increase fertility. If you're trying to increase estrogen in order to ovulate, coffee and caffeine may not help much. The link between caffeine and estrogen is still unclear, but there's no harm in trying this.

      "content": "Ask your doctor to test your estrogen levels. There are a variety of tests available for determining hormone levels. Your doctor will likely have you take a blood test. Your blood may also be tested for FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone), which is responsible for regulating estrogen and progesterone production in the ovaries. [23] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tell your doctor about any medications and supplements you're taking, including hormonal contraceptive (which may affect your test results). Let your physician know about any existing medical conditions like thyroid disease, sex-dependent hormone tumors, ovarian cysts, and unusual vaginal bleeding. The FSH test is usually drawn on the second or third day of your period. There are 3 types of estrogen; estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Estradiol is the type of estrogen that is normally measured with testing, and a normal range is 30-400 pg/mL for premenopausal women (depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle) and 0-30 pg/mL for postmenopausal women. [24] X Research source Levels lower than 20 pg/mL may cause hormonal symptoms such as hot flashes. The value of checking estrogen levels is controversial, as levels fluctuate widely throughout the day. However, it can be helpful in conjunction with a physical exam, history, and other testing."
