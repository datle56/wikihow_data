      "content": "Stay in the present. Arguments are often the result of underlying tensions in a relationship. If you want to settle an argument effectively you must be willing to communicate with your wife. This means staying in the present moment and avoiding discussing past conflicts. In an argument, you might be tempted to bring something up from the past. You might be trying to prove a point or convey how a certain behavior is part of a pattern. This is bad form in an argument, however, as it distracts from the issue at hand and can make your wife feel attacked or judged. If you're inclined to bring up issues from the past, it might be because these issues were never resolved to begin with. Keep in mind that moving forward means addressing present issues and letting go of the past."

This keeps the frame of reference subjective and de-emphasizes blame. [1] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. An \"I\" statement addresses how you feel when something happens. It does not focus on an objective judgment of the situation but rather a personal reaction. For example, instead of saying \"It's very disrespectful when you make us late for family events\" try saying something like \"I feel disrespected when you're not ready for family events on time.\""

Even if you're extremely upset, refrain from name calling and cursing during an argument. Yelling is also a bad idea during an argument. Yelling can be subjective. You might not think you're not yelling or raising your voice but it could easily come off that way to your spouse. If your wife asks you to keep your voice down, take a deep breath and proceed calmly with the conversation."

      "content": "Consider your wife's values. Oftentimes, arguments are about more than surface issues. Try to understand your wife's perspective during the fight by considering her values. While most successful couples share many core values, you'll inevitably clash in some areas. Arguments are sometimes necessary if they're in relation to certain differences in values. It's an opportunity for clarification and discussion. Try to think deeper during an argument. What are you really fighting about? For example, say your wife is slightly more religious than you is and is upset you want to take a romantic vacation over Easter Weekend. It might not really be about the vacation itself but your differing religious beliefs. Your wife might be the type of person who cringes at the idea of missing a service, especially on a major holiday. She might feel you're being disrespectful of her wants and needs regarding her faith."

In your family, it might be considered extremely rude to be even 5 or 10 minutes late. To resolve this, say something like, \"It makes me uncomfortable when we don't show up early or at the start time of an invitation. Can we make an effort to get to events a little earlier?\" This way, you're emphasizing your feelings over an objective definition of lateness. This makes it clear to your wife what you mean by \"on time.\""
