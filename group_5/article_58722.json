      "content": "Pseudo-listening involves seeming attentive, while not actively listening. People who pseudo-listen may act as if they’re paying attention, but in reality, they’re only partially listening—or not listening at all. [1] X Research source Pseudo-listeners may be hard to detect because they use many of the same cues as active listeners such as nodding or maintaining eye contact. They may even offer a response to the speaker that’s tangentially related to the subject at hand to make it seem as if they’re attentive, when in reality, they’re only aware of the broad strokes of the conversation. Pseudolistening is similar to glazing over , although pseudolistening is typically somewhat intentional, while glazing over usually occurs unintentionally due to a lack of interest in the conversation. Pseudolistening typically occurs in face-to-face communication, but it can also occur via text or phone calls."

For instance, are you in a loud public place where it’s hard to focus? Are you physically uncomfortable—are you chilly, sweaty, achy? Do you have anything on your mind that might prevent you from offering your full attention? Maybe you’re anxious about an upcoming surgery, or you were about to leave for work when your spouse began talking to you and you’re anxious about being late. Are you multitasking? Are you trying to check your email, scroll social media, or watch TV while listening to someone? Are you only pretending to listen to be polite?

Sometimes this comes from genuine excitement about the conversation topic, but often it’s because the pseudolistener is more interested in their own thoughts than the speaker’s. When it is your turn to speak, avoid shifting the focus to you (also known as deflecting). Even if you mean well, responding to someone’s confession that they’re worried about their sick brother’s health with a story about how you know someone who was sick once may come across as monopolizing the conversation. [15] X Research source Try not to rehearse what you’re going to say while they’re talking. If you need to, take a few seconds to compose your thoughts after they stop speaking."

Active listening doesn’t just involve hearing the words someone says—it also involves listening for tone, watching their facial expressions, and noting their stance. These can all give you a better understanding of what they’re actually saying. [16] X Research source According to Mindset and Action Coach Kirsten Parker, MFA, “The key to effective listening is presence, . . . [which] entails making eye contact, watching body language , and listening beyond someone’s words to hear their tone. You’ll start picking up on someone’s emotional state, and listening for what they mean (not just what they say).” For instance, are their arms crossed? Are their shoulders scrunched up? This may indicate they’re frustrated or uneasy, whereas if their posture is more open and loose, they’re likely more relaxed."

If someone tries to engage you in conversation while you’re otherwise busy or distracted, consider letting them know upfront that they might not get your full attention, and ask if it can wait. If you find your attention wandering during the conversation, instead of resorting to faking it, own up to the fact that you’re having trouble really listening and see if you can try talking later or change your environment if it’s too distracting."
