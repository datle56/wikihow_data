If your report finds no errors, or if there is information on your report you need to clarify, you have the option to write a 100 word statement to ChexSystems (200 if you live in Maine) that allows you to explain your situation. You can find the Consumer Statement Form on the same page as the Request for Consumer Reinvestigation Form. [1] X Research source . For example, if you noticed a bounced check on your form, but that check bounce was an accident, or if there is an overdraft that was accidental or a one-time occurrence, you can explain this to ChexSystems. Also, if you owe money to the bank and it listed on your ChexSystems report, but you have paid it, you can indicate this to ChexSystems in your statement and have it removed. Remember to be professional and businesslike in your statement. This statement will likely be seen by banks in the future, and you need calmly and factually state why you believe the information on the report is unfair and poorly represents you as a banking user. Do not include profanity, or the names of other businesses or people."

      "content": "Address the debts on your report. This step can be done before or after you contact ChexSystems to dispute, and is one of the most important things you can do to clear your record. If your ChexSystems report indicates you owe money to a bank, try your best to pay the owed balance off. Sometimes, the balance you owe may be a very manageable amount you forgot about, or that is within your ability to pay. If the owed amount is large and is outside of your current means to pay, contact your creditor. Creditors are extremely negotiable, and are often willing to accept a smaller amount back, rather than no amount at all. If you owe $1,000 and are only able to pay $700, contact your creditors and say you would like to make yourself right with the bank, and are able to pay $700."

[2] X Research source Many major banks do not have second chance checking accounts (although some do), but there are plenty of credit unions and community banks that do. If you are looking for institutions in your region that offer second chance checking accounts, NerdWallet.com offers an exhaustive list of providers by state.

Many credit unions will open an account for you if you can reasonably explain why you haven't paid a ChexSystems debt, and some credit unions will not pull a report on you even if you do have poor history."

Most businesses want your business, but if you don't look good on paper, they'll be wary. If you present yourself, in person, as someone who is decent, with an honest reason for your past performance and evidence that you're not liable to be a problem in the future, they'll be much more receptive to working with you. Make sure to clearly explain why you have had financial issues with previous checking accounts, what steps you have taken to rectify those issues, and why those issues are unlikely to happen in the future. If you went through a bout of unemployment for example, indicate this. Also indicate if you have taken any actions to pay back previously owed bank debt."

There are a few helpful tips that can reduce your odds of going into overdraft in the future. Monitor your accounts frequently. If you see your account balance approaching zero it is important to reduce spending you can easily control. If you have essential bills coming due, consider using your credit card or line of credit so your account does not go into overdraft. It is very important to note that using credit to pay bills should only be done in emergency situations. If you regularly are running out of money in your checking account and needing to rely on credit, it means that your expenses are exceeding your income. If this is the case, it is absolutely essential that you look at options to increase your income (if possible), and if not, that you reduce your expenses so they are equal to or less than your income."

Secondly, confirm that the money will remain in your account indefinitely until the check is cashed. Writing bad checks can easily get you listed in Chexsystems. Consider opening two checking accounts. One for your day-today transactions,and another specifically for check writing. When you need to write a check, transfer the amount into the checking-only account, and do not touch the money at all costs until the recipient cashes the check. Only write checks for amounts that you either currently have, or that you are 100% certain you will have. If you are writing a $100 check, and know you are getting paid $500 in the next week, do not write the check unless you are absolutely certain you can afford to use $100 of that $500 to cover the check."

      "content": "Create a Budget . Learning budgeting skills is an excellent way to ensure your expenses are within your income every month. There are plenty of resources available online to teach you how to make a budget. In addition, there is also software available that can be useful. Look for budgeting software like Mint. Mint, as just one example, allows you to sync your bank accounts with the software, and can closely track your expenses each month to ensure you stay within your income. When you create a budget, you will often need to reduce your expenses. When doing this, it is helpful to think of what you want versus what you need . Reducing wants can be an excellent way to find savings. For example, a cable package may be a want, but it is likely not a need especially if you already have internet. As another example, eating is certainly a need, but eating out once a week is a want and can likely be reduced to once a month (or even less frequently depending on your particular situation)."
