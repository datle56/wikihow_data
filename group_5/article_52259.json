If the clog persists, repeat the process (steps 1 through 4) and see if anything improves. [9] X Research source What if the clog doesn’t go away? Funnel ½ cup of borax into the drain, along with 2 c (470 mL) of boiling water. If you suspect that hair is causing the clog (like in a bathtub drain), use a hair snake to get rid of it. [10] X Research source When should you try vinegar and baking soda? Give this remedy a try whenever your drain starts to run slower than normal and the blockage is deep enough that you can't pull it out with your hands or a short tool. [11] X Research source"

Many people agree that the combined power of baking soda and vinegar can be an effective (and all-natural) way to get rid of clogs, but it isn’t 100% foolproof. The combo might not clear away the entire clog at first, so you may need to use multiple courses of baking soda, vinegar, and boiling water to get the results you’re looking for. [19] X Research source Baking soda and vinegar fall on opposite ends of the pH scale, with baking soda being basic and vinegar being acidic. When you combine the two, multiple chemical reactions occur, including one that produces carbon dioxide (hence the foamy bubbles). [20] X Research source The mix of baking soda and vinegar helps to eat through the clog. [21] X Research source"
