      "content": "Get all of the electronic parts that you need for the project. A water level indicator requires a few different electronic components to create a circuit. These components are simple and easy to find. You can purchase all of the parts that you need either at an electronics supply store or online. [1] X Research source A ULN2003 Integrated Circuit (IC) is necessary to complete this project. This is a tiny set of premade electronic circuits that are mounted on a flat piece of silicon. [2] X Research source You will also need 3 LEDs, which are used for indicating when the water level is low, moderate, and high. 1 buzzer is necessary to signal when the water level is high. 5 sensing wires are needed for measuring the water level. The length doesn't matter, as you will be cutting them to size later on. You can also solder sensing wires together if one is too short. A 9-volt battery and a battery connector are required to provide energy to the water level indicator."

These tools are easy to find and use, and you may even already have them at your school or home. You can purchase any tools that you don't have from home improvement stores or online. [3] X Research source Pliers are necessary for preparing the IC to add the LEDs. A soldering iron and solder are key for most electronics projects. This is how you will connect the circuit together. You will also need wire cutters to cut the sensing wires to size."

      "title": "Cut the 5 sensing wires to the different lengths you want to measure.",
      "content": "Cut the 5 sensing wires to the different lengths you want to measure. The length of the sensing wires that you need depends entirely on the different water levels that you are planning to measure. Use the wire cutters to cut 2 long wires of equal length. Then cut the remaining 3 wires progressively shorter. For example, the 2 longest wires could be 10 in (25 cm) each, and the remaining wires could be 8 in (20 cm), 6 in (15 cm), and 4 in (10 cm) respectively. [5] X Research source The shorter sensing wires measure higher water levels, while 1 of the longest wires measures the lowest water level. The other longest wire is for the buzzer, which signals when the water is at the highest level. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Solder the LED negative points to IC pins #12, #14, and #16. Hold the LED negative point on the pin and feed the solder to the tip of the soldering iron where the LED negative point and the pin meets. Repeat this process for each of the 3 LED lights to connect them to the IC. [7] X Research source The negative point on each LED is the short lead, while the positive point is the long lead. [8] X Research source Rest the IC flat in front of you to understand how the pins are numbered. There are 8 pins on each side and a notch at one end of the IC. With the notch toward the top, pin #1 is next to the notch on the left side and pin #8 is at the bottom left side. Pins #9 to #16 are counted up the opposite direction with pin #16 being next to the notch on the right side."

Use the soldering iron and solder to connect the buzzer's positive point to pin #10 first. Then attach the buzzer's negative point to pin #12. [10] X Research source Because pin #12 is already connected to an LED, you need to solder the negative point of the buzzer to the negative wire of the LED that is connected to pin #12. Even though the buzzer isn't attached directly onto pin #12, it still works because the wires are connected in a circuit. The negative point on the buzzer has a shorter lead than the positive point. This is the same as the LEDs. [11] X Research source"

Solder the 2 longest wires to pins #1 and #9. Then solder the second longest wire to pin #3, the second shortest wire to pin #5, and the shortest wire to pin #7. For the wire that attaches to pin #9, attach it between the buzzer and the IC pin. [13] X Research source This means that the LED that's connected to pin #16 lights up when the water level is low, the LED at pin #14 lights up when the water level is moderate, and the LED at pin #12 lights up when the water level is high. The buzzer will also indicate when the water level is high."

Watch as the LED with the longest wire indicates when the water level is lowest and how as the water level rises, the LED with the shortest wire shows when the water is at the highest point. Listen for the buzzer too when the water level reaches the highest point. [16] X Research source It's necessary for the buzzer to let you know when the water reaches the highest point, as this prevents it from overflowing and stops the water being wasted.
