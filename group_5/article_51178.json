      "title": "Find a baby-friendly movie theater.",
      "content": "Find a baby-friendly movie theater. Some theaters are more tolerant of babies than others, so choose your cinema carefully. Look for chains where children under a certain age get in free, since that means they have accommodations in place for young children. Avoid theaters with strict etiquette policies like the Alamo Drafthouse."

      "content": "Ask about stroller screenings. Many cinemas have special “stroller” or “mothers and babies” screenings to accommodate parents with young children. [1] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. These screenings may have the sound boosted to drown out crying or turned down to avoid harming the infants’ ears. Some theaters offer ticket or concession discounts for these showings, especially if they’re part of a special event or multi-week movie series. Most kid-focused screenings happen early in the morning and are designed to sell tickets during slow business hours. If you can, choose a screening that takes place when your baby is normally napping. [2] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021."

      "title": "Ask about theater daycare.",
      "content": "Ask about theater daycare. Some cinemas offer childcare services for parents who can’t find a sitter. Call ahead to see if your theater provides this. If they do, ask when the service is available, how much it costs, and if you need to make a reservation. Some theaters charge by the hour, while others charge a flat rate for each movie."

      "title": "See an appropriate film.",
      "content": "See an appropriate film. Though they won’t understand the story, some movies contain imagery or noises that can overwhelm a baby. Look for family films, animated movies, romantic comedies, and other genres known for bright, pleasant colors and relaxed sound design. Avoid horror films, action movies, and other genres known for frightening imagery or loud noises [3] X Expert Source Jessie Davidson Child Care Specialist Expert Interview. 11 June 2021. . [4] X Research source Raunchy jokes and offensive language are fine if your baby is too young to comprehend or repeat them, but avoid distressing imagery and creepy or unsettling sounds. When in doubt, consult a website like Kids-In-Mind or Common Sense Media, which offer comprehensive breakdowns of potentially troubling content in movies."

      "title": "Avoid 3D, 4D, and D-Box movies.",
      "content": "Avoid 3D, 4D, and D-Box movies. Look for a standard 2D screening of the movie you want to see. Movies with enhanced seat or environment effects may be fun, but they can make young children uncomfortable or queasy. Though 3D movies are considered safe for all ages when watched in moderation, they can make some kids sick or dizzy. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring a handheld baby carrier.",
      "content": "Bring a handheld baby carrier. Most handheld carriers are small and compact enough to fit in theater aisles. Look for a carrier with a hood or cover in case your baby wants to sleep or get away from the new environment. Avoid backpack or body carriers, as they allow children to look at other patrons and take them out of the experience. If you want to bring a stroller instead, make sure it folds down so you don’t block anybody’s view."

      "title": "Pack earmuffs and eye protection.",
      "content": "Pack earmuffs and eye protection. Some babies find bright lights, flashing images, or loud sounds difficult to deal with. To help them stay calm during loud films, bring a pair of earmuffs or baby-safe ear plugs. To help with light issues, bring a pair of infant sunglasses or an eye mask. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pack clean snacks.",
      "content": "Pack clean snacks. Snacks can keep a baby quiet and occupied, especially when they’re surrounded by so many delicious smells. Look for snacks that are easy to clean up, like cereal and fruit gummies, or things that can be drunk from a bottle or sippy cup, like milk and juice. Avoid goopy snacks like applesauce and yogurt, since they’re very messy and will be harder for the you to clean up. [7] X Research source Remember that the mess your child makes is something you ought to clean up, not the movie theater staff! There is a difference for them between sweeping up spilled popcorn and scrubbing yogurt off of seats. Be sure that you don't leave them undue labor."

      "title": "Pack a quiet toy.",
      "content": "Pack a quiet toy. A toy can help babies stay engaged and feel secure in new environments, but distracting ones can ruin a movie for other patrons. Stuffed animals and similar plush toys are great, quiet solutions, as are squishy teething toys. Avoid anything with multiple parts so you don’t lose part of the toy. Movie theater floors are not always clean, so bring baby-safe disinfectant wipes or spray in case a toy falls on the ground."

      "title": "Hold your baby at all times.",
      "content": "Hold your baby at all times. For their own safety, and out of consideration for other patrons, make sure your baby is in your arms or strapped to their carrier for the entire film. Because theaters are so dark, an unsecured baby could stumble down the stairs or fall though aisle borders, so keep an eye on them for the entire picture."

      "content": "Exit the theater if your baby starts crying. Should your baby start to cry, scream, or make other distracting noises, excuse yourself from the theater to deal with the situation. Once your baby is calm and quiet, feel free to return to the movie. To help scenarios like this go smoothly, look for an aisle seat near the theater entrance. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Change messy diapers immediately. Theaters are designed to keep light and sound inside, which means they also keep in smells. To avoid stinking up a movie, make sure to change any messy diapers as soon as they occur."

      "title": "Be kind to your fellow moviegoers.",
      "content": "Be kind to your fellow moviegoers. Everyone is at the cinema to have a good time, so be nice and try to accommodate those in the theater with you. A simple “I’m sorry” or “Thank you for understanding” can work wonders, even if your baby is making someone’s day particularly difficult. Some people get upset if they see a baby in a theater. If they start making negative or threatening comments toward you or your child, make sure to let the staff know."
