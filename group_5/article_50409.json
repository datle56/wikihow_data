If you’re organizing data on a computer, it may help to create a new file or folder for alphabetizing to avoid confusion. If you’re alphabetizing objects, such as records or books, remove them from their current placement so that you can more easily see the names"

      "content": "Compare the next letter in the words if the first letter is the same. For example, if the first two letters in one word are “Am” and the first to letters in the other word are “An”, then place “Am” before “An”. Continue comparing the next letter in the word if the words continue to have the same letters until you reach a difference in the letters, then place the word that has a letter that appears first in the alphabet before the other word. If you get to a point where there are no more letters to compare in one word to the other, the word with the shorter string of letters goes first in the alphabetical order. If the first words in two items are the same, look to the spelling of the next word to determine which one goes first."

If you’re alphabetizing books or documents, it’s easier to organize and search using the author’s last name. For example, “John W. Adams” would be listed as “Adams, John W.” and would go before “Adams, John B.”, which would go before “Adams, Lenny A.”"
