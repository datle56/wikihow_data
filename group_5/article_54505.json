      "content": "A set of press-on nails can cover tears and imperfections. If your nail falls off completely, don’t sweat it! Wipe off your nail polish and glue on artificial nails to hide that one nail is shorter than the other. This isn’t a permanent fix, but it can give you a longer manicure while you wait for your nail to grow. Help your fake nails last longer by gently pushing your cuticles back after you get out of the shower before you put on the nails. [4] X Research source Never cut your cuticles away, as this could cause an infection.

      "title": "For a temporary fix without glue, wrap clear tape around the break.",
      "content": "For a temporary fix without glue, wrap clear tape around the break. Use scissors to trim a small piece of clear tape the size of the break. Place the tape on the break with tweezers, and cut off any excess. Mold the tape around your nail using your fingers. [6] X Research source This temporary repair is perfect if you break your nail at work or in class and only have tape near you. Nail polish won’t adhere to the tape, so make sure you peel the tape off and try a more permanent fix for a long-lasting manicure."

      "content": "When all else fails, trim your other nails to match the broken nail’s length. Some nails are too far gone to fix, and that’s okay! Skip the glue and shorten your overall manicure by cutting or filing your nails so they’re all uniform. No one will be able to tell if one nail is broken. Opt for dark, muted, or neutral-colored nail polishes when you have short nails. Apply a strengthening base coat to protect your natural nail and help them grow.
