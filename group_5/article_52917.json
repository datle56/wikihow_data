It's still important to secure the PVC in place using a vise, to avoid letting it slip around and risk cutting yourself with a glancing swipe of the blade. Be extremely careful and take the necessary precautions in clamping the pipe into the place. [2] X Research source You could also use another type of work clamp to just secure the pipe into place on your workbench, rather than using a vise. Use what's available. Clamp it a few inches away from the cut to give yourself ample clearance. If possible, you can clamp on both sides of your cut, but having one clamp a few inches from the intended cut line will make it plenty secure."

There are two kinds of PVC pipe cutters: scissor style and ratcheting style. Scissor style pipe cutters are ideal for 1/2” to 1” PVC pipe, but are sometimes too difficult to use even for pipe that big. It's recommended instead that you use a ratcheting plastic pipe cutter, ideal for larger sized pipes and also effective for smaller. It's much safer and more reliable. The arm strength necessary to use scissor-style cutters is sometimes a little extreme, and it would be easier to just use a saw of some kind. Investing in a ratchet style cutter will make your job a whole lot easier."

      "content": "Consider using a miter box and saw for more specific cuts. A miter saw can be used for PVC projects that require many specific, detailed cuts. Use a tooth-count saw appropriate to the cutting job and the saws available. When in doubt, go with something like a standard 10 Tooth per-inch (TPI) wood blade, which comes with most miter saws. It'll depend on the particular brand and style of saw that you've got, though."
