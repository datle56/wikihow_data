Below \"Featured Designs\" you will see an alphabetical list of holidays or occasions that should vertically read \"Anniversary, Baby Shower, Baby's First Year, Bachelor Party\" and so on."

Fill in those fields first so that you can continue through the process if you do not know all the details yet. Fill in \"Phone Number,\" \"Location,\" \"Address,\" \"City,\" \"State,\" \"Zip\" and \"Message.\" For a close gathering like a dinner party, these details are essential. For an informal gathering at work, these details may not be necessary. Be sure to fill in the \"Message\" box. The template only tells the kind of event, while your message conveys a personal tone and lets people know if they need to bring anything. Click \"Next Step.\""
