      "content": "Choose a film that you both like, for the times when you are watching the film. Prior to the date, discuss the types of movies you both enjoy. If you haven't agreed on the film, you will get bored halfway through it, and lose interest. Try one of the many film review websites out there before you go. If the movie theater is likely to be crowded, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, it is better to get tickets ahead of time."

      "title": "Holding hands",
      "content": "Holding hands is a great way to feel close to one another, it makes you feel happy and it makes you feel special. If you are nervous or it is your first date, you could try putting your hand next to his -if he has his hand on the arm rest- then just shuffle your hand closer to his and you will end up holding hands."

Don't rushâ€” when the lights go dim, it doesn't mean that you have to grab your boyfriend and start making out right away! Before trying to go further, make sure that he is comfortable with you touching him."
