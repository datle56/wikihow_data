I am committed to Your covenant and promise, as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from the evil I have done. I acknowledge all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So, forgive me, for indeed, no one forgives sins but You.” Bangla translation: হে আল্লাহ! তুমি আমার পালনকর্তা। তুমি ব্যতীত কোন উপাস্য নেই। তুমি আমাকে সৃষ্টি করেছ। আমি তোমার দাস। আমি আমার সাধ্যমত তোমার নিকটে দেওয়া অঙ্গীকারে ও প্রতিশ্রুতিতে দৃঢ় আছি। আমি আমার কৃতকর্মের অনিষ্ট হ’তে তোমার নিকটে আশ্রয় প্রার্থনা করছি। আমি আমার উপরে তোমার দেওয়া অনুগ্রহকে স্বীকার করছি এবং আমি আমার গোনাহের স্বীকৃতি দিচ্ছি। অতএব তুমি আমাকে ক্ষমা কর। কেননা তুমি ব্যতীত পাপসমূহ ক্ষমা করার কেউ নেই’ You can recite the Sayyidul Istighfar du’a in English, or whatever language you’re comfortable speaking in—all that matters is that you recite it from the heart.
