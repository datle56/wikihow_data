      "content": "Hold down the fret closest to the body on the top string. The frets are the square or rectangular spaces on the neck. Hold down the fret that’s closest to where the neck and body of your guitar meet on the top string, otherwise known as the 6th string. [1] X Research source This fret is usually the 12th fret on classical guitars. Electric and acoustic guitars have longer necks."

      "content": "Hold down the first fret on the 6th string. Hold down the first fret with your other hand while continuing to hold down the fret closest to the body of the guitar. Doing this will allow you to see whether there is a gap between the strings and the neck of the guitar. [2] X Research source You can also hold down the first fret with a capo, which is a guitar tool used to hold down strings on the neck. Using a capo will make it easier to examine your guitar while holding down the strings."

      "title": "Look and feel for a gap between the string and neck.",
      "content": "Look and feel for a gap between the string and neck. Look at the string and the neck of the guitar. There should be a gap about the width of a business card between the frets on the string that you’re holding down. Use a free finger to push down one of the frets on the top string. If the strings move a lot and there is a large gap, your neck has too much relief and you should tighten the truss rod. If the string doesn’t move at all and is tight against the neck with no gap, you’ll need to loosen the truss rod. [3] X Research source The traditional setup is to have a very slight amount of curve in the neck, which is known as a concave bow."

      "title": "Remove the screws in the truss rod cover on the neck of the guitar.",
      "content": "Remove the screws in the truss rod cover on the neck of the guitar. The truss rod cover is typically on the top of the neck of your guitar, near the tuning knobs, and looks almond shaped. You must remove this plastic or wood covering before you can make adjustments to the truss rod itself. Insert a Phillips head screwdriver into the top of the cover and turn it counterclockwise to remove it. This will reveal the tip of the truss rod. [4] X Research source Once you remove the truss rod cover, you should see a hole with your truss rod in it."

      "title": "Tighten the truss rod nut if there is a large gap.",
      "content": "Tighten the truss rod nut if there is a large gap. Use the truss rod wrench that came with your guitar or purchase one at a guitar store or online. Fit the wrench around the end of the truss rod and turn it clockwise a quarter turn to tighten it. This will reduce the bend in the neck and bring the strings closer to the neck in between the frets you’re holding down. [5] X Research source If the gap between the strings and neck is too high, it will make it harder to play the guitar."

      "content": "Loosen the truss rod nut if there is no gap in the neck. Fit the truss rod wrench around the end of the truss rod and turn it counterclockwise a quarter of a turn to loosen the tension in the neck. This should bring your strings off the neck of the guitar and will give them some space. Keep in mind that there should be just a small amount of space between the strings and neck. [6] X Research source If your truss rod is too tight, it will cause the neck of your guitar to bow. This may cause buzzing noises as you play."

      "content": "Screw the truss rod cover back on and wait a day. It may take some time for the neck to adjust to the new truss rod settings. Don’t play the guitar for a day. Re-examine the guitar by holding down the fret closest to the body of the guitar and the first fret on the same string. The neck of the guitar should be slightly concave. [7] X Research source The strings should slightly come off the neck of the guitar."

Hold the flat end of a ruler against the neck and measure how high the strings are. [8] X Research source If the strings are further than 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in), (high action) you need to lower the bridge. If the string has a low action, or the strings are less than 1.6 millimetres (0.063 in) from the neck at the 12th fret, you’ll need to raise the bridge."

Insert the wrench into the corresponding hole of the string you want to adjust and turn it 2-3 rotations to raise or lower the bridge. If the string is too high, turn the Allen wrench clockwise to lower the bridge. If the string is too low, turn the Allen wrench counterclockwise. [9] X Research source"

Play each string while holding down the 12th fret. If the string buzzes when you strum it, it means that the string is too close to the frets. In this case, raise the bridge by turning the Allen wrench in the corresponding hole clockwise. If it's hard to push down the strings onto the neck, your strings may be too far from the frets. [10] X Research source The “action” or distance between the strings and the neck differs among guitar players, but 1.6 mm (0.063 in) is standard for most guitar players."
