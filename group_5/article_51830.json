To check the fluid, use the transmission fluid dipstick. Drive the vehicle until it is warmed up and has shifted through all of the gears, park it on a level surface, and shut it off. Remove the dipstick between 60 and 90 seconds after turning the engine off, and make sure the level is between the two marks."
