For example, if you were to use George Washington's birthday (2/22/1732), you would write it as 2221732. Each number will tell you how many letters over you’ll need to shift to read the original message. For example, if the letter D is in the encoded phrase and has the number 2 underneath it, this means you must move 2 letters forwards or backwards to get the letter from the decoded message. In this case, it would be either F or B. When making your cipher, be sure to decide on the direction you’ll be moving along the alphabet when encoding and decoding (forwards or backwards).

In this case, “tango” means “walk,” “restaurant” means “museum,” and “Roy” means “reading you loud and clear.” Message: About yesterday. I wanted to say, Roy .

[17] X Research source Different editions of books might use different page numbers. To ensure the right book is used as a key, include publication information, like edition, year published, and so on with your book key.
