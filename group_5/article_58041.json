      "content": "Put on safety gear before you start using the chainsaw. Put on chaps, a chainsaw helmet with a faceguard, gloves, and heavy-duty or steel-toed boots. Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes. Don’t wear loose clothing which can get caught in the teeth of the saw.

      "content": "Place the chainsaw flat on the ground and lock the chain brake. Lay the chainsaw on a flat spot on the ground and locate the chain brake, which is usually a lever between the top handle on the chainsaw and the blade. Push the chain saw brake forward until it locks into place to prevent the blade from spinning until you’re ready to use it.

      "content": "Turn on the choke and push the primer button 4-6 times. If your chainsaw has a choke, flip the control lever on the handle to the “choke” position. Then, locate the primer button, which is near or on top of the fuel tank. Press the button several times to prime the engine so it starts more easily. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your foot through the back handle and pull the starter rope 4-5 times. Use your foot to brace the chainsaw by stepping into the back handle. Place 1 hand on the front handle and lean your weight on it to hold it in place. With your other hand, pull the starter rope a few times until the engine starts. [4] X Research source You can’t cut with the saw until you unlock the chain brake."

      "content": "Flip the power switch on and press the trigger to get the chain moving. Starting an electric chainsaw is super simple. If your chainsaw has a cord, plug it into an outlet. If it doesn’t use a cord, make sure your chainsaw is fully charged. When you’re ready to use it, flip the power switch to the on position. All you need to do is release the chain brake and squeeze the trigger when you’re ready to saw! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Start up the chainsaw and lay the saw where you want to cut. Turn on your chainsaw and squeeze the trigger to fully engage the throttle and bring the blade up to speed. Gently lay the blade against the wood and allow the momentum of the chain and blade to cut through it. Don’t push or force the saw to cut through the wood. [6] X Research source Pushing against the wood could cause the chainsaw to kickback or the blade to get stuck."

      "title": "Hold the chainsaw firmly with both hands to prevent kickback.",
      "content": "Hold the chainsaw firmly with both hands to prevent kickback. Keep the chainsaw close to your body so your arms don’t get fatigued. While the blade cuts through the wood, keep a firm grip without applying pressure against the saw. Let the blade’s momentum draw the wood in and hold the chainsaw steady so it doesn’t jump or kickback toward you. Don’t adjust the chainsaw or change position while the engine is running and continue cutting until you cut through the wood. [7] X Research source"

Make sure there aren’t any other people near you and clear any obstacles away from the area. Never force or push the saw. Instead, simply lay the moving blade on the location you want to cut and let the wood draw the saw in as it cuts. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source It’s also important that you keep your chainsaw properly maintained. Clear away dirt and debris from the chainsaw’s teeth and make sure it has plenty of oil."

Don’t allow anyone younger than 16 use a chainsaw. Before someone uses a chainsaw, make sure they know how to operate it, and make sure they wear protective equipment.

Make sure you can easily move out of the way once the tree starts to fall. [10] X Research source If the tree is already leaning in 1 direction, cut it down so it falls that way."

Make 1 face cut about 24 inches (61 cm) from the ground, cutting up at a 45-degree angle to a depth of about 20-25% of the tree’s diameter. Then, make another face cut at a downward 45-degree angle to meet the first cut and create a notch in the tree.

Bring your chainsaw up to speed and cut into the backside of the trunk, on the opposite side of the notch you made. Keep the saw blade parallel to the ground and cut to a depth of about 10% of the diameter of the tree. The tree will slowly start to lean in the direction of the notch and then fall under its own weight. Move out of the way as the tree starts to fall.
