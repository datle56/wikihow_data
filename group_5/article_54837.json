      "title": "Grow plenty of grass.",
      "content": "Grow plenty of grass. Hay can be harvested from grass using a scythe. When you start a farm, you should have plenty of grass around. Let it grow as much as possible. If you don't have any grass on your farm, you can purchase Grass Starter from the General Store to start growing. It's recommended to leave some patches of grass around your farm at all times (excluding the Winter season). If there's at least one patch of grass, it will continue to grow and spread over time."

      "title": "Build a Silo.",
      "content": "Build a Silo. A Silo can be purchased from the Carpenter's Shop for 100g, 100 Stone, 10 Clay , and 5 Copper Bars. A Silo is used to store hay. When a scythe is used on tall grass, the Silo will automatically store the hay. One Silo can store up to 240 hay. If you have a lot of animals, consider building more than one Silo to keep them fed throughout Winter."

      "title": "Use a scythe on tall grass.",
      "content": "Use a scythe on tall grass. This is grass that is fully grown. Hay can't be harvested with any other tool. With each tile of grass cleared, there's a 50% chance of producing Hay. If you have a Golden Scythe, it increases to 75%. [1] X Research source You can also harvest Hay from planted and grown Wheat. However, this is not recommended as it's more expensive, less likely to produce, and doesn't automatically collect in the Silo. Be sure to cut all your grass before Winter begins; every crop will die during this season."

      "title": "Use the Hay.",
      "content": "Use the Hay. Hay is needed to feed the animals in the Coops and Barns. It's also needed for the Fodder Bundle in the Community Center . Go inside the Coop or Barn and interact with the Hopper. This will dispense the exact number of Hay needed for the animals within the building. If you have the Deluxe Barn or Deluxe Coop, the auto-feed system will automatically dispense Hay from the Silo onto the feeding bench."
