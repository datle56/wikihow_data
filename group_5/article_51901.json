Though it may seem relatively simple to perform, prostate exams require proper technique and the ability to understand what you are feeling for. Unless you’re a medical professional, you likely can’t accurately examine your own prostate.

This can lead to infection or other complications, which would require a trip to your doctor regardless. In addition, if your self exam is abnormal and you seek advice from your doctor, they will most likely repeat the exam to confirm the results anyway."

Your doctor will order a laboratory blood test to check your PSA levels (a specific protein found in your prostate) in the event of prostate abnormalities or urinary symptoms. Typically, a PSA level of 4 ng/mL or lower is considered normal. [17] X Research source PSA levels can cause false positive or false negative results. The United States Preventive Task Force advises against prostate screening with PSA levels alone due to these risks. [18] X Research source Ejaculation (recent sexual activity), prostate infection, digital rectal examination (DRE), and bike riding (due to pressure on the prostate) can cause elevations of PSA. Those without prostate symptoms and elevated PSA may require repeat testing after two days. Repeat elevated PSA levels may warrant a DRE and/or a biopsy of the prostate (a needle inserted to take a piece of the prostate tissue for analysis) if symptoms are present. Men with a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every two years. Get screened yearly if your PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher.
