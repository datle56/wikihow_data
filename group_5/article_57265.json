Make sure that the ring size of the binder you are getting is at least an inch and a half; it can be small because it won’t hold much. You can find some schools binders in the “school supplies” section. If you don’t know where that is, ask a member of the staff for help. Try to get a binder with Pokémon colors, like red and black, or red and white."

      "content": "First, get your Pokémon cards and put them into the Pokémon sheet pockets. Organize them in a way that sorts them by the type of card. Once you do that, open your Pokémon binder. Once your binder is opened, you will need to open rings in order to put your Pokémon card sheets in. To do this, pull the tabs on both sides of the inside of your binder. Once your rings are open, put your sheets filled with Pokémon cards inside the binder. Make sure you put the holes on your sheets in the rings. Then, close your rings by pushing the tabs inward. If done correctly, your sheets should stay in securely, and you are able to see all of your Pokémon. If you have more than one of the same Pokémon (which includes the name, HP, and attacks), then both them in the sheets pocket. This helps conserve space, just in case if you get more Pokémon cards binder."
