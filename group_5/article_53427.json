      "content": "Spray with texturizing spray or dry shampoo. If you have very fine, smooth hair (or if you showered recently), add a bit of texture so it has more “grab” to secure the braids. There are a few ways you can do this. Buy a texturizing spray or dry shampoo at your local pharmacy or beauty supply store to add a bit of grit to your locks. Spritz it all over your hair, and then run your fingers through it to distribute the product. You can also add extra texture to your hair by skipping your regular shower. Viking braids are not perfectly neat or sleek, and it's easiest to create this look in second (or third or fourth) day hair. The oils in your hair will give it a bit of natural hold and texture. Remember, this look is supposed to look a bit messy and rugged!"

      "content": "Section the top of your hair and clip it out of the way. You'll be creating multiple braids for this look, so sectioning out your hair is key. Hair Stylist & Master Braider Ndeye Anta Niang says, “Sectioning the hair helps if you have lots of hair that is not easily manageable.” First, gather the hair on the very top of your head. Put your fingers on either side of your forehead and then move them backward, scooping up all of the hair on the top of your head as you go. Clip this very top section up and out of the way with claw clips, duckbill clips, or any sort of hair clip that you have handy."

      "content": "Create two sections (an upper and lower) on each side of your head. You will create two braids on each side of your head, for a total of four. First, gather up all of your hair on one side of your head, starting at your hairline. Then, create a horizontal part extending back from your hairline, evenly splitting the side section of hair into an upper and lower section. Clip the upper section of hair out of the way and leave the lower section loose. Repeat these steps on the other side of your head. When you are finished, you will have five total sections along the top of your head: the top section, two upper-side sections, and two lower-side sections."

      "content": "Create a rope braid on the lower side sections. Starting on one side of your head, grip the loose-hanging lower section of hair and separate two small pieces to begin the rope braid . Twist each small section to make two small ropes. Cross the two ropes over and around each other. Still holding the roped hair, gather up a small piece of hair from each side of the head. Twist and add these pieces to the two ropes of hair. Holding tightly, cross them over each other again. [1] X Research source Continue to gather and twist small pieces from each side of the rope along the hairline around your ear. [2] X Research source Hold your hair taut as you work to keep the finished effect tight against your head, like a cornrow."

      "content": "When the rope braid is fully curled behind the ear, switch to a traditional 3-strand braid. Once you've created a tight rope braid against your head, switch from the rope braid to a 3-strand braid about 2 inches (5 cm) behind your ear. Divide the 2 sections at the end of the rope into 3 sections. Don't worry if it isn't a perfectly smooth transition because these braids are supposed to look imperfect. [3] X Research source Braid to the end of your hair, and then secure it with a clear hair elastic . Tease the tail of your braid so that the elastic is concealed and the end of the braid has a lot of volume and texture. Repeat this process on the lower side section on the other side of your head as well as both upper side sections. Note that the very top of your hair is still clipped up – this is just to finish the cornrow side braids. When you are done repeating the process, you will have 2 braids on either side.

      "content": "Slide two strands of each braid up the third to create a snake braid. For some added interest, turn 2 of these 3-strand braids into snake braids. To do this, untie the braid and firmly grasp the middle strand. Combine the 2 outer strands in your other hand. Push them upwards while holding the other piece taut. This will cause the plaits to slide up and bunch at the top, creating an intricate snake-like effect. [5] X Research source If you have more hair at the bottom of the snake braid, continue to plait a 3-strand braid. Then, push upward again to create a longer snake braid. [6] X Research source Tie your hair off at the bottom of the snake braid. If you make 2 snake braids on one side, twist them together for an even more intricate style. [7] X Research source Making snake braids is optional. If you want to leave your side braids as is, you certainly can. Pushing your braid up like this might create frizz, but that fits perfectly with the look of a Viking."

      "content": "French braid your hair to the crown. Once you've completed and tied off your side braids, it's time to work with the very top section of hair. Unclip it and smooth out any huge tangles with your fingers. Then, French braid your hair to the crown of your head by braiding and pulling hair from the sides. [8] X Research source It's okay if you aren't an expert at French braiding – the messier, the better. [9] X Research source If you have shorter hair, end the top braid in a small bun. In fact, the Vikings character Ragnar Lothbrok often rocks a version of the \"man bun\" at the end of his braid. Braid until you reach the ends of your hair or near the crown of your head. It’s up to you how far to go. The important thing is that the very top of your head is braided. Tie the braid off with a clear hair elastic."

      "content": "Tease the end of the braid for a messy, tousled finish. The finishing touch for this braid is backcombing the end, just like with the rest of your braids. After you've tied off the end, use a teasing comb to backcomb whatever hair is left. You can also carefully loosen or mess up your braid to give it a more tousled, authentically Viking look by gently tugging on the sides. If you ended the braid at the crown of your head, tease the hair directly under the hair elastic for a wild, messy look."

      "title": "Spray your Viking braids with hairspray to secure the style.",
      "content": "Spray your Viking braids with hairspray to secure the style. Once you've finished braiding, teasing, and securing your braids, spritz the entire hairstyle with hairspray . This helps hold all of your handiwork in place and make sure your braids last throughout the day. The beauty of this style, however, is that flyaways and loose pieces are welcome. Niang says, “Nordic braid styles are done usually with long natural hair. [They’re] made to last a short time and to appear loose and pretty.” It’s meant to look a bit messy, so don't worry about making sure everything is perfectly placed. If you’re worried about your braids lasting throughout the day, bring a comb and some extra hair ties along with you. You can always re-braid sections of your hair as needed!"
