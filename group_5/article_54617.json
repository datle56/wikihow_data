      "title": "Pick the color of your sailboat.",
      "content": "Pick the color of your sailboat. You will want a napkin that has a darker tone, like a brown, if you want to replicate the look of a sailboat. However, you can also use whatever color napkin you have. This would be the best time to also decide whether you want a double-sided napkin. Your napkin should be colored on both sides, rather than just the outside. Paper napkins are great for birthday parties, while cotton and linen napkins allow for a more professional look (hotels, restaurants, etc.)."

      "title": "Find a square napkin to use.",
      "content": "Find a square napkin to use. A 20X20 inch napkin is the ideal size for your sailboat. Naturally, the bigger the napkin the bigger the boat. Your napkin should not be too thick, otherwise you will not be able to fold it properly. If you cannot find a perfectly square napkin, try one that is as close to square as you can get it. This extra half an inch or so will even allow you to make the folds easier. [1] X Research source Another great option is to cut your napkin to a square size. However, you want to make sure to not leave any frayed edges when you do so. This is better for paper napkins, rather than nice family napkins used for holiday dinners."

      "title": "Lay your napkin flat on a surface.",
      "content": "Lay your napkin flat on a surface. First clean the surface with a duster and/or glass cleaner. This will prevent your napkin from becoming stained. You can put it on a table, a desk, or a nightstand. Do not lay it on soft surfaces otherwise it will be hard to make the folds."

      "title": "Use an iron on your napkin.",
      "content": "Use an iron on your napkin. This would be the best time to get out any excess wrinkles that might make your sailboat look bad. Only use an iron if you are using a cloth napkin. Do NOT iron a paper napkin. Use an iron on low, and gently press against the napkin. Make sure to get both sides."

    {
      "title": "Decide on your type of fold.",
      "content": "Decide on your type of fold. There are three different types of sailboat napkin folds: wind-drawn sailboat (upright), the stable sailboat (flat), and the party sailboat (upright). A wind-drawn sail is more for formal occasions like a dinner date. The stable sail can be used for any occasion, but typically formal. The party sail is mostly for festive, informal occasions. Check what event you are planning, and how each of the sailboats matches up."

      "title": "Fold your napkin downward in half.",
      "content": "Fold your napkin downward in half. Start with the napkin facing you in the square position. Make sure that your napkin is open and flat before you begin your fold. Apply pressure with your hand if you would like a more crisp look to your sailboat. A tight fold will also allow the use of more fabric in your sailboat. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold the top right corner downward. Make sure when you make this fold, the open edges are towards your body. Pull the corner all the way down until it is about one inch from the bottom edge. This should create a right angle. Apply pressure to the fold with your hand for a more crisp look.

      "title": "Fold the top left corner downward.",
      "content": "Fold the top left corner downward. Pull the corner from left to right. Make sure the edge lines up nice and smooth. Crease the fold with your hand. If the fabric becomes too thick to crease, use a heavy object like a paperweight to make the fold. If you prefer a more \"fluid\" sail, don't crease the fold. There should be 1/2-1 inch of excess fabric left at the bottom of your napkin, after you complete this fold."

      "content": "Lift the bottom flap upwards. You will want to make sure that you fold it upwards at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). This flap will form the boat in your sailboat. Adjust this fold upwards or downwards if you want a smaller or larger boat."

The flap away from the \"sail\" you want to separate away from the flap closest to the \"sail.\" Use your thumb and fold one of the flaps upwards. Take the other flap and fold it backwards. Smooth out the edges of the flaps and you now have a napkin wind-drawn sailboat."

If not, take the left edge of your square napkin, and fold it until the edge reaches the middle. Take the right edge, and fold it until the edge hits the middle. Crease both folds with your hands. After you have folded, open the napkin back up. You should have 4 sections. Cut off one of the outside sections and you are ready to begin."
