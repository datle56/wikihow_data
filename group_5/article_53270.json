Hold the strip up next to the color-coded chart and confirm what pH range you fall under. [2] X Research source Your vaginal pH won’t likely be above 4.5 if you have a yeast infection. If it is above 4.5, you might have an infection like bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or group B strep. [3] X Research source Some test kits provide a “symptom checker” sheet as well as a color-coded pH chart, which highlights the symptoms and average vaginal pH of common vaginal infections (like bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, group B strep, trichomoniasis, etc.). Use this sheet to cross-check your pH results with your symptoms."
