To completely close the platform , go to Steam > Exit . Just make sure Steam still isn't running in the background with Activity Monitor or Task Manager , then open Steam again. If this happens whenever Steam auto-starts whenever you turn on your computer, disable that feature so you manually open Steam. If you're using a Steam Deck, you'll need to restart your device instead. Press and hold the Power button for 4(LCD) or 7(OLED) seconds to prompt the restart."
