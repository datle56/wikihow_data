      "content": "You can never go wrong with a graphic tee. These have been a staple of geek culture for ages. There's no right or wrong—if it's a part of geekdom and it's on a T-shirt, go for it! If you're a Star Wars fan, try sporting the Death Star, Darth Vader, or Chewbacca. If you love retro gaming, you might go with Tetris, old-school Mario, or even a Rubik's cube. Shirts with a math equation, pi joke, or binary code could all work too. Try layering your T-shirt over one with a 3/4-length sleeve to add some extra interest to your look."

      "title": "Short-sleeved button-downs are especially nerdy.",
      "content": "Short-sleeved button-downs are especially nerdy. If you picture the quintessential 90s geek, they probably have a short-sleeved button-down with thick glasses and a pocket protector, right? To give this look a fresh update, go for a more fitted button-down and pair it with some geek-chic accessories. [1] X Research source A long-sleeve button-down or even a fitted polo can work with this look, as well. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Who knew geek-chic was so comfortable?",
      "content": "Who knew geek-chic was so comfortable? Argyle and striped sweaters are especially popular in geek-chic, but you can go with a solid sweater if you prefer. It's all in how you style it, so try layering it over a collared shirt and wearing it with a pair of cropped corduroys and loafers. You could even layer a cardigan or sport coat over the sweater. Sweater vests are an especially good option for layering so your look doesn't get too bulky. [3] X Research source Want to go for the ironic look? Sport an ugly Christmas sweater!

      "title": "A slouchy cardigan is the ultimate geek-chic layering piece.",
      "content": "A slouchy cardigan is the ultimate geek-chic layering piece. You'll be comfortable, warm, and stylish, which is a pretty winning combo. Even better, they're versatile—you can sport a cardigan whether you're wearing a T-shirt, button-down, or polo, and you can wear them somewhere casual or to the office. [5] X Research source For an even more casual option, wear a zip-up hoodie. Other outerwear options include bomber jackets, peacoats, and zip-up track jackets. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Brown and blue are especially good options.",
      "content": "Brown and blue are especially good options. Everybody loves a great suit, and it's no different in geek-chic culture. A subtle pinstripe or plaid pattern will help give off nerdy vibes, especially if you wear the suit with loafers, a sweater vest, and your ever-present glasses. [7] X Research source A sports coat is also a good option for dressing up if you don't want to go all the way to a suit."

    {
      "title": "Opt for a shorter cut if you have one.",
      "content": "Opt for a shorter cut if you have one. Once upon a time, geeks might have gotten picked on for wearing high-waters, but these days, ankle-length pants are super chic. Try buying your pants in a cropped length so they hit right at the ball of your ankle. Or, if you're wearing pants you already have, cuff them so they hit just a little above the tops of your shoes. [8] X Research source Jeans, corduroys, and cargo pants are all good choices for a geek-chic look. Regular jeans are fine, but if you can find brown or brightly-colored pants, it's even better!"

    {
      "title": "It's all about comfort with the footwear.",
      "content": "It's all about comfort with the footwear. Slip-ons, skate shoes, high-top Converse—you have plenty of options, so have fun with it! Don't be afraid of bold colors, although classic neutrals are fine as well. [9] X Research source For an extra-chic look, skip the socks. If you prefer socks, go with something loud—like colorful argyle or socks printed with your favorite Doctor Who. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Thick black glasses are a geek-chic staple.",
      "content": "Thick black glasses are a geek-chic staple. If you want to skip the glasses, that's fine, but you'll definitely have to work harder to give off geek-chic vibes. You don't have to actually need prescription lenses to wear them, though. In fact, you can wear glasses without lenses at all. [11] X Research source Don't like black-rimmed glasses? No problem! Round or wire-framed glasses can fit into this style as well. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Is there anything geekier?",
      "content": "Is there anything geekier? Bowties aren't just for college professors anymore. They'll take any button-down from chic to geek, in the very best way. [13] X Research source However, unless you're very sure you can pull it off, avoid wearing a bowtie with shorts. That's a little less chic and a lot more geek. You could also wear a skinny necktie instead of a bowtie, if you prefer."

      "title": "Clip-on suspenders are geeky but cute.",
      "content": "Clip-on suspenders are geeky but cute. You can wear them with just about anything, from a T-shirt and skinny jeans to your favorite suit. And when you add a bowtie and thick glasses, there will be no doubt that you're the king of the geekdom. [14] X Research source Don't want to wear suspenders? Wear a belt—printed belts and belts with a geeky buckle are especially great!"

      "content": "Geeks have always been on the cutting edge of science. So, it makes perfect sense that your geek-chic look would include the most modern of accessories. Maybe it's a pair of glasses fitted with the latest built-in camera. Or, maybe you're sporting a really gorgeous smart watch. Regardless, a few tech touches can take your geek-chic look to the next level. Bonus points if your watch displays the time in binary! [15] X Research source"

      "title": "You can find accessories to fit pretty much any interest.",
      "content": "You can find accessories to fit pretty much any interest. You could wear cufflinks that feature your favorite sci-fi character. You might sport a belt buckle with the Atari symbol. Or you might go with something more subtle, like jewelry made out of computer parts. There's no shortage of options, so find what really brings out your geeky side! [16] X Research source Messenger bags and undersized backpacks are nerdy ways to display patches or buttons that show off your interests."
