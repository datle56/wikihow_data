      "content": "Battery leaks can contain caustic chemicals that irritate the skin, lungs, and eyes. Automotive repair specialist Duston Maynes recommends wearing safety goggles , a face mask , and rubber , nitrile , or latex gloves before you handle the battery or the leaked material. Open all the windows and doors and use a fan to ensure the area is ventilated. [1] X Research source If you get battery acid on your skin or in your eyes, rinse the area in lukewarm, gently flowing water for at least 30 minutes. Under running water, remove all contaminated clothing and accessories. [2] X Research source Acid leaks, typically from a car battery, are much more dangerous than alkaline battery leaks."

      "content": "Most batteries for cars and other motor vehicles are lead-acid batteries. [3] X Research source Smaller batteries that slot into electric devices are more varied, so examine the label to find the type. The most common types for small batteries are alkaline, lithium, and nickel-cadmium (NiCd). [4] X Research source Size and shape alone are not reliable identification methods. If the only label is the voltage display (V), you can make an educated guess: [5] X Research source Nickel cadmium (NiCd): 1.20V or 1.25V. Alkaline batteries: 1.50V. Lead-acid batteries: 2 to 2.10V. Lithium-ion batteries: 3.60V to 3.70V or higher."

[10] X Research source Any electric device exposed to the leak is no longer safe to use. Throw the device away, and clean up spills with water and a soft cloth. If you have access to a lithium spill kit , neutralize the material with the absorbent material and neutralizing agent, put the absorbent into a sealable bag, and clean the area with water. [11] X Research source Alternatively, clean the area with an ammonia-based cleaner . [12] X Research source"

      "content": "These types of batteries leak a strong acid, which can eat through clothing, carpet, or even metal. Cover the area liberally with baking soda. The acid is neutralized when the baking soda stops fizzing. Absorb the leftover material with clay or kitty litter and shovel it all into a doubled trash bag. [13] X Trustworthy Source US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards Go to source If the battery is broken or damaged, sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda inside the double bag containing it. If there’s acid on surfaces around the battery, you may need to use a wire brush to scrub it off. Use an absorbent microfiber cloth to dry the area once the corrosion is gone. Make sure you have gloves and a face mask on before tackling one of these spills."

[14] X Research source Use a cotton swab dipped in 90 to 99% isopropyl alcohol to remove residue. Wipe the area with a microfiber cloth, then let the device dry for several hours. [15] X Research source Although the potassium hydroxide that leaks from alkaline batteries is often called “battery acid,” it’s actually a base on the pH scale, meaning it’s best neutralized with an acid. [16] X Research source Use a toothbrush or toothpick to scrape off lingering corrosion in the battery compartment and contacts. For heavy corrosion, use fine sandpaper, an emery board, or a small screwdriver to gently scrape off the residue. [17] X Research source"
