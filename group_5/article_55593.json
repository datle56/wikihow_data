However, just remember that squatting places a strain on bones and muscles, and if one of those bones or muscles is not able to support the dog's weight she is liable to collapse. This will discourage her from trying to urinate again, and she may lie in her bed and soil herself."

Alternatively, improvise with anything that is long and narrow, but if using a belt or similar, just be careful it doesn't dig into her skin or chaff in any way. [1] X Research source A simple sling can be made from a cotton shopper bag. Slit the side seams so that the bag lies out completely flat. The body of the bag forms the sling which you locate under the belly, then bring the handles together, one on either side, to hold them above her back to form a hoist."

This forms a loop with the dog supported in the 'U' of the loop. Slide the sling back so that it rests as far back towards her hips and knees as is comfortable for her. By holding the ends of the towel you can take the weight off her back legs if she's struggling to walk to a toilet spot.

To keep her as clean and comfortable as possible, make sure she is lying on a well-padded bed. VetBed is ideal, as it wicks moisture away from the dog, so if she has an accident the urine is absorbed away from her body. [6] X Research source Another alternative is to lie her on puppy training pads, as these absorb the urine and there is less of it to irritate her skin."

This may be necessary either to encourage a bed-bound dog to toilet at a convenient time so that you can clean up after, or if she has nerve damage that makes it difficult for her to pee. Never try to express a dog's bladder until you have been shown how to do this by a vet. This is because squeezing in the wrong place or applying too much pressure could cause serious damage such as rupturing an organ or bursting her bladder. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn how to express your dog's bladder. The idea behind the technique is to apply gentle pressure to the bladder so that the resistance from the valve that stops the bladder leaking urine is overcome. [9] X Expert Source Jennifer Damon Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 18 August 2021. The first skill to learn is locating the bladder. This is located at the back of her belly lying along the body wall. In small dogs feel for it with one hand, forming a 'C' shape with your thumb and fingers and placing them either side of the belly. With large dogs it takes two hands, one of either side of the body wall. Press gently inwards until you feel something that feels like a grapefruit. [10] X Research source Now squeeze evenly across the bladder, Avoid using your fingertips, as this puts a lot of pressure in localized spots. Instead use the flats of your fingers (small dogs) or your palms (large dogs). Apply ever increasing pressure until you see a stream of urine passing from the dog's vulva. [11] X Research source Never apply more than moderate pressure or the level of pressure as demonstrated by the vet. If you have to exert severe pressure the dog either doesn't need to go, you are in the wrong place, or the dog has a problem which renders her unable to pee. Immediately stop, and contact your vet for advice. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Manage your dog's pain. A female dog with a back, pelvic or limb injury will be in pain. This pain will discourage her from wanting to move around and may inhibit her from being able to squat to go to the bathroom. No animal should be knowing left in pain, so alongside the mobility issue it is important she has adequate pain relief administered. Your veterinarian should prescribe pain relief. If the level of pain relief is appropriate the female dog will be better able to move around, and either squat to urinate by herself or accept assistance to urinate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used, such as Metacam (meloxicam), Rimadyl (carprofen), Onsior (robenacoxib). There drugs have a high safety margin when given with food, but should never be given on an empty stomach, as they can cause gastric ulceration. [13] X Research source Plumbs veterinary drug handbook. Donald Plumb. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell Always follow the instructions and dose given by your veterinarian closely. If the dog does not eat, or has sickness or diarrhea, then do not give the medication. NSAIDs are most effective against mild to moderate pain. Broken bones are often extremely painful and so the dog may need a stronger painkiller. If the dog is already on a NSAID then another drug in combination often gives sufficient pain relief to help the dog be more mobile. A common addition is tramadol, as this is safe alongside an NSAID and give opioid strength pain relief. [14] X Research source Plumbs veterinary drug handbook. Donald Plumb. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell If the dog is in severe pain then she may be prescribed a fentanyl patch. Fentanyl patches are stuck onto the skin for slow release pain relief. They are most commonly used in veterinary hospitals, rather than in private homes. However, some vets will allow a pet home wearing one, under close supervision from clients they know and trust. Vigilance is crucial when using fentanyl patches, as the dog could potentially overdose if they chew and swallow a patch."
