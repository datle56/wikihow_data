Hold the bed sheet above either shoulder with the corresponding hand (left hand to left shoulder, right hand to right shoulder, etc.). [1] X Research source"

Ask a friend to help wrap the toga around you if you have difficulty keeping it up as you go. Alternately, wrap the toga snugly around your waist for a toga that exposes half of your chest. Ohayon-Crosby recommends this method for men wanting to wear a one-sided toga."

      "title": "Shorten the toga if necessary.",
      "content": "Shorten the toga if necessary. If the toga is too long, fold one edge over by about 6 inches (15 cm), and try again. Keep adjusting until you get the right length, which is around the knee area."

Pass it under the opposite arm and across your back, ending at the back of your shoulder on the same side where you’re holding the corner in the front. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Tie the corners of the bedsheet in a knot over your shoulder. Ohayon-Crosby says to bring the second corner of the sheet up over your back to the corner in your hand. Secure the two ends by tying them in a knot . For a more secure toga, use a brooch or pin. For another neck option, wrap the toga at your chest level from the back. Hold each corner an equal distance from your body, then cross them over each other and tie the ends behind your neck. Ohayon-Crosby recommends securing your toga at the waist to make sure it doesn’t fall. Use a couple of safety pins inside the toga if necessary.

      "content": "Wrap the sheet around your waist. Hold the corner of the sheet hip level at your left side, so it covers the front of your body and not the back. Wrap the sheet around your body until it overlaps the first corner by a few inches. [5] X Research source"

Fold the sheet lengthwise until it is the desired length of the final dress. [7] X Research source For a short toga, fold the sheet in half. For a longer toga, fold down only the top 6” to 1’."

      "content": "Join the front and back of the chiton with a pin at each shoulder. [8] X Research source Place the pins about 2 feet (60 cm) apart. This gives you enough room for the chiton to drape across your clavicle without falling off your shoulders. Buy fancy pins for the occasion or use safety pins."

You will probably need to overlap the open sides a bit before you secure the waist to ensure you don’t expose more skin than you’d like. If you’re concerned about the chiton gaping, whipstitch the edges together before putting it on. [9] X Research source"
