      "content": "Review the power rule for derivatives . The first rule you probably learned for finding derivatives is the power rule. This rule says that for a variable x {\\displaystyle x} raised to any exponent a {\\displaystyle a} , the derivative is as follows: [1] X Research source f ( x ) = x a {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{a}} f ′ ( x ) = a x a − 1 {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=ax^{a-1}} For example, review the following functions and their derivatives: If f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} , then f ′ ( x ) = 2 x {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=2x} If f ( x ) = 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=3x^{2}} , then f ′ ( x ) = 2 ∗ 3 x = 6 x {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=2*3x=6x} If f ( x ) = x 3 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}} , then f ′ ( x ) = 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=3x^{2}} If f ( x ) = 1 2 x 4 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {1}{2}}x^{4}} , then f ′ ( x ) = 4 ∗ 1 2 x 3 = 2 x 3 {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=4*{\\frac {1}{2}}x^{3}=2x^{3}}"

      "title": "Rewrite the square root as an exponent.",
      "content": "Rewrite the square root as an exponent. To find the derivative of a square root function, you need to remember that the square root of any number or variable can also be written as an exponent. The term below the square root (radical) sign is written as the base, and it is raised to the exponent of 1/2. Consider the following examples: [2] X Research source x = x 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}=x^{\\frac {1}{2}}} 4 = 4 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {4}}=4^{\\frac {1}{2}}} 3 x = ( 3 x ) 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {3x}}=(3x)^{\\frac {1}{2}}} Remember that square roots are the opposite of squaring because roots and exponents are opposites. For example, the four squared is 16. Therefore, the square root of 16 is four. So, if you are trying to get the square root of some number, see if the number is a perfect square. For example, if you have to find the square root of 81. Think whether you can multiply a number by itself to get 81. You know that nine times nine is 81. So nine squared is 81. That means the square root of 81 is nine. There are so many numbers that you could be guessing with this method. You can try out seven and eight. If it is too small, you can go up to nine. If you try out 10, 10 squared is 100. That is too large. You might have to go smaller."
