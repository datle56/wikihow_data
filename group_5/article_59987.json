      "content": "Take a shower to wet your skin and soften your hair. Before shaving, it’s important to clean your skin for a smooth, even shave. Hop into the shower and let the warm water run over your back to soften your hair and get it ready to shave. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you’re prone to ingrown hairs, exfoliate your back in the shower. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells that can clog razors and make for an uneven shave. If your back hair is very long, use an electric trimmer to trim the hair down before shaving. This can be a little tough to do on your own, so grab a friend to help you if you choose to do this optional step."

      "content": "Use a mirror to see what you’re doing. A mirror will help you see what areas you’ve missed and what you need to do next. Use a large mirror, and try to angle it so that you have a clear view of your back. If it’s possible, set up 2 mirrors: 1 in front of you and 1 behind you. [5] X Research source You can also use a handheld mirror to focus on 1 specific area of your back at a time."

      "content": "Go over your back at least twice. Depending on how thick and long your hair is, you may need to pass your razor over certain areas more than once. Keep reapplying shaving cream, and go over your back multiple times until there’s no more hair left. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Take special care when shaving around your spine and shoulder blades.

Pick a fragrance-free, mild lotion and smooth it onto your skin with your hands.

If you’re going to be heading outside with your shirt off, make sure you apply an SPF 30 or higher to protect from the sun. Skin is more sensitive right after shaving, so your back is more likely to get burned. [9] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If your back is prone to acne (or “backne”), apply an antiseptic aftershave that contains isopropyl alcohol.

      "title": "Get your back waxed for a long-lasting option.",
      "content": "Get your back waxed for a long-lasting option. Find a salon that offers body waxing, and go in for an appointment. Waxing is generally safer than shaving, because it tends to cause less skin irritation. It also lasts longer, and it shouldn't cost much more than $30. You won't need to shave your back every few days to keep the stubble down, and over time your back hair should even start to grow in thinner! Waxing removes hair from the root. If done well, a back wax may last as long as 6 weeks—much longer than any shave. Waxing can be uncomfortable, especially during your first time. However, a professional will know how to minimize pain and irritation."

This procedure is generally safe and painless, and can last for years depending on how thick your hair is. Contact a licensed dermatologist to see if laser hair removal is a good option for you. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The price of laser hair removal will depend on the particular salon and the hairiness of your back. As a general rule, however, you can expect the procedure to cost about $50-$100 per session, over as many as 10 sessions."
