      "content": "Get a smelter. Cracked Stone Bricks can only be made by smelting them in a smelter. You can't craft Cracked Stone Bricks via the crafting grid, so you must use a furnace, blast furnace, smoker, or campfire to smelt them. [1] X Research source Furnaces are obtained from weaponsmiths in plains, desert, or savanna villages. They also generate in houses in snowy tundra, taiga, and snowy taiga villages, as well as in ancient cities, trail ruins, and igloos. You can also craft one with 8 stone-tier blocks. Blast furnaces are obtained from armorers within villages, as well as in trail ruins. You can craft one with 5 Iron Ingots, 3 Smooth Stone, and 1 furnace. Smokers are obtained from butcher houses in villages. You can also craft one with 1 furnace and 4 of any of the following (can be mixed): log, stem, stripped log, stripped stem, wood, hyphae, stripped wood, and stripped hyphae. Campfires are found in taiga and snowy taiga villages, as well as inside ancient cities. You can craft one with 3 Sticks, 1 Charcoal, and 3 of any of the following (can be mixed): log, stem, stripped log, stripped stem, wood, hyphae, stripped wood, and stripped hyphae."

These blocks can be generated in strongholds, ocean ruins, igloo basements, ruined portals, and trail ruins. If you mine a cracked stone brick block with anything other than a pickaxe, the block won't drop anything. [3] X Research source Infested Cracked Stone Bricks must be mined with a Silk Touch weapon. Silk Touch is an enchantment for your tools that allows you to get the blocks themselves instead of their usual drop. You can obtain it from the following places: [4] X Research source Enchantment tables Books obtained by fishing Monster room chests Librarian villagers Structure loot (non-village) Certain mob drops in Bedrock Edition"
