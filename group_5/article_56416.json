      "content": "Select the needle size required for your project and yarn type. If you are using a knitting pattern, check the pattern for a needle size recommendation. If you are not using a pattern, you can check your yarn label for a needle size recommendation. This should appear as a number next to an image of knitting needles. [1] X Research source Needle sizes are the same for straight and circular needles, so if you are using a pattern that calls for a pair of US size 8 (5.0 mm) straight knitting needles, you could use US size 8 (5.0 mm) circular needles instead."

      "title": "Choose circular needles",
      "content": "Choose circular needles with a small cable. Circular knitting needles have a cable in between them and they come in many different lengths. Check the length of the cable of the circular needles before you buy them. You can also check your knitting pattern (if you are using one) to see what size is recommended. [2] X Research source For example, if you are knitting a hat and the finished circumference will be 20 in (51 cm), then you might go with a pair of 16 in (41 cm) circular needles. If the cable is too long for the item you want to knit, then you will not be able to complete the project properly. It will also make it much harder for the stitches to move around the cable."

      "content": "Get a set of double-pointed needles to increase or decrease. If you need to start or finish your project with a small circumference, such as for a hat, mittens, or sleeves, then you will need to use double-pointed needles along with circular needles. Choose a set of 5 double-pointed needles in the same size as the knitting needles you are using. [3] X Research source For example, if you are using a pair of US size 7 (4.5 mm) circular knitting needles, then use the same size double-pointed needles."

      "title": "Make a slipknot",
      "content": "Make a slipknot and slip it onto your right-hand needle. Loop your working yarn around your middle and index finger 2 times. Then, slip the first loop over the second loop. Pull the tail of your yarn to tighten the knot around the base of the loop. Then, slip the loop onto your right-hand needle. The slip knot will count as your first cast on stitch. For example, if you need to cast on 40 stitches for your project, then you will only need to cast on 39 more."

      "title": "Cast on",
      "content": "Cast on as you normally would. Hold 1 needle in each hand with the central cable hanging down in front of you. With the slipknot on your right-hand needle, loop the yarn around the left-hand needle, insert the right hand needle into it, yarn over again, and use the right-hand needle to pull the new yarn through the loop on the left-hand needle. Repeat this process until you have the desired number of cast on stitches. [4] X Research source Make sure to consult your pattern (if you are using a pattern) to determine how many stitches you need to cast on. If you want to do an invisible join, then cast on 1 additional stitch after you finish casting on the number of stitches you need for your project. For example, if you need to cast on 36 stitches, add 1 for a total of 37 stitches."

When knitting in the round or flat, the working yarn (yarn that you use to knit) should be on your right hand side. After casting on, the yarn might not be on this side. If not, then turn your work to position the working yarn on your right. [5] X Research source You will only have to do this 1 time when knitting in the round. For the rest of your rounds, the yarn will slide around the needles and always be on your right. If you are working in rows, then you will need to turn your work after each row to keep the working yarn on your right hand side. If you are left-handed and would prefer to have the yarn on your left, then position it this way instead."

Before you join the stitches when you are working in the round, place a stitch marker to indicate where the first and last stitches are. This will make it much easier for you to keep track of where you are at if you are using a pattern, or if you need to follow a different stitch sequence for each round. [6] X Research source If you do not have any stitch markers, get a piece of yarn in a different color than the yarn you are using and tie it around your right-hand needle between the first and last stitch."

Consult your knitting pattern (if you are using one) for any special instructions on joining the round. Then, continue knitting the round according to your pattern or as desired. To avoid a visible gap in your round from joining, cast on 1 additional stitch before turning your work. Then, turn your work and slip the first stitch onto your right hand needle. Slip the extra cast on stitch over the slipped stitch. Then, slip the stitch back to the left hand needle and continue knitting the round as usual. [7] X Research source"

To work rounds on circular needles, keep knitting in 1 direction going around the circle. You do not need to turn your work. To work rows on circular needles, knit back and forth across the rows and turn your work after each row. [8] X Research source Make sure to keep the stitch marker in place if you are working rounds. Move it from the left to right needle after each round to keep it in position."

Knitting in the round can be tricky, especially for the first few rounds since there is a risk of twisting the stitches. Make sure to check the direction of your stitches often as you work the first few rounds to ensure that they do not get twisted. [9] X Research source You might find it helpful to adjust the stitches after every 10 stitches or so to make sure they are straight."

When you are ready to transfer the stitches, begin your next round with the left-hand circular-needle in your left hand and a double-pointed needle in your right hand. Knit ¼ of the total number of stitches onto the double-pointed needle to transfer them then pick up a new double-pointed needle and work the next ¼ of the stitches onto the round. [10] X Research source Continue to work stitches onto the double-pointed needles until you have transferred all of them. Then, work the rest of your project on the double-pointed needles."

To do this, knit the first 2 stitches in the row or round. Then, use the left-hand needle to lift the first stitch you knit onto the right-hand needle up and over the second stitch. Then, knit 1 and lift the old stitch over this new stitch. [11] X Research source Repeat this until you have cast off all of the stitches in the row or round."

Tie a knot through the stitch and then cut the yarn about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the last stitch to secure it. If desired, you may also weave in the end of the yarn instead of cutting it. Insert the end of the yarn through the eye of a yarn needle and weave it in and out of the stitches along the edge of your project."
