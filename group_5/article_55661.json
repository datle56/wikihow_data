Some clinics accept questions in person, while others accept questions submitted online. The questions are typically answered by lawyers or paralegals. In many, but not all, cases the process is confidential. [7] X Trustworthy Source State of Indiana Official site for state-approved sources related to life in Indiana, including laws, services, and culture Go to source Self help clinics are good resources when you have a question or two about the process you need to undertake, or which forms to fill out. However, they are not a substitute for actually retaining a lawyer who can help with your case. To find a self help program, call your local courthouse or look online. If you find a program that accepts questions in person, arrive as early as you can to ensure that you are helped. Most of the programs held by courthouses focus on specific legal issues, so make sure that you attend the right program for help with your particular issue. For example, some courts might run a “domestic relations clinic” that can help you with matters like uncontested divorces and child support modifications. These programs may also help you find a low-cost lawyer if the program cannot legally represent you. District courts may hold programs that help with will planning, personal injury, landlord-tenant law, and debt collection. If the program is held at a civil court, it will not likely be able to help you in criminal issues."

It's important to call a hotline in your state of residence. The laws differ from state to state, so you might get the wrong advice if you call a hotline in another state. For example, many bar associations in Texas run a “Legal Line” on certain days of the week. These hotlines can help victims of domestic violence, people facing employment issues, and the elderly.

Lawyers are not required to provide a payment plan. When you first contact a lawyer , before you go to his or her office for an in-person meeting, ask whether the lawyer will consider accepting a payment plan. Make sure you know exactly what to expect before meeting in person Whether you end up wanting to retain the lawyer's services or not, you're likely to be charged for that first meeting unless the lawyer specifies a free initial consult.

However, if you are thinking of entering into a contingency fee arrangement, know that you may be responsible for expenses even if you do not owe fees. Make sure that you understand what expenses you may be responsible for upfront. For example, many attorneys will ask you to cover filing and service fees upfront. Most lawyers will take personal injury cases (injuries caused by careless drivers, property owners, or healthcare providers) on contingency. Contingency fee arrangements vary, but between 30-40% is common.

This means they’ll have more time to devote to your case. They may charge less because they are less in demand and have fewer years of experience. [13] X Research source Younger lawyers are also more likely to need to “make a name” for themselves. This means they are likely to spend a lot of energy to represent you as aggressively as they can. Be aware that younger attorneys are less experienced, and often have fewer resources to handle big cases. Ask your young lawyer how much experience he or she has handling cases like yours. Ask if he or she participated in a clinic, internship, or a volunteer lawyer project while in law school. These experiences will have given him or her experience and qualifications that equip him or her to handle your case."

Many lawyers may also accept barter services, such as web design or accounting, in exchange for their representation. [14] X Research source If you own your own business, you can offer the lawyer free services in exchange for their representation. You could even offer a stake in the business, if the case is very significant. You cannot pay with property or barter if the business or property is involved in the litigation you’re seeking help with. For example, if you and your spouse jointly own a business and you are seeking a divorce, you could not offer to pay your lawyer with services from that business because your spouse also has an interest in the business. Make sure to get any property or barter agreements in writing. Make the terms very clear. For example, if you are exchanging tax preparation services in exchange for legal representation, make clear how long you will provide your services (e.g., two years, three years, etc.)."

You should feel comfortable with your attorney, and interviewing him or her before hiring anyone will help you determine that. Ask about fees and payment upfront. If the attorney is not forthcoming or does not answer the questions to your satisfaction, look elsewhere. Ask who will do the work. It is useful to know whether the attorney you are interviewing will do most of the work. In some cases, junior attorneys and/or paralegals can handle much of the legal “legwork” for a cheaper rate. Ask if this is an option to help you save money. Ask about the attorney’s qualifications and experience. Ideally, the attorney should have some experience in handling matters similar to yours. At the very least, they should have the proper qualifications to handle your case, such as training in property or divorce law. [15] X Research source"

If your attorney does not answer these questions to your satisfaction, do not sign any agreement. Ask for further clarification, or find another attorney .
