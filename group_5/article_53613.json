      "title": "Think of an interesting subject that would look quite realistic.",
      "content": "Think of an interesting subject that would look quite realistic. Perhaps you would like to draw an animal. If you are not sure which animal to choose, you could look up animals in an encyclopedia, to get some ideas. Or maybe you would like to draw a fantasy character. Again, if you are at a loss for what to draw, read some fairy tales, as these are rich in suggestions. Go outside for a walk. Take your phone with you and imagine you're an insect crawling around the leaves. Take close-up images of the bugs and the twigs, leaves, flower petals and grass blades they're walking on and flying around. Remember to snap any textures you find appealing. You can then use these images as idea prompts for your art. For example, you can draw a portion of a plant or a flower, and using the photo as a reference guide, imagine yourself as an insect crawling around the shapes as you draw them."

      "title": "Be inspired.",
      "content": "Be inspired. If you don't have any ideas, look at other peopleâ€™s art for ideas. Look for things you might want to try, see what techniques they use, or just say, \"I can do that!\" Be inspired but don't copy. It's important that you develop your own style and draw deeply upon your imagination to develop your drawings."

      "title": "Start with using basic shapes then start adding more detail.",
      "content": "Start with using basic shapes then start adding more detail. Draw slowly and meditatively. This isn't a competition or a race. Take your time to see what develops."

    {
      "title": "Do a rough draft.",
      "content": "Do a rough draft. At first do your picture lightly with a pencil so you don't see the mistakes, and when you're happy with the picture, darken the lines or ink it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw every detail needed in your picture so you could see that it looks realistic.",
      "content": "Draw every detail needed in your picture so you could see that it looks realistic. If your subject is a clown, be sure to draw some eyes and ears that look clownish. If your subject is a toaster, look at a toaster and try to zero in on the essential details, so that you can draw them. You will probably want slots for the bread, and some controls for turning on the toaster."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch in an environment.",
      "content": "Sketch in an environment. Think about what your character or other subject would inhabit. For example, if your subject is a cow, you could draw a barn, or a field. If your subject is a space alien, draw a distant planet. If your subject is a box of cereal, draw the breakfast table, or the inside of a kitchen cupboard."
