Then, just slowly pour the hot water down your drain to rinse out any loose debris or residue that’s causing the smell. [1] X Research source If you don’t have the time to boil water, just run the hottest water from your tap down the drain for a few minutes to help loosen up smelly residue. Sometimes, hot water may be enough to break apart gunk that makes your drains smelly."

      "content": "Sprinkle ½ cup (114 g) of baking soda down the drain. Remove the cover or stopper from your drain if it has one. Pour the baking soda out slowly, and try to get as much of it as you can down the drain. The baking soda will cling to the gunk inside your drain to start neutralizing odors. [2] X Research source Kadi Dalude, a professional home cleaner, mentions that baking soda deodorizes your drain, but it also works great for clearing minor clogs . You can clean any stinky drain with vinegar and baking soda, so it’s perfect and safe for your kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower."

      "content": "Pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar down the drain. Slowly pour distilled white vinegar down your drain so it starts to bubble and fizz with the baking soda. Cover the drain with its stopper or place a towel over it to force the bubbles further down the pipe. The fizzing mixture will continue breaking apart debris and deodorize smelly drains even more. [3] X Research source If you want even more cleaning power, heat the vinegar on the stove until it’s just about boiling. The extra heat will loosen up stubborn residue so it rinses out easily."

      "content": "Wait at least 10 minutes for the cleaner to take effect. Give the baking soda and vinegar time to sit in the drain pipe so it can break up as much smelly debris and buildup as possible. Keep the drain covered for the entire time to prevent the smell or cleaner from coming back up. [4] X Research source If it’s been a while since you’ve cleaned your drain , leave the baking soda mixture in the drain overnight."

Let the water wash away any residual cleaner and gunk inside of the drain so it has a fresh scent. [5] X Research source If you still notice odors, try running baking soda and vinegar down your drain again. If the smell persists, you may need to do a more thorough cleaning."

      "content": "Clean out a sink drain trap if your drain is still clogged or smelly. A P-trap is a curved pipe connecting the drain to the pipes in your wall that prevents sewage gasses from entering your home. When a P-trap is dirty or dried out, you may still notice odors coming from your drain. [6] X Research source P-traps are typically right underneath a bathroom or kitchen sink, so they’re easy to access and clean on your own. P-traps for floor drains in tubs and showers are typically inaccessible inside your walls or under your floor. Try running an auger through your drain instead."

      "title": "Unscrew the P-trap from your sink’s drain.",
      "content": "Unscrew the P-trap from your sink’s drain. Locate the curved pipe directly underneath your drain and place a bucket underneath it. Find the 2 plastic or metal nuts on either end of the P-trap, and turn them counterclockwise with a wrench. Once it’s loose enough, slowly pull the P-trap off and empty any water inside of it into the bucket. [7] X Research source Make sure you don’t use your sink after disconnecting the P-trap. For added safety, turn off the sink’s water supply by twisting the valves on the wall clockwise."

      "content": "Scrub the P-trap with a nylon bottle brush and a paper towel. To clean your sink trap , push the brush through the pipe to clear out any clogs or grime causing the stinky drain. After using the brush, push a paper towel through the P-trap to pick up any grime still left inside. [8] X Research source If you don’t have a bottle brush, try straightening a wire hanger and using it to scrape out debris. Alternatively, take your P-trap outside and flush out the debris using a garden hose. Check the pipes connecting to your drain and wall for any smelly debris as well. If you notice any, wipe it out with a paper towel."

Keep the bucket under the pipe and run hot water down your drain for about 15 seconds. Check the pipe connections, and tighten them if any water leaks out. [9] X Research source After cleaning your P-trap, try pouring hot water down your drain or using baking soda and vinegar to neutralize any other residual odors. If you still notice unpleasant odors in your drain or if a clog forms, then you may need to use an auger to reach further down in your pipes."

If using baking soda and vinegar or cleaning your P-trap doesn’t work, then an auger may be able to reach the smelly residue. [10] X Research source Drain augers work well for removing clogs and smelly residue from any type of drain in your home."

Slowly push the auger down the drain line so it works around the curves in your pipes. Then, start cranking the auger’s handle until it doesn’t extend any further. [11] X Research source Avoid using a drain auger if you recently used any chemical cleaners because they could come back up the drain. Wear rubber gloves and safety glasses to protect yourself from splashes. If you need to reach further down a sink drain, remove the curved P-trap underneath the basin. Then, feed the auger into the pipe connected to your wall."

      "content": "Twist the auger to break apart and pull out blockages. Once the auger doesn’t move forward any more, twist the handle to rotate the auger head. The debris will either break apart and move out from your drain pipe, or it will catch on the auger head. Pull the auger back out from your drain to remove the clog. [12] X Research source Wipe the smelly residue off of the auger head with a paper towel as you pull it out from your drain."

If the water flows freely down the drain and you don’t notice any odors, then you successfully removed the clog. [13] X Research source If you still notice an odor or clog, try running the auger through your drain again to see if there’s any debris. According to cleaning guru Bridgett Price, you may need to run the auger through your drain 4 or 5 times to completely remove a large clog. If you can’t reach anything else with your auger, then it may be time to hire a professional plumber to find the source of the problem."

Let the solution sit for about 5 minutes before turning on cold water and running the disposal for a few seconds.
