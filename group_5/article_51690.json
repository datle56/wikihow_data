Look at the sticker label on the front of your user guide or on the back of the keypad assembly to find the default Programming Code. The Programming Code does not unlock or lock the door—it just allows you to enter and delete User Codes. [1] X Research source If you previously changed the Programming Code, the default code will not work. Use your custom Programming Code to manage your User Codes. If you can’t remember your custom Programming Code, perform a factory reset to restore the default code (this will also restore the default User Codes). The sticker labels also show the two default 4-digit User Codes your lock comes with."
