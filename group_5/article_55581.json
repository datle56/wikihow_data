In some cases, an overdose can cause a person to have a seizure, which can be doubly scary if you've never dealt with either situation before. However, the steps for dealing with someone's seizure are actually fairly simple in nature. Lower the person to the floor. Make sure the person is still breathing. Stay with the person. Especially since this person has just overdosed, do not leave them alone."

A common suggestion for those who have overdosed on drugs or are suffering from alcohol poisoning is to get the person into a shower and turn on the cold water, dousing them. Avoid doing this in any situation. The water temperature might put the body in shock and cause the person's body temperature to drop into dangerous levels - and it's pretty tough to drag a person in and out of a shower if they're incapacitated."
