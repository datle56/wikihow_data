      "title": "Identify where Rockruff can be found.",
      "content": "Identify where Rockruff can be found. It's found at the outside area of Ten Carat Hill, which is near your player's house. You need Tauros Charge to get there, which is obtained after beating the Melemele Island Grand Trial. You have a 20% chance of finding a Rockruff, which will be between level 10 and 13."

      "title": "Catch the Rockruff once you find it.",
      "content": "Catch the Rockruff once you find it. It shouldn't be too difficult for you to catch, as it has a relatively high catch rate. Some regular Pokéballs, or perhaps a Great Ball should do the trick. If you’re having difficulty catching it, try weakening its health to about half or less. If you’d like to attempt to catch Rockruff immediately when the battle starts, you can also use Quick Balls."

    {
      "title": "Have your Rockruff gain experience.",
      "content": "Have your Rockruff gain experience. Since Rockruff is a Rock-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Bug, Fire, Ice, and Flying-type Pokémon. For it to evolve, you'll have to train it during the daytime in Pokémon Sun, and during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon. Note, however, that Pokémon Moon's in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of the 3DS' clock, so be sure to keep track of the time if you're playing Pokémon Moon."

    {
      "title": "Have your Rockruff reach level 25.",
      "content": "Have your Rockruff reach level 25. Once your Rockruff reaches this level during the daytime in Pokémon Sun or during the nighttime in Pokémon Moon, it will evolve into either Midday Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Sun) or Midnight Form Lycanroc (if you're playing Pokémon Moon). Once again, remember that in Pokémon Moon, your in-game clock is 12 hours ahead of your 3DS clock."
