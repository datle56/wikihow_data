      "title": "They tell obvious lies with a straight face.",
      "content": "They tell obvious lies with a straight face. If you show them proof that they’re lying, they dismiss it or accuse you of making it up. If you call them a liar, they turn around and call you a liar. Or they insist they lied for a good reason, like to protect your feelings—or theirs. Whatever the case, they never admit to being in the wrong. If you believe someone in your life habitually lies to you, practice self-care by stepping back from the situation. Confide in your support network—friends, family, partners, a professional therapist, or all of the above. Unfortunately, confronting a habitual liar probably won’t change their behavior in the long term. Being lied to on a regular basis can be extremely disorienting. It can make it hard to trust a person and harms your mental health."

    {
      "title": "They deny lying, hurting your feelings, or doing anything wrong.",
      "content": "They deny lying, hurting your feelings, or doing anything wrong. They insist that you misunderstood them, that you’re remembering things incorrectly, or that you’re making things up to hurt them. They may even blame you for your reaction instead of taking responsibility: “I only called you fat because you let yourself go,” or “You’re just too sensitive! I never tease you.” [1] X Research source Stand firm and don’t let their denials cloud your thinking. You saw what you saw, heard what you heard, and you’re not remembering it wrong. And no matter what, you’re not responsible for someone else’s behavior. Denials can chip away at your sense of reality by making you doubt your own memories. This is extremely abusive behavior and a classic technique in gaslighting."

    {
      "title": "They’re always saying one thing, but doing another.",
      "content": "They’re always saying one thing, but doing another. They insist they support you, but always criticize your choices. They say they won’t be late, but they’re never on time. They make promises but never keep them. They’re nice to you at one moment and cruel in the next. [2] X Research source Believe your eyes and trust your judgment. If someone displays a pattern of behavior, trust the pattern over anything that person says. [3] X Research source Gaslighters use words to disguise or erase bad behaviors, and make others see them in a better light. Don’t fall for it."
    },
    {
      "title": "They get angry or dismissive if you complain about their behavior.",
      "content": "They get angry or dismissive if you complain about their behavior. They take criticism as a personal attack, no matter how gentle, respectful, or irate you become. They claim you’re overreacting or being selfish. They accuse you of lying or exaggerating. Or they dismiss you and refuse to listen, as if to say, “I am who I am. Take it or leave it.” [4] X Research source Don’t back down if you feel your criticism is fair, even if the gaslighter refuses to change. Constructive criticism is important for healthy relationships, especially in professional settings where bosses and colleagues provide feedback on each other’s work. It’s also important in friendships, family relationships, and between romantic partners. Being open to feedback allows us to learn from our mistakes and treat people better. By rejecting all criticism or attacking you for giving it, gaslighters make healthy relationships impossible."

      "title": "They shower you with positive attention, only to you hurt again later.",
      "content": "They shower you with positive attention, only to you hurt again later. They might compliment or encourage you, unexpectedly. Or if they’re a romantic partner, they might buy you gifts and give you extra kisses. The sudden change makes you think “This person isn’t all bad, right?” But eventually, the mask comes off and they hurt your feelings all over again. Remember that kindness should be the norm in a relationship, not the exception. Gaslighters may use kindness and affection to make you overlook their bad behaviors, but this is still abuse. Positive attention can be a form of abuse when it’s withheld or only given conditionally. For instance, a gaslighting person may behave cruelly when you get upset with them, only to “reward” you with kindness when you accept their lies and bad behavior."

      "title": "They use gaslighting to drive a wedge between you and others.",
      "content": "They use gaslighting to drive a wedge between you and others. For instance, if the gaslighter is a friend or romantic partner, they might mock your friends and family to discourage you from seeing them. If they’re a coworker or boss, they might undermine your confidence by claiming that other colleagues don’t like you. [5] X Research source This makes it hard to maintain relationships and form new connections with people. In romantic relationships, a partner may gaslight you into pulling away from other people, until your partner is the only person you’re close to. [6] X Research source Stay in touch with friends, family, and other colleagues. Treat these relationships as separate from the person who is gaslighting you. Contact your company’s HR department or reach out to a trusted colleague if someone is gaslighting you at work. If you don’t have someone to talk to, consider seeing a therapist . They can provide an outside perspective and help you recognize gaslighting behaviors. They can also help you decide whether to confront the person who’s gaslighting you, or pull back from the relationship in some way."

      "title": "They target your insecurities to make you feel weak.",
      "content": "They target your insecurities to make you feel weak. If you struggle with body image, they may comment on your weight or appearance. If you often worry about falling behind at work, they might drop hints that you’re a slow worker. [7] X Research source They know your emotional vulnerabilities and use them against you. [8] X Research source Remind yourself that you deserve to be respected and supported by the people in your life. Your insecurities are not “fair game” for others to use against you. For romantic relationships, consider seeing a couple’s therapist. They can help you and your partner solve disagreements in a healthier way. For instance, they may help your partner express frustration without resorting to personal attacks. Understand that counseling doesn’t always work to prevent gaslighting in romantic relationships."

      "title": "They spread rumors and speak poorly about you.",
      "content": "They spread rumors and speak poorly about you. They make false accusations about you online or in face-to-face conversations. They try to make you look like a bad person, and make themself look like a good person or victim in the process. This puts you on the defensive and makes people doubt your integrity. [9] X Research source Stand up for yourself if you feel safe doing so. Your reputation and personal relationships matter greatly, and no one has a right to attack your reputation for personal gain. Gaslighters can be extremely charming and manipulative, and others may be inclined to believe them."

      "title": "Their abuse makes it hard to tell what’s real and what’s not.",
      "content": "Their abuse makes it hard to tell what’s real and what’s not. You start to wonder, what if you really are making it all up? What if you are overreacting? But if so, where did all these memories and feelings come from? This inner conflict leaves you torn, confused, and questioning your own reality. [10] X Research source Remember that you’re not crazy, end of story. Trust your observations, memories, and feelings, and defend yourself accordingly. Consider keeping a journal to record experiences and feelings as they happen. Go back and read through it to remind yourself of what really happened, especially if you’re doubting yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "You learn to stop arguing or defending yourself.",
      "content": "You learn to stop arguing or defending yourself. You wonder, what’s the point if they never listen or admit they’re wrong? Over time, your relationship with this person becomes completely one-sided. Your feelings and opinions always come second. This can leave you feeling extremely defeated and depressed. [11] X Research source Consider ending or pulling back on the relationship if you want to, especially if the gaslighter is unwilling to change their behavior. “Ending” or “pulling back” can mean breaking up, finding a new job, or minimizing contact with a toxic family member or friend, depending on the type of relationship. Talk to a therapist if you have doubts or aren’t sure how to move forward. They can help you reach a decision that feels right for you. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, counselor, or neighbor if you want to end an abusive romantic relationship but are concerned for your safety."
