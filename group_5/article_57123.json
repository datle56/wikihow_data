Are you hoping to make a throw blanket or something large enough to cover your entire bed? Pick the blanket size and dimensions that make the most sense for you and your needs. [2] X Research source Throw blanket: 50 by 60 in (130 by 150 cm) Twin bed: 65 to 66 by 90 in (170 to 170 by 230 cm) Full bed: 80 to 85 by 90 in (200 to 220 by 230 cm) Queen bed: 90 by 90 to 100 in (230 by 230 to 250 cm) King bed: 108 by 90 to 100 in (270 by 230 to 250 cm) California king bed: 104 by 108 in (260 by 270 cm)"

      "content": "Add 4 in (10 cm) to the dimensions for your blanket. You’ll essentially be stitching a grid-style pattern onto your blanket (with each square stuffed with pellets), so it’s important to factor in a little extra fabric to ensure your weighted blanket is the right size. Adding 4 in (10 cm) to both the length and width helps accommodate this. [3] X Research source If you were making a weighted blanket to cover a twin bed, for example, your new dimensions would be 69 to 70 by 94 in (180 to 180 by 240 cm)."

Ask for 2 larges pieces of this fabric to be cut in the dimensions of your blanket. You can also order the fabric online and cut out the measurements yourself. [4] X Research source To change things up, get your sheets of fabric in different colors and patterns. Pro tip: Some sewing enthusiasts find materials like cotton and flannel to be super easy and smooth to stitch, so stick with those types of fabrics if you don’t have a lot of experience with a sewing machine .

When cut out, your batting should be the same size as the cotton or flannel portions of your blanket. [6] X Research source Batting is a thick and soft material that gives your fabric a little cushioning. It’s commonly used in quilting. Be sure to get batting that roughly matches your blanket’s dimensions. For example, if you were making a queen-sized weighted blanket, you’d want to use queen-sized batting ."

Most weighted blanket sellers suggest getting a blanket that’s about 10% of your total body weight, so use that formula when calculating how many poly-pellets (in lb/kg) you’ll need for your own blanket. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Let’s say you weight about 140 lb (64 kg)—in that case, you’d want about 14 lb (6.4 kg) of poly-pellets to evenly stuff your blanket with. Make sure to choose machine-washable poly-pellets so you can easily clean your blanket. If you’re making a weighted blanket for someone else, estimate what their weight is and calculate your poly-pellet weight based on that."

Continue to stitch along the short end of the blanket, followed by the other long end. Leave the second short end open, since you’ll be using that to stuff your blanket. Use the default stitch setting on your sewing machine for this—you don’t need to set it to anything specific. You should now have a basic structure for your blanket, with the batting and fabric securely stitched together. Consider using a denim sewing machine needle , which is designed to handle tougher material. [12] X Research source"
