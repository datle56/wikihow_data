      "content": "Obtain the right apples. The best cider has a balance between sweetness and tartness. Often times, apple producers (who will often make their own brand of cider) will blend different apples together to get the right combination. Finding \"your\" blend is just a matter of experimentation, and experimenting will be a delicious endeavor! Here are some basic characteristics of common apple varieties: [1] X Research source Red Delicious : Large, firm red apple with a sweet flavor. Yellow Delicious : Large, firm yellow apple with a sweet flavor. Jonathon : Medium, crisp semi-tart apple, with red near the top, descending to green lower down the fruit. Granny Smith : Medium/small, crisp, tart apple with green color. Gala : Medium, crisp semi-tart apple with yellow skin blushed with orange to red tinge."

      "content": "Choose apples from the above list. Shop the local produce stands, fruit markets or grocery store shelves. If you lean toward a sweet juice, use a ratio of three sweet to one tart, or for medium sweetness, use a \"two sweet to one tart\" ratio. If you intend to make hard cider, use all sweet apples. It takes about one third of a bushel to make one gallon of cider."

This will ensure that your yeast is alive and ready to go, and will let you control the final flavor of your brew. [4] X Research source In a sealable jar, add one yeast packet to a half cup of your fresh apple cider. Seal the jar, give it a good shaking for five to ten seconds, then set it aside for five or six hours, or overnight. When you see it bubbling, release the pressure by partially twisting off the lid, then resealing the jar. Put the start in the refrigerator until a couple hours before you're ready to use it."

Continue simmering for about 45 minutes to an hour, to kill off any bacteria or wild yeasts that could alter the flavor of your cider. Do not boil the cider Add up to two pounds of brown sugar or honey to boost the sugar content, and make a harder hard cider!"

After a couple days, you should see the airlock start to bubble, as the yeast releases carbon dioxide. It should continue to bubble for a couple weeks. When it stops, let the cider rest for another week so that the yeast settles. [5] X Research source"
