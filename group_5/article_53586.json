      "content": "Remove the plastic cover that is over the fuel lines. This needs to be done in order to make it easier to access the fuel lines. This should be fairly easy to do; there are generally a couple of large bolts holding the cover in place. (See the video below for example of a cover that is on the 6800 Watt Ridgid Generator.) You will need a wrench or socket wrenches to remove the cover."

      "title": "Push the fuel valve through the cover.",
      "content": "Push the fuel valve through the cover. Move the cover out of the way. Make sure that the fuel valve is set to off . This is so that the fuel valve is closed when you remove one side of the line in the next step."

      "content": "Pinch and remove the aluminum clip off the side of the fuel line that does not connect to the gas tank. Have a rag close by to catch a little gas that is left in the tube you are removing (the tube that runs to the carburetor). Then remove the tube from the fuel valve. You may need to use pliers the first time because it's sealed fairly tightly. Do not disconnect the line that runs to the gas tank, or gas will pour everywhere."

      "title": "Put the fuel valve tube into a collection container large enough to hold all the gas in the tank.",
      "content": "Put the fuel valve tube into a collection container large enough to hold all the gas in the tank. This will generally be about 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L). You can use a gas can so that you can put the gas into your car so it doesn't go to waste (see the video for an example)."

      "title": "Turn the fuel valve to on.",
      "content": "Turn the fuel valve to on. Let all of the gas drain out into the container until no more comes out. Once you're done, reconnect the fuel line and replace the cover."
