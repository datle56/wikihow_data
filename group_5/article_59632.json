If you plan to refinish an entire house or regularly repaint metal or wood outdoor projects, you may choose to buy a sandblasting cabinet. Otherwise, hardware and home improvement stores rent sandblasters for small projects. Make sure you leave the rental store with an air compressor, a blasting gun, blasting media and a blasting bucket. You may also want to pick up sheets of sandpaper and wood filler. Ask the clerk what materials will be best for your project."
