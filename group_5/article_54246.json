      "content": "Resolve your issue without court intervention. Usually, people do not want to go to court, therefore, many people attempt to resolve any disputes they have with each other outside of court. Even if someone has wronged you, it may be better to try and work it out with them before filing a lawsuit. For example, if someone owes you money, you should ask the person for the money repeatedly before suing them for it and consider setting up a payment plan with them if they are having financial difficulty. If the payment plan works out, you will likely get the money that is owed to you must faster than if you sued for it. Lawsuits can be time-consuming and very expensive to get involved in, so you should try anything you can to work out your issue, and only file a lawsuit as a last resort."

If you do not have a valid legal claim, any lawsuit you bring will be dismissed by the court, and you will have wasted time and money. For example, if someone “promised” to give you $100 as a gift, you legally would not be able to sue them for the $100 if they didn’t give it to you, because the court will not force someone to give something for free. Similarly, if you are involved in a car accident with someone, but you were not injured and your car was not damaged, you will not have a valid claim because you do not have any damages, even if you know that the accident was not your fault."

To determine whether you have a strong case, consider the following: [4] X Research source Represent Yourself in Court: How to Prepare and Try a Winning Case, Paul Bergman &amp; Sara Berman, chapter 3 Whether you have evidence: you should consider whether you can prove what happened in a court of law. For example, if you need witnesses, were any present, and will they be able to testify at trial? If you need papers or documents to support your claim, do you have them, or can you get them before the trial? Whether your opponent has a convincing story: you should consider whether or not your opponent has a convincing story that conflicts with yours. If so, you should consider how you will convince the court that your story is better. Whether you can prove the legal elements: you need to know the elements or facts that you legally must prove to win your case. For example, in a “breach of contract” lawsuit, you must have enough evidence to prove that there was a valid contract. Without proving the existence of a contract, you cannot show that there was a “breach.” Whether you can collect money from your opponent: you need to know whether or not you will be able to collect a judgment if you win your lawsuit. It will not be worth the money and time it takes to bring a lawsuit if your opponent doesn’t have any money or assets, because you will not be able to collect anything, even if you win. However, if money is no object, you may want to consider a lawsuit anyway in order to get validation that your opponent was wrong. Who could be responsible: before filing a lawsuit, you should think of all of the possible parties that could be legally responsible for your harm. For example, if you were involved in an accident with a truck driver, you may consider suing not only the truck driver who struck you, but also his employer, if he was working at the time of the accident."

For example, one state may allow a plaintiff who wants to file a personal injury suit 1 year from the date of the injury, while another state may allow 4 years from the date of the injury. As a good rule of thumb, you will be okay if you file your lawsuit within a year from the date of the harm, no matter what type of claim you have or what state you live in."

Choose an attorney who has experience and strong knowledge of the law, and who you think that you would get along with and like working with. If the attorney makes you uncomfortable in any way or seems dismissive of your case or your situation, you should choose someone different to represent you. To find an attorney near you, consider talking to friends and family members who have used an attorney before. Find out who they hired, for what type of service, and if they would recommend the attorney. You can also find an attorney by checking online reviews. Many websites offer free reviews of businesses.

You must file your lawsuit in a court that has jurisdiction over your case. Generally, you should file a case that deals with a state law in state court. The majority of cases, including personal injury cases, landlord-tenant cases, breach of contract, divorce, and probate matters, a state law claims. There are a few types of cases that should be filed in “federal court” instead of state court. If your case is based on a federal law, you can sue in federal court.

This is because the rules of procedure require that you provide a defendant notice of the lawsuit and give him or her an opportunity to respond. Most states allow you to serve a defendant by mail, or by personal service, through the County Sheriff or a process server. Some things to consider when deciding where and how to serve the defendant: Your state may require personal service of the initial Complaint: if personal service is required, you will need to have the County Sheriff or a process server serve the defendant. When serving via the County Sheriff, the Clerk’s Office and/or the Court will take care of making the arrangements. Personal service may or may not be offered by your County Sheriff’s Department. If the Sheriff offers personal service, there may be a fee. Call the County Clerk or the Sheriff’s Office to determine if process service is offered, and what the fee is. Your state may require a signature from an appropriate person when serving the defendant. Check with your state’s Rules of Procedure for service or with an attorney in order to determine if the process server may leave a copy of the Complaint at the defendant’s home or work, or if a signature is required. If allowed for the initial Complaint and Summons, service by mail is usually sufficient and reliable, and is usually less expensive. However, if you have any reason to believe the Defendant may attempt to hide from service, it may be best to pay for personal service."

Essentially, this type of motion argues that there are no issues of the facts, so the case can be decided by the judge on the basis of the law only. Discuss the possibility of a motion for summary judgment with your attorney.

In fact, most cases actually “settle,” or a worked out, before trial. Settling with the opposing party is a good idea for many reasons including: Settling will save you time: trials are often long and drawn out, therefore, settling now means that as a plaintiff, you will receive money sooner rather than later. Settling is easier than trial: as someone representing yourself, going all the way through the trial can be stressful due to the complex and unfamiliar nature of the legal system, settling will save you from having to navigate all the way through a trial on your own. Settling insures you agree to the outcome of the case: if you end up going to trial, you really have no idea how the judge or jury will decide your case. Additionally, sometimes, even if you should win, you don’t (or you don’t win nearly as much money as you are entitled to). Because settling a case means that the case doesn’t have to go all the way through the legal system, judges often encourage parties to settle cases as well, and sometimes provides help to parties who want to try and work it out. Ask the clerk in the court where you filed your lawsuit whether there are any resources available to parties who want to settle."

Mediation is an “alternative dispute resolution” technique where a third party “neutral mediator” (that is, someone who is not on your side, or your opponent’s side), yourself and your opponent discuss the case and try to come to an agreement on a settlement. The mediator is there to help the parties discuss the issues without getting angry or frustrated with each other. Many states offer low-cost programs that supply mediators for various types of cases, including landlord-tenant disputes, divorce cases, and disputes between neighbors. To prepare for a mediation session, do the following: Think about what outcomes would be acceptable to you: think about what you want from your opponent, and don’t limit yourself to asking for money. For example, many people want an apology from the person who they think wronged them. Prepare to show the mediator the evidence that supports your claim. This will allow the mediator to get an idea of whose side of the case is “better,” and, even though the mediator cannot force you or your opponent to accept a settlement, they may be able to discuss the chances each party would have at trial. Remember that the goal of mediation is come up with a settlement that works for both parties. Don’t go into mediation with a mindset that you have to “win” or “punish” your opponent. Instead, you should be prepared to work collaboratively with the mediator and your opponent to come up with a creative solution to your issues."

In an arbitration proceeding, you and your opponent present oral testimony, documents, and other evidence to a neutral third party (the arbitrator) who then makes a decision based on both sides' case, usually called an “award.” Unlike mediation, an arbitrator’s award is binding on the parties, so whatever the arbitrator decides goes.

You will also have the opportunity to ask questions of your opponent’s witnesses (this is called cross-examination). To prepare for calling and examining your witnesses, make sure that they all agree to be present at the trial. For direct examination, you should prepare a notebook with an outline of what you want to ask the witnesses. Ask questions that will encourage the witnesses to talk, instead of “yes” and “no” questions. To get comfortable with questioning witnesses, you can meet with them to practice beforehand. For cross-examination, realize that you probably won’t get that much useful information, and limit or completely forgo examining the opposing witnesses. Only cross-examine the opposing witnesses if you can get evidence from them that supports your version of events or discredits their trustworthiness as a witness. Always be kind and polite to any witnesses, even during cross-examination.

If you think you might want to appeal the decision in your case, make sure you understand the following: How appeals are decided: generally, the courts of appeal do not want to tell the trial judge that he made the wrong decision, or “overrule” that decision. Therefore, an appeals court will usually only overturn the decision of a lower court if the lower court made a significant error of law.What a “significant error of law” is will be completely different depending on each particular case. What evidence you can present: The courts of appeals do not look at any new evidence that may have been discovered after the case was decided (either by the judge or the jury). Instead, the court will look at the documents from the case, a “brief” by both parties discussing why each one believes that they have the correct view, and in some cases, will listen to both parties argue your case in front of the court (this is referred to as “oral argument). The consequences of an unsuccessful appeal: if a party unsuccessfully appeals the court’s order, the higher court will “affirm” the lower court’s ruling (or the jury’s), and the current judgment will stand.
