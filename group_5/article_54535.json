      "content": "Go with a short-sleeve undershirt under a button-down dress shirt. Select a skin tight undershirt so you don’t get any bulges underneath your button-down, and try to find one in a neutral color that blends into your skin tone. A short-sleeve will give you extra coverage and protect your dress shirt from deodorant stains (unlike a tank top or “wife beater”). [3] X Research source If you can't find an undershirt in your skin tone, choose a gray or white one. You can find undershirts in most men's clothing departments near the socks and underwear."

      "content": "Select a thin slip under a see-through shirt dress. Opt for a fitted slip dress if you want a more sexy or seamless look, or go for a looser slip for a more work-appropriate look. [4] X Research source Make sure the slip is made of a smooth fabric so it doesn’t cling to your shirt dress or damage it. Try on the slip with your shirt dress before wearing it out. If it’s too long, hem your slip at home or take it to a tailor to get it shortened. Check the opacity of the slip underneath a flashlight to ensure your undergarments don't peak through in the sunlight."

Alternatively, wear a bandeau top if you don’t care about your stomach being exposed, or slip on a swimsuit underneath if you plan to wear the top to the beach or pool."

Using thread that matches the color of your top, thread the needle and sew a straight stitch around the border of your sheer top, connecting the fabric and your sheer top together. Make sure you don’t accidentally sew both sides of the sheer top together. Repeat this process on the back side of your sheer top if you want the back to be opaque too. Once you’ve finished sewing the fabric to your sheer top, flip your shirt right-side-out, then trim off any excess fabric that peeks out from the perimeter of your top."
