Insert a flathead screwdriver or spudger into the space between the back-left corner of the console and the plastic grille on the left side of the console, then gently pry the grille away from the console. It helps to use a plastic tool rather than a metal tool here since the grille is made of relatively delicate plastic."

      "content": "Unhook the second bracket. It's on the far-left side of the grille area. To unhook this bracket: pull on the bottom of the bracket while pushing on the top of the bracket, then insert a flathead screwdriver into the seam that's covered by the warranty sticker on the back of the console and pry until the bracket unhooks. This is easiest if the console is upright. Breaking the warranty sticker will officially void your warranty."

      "content": "Detach the rest of the casing brackets. Insert your screwdriver into the top section of the grille that's on the back of the console and twist it until the bracket unhooks, then repeat this process down the side of the console. Once all of the brackets are unhooked, the back part of the Xbox One's casing will pop open. Do not pull the casing off of the console yet. Doing so will break the ribbon that connects the front of your Xbox One to the circuit board."

There are eight total screws to remove; you'll see a light \"C\" with a number next to or below the screws. Two of the screws are at the bottom of the fan box.

The whole bottom part of the Xbox One's casing is now removable as well. This is helpful if you want to paint or otherwise detail your Xbox One's casing. If you want to remove a stuck CD from your Xbox One's disk drive, there should be a pinhole in the front of the Xbox One's face plate where you can insert a small item (e.g., a paperclip) to force the drive to open."
