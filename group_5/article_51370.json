      "content": "Use the IRS withholding calculator for a good estimate. There are many calculators online that can help you calculate about how much your federal withholding should be for the year. However, the most authoritative is probably the one offered by the IRS itself, available here: http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator . This calculator allows you to input your income for the year and receive a reasonably accurate estimate both of your total withholding and of your refund. For the most accurate results, be sure to supply any tax credits, allowances, and deductions when prompted, though you can also ignore these for a quicker (and likely less accurate) result."

After the end of every tax year, your employers are legally required to send you tax documents that contain important information about your income for the year. These forms almost always tell how much of your income was withheld for federal taxes (and state taxes as well, when applicable.) If you don't have this form, talk to your employer's payroll department to get a copy. Most employees will get a standard W-2 form from their employer. [1] X Research source If you are an employee at multiple businesses, you should receive a W-2 from each. On the other hand, independent contractors will receive a 1099 form from every customer they had that paid them more than $600 during the year.

The more money you make, the more taxes you owe, and the greater your withholding will be. Usually, you can find your gross income by adding up the totals on the end-of-year documents like W-2s and 1099s you receive from your employer(s). Note that tips, bonuses, commissions, and overtime pay are all taxable. In addition, many types of non-wage income, like retirement payments and even gambling income may be taxable.

While withholding rates can vary from year to year, as a general, single people almost always have the biggest withholding and married people have significantly lower ones. Filing statuses include: Single: Highest withholding. Married filing jointly: Smaller withholding. Married filing separately: Usually similar to single. Head of household: For unmarried people who are responsible for more than 50% of the costs of maintaining a home for themselves and dependents.

      "content": "Use a W-4 to find your allowances. Withholding exemptions called \"allowances\" dictate how much money is withheld from your wage income for tax purposes. As a general rule, the government takes a greater withholding from people who are single and have no children. This means, however, that these people usually get the biggest refunds at the end of the year. You can use an IRS form W-4 (available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf ) to determine how many allowances to claim. If, for whatever reason, the form is not available, you should assume a filing status of single and 0 allowances. This will lead to the greatest withholding and the biggest refund at the end of the year."

Deductible items may include payments to retirement accounts (such as traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans), insurance premiums, health savings plans, some healthcare expenses, charitable donations, and more. Subtract your deductions from your income before finding your withholding. Expenses that are eligible for tax deductions can vary based on your living situation (single, married, etc.) and events that have recently occurred in your life. For a good resource on tax deductions, consult the eFile deduction guide, available at http://www.efile.com/tax-deduction/ .

      "content": "Use the provided example problems to your benefit. The 2 methods for finding your income tax withholding above are somewhat complex, so following along with an example problem (like the ones in Publication 15 itself) can help make them more manageable. See below for an example problem for each method: Wage bracket example: If you are single, you make $50,000 per year, and you are paid every week, go to the Single Persons, weekly pay period page. There are 52 weeks in a year, so 50,000/52 = $961, your weekly pay. Scroll down to the 953-964 row on the next page. Looking to the right, see that at 0 deductions, you have $115 withheld. Percentage example: Let's say that you are married, you are paid $2,000 every 2 weeks, and that you are claiming 2 allowances. Using Table 5 on page 45, you should subtract 2 × 161.50 = $323.00 from your pay. 2,000 - 323.00 = $1,677.00. On page 46, you can use this number to determine your withholding. $1,677.00 after deductions puts you in the second row for tax purposes which means that your income above $1,200 is taxed at 12% . The total withholding per pay would be calculated as follows: (($1,677.00 - $1,200) x .12) + $74.60 = $131.80."

      "content": "Add your payroll and income taxes to get your total withholding. Once you know your income tax withholding and your withholding for your payroll taxes, finding your total withholding is as simple as adding them together. Using an annual pay period for your tax calculations will give you your withholding for the year, while using your normal pay period will give you your withholding for each paycheck. Example: Let's say that you are single, you make $4,000 per week ($208,000 per year), you work for someone else, and you are claiming zero (0) allowances. You can find your withholding for the year with the following calculations: Income tax (percentage method): Withhold $896.70 per week plus 35% of the excess over $3,998. $4,000 - $3,998 = $2. $2 x 0.35 = $.070. $896.70 + $0.70 = $897.40, which would be withheld from each paycheck. $897.40 x 52 = $46,664.80 is the total amount that would be withheld for the year. Social Security: 6.2% of 132,900 of your earnings. 0.062 × 132900 = $8,239.80 Medicare: 1.45% of income, plus 0.9% of income over $200,000. 0.0145 × 208000 = $3,016. 0.009 × 8000 = $72. 3016 + 72 = $3,088 Total: $46,664.80 + $8,239.80 + $3,088 = $57,992.60"
