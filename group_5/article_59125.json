      "content": "Remove the source of the rust stain. If the stain came from a piece of furniture or a plant stand, move it off of the carpet before you start the cleaning process. You may want to permanently relocate the offending piece of furniture to protect your carpet from future stains.

      "content": "Use a butter knife to scrape up as much visible rust as you can. Gently scrape the knife against the stain; you will notice small flakes of rust coming off the carpet. Be patient—you don’t want to snag threads or rip the carpet. [2] X Research source Use a vacuum to remove the flaked off rust from the carpet. [3] X Expert Source Haim Shemesh Carpet & Rug Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 May 2020. When you have finished scraping the rust up, your carpet will still be stained but the stain will have lightened in color."

      "content": "Mix 2 cups (470 mL) warm water with 1 tablespoon (15 mL) dish soap. Use a bowl or a bucket to mix your stain removal mixture—just make sure it is clean before you add the water and soap to avoid transferring any dirt or dye to your carpet. [4] X Research source If you can, avoid using a dish soap that is dark in color (like purple or blue). Usually these soaps are fine to use, but sometimes they can stain light colored carpet."

      "title": "Use a sponge to blot the stain with the warm water and soap mixture.",
      "content": "Use a sponge to blot the stain with the warm water and soap mixture. Blot repeatedly until the stained area is completely saturated. You may need to squeeze out and refill your sponge with the soapy water several times to ensure the entire area is treated. [5] X Research source Blot the stain rather than rubbing. Blotting is when you repeatedly press down on the stain, rather than rubbing back and forth. Rubbing can spread the stain to clean areas of the carpet. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Let the stain soak for 5 minutes after you finish blotting.",
      "content": "Let the stain soak for 5 minutes after you finish blotting. This gives the soap and water time to loosen the rust stain and clean the fibers of the carpet. You can leave the area wet for longer (10-15 minutes), but you want to make sure the soapy water and loosening rust stain doesn’t dry and set in to the carpet again. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak up excess water with a clean white towel.",
      "content": "Soak up excess water with a clean white towel. Using a white towel helps you see how much of the stain is transferring up from the carpet. Press dry sections of the towel repeatedly to the stain. The rust stain should transfer from the carpet to the towel. [8] X Research source Keep blotting the stain until your towel comes away clean and dry (so after you press the towel into the stain, there is no more transfer of liquid or rust). If you’re cleaning a large area, you may need to use more than 1 towel."

      "content": "Use warm water and ammonia for tougher stains. If the stain is still there after using warm water and dish soap, make a new mixture of 2 cups (470 mL) of warm water and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of household ammonia. Pour this mixture directly onto the stain and let it sit for 5 minutes. Blot the carpet dry with a white towel after it has soaked. [9] X Research source If you dislike the smell of the ammonia, try adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice into the mixture. [10] X Research source"

You’ll want to either find a new location for that piece of furniture or look into coating it with an anti-rust solution to prevent new stains.

      "content": "Scrape up excess rust with a butter knife. The more rust you can remove before cleaning, the better your chances of getting rid of the stain completely. Be patient and gentle as you scrape—you want to be thorough but you also don’t want to rip or snag the carpet threads. [12] X Research source Vacuum up the flaked rust from the carpet before moving on to the stain removal steps."

      "title": "Apply lemon juice and salt directly onto the stained area.",
      "content": "Apply lemon juice and salt directly onto the stained area. You can use fresh lemon juice or bottled—whichever you have on hand will work! If you have sea salt, sprinkle that on top of the lemon-soaked area. If you don’t have sea salt, common table salt will work, too. Let the stain soak for 5 minutes. [13] X Research source The lemon juice and salt combination creates a mild abrasive cleaner and helps break up the rust composition. [14] X Research source If you like a more hands-on approach, you can mix the lemon juice and salt in a bowl and use a sponge to blot it onto the stain directly."

If the stain is particularly large, you may need to use more than 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water. The main thing to keep in mind is that you want the water to saturate the stain so it removes the salt and lemon juice mixture and clears the stain. [15] X Research source"
