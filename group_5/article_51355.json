The formula is: (0.006012 x Height 3 {\\displaystyle ^{3}} )+(14.6 x Weight)+604. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have your height in centimeters and your weight in kilograms, you will first need to convert them to inches and pounds, respectively. 1 centimeter is 0.39 inches. 1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds. Calculate the height function of the formula. Cube your height in inches and then multiply it by 0.006012. Calculate the weight function. Multiply your weight in pounds by 14.6. Add the height function to the weight function. Add 604."

This means that if a person is obese or very thin, it will influence the accuracy of the calculations. Gilcher’s Rule of Fives makes adjustments for this in the estimated amount of blood per kilogram of body weight. If you know your weight in pounds, convert it to kilograms by multiplying by 0.45. Then multiply your body weight in kilograms by one of these values to get your estimated total blood volume in milliliters: Muscular men have 75 mL of blood per kilogram of body weight. Normal men have 70. Thin men have 65. Obese men have 60."

Gilcher’s Rule of Fives corrects this by adjusting the estimated amount of blood per kilogram of body weight. If you know your weight in pounds, convert it to kilograms by multiplying by 0.45. Then multiply your body weight by these averages according to your body condition: Muscular women have 70 mL of blood per kilogram of body weight. Normal women have 65. Thin women have 60.
