      "title": "Go to Labyrinthian.",
      "content": "Go to Labyrinthian. Start from the city of Morthal, and from there, take the road south and turn eastwards. Keep on walking along this course and turn right around the first corner that leads to the south. Stick to this small road and you’ll be able to come across the entrance to the Labyrinthian, an abandoned city in ruins. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Kill Morokei.",
      "content": "Kill Morokei. Make your way through the Labyrinthian up to its third level, called the Labyrinthian Tribune. Inside this chamber you’ll find a dragon priest named Morokei who’s wielding a staff called the Staff of Magnus; kill him. [2] X Research source Range weapons like bow and arrows, and magic spells are very effective against Morokei. Close combats like swords or axes can damage the priest too but will not be as effective. Also, avoid the shock spells that he’ll cast at you as these will deal severe damage on you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Retrieve the staff.",
      "content": "Retrieve the staff. Once Morokei is defeated, approach and search Morokei’s ashes to retrieve his mask and the Staff of Magnus. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Return to Winterhold.",
      "content": "Return to Winterhold. After killing Morokei, you’ll find a door inside the Labyrinthian Tribune that leads back to the outside world. Exit through this door and head back to Winterhold, taking the northeastern road from where you are."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your way up to the college.",
      "content": "Make your way up to the college. Once you arrive in Winterhold, you’ll find a strong gust of wind breezing the courtyard, making it hard for you to move. Equip the Staff of Magnus and point it out into the open by pressing the “Attack” button on your controller. This will clear the way and will let you enter the college. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find Ancano.",
      "content": "Find Ancano. Enter the largest tower in the area called “The Hall of Elements.” Inside you’ll find Ancano casting spells at a great sphere called the Eye of Magnus. At this point, Tolfdir (a non-playable character) will enter the same room and talk to Ancano. Wait for the dialogue to finish and for Ancano to paralyze Tolfdir before attacking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Close the Eye of Magnus.",
      "content": "Close the Eye of Magnus. Once Tolfdir is down on the ground, use your Staff of Magnus and point it towards the great Eye of Magnus sphere. You’ll notice that the sphere will slowly close down, decreasing the power it’s emitting. Keep pointing the staff at the sphere until it’s fully closed. [5] X Research source Do not attack Ancano if the Eye of Magnus isn’t fully closed. Ancano is invulnerable to any form of attacks while the great sphere is open."
    },
    {
      "title": "Kill Ancano.",
      "content": "Kill Ancano. Once the Eye of Magnus is closed, approach Ancano and attack him using any weapon or spell you have until he’s dead. [6] X Research source Ancano will occasionally try to open the Eye of Magnus again, making him invulnerable once more. When this happens, just repeat step 3 until the sphere is closed once more and Ancano is taking damage again. Any fire-type spell you’ve learned during the early stages of the game can also prove to be very effective against Ancano. Once Ancano is dead, talk to Tolfdir, who is now conscious, to continue with the quest."
