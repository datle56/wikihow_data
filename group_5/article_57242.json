      "content": "Get clay. If you want to be able to move your clay person around after it's finished, you'll need modeling clay. This clay doesn't dry in the air, so it's perfect for making clay models out of. If you want your clay person to be still once it's done, you can use oven-bake clay. You can make your clay person all the same color, or you can use different colors for different parts of the body. For example, if you want it to look like your clay person is wearing a shirt, you can use a green or white piece of clay for the torso. [1] X Research source"

You can always make the legs thicker, but sometimes the legs are plenty thick, and it still falls over. In that case, you might want to redo various parts of the person and experiment with a shorter torso, less clay for the torso, smaller arms, a smaller head, etc. Also make sure the clay person's torso is straight, and that the arms are close to the same size and weight."
