      "content": "Drill holes into an old wheelbarrow. Use an electric drill and an eight-inch drill bit to do this. Drill holes into the bottom of the wheelbarrow, as well as the sides (about three to four inches up the sides). Drill as many holes as you can to turn your wheelbarrow into a strainer. [1] X Research source If you do not have an electric drill, you can rent one from your local hardware store."

      "content": "Shovel the gravel into the wheelbarrow. Only fill a quarter of the wheelbarrow with gravel. This way the water will be able to easily drain through the gravel as you rinse it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse with water.",
      "content": "Rinse with water. Turn on your hose and begin rinsing the gravel. As you rinse the gravel, use your shovel to move it around. This way you can ensure all sides of the gravel are rinsed. [3] X Research source Rinse the gravel for 30 seconds to a minute."

      "title": "Dry the gravel.",
      "content": "Dry the gravel. Lay a geotextile fabric on the grass. Wheelbarrow the clean gravel over to the fabric and pour it on top. Spread the gravel on the fabric until it is one to two inches high. It should take about an hour to dry in the sun. [4] X Research source Geotextile fabric is a special type of fabric that contains tiny holes, which enable water and other debris to drain. You can find it at your local hardware store. The size of the fabric depends on how much gravel you have. Just make sure the fabric can fit all of your gravel."

      "title": "Cut a section of metal hardware cloth.",
      "content": "Cut a section of metal hardware cloth. Use tin snips or heavy shears to cut a 2x2 foot section of cloth. The section of hardware cloth will act as a sieve so you can sift your gravel. [5] X Research source Hardware cloth is metal or plastic wire mesh that is sold in rolls at your local hardware store."

    {
      "title": "Shape the sieve.",
      "content": "Shape the sieve. Once it is cut, roll or fold two edges of the cloth to make handles. Using your hands, slightly bend the rest of the edges up and inward to mold the cloth into a bowl-like shape. Shape it just enough so that the gravel will stay in the sieve as you sift it.

      "title": "Position a tarp on the ground near the gravel.",
      "content": "Position a tarp on the ground near the gravel. Stabilize the tarp with rocks or another heavy object. Place your sieve on top of the tarp. The tarp will catch the debris as you sift your gravel. [7] X Research source The tarp will enable you to easily discard the dirt and debris without too much mess."

Shake the gravel until all of the dirt and debris are removed. [8] X Research source Remove large chunks of dirt and debris with your hands."

      "content": "Place the clean gravel in a bucket. Use a gallon bucket, or another type of container. Only fill the bucket a third of the way with gravel. This way, the bucket will not be too heavy to lift when you transport the gravel. [9] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a wheelbarrow to transport the gravel."
