You don't need help from anybody. This is a very light job. You may wish to change both HID light bulbs at the same time simply because if one of them failed the other may fail soon."

      "content": "Get the Prius HID headlights online. 2006-2009 Priuses use D4R HID bulbs. [1] X Research source The stock bulbs are made by Phillips and have a color temperature of 3400K. These can be found on eBay for $35 per bulb rather than the $150 charged by Toyota. Other brands can be found for $50 per pair. Other color temperatures are also available. The higher the color temperature, the more blue the lights will be (example: 8000K is much bluer than the stock 4300K (bright yellowish)).While it may be a good idea to replace both bulbs at the same time, if you choose not to do this, make sure to get the same color temperature bulb as the existing one or your headlights will appear different. In some places, it may be illegal to use higher kelvin (more blue or purple) bulbs. Some users note that the standard 4300K bulbs provide the best visible light for nighttime driving, and do not recommend going above 5000K."

The fastener has two indentations that will receive a flathead screwdriver. Gently pry the fastener out, and remove the vent tube.

It has a pop-out screw or clip on the left and one threaded screw towards the firewall on top with a bolt/washer combo that holds it down. Also, there is an electrical wire that pops free from the right side. Take off the two electrical connectors at the bottom of the front of the reservoir by squeezing them and pulling. Now the container will come out with a little manipulation. The front plastic tab that goes to that threaded screw hold down will need to be bent just a tad to release from under the front lip and the whole thing will come out. You can probably let the container rest right there lifted up and out of the way; if you have very large hands, you can remove the “slide off” rubber hose connectors \"on bottom\" that will allow you to completely remove it and sit it on the ground."

You need to turn it about an eighth of a turn counterclockwise. It has a very sticky O-ring to keep out moisture and may be very reluctant to turn. If this is the first time this part has been removed, then this step is by far the most time consuming of the entire process. The little fins to give you traction when attempting to turn; don't hit them with a screwdriver nor should you use pliers or tools, as you \"will\" break them off if you do! Use some garden gloves to improve grip and grab and turn counterclockwise. If it resists, wiggle it a bit to loosen the large O ring underneath and try again. \"Constant\" tension seems to be the key. If you look very close you will see it turning very slowly. It takes about an eighth of a turn before it stops and you can wiggle it free. Once you've done this once, it’s much easier should you need to do it again. [6] X Research source"
