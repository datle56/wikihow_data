      "content": "Crawl underneath the car and look for the spot where fluid is dripping from the brakes. If the leak is coming from within a wheel, then you may have to remove the wheel to check for leaks in the lines and calipers. It the car has brake drums it may have a leak in the wheel cylinder. You will have to remove the brake drum to check it."

      "title": "Remove the old caliper.",
      "content": "Remove the old caliper. Purchase a caliper rebuild kit from an automotive store or dealership. Remove the brake bleeder bolt using a flare-nut wrench. If needed, utilize gentle tapping and penetrating oil to loosen the part without breaking it. Disconnect both the steel and rubber brake lines using a flare-nut wrench. Replace these lines if they are cracking or worn before putting the calipers back onto the car. Strip the calipers of pads, shims, springs and sliders or pins. Remove the outer dust seal. Place a piece of wood that is slightly thicker than both brake pads stacked together in the caliper behind the piston. Release low-pressure compressed air into the inlet port. This should cause the piston to pop out."

If you turn the self-adjuster in the wrong direction, then the drum will get tighter and will not turn. Use a small flat head screwdriver to release the adjuster arm, if needed. You may need to use a hammer to hit the middle of the drum to loosen any rust that surrounds the center piece. Remove the drum. Place a drip pan beneath the brake shoes. If the brake shoes are covered in fluid, you will need to replace them as well. Spray the area with brake cleaner to eliminate dirt and fluid."
