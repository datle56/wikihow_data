      "content": "Download software capable of recording (or \"ripping\") streaming audio. There are many programs available for download that have this capability. Compare software in terms of functionality and cost to determine which one is appropriate for your needs.

If this feature is not included, you will end up with a single large audio file for the entire recording. One easy way to record any online stream is to use VLC. This will work as long as you have a link to the stream. [3] X Research source Some popular software available includes RipCast, Freecorder, Replay A/V, and StationRipper.

Some applications actually have a browser that allows you to find and mark your favorite programs for later recording, much like a DVR on a television set. Other programs will simply have a \"Record\" button that you press after you have manually started streaming the broadcast. [5] X Research source"
