      "title": "Use a cloth that doesn't scratch.",
      "content": "Use a cloth that doesn't scratch. A microfiber cloth or a jewelry-polishing cloth are ideal for polishing your necklace. These cloths won't scratch your jewelry like paper towels or even tissues can. You want something soft and lint-free for polishing. [1] X Research source If you need to get into small areas, try a cotton swab."

      "title": "Start with a bit of soap.",
      "content": "Start with a bit of soap. If your silver necklace is only mildly tarnished, you can start by using a bit of dish soap. In a cup of warm water, add a few drops of the soap. Stir it up, then wet your cloth with the solution to start polishing your necklace. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub along the grain.",
      "content": "Rub along the grain. You may think the ideal polishing motion is circular. However, that can actually scratch up your silver. A better idea is to rub back and forth, making sure to go along the grain of the metal, which is less likely to scratch it. [3] X Research source With the chain, you may need to gently rub it between two fingers, using the cloth. Continue to move to clean sections of the cloth, so you're not adding tarnish back on to the necklace. You can also use a clean soft-bristled toothbrush for detailed areas, though try not to brush too hard."

      "title": "Avoid intentionally oxidized details.",
      "content": "Avoid intentionally oxidized details. In some cases, the person who made the necklace may have let certain parts of the jewelry darken to highlight details. If you have a piece like that, you need to avoid polishing those areas so you don't lose some of the beauty of your piece. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try other polishes.",
      "content": "Try other polishes. If your jewelry is more tarnished, you may need to get actual jewelry polish to clean the necklace. Alternatively, you can make a paste of baking soda and water and rub it into the necklace as a polish. [5] X Research source Another option is half a cup of lemon juice with a tablespoon of olive oil. [6] X Research source You can also use toothpaste. The ingredient in the toothpaste that polishes the silver is hydrated silica, so look for that ingredient; tartar control toothpastes will have more of this ingredient. However, whatever you use on your teeth is likely fine for silver, though gel varieties likely won't work as well. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apply the paste.",
      "content": "Apply the paste. Put a small dab of the paste on the necklace. If you have precious or semi-precious stones on your necklace, this method may not be the best one, though you can try to avoid the stone. Just a pea-sized dab should be enough, and you can always add more later. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Scrub the silver.",
      "content": "Scrub the silver. For this part, you can start out just using your fingers, if you'd like, though only do so if you're using a natural paste; grab a microfiber cloth if you're using professional silver polish. Rub the paste into the silver, including the chain if it's also tarnished. Basically, it's like your rubbing soap into the silver, but you're using a paste instead. You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush (one you're not going to brush with!), but you can end up scratching it if you try to brush too hard. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Rinse the silver.",
      "content": "Rinse the silver. Once the tarnish is mostly gone, run the necklace under water. Carefully wash off all the paste, as any left on will look funny. You can repeat the process, as well, if you didn't manage to get all the tarnish off. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Set up the bath. Start with an aluminum pie plate or a bowl with aluminum foil covering the inside. Add a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of salt to the plate. Next, add a tablespoon of either water softener powder OR baking soda. [11] X Research source While some people use this method on necklaces with precious or semi-precious stones, it could cause damage, so it's better not to risk it if it is valuable. Similarly, it's best not to try this method on antique or fragile silver. This process will remove all the tarnish, including decorative oxidized areas (black areas put in place to create a design). You can also add 1/2 a cup (118 milliliters) of white vinegar at this point. Keep in mind, vinegar will cause the baking soda to react, so watch for overflow. [12] X Research source"

It should be touching the aluminum, so that the tarnish will move from the silver to the aluminum. Let it soak for a couple of minutes. You can do a bit more if the necklace is especially tarnished.
