      "content": "Attach your model to a wire coat hanger. Pull on the middle of a wire coat hanger so that it looks like a diamond. Continue to flatten out both sides so that they run vertically. Once your done doing that, bend the hanger over itself to create a stand that your car model can hang on while you work on it. The hanger should look like the letter C. Attach the end of the hanger to the inside of your model using a strong masking tape. [1] X Research source Once you're done taping your model to your stand, test its stability by pressing your fingers on the front and back of the model. Attaching your model to a hanger will allow you to spray paint the entirety of the car, including the bottom and interior."

      "title": "Spray a layer of protective primer over your car's model.",
      "content": "Spray a layer of protective primer over your car's model. Purchase a model-specific primer or a general primer to lay an opaque base coat for your model. You can purchase a protective primer at most arts and crafts stores. Apply pressure to the trigger of the primer and try to get an even coat across the surface and interior of the model. Once you're done, remove the tape and spray primer in the areas that were covered up by the tape. Keep your model in a well-aerated area while it dries. If you are using a primer specifically made for model building, you don't need to apply a base primer, though it could add to the overall consistency of your paint job. Use a gray or off-white primer for your model car. Primer will also act as an adhesive for other layers of paint. A layer of primer is necessary if you want to use real automotive paint because it contains solvents that are harmful to the plastic model. The primer will take anywhere from two to four hours to dry."

      "content": "Sand the model with a fine grit sandpaper. Take the model off of the stand and use a 1200-1500 sandpaper to smooth out the car's surfaces. When sanding, make sure not to sand off the protective primer that you applied. If you notice that you do, go back to the area and spot paint with your spray can. The goal is to get your model smooth and ready for painting. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your car.",
      "content": "Wash your car. Wash your car with a damp rag and a drop of mild dish soap. There will probably be primer residue left over from sanding that you should remove. If there is dust on the surface of your car before you paint it, it will be trapped in the paint job. Pat your car dry once you're done."

      "title": "Apply your coats of paint.",
      "content": "Apply your coats of paint. Reattach the car to your painting stand and shake your spray paint can. Point the spray paint can on your car and administer pressure to the trigger while slowly sweeping the can horizontally to apply even coats of paint across the surface of your car. Once you're done, allow the paint to dry overnight before applying another coat of paint. Continue to do this until the color reaches the deepness and richness that you desire. [3] X Research source Before you paint your model, it's smart to practice using the spray can on a piece of newspaper. Spray can handles are add-on mechanisms that you can add to any can to make it easier to spray. Enamel paint dries slowly and hardens to a shiny finish. Acrylic paint dries quickly and is easier to clean up. [4] X Research source"

Sand the surface of your car with a very fine 3600 grit sandpaper. Once the surface of the car looks smooth and even, wash the car with cold water and a drop of mild dish soap."

      "content": "Add paint thinner and stir your paint. There are paint thinners that have been created specifically for model use. If you are using a specific brand of paint, use the same brand of paint thinner. If you can't find paint thinner or want to create your own, combine 50% distilled water with 50% of propyl alcohol and your paint in a 1:1 ratio. Thinning out the paint lightens the consistency and enables you to make more consistent coats. [5] X Research source"

Make sure not to paint over areas where your model will fit together, or you may have trouble assembling your model correctly. Get a variety of different sized brushes to make painting easier. You can use either a synthetic or natural-haired brush to paint your car models."

Instead, you want to achieve an even coat by making long and even strokes. Popular paints for model cars include Testors, Model Masters, Humbrol, Tamiya, PollyScale, Floquil, and Vallejo.

Once you've correctly hooked up your air brush, practice at different pressure levels to get a feeling for how the airbrush works. Use a cheap paint and airbrush on large pieces of butcher paper. Airbrushes typically cost anywhere from $25 to $300 and up. Remember to wear a protective mask and to lay out a tarp on your work area when using an airbrush."

      "content": "Apply an airbrushed coat of paint onto your car. Connect the paint jar color that you want to use to your airbrush. Apply the first base coat with your airbrush by applying pressure to the actuator, or button on the top of the airbrush. Quickly move your hand left to right and apply mist coats at 25-30 PSI. Continue to rotate your model car as you apply more coats of paint. When you are nearing the end, lower the PSI on your airbrush to 18-20 PSI to apply the final one or two coats. Lowering the airbrush PSI will make the paint come out thicker. Do not let the thick paint run, or it may ruin your model. Be conservative on thick coats of paint. Remember to airbrush separate parts of your car, such as the hood, as you paint the car's body."

Once it's totally dried, examine the car and look for areas that are not painted. Instead of airbrushing over the car again, fix small details with a brush and matching paint."
