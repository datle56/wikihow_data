      "content": "Corporate goth style mixes dark aesthetics with professional clothing. The “corporate goth” style picked up steam on TikTok, where young creators show off the gothic work-appropriate attire they wear each day. [1] X Research source They might wear black slacks and patterned button-up shirts, spice up a black midi dress with silver Victorian jewelry, or combine frilly lace tops with pencil skirts. They also might dye their hair or wear it in traditional gothic styles. Some people also incorporate alternative or gothic make-up looks, like white face paint or dark eyeshadow. This new style began as young alternative Gen-Zers entered the workforce post-pandemic, playfully blurring the line between personal and professional wear. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your supervisor what your workplace dress code policies are. Not every company will have a documented dress code, but most employers will be happy to give you their expectations. [3] X Research source If you’re not sure if a certain outfit or accessory fits the dress code, it might be best to leave them at home. Hot tip: If you’re not sure what the dress code is at your office after asking, look at what other employees are wearing for a baseline."

      "title": "Wear a black skirt or dress pants as a base.",
      "content": "Wear a black skirt or dress pants as a base. Just because you’re working in an office doesn’t mean you can’t dress as dark as the night. Try combining a pair of gray or black dress pants or a black skirt with a cute dark-colored blouse or sweater for a clean but totally spooky look. Hot tip: Try wearing patterned mesh or black tights under mini-skirts that might be otherwise too revealing to wear at the workplace."

      "title": "Play around with silk, velvet, and lace.",
      "content": "Play around with silk, velvet, and lace. Goth styles often experiment with different fabric textures, shapes, and styles. Although distressed denim probably might not be appropriate in most office settings, feel free to explore blouses, dress pants, button-down shirts, and blazers in gothic textures like velvet, silk, mesh, or lace. Hot tip: Wear a tank top under mesh or lace-heavy shirts or wear a comfortable blazer over them to make your outfit look more formal."

      "title": "Pair any eclectic clothing you have with traditional business wear.",
      "content": "Pair any eclectic clothing you have with traditional business wear. Innovate your daily uniform by combining button-down shirts and slacks with old Victorian gowns, vintage frilly dress shirts, and black waistcoat vests. [4] X Research source For example, you might rock a tan button-down shirt with a frilly steampunk-inspired skirt or wear a black suit with a pair of edgy combat boots. Hot tip: Contrast dresses, skirts, and pants in dark colors like maroon, purple, and navy blue with a white button-up shirt or a casual light-colored t-shirt."

      "title": "Wear a corset over a button-up shirt or blouse.",
      "content": "Wear a corset over a button-up shirt or blouse. Goth clothing often incorporates a lot of Victorian-era styles, including corsets. If you’re looking to goth-ify one of your typical workday outfits, try putting on a laceless corset over whatever shirt you’re wearing. Hot tip: Depending on your job, a corset with a lot of boning or lace might not be comfortable or appropriate for a full day of work. Try wearing solid black or patterned corsets instead."

      "title": "Combine mesh long-sleeve shirts with a solid-colored blouse.",
      "content": "Combine mesh long-sleeve shirts with a solid-colored blouse. Mesh, fishnet, and frills are all goth fashion staples, but that doesn’t mean you have to ditch them completely for the workplace. Try a black dress or shirt under a mesh long-sleeve top to make your outfit more work-appropriate. Hot tip: Put a blazer over your look for an extra dash of professional flare or wear fishnet stockings with maxi skirts for an interesting pop of texture."

      "title": "Wear black button-up shirts in playful patterns and textures.",
      "content": "Wear black button-up shirts in playful patterns and textures. If you’re struggling to goth up a suit and tie, try picking button-up shirts with black stripes, spiderwebs, moths, animal skeletons, or Victorian brocade patterns. You can also experiment with black ruffle shirts or shirts that have buckles, zippers, and other punk-esque accessories sewn in. Hot tip: Style adviser Jordan Stolch recommends looking for clothing with “interesting fabric or interesting detail[s]” like pieces with “leather accents” or “chain studding.” You can also add chains to a classic waistcoat or look for black slacks with added zippers to give your corporate ‘fit a gothic twist."

      "content": "Put on a pair of combat boots, platform shoes, or lacy high heels. Aim for dark shoes that are comfortable, meet your workplace requirements, and look clean and presentable. [5] X Research source You might pair black dress pants and a white button-down shirt with a pair of Mary Jane wedges or spice up your shiny black Oxford loafers with a couple of added chains. Hot tip: Depending on the kind of job you have, a pair of pointed-toe high heels might not be practical. If you work outdoors, you might go for a pair of black military or construction boots."

      "content": "Throw on a little bit of goth-influenced makeup to complete the look. Some employers might not appreciate it if you wear “trad goth” nearly-white foundation, but you might be able to wear a little bit of dark lipstick or black wing-tip eyeliner to work. Try mixing your normal foundation with a slightly lighter shade to get a paler base without looking too ghostly. [6] X Research source Hot tip: If your workplace allows it, put in some colorful contact lenses or get black stiletto nails to really make your outfit pop."

      "content": "Add 2 to 3 pieces of gothic jewelry with your outfit. One of the best ways to make you feel like yourself without breaking the workplace dress code is to use tons of accessories. Necklaces with bats and roses, silver Victorian rings, and spike earrings can help you express yourself without going all-out. Hot tip: Pick bowties or neckties with spooky patterns, like barbed wire or kitchen knives. If you’re more into the nu-goth style, try a tattoo choker or a round oversized hat."

      "content": "Decorate your workplace to embrace the vibe. If you have a cubicle or office that you can decorate, why not add a little bit of cryptic decor to match your aesthetic? Bring in a ghost-printed pillow, a fake skull, an occult-inspired mousepad, or a couple of old eclectic paintings to darken your workspace. Hot tip: Even a couple of fake candles or a little witchy altar can help make you feel more at home at your office."
