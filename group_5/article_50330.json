  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Start with school or professional letterhead.",
      "content": "Start with school or professional letterhead. If your current position is relevant to the recommendation, use official letterhead if possible. That is, if you work for a school, use the school letterhead. If you supervise the student at volunteer position, use the nonprofit's letterhead. Doing so creates a sense of authority and makes the letter look more polished. [2] X Research source If you don't have letterhead with your address, your address goes at the top. You can use the school's address. You don't need to include your name, as that's included at the end of the letter. Just place the school name on one line, the street address on the next line, and the city, state, and zip code on the last line. [3] X Research source If you are submitting electronically, it's best to start with letterhead. [4] X Research source It should look like the following address: Muddy River High School 492 West Lane Big City, Arkansas 73234"
    },
    {
      "title": "Skip a line and add the date.",
      "content": "Skip a line and add the date. Leave a line between your address and the date. Write the month out in full, followed by the day of the month, a comma, and the year. In some countries, such as the UK, the day of the month will come before the month. [5] X Research source The date will look this way: January 28, 2017 In the UK and other countries, you should write it this way: 28 January 2017"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the recipient's address.",
      "content": "Add the recipient's address. Leave a line blank underneath the date. On the next line, place the person's name if you have it. Use \"Dr.\" and other professional titles over \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.,\" but \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" is fine if you don't have a title for the person. You can also use \"Mrs.\" and \"Miss\" if the person shows a preference for one of them, but default to \"Ms.\" if you don't know what they prefer. Add the person's last name next. [6] X Research source The student should supply you with a list of addresses. If they don't, reach out to them to get addresses. Also, it's up to you whether you want to put the recipient's address on the letter when submitting electronically. If you don't, you'll just have the letterhead, the date, and the salutation. [7] X Research source Under the person's name, place the school's name and then the street address. Below that, add the city, state, and zip code. If you don't know the name, you can use \"Admission's Office\" and the name of the school underneath it. The address should look like this example: Dr. Jordan Jones College of the Pines 2948 Northlake Boulevard Big Buck City, Oregon 42343"

    {
      "title": "Use a name in the salutation.",
      "content": "Use a name in the salutation. If at all possible, it's best to use a name in the salutation. [8] X Research source Address him or her professionally by writing \"Dear,\" followed by \"Mr.,\" \"Ms.,\" or \"Dr.\" and the person's last name. Add a colon after the person's last name. If you don't know the person's gender, you can either use a title (such as Dean) or the person's full name in place of \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" The salutation should look like the following example: Dear Ms. Jones: or Dear Dr. Jones: Alternatively, you could write one of the following: Dear Jordan Jones: or Dear Dean Jones: Use \"To Whom It May Concern\" followed by a colon if you don't have a name."

      "title": "Write the body of the letter.",
      "content": "Write the body of the letter. After addressing the college recommendation letter, write the letter in support of the individual applying to college. Keep all text justified to the left, and use a line break between paragraphs."

      "title": "Use a letterhead envelope.",
      "content": "Use a letterhead envelope. Just like with the letter, it's best to use professional letterhead if you have it. A pre-printed envelope looks more polished and authoritative than just a handwritten or even a typed envelope. [9] X Research source If you don't have a letterhead envelope, place your address in the upper left-hand corner, starting with your name on the first line, followed by the rest of the address on the next lines: Ms. Rebecca Johnson Muddy River High School 492 West Lane Big City, Arkansas 73234"

      "content": "Add the recipient's address. The recipient's address should go over to the right on the envelope, centered from top to bottom. Start with the recipient's name. If you don't know the person's name, start with the office, such as the Office of Admissions, followed by the school's name and the rest of the address on the next lines. [10] X Research source The address should look like the following example: Dr. Jordan Jones Office of Admissions College of the Pines 2948 Northlake Boulevard Big Buck City, Oregon 42343"

      "title": "Seal the envelope.",
      "content": "Seal the envelope. Often, a school will require you to seal and sign the envelope to verify that you wrote it. That just means that you sign it over the sealed edge of the envelope before sending it or giving it to the student to send. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mail the letter on time.",
      "content": "Mail the letter on time. Know the deadline for the letter, and make sure you send it in on time or give it to the student. Missing the deadline could mean the student will be rejected for that school. [12] X Research source Some schools will allow you to fax or email the letter. Check with the student to see if that's appropriate. [13] X Research source"
