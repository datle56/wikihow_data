      "content": "Turn your PC off if it gets too hot. If you get a CPU temperature error, try shutting down your PC and letting it cool off. This can help fix the issue, but if there's an underlying issue causing your PC to routinely overheat, you'll need to address that to avoid overheating your CPU again."

      "content": "Make sure your PC is placed in an optimal spot. If your PC isn't in a good spot in your room or office, it could potentially overheat. Check the following list below for some tips: Don't place your PC in direct sunlight. Keep it in a cool, shaded spot (such as below your desk). If you must keep your PC in a bright spot, use curtains to block out as much sunlight as possible. Keep your PC on a flat surface. Don't put your PC directly on carpet, as carpet fibers can block airflow at the bottom of the case. If the only spot you can put your case is on carpet, consider buying a PC tower riser stand to put your tower on. Make sure there's enough airflow around your case. Don't stack things on top of your computer, as this can block fans at the top of your case. If your PC tower is enclosed (like in a desk cabinet) make sure there's ample space around the case to allow heat to dissipate, and make sure the back of the cabinet is open to allow for proper airflow."

      "content": "Keep your PC clean and up-to-date to not strain the CPU. If your CPU has to work harder to run your computer, it can potentially overheat faster. Try these tips to keep your PC clean and optimized: Update your software and operating system regularly. Running software that's one version behind won't hurt the performance of your computer too much, but the longer you wait, the higher the chances that your PC's performance will suffer and strain your CPU. Only run demanding software when necessary. This depends on how powerful your CPU is, but in general don't run a lot of intensive programs at the same time. These programs can include graphics or video software (like Photoshop or Premiere), modeling software (such as Maya or 3ds Max), or certain video games (such as Civilization V or Minecraft). Close unresponsive programs. If a program is unresponsive, your computer will try to get it to respond. This might eat up more resources than necessary, and it's usually better to just close out of the program and restart it if you are still using it. Close browser tabs and programs you're not using. Keep your computer uncluttered by closing out of programs you're not using at the momentâ€”make sure the program is completely closed by opening Task Manager and ending the process, if it's still running in the background. Also close browser tabs you're not using anymore, and consider bookmarking webpages you want to come back to but aren't using at the moment."

      "content": "Open up your tower and clean the inside. Over time, dust will settle inside your PC tower. When this dust covers your CPU cooler or fans, it can decrease their efficiency and reduce airflow in your case. When this happens, your CPU will overheat. Using a can of compressed air, clean the dust out of your PC tower. Make sure to get the fans on the front, back, bottom, and top of your case, as well as the heatsink fans at the top (if you have them)."

      "content": "Make sure your cooling system is still working. If your cooling system (case fans and CPU heatsink) aren't working properly, this can contribute to your computer overheating. Make sure all of your fans are working, and if not make sure they're plugged into your motherboard fully. Also make sure your CPU heatsink is seated properly on top of the CPU."

      "content": "Organize your case to increase airflow. If you have a small case with a lot of big components, airflow will be difficult. Make sure to keep the cables in your case organized to ensure there's no issues with airflow. You may also want to consider getting a bigger case if this is a common occurrence for you."

      "content": "Remove the heatsink and put in new thermal paste. If you use too much or too little thermal paste, it can cause the CPU to overheat. If you removed your heatsink for any reason and had to put on thermal paste, check to make sure you put the correct amount . To remove thermal paste, use rubbing alcohol and a tissue or cotton swab to remove it all. Let the CPU and heatsink dry. Then, place a pea-sized drop of thermal paste in the center of the CPU and place the heatsink on top before screwing it back in. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a new CPU or heatsink. If nothing else works, you may need to replace your CPU or CPU's heatsink. There's a chance one of them is broken, or it always had an issue that never became apparent until now. Make sure to get a CPU and heatsink that fit your motherboard and computer case. If you can repurchase the same CPU and heatsink that your PC had previously, you know those models will work."

The specialist may be able to diagnose the problem more effectively after seeing your PC in person. To find a computer repair shop, look on your favorite search engine. Look for professional shops that have a number of good reviews, or get suggestions from friends and family for repair shops. If you have a laptop and you're getting the CPU over temperature error, going to a repair shop is the best bet. Laptops are difficult to fix on your own as the parts aren't always the easiest to remove or replace."
