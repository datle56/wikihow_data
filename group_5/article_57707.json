      "content": "Get a tape measure and write down the height and width of the space you need to fill on your wall. [1] X Research source Height is the length from top to bottom, and width is the length from side to side. Let’s say your measurement gives a 24” width and a 30” length. It would be considered a 24x30 inch space to fill the requirement. We can use that measurement to work backward and find the perfect size ornate mirror. Why should we work backward from this measurement? For large wall mirrors, most all wood-constructed frames come in standard sizes, which are derived from the size of the opening of the frame, not the outside dimensions. The opening can either hold a mirror, or a picture that is equal to that size. The standard size 24x30 framed large wall mirror contains a frame molding that is various inches thick plus, a mirror that is size 24x30. Thus a 24x30 mirror with a 3” thick molding is actually 24” + 3” (moulding width) + 3” (moulding width) = 30” is the actual outside measurement. [2] X Research source A 24x30 wall mirror with a 4” molding would be calculated as follows: 24+4+4=32 and 30+4+4=38 So, the outside measurement is actually 32x38, even though it’s called a 24x30 large wall mirror. Popular standard ornate mirror sizes are 8x10, 11x14, 12x16, 14x18, 16x20, 20x24, 24x36, 30x40 and 36x48. [3] X Research source Taking these sizes into consideration and working backward will give the ORDER SIZE."

      "content": "Use the molding width in figuring out what size mirror to order. Using the above example, let’s pick a frame that is 3-1/2” thick in molding width. Earlier, we measured a space requirement of 24x30. We prefer a molding 3-1/2” wide. Using those figures and working backward you can find the right ORDER SIZE. 24 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 16” Then, 30 minus 3-1/2 minus 3-1/2 = 23” So 16x23 is the exact dimension you need, but which standard size comes the closest to matching? Of the standard sizes available, the 16x20 most closely matches these requirements, even though the 20” length is three inches short of the target. You might consider ordering the next size larger, a 20x24, but the 20” width is 4” wider than you need, and the 24” length is 1” longer. Check your space requirements and decide which is best for you."
