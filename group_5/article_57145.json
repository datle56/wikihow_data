Your dog may give you big sad eyes as you try to go to sleep, or vocalize displeasure at their new sleeping arrangement by whining or moaning during the night. But avoid giving in to these displays as it will only reinforce behavior and prevent them from getting used to their bed. Yelling at your dog in response to whining may only make them whine louder. If the whining continues after you have ignored it for several minutes, ask your dog if they want to go outside. If they respond and become excited, take them out. Make the trip feel purposeful, a time for your pup to go to the bathroom, not play time. If you don’t think your dog needs to go to the bathroom and is whining due to being in their bed, continue to ignore them whining. Do not try to punish this behavior as this will actually reinforce it. Punishing will show you are paying attention to their behavior. Be prepared for the whining to get worse before your dog eventually stops whining. But commit to ignoring them as it will help them get used to the bed in the long run."

Many dog owners use a spray bottle of water to punish bad behavior in their dog, including sleeping on their bed or on other furniture. But positive reinforcement, where you reward your dog for good behavior rather than punish them for bad behavior, can also be an effective way to train them. Praise your dog if they go to the bed without you leading them or if they lay down on the bed after you command “Go to bed”.
