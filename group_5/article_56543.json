      "title": "You’re more likely to remember something you’ve written down.",
      "content": "You’re more likely to remember something you’ve written down. If you’re in a class, listen carefully to the lecture and write down the keywords and phrases you hear, and if you’re learning something online or from a book, rewrite what you read in your own words. Taking handwritten notes helps you retain information better the first time you learn it, so you don’t have to review it over and over again in the future. [1] X Research source Not only will the process of writing your notes help you learn things faster, but it will also leave you with a cheat sheet of important concepts to review if you need to quickly refresh your memory later. You can even go through and highlight or underline important keywords and phrases so that they immediately stand out when you reread your notes."

      "title": "Hearing yourself repeat things out loud helps you remember them better.",
      "content": "Hearing yourself repeat things out loud helps you remember them better. Oral repetition cuts down on learning and review time because the information is more ingrained in your brain the first time you learn it. If you’re studying from a book, an online source, or your notes, read important keywords and concepts aloud to lock them into your memory. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to learn a new language , practice saying vocab words and sentences as you learn them. Since you’re actively speaking, the information stands out better in your long-term memory. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Quiz yourself so you know what topics you still need to review.",
      "content": "Quiz yourself so you know what topics you still need to review. After you’ve read through or practiced something, test your memory by reciting everything you just learned. If you need to remember keywords or phrases, try writing down their definitions without looking them up. If you have flashcards, use them to test your knowledge. Make a note of what you have trouble remembering so you can go back and practice it some more. That way, you aren’t wasting time focusing on things you already know well. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if you’re testing yourself on a textbook chapter, summarize everything that happened in your own words. Then, check for any keywords at the end of the chapter and try to define them. You can also find many practice tests online for the subject you’re studying."

      "title": "Explaining information to someone else helps you retain it better.",
      "content": "Explaining information to someone else helps you retain it better. As you study the information yourself, try to think about how you would teach it to a friend. What main points would you emphasize? What key facts, definitions, and concepts would you include? Research shows that studying information with the intent to teach it to someone else helps you remember it better and recall it more easily. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source After you study, ask a friend or family member if you can teach them the information, then tell them what you know in a clear and direct way. If you don’t have a friend to do this with, that’s okay! Just pretend that you do. Research suggests that it’s still beneficial to study with the expectation of teaching the information to someone else, even if you don’t actually end up doing it.

      "title": "Mnemonic devices can help you recall information more quickly.",
      "content": "Mnemonic devices can help you recall information more quickly. Dorsey explains that mnemonic devices help you keep new facts in your mind. If you're trying to learn coordinating conjunctions, for example, Dorsey says that the FANBOYS acronym (for, and, or, but, or, yet, so) would be helpful. “The more you practice with [mnemonic devices], the more second nature they become. You can learn them on a Thursday or Friday and know them by Saturday morning.” [7] X Expert Source Ted Dorsey, MA Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 11 December 2019. Mnemonic devices can be sentences, too. For example, if you want to learn the notes on a treble clef, you could use the sentence “Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge” to remember the notes E, G, B, D, and F. If a mnemonic device doesn’t already exist for the subject you’re studying, you can make up your own unique acronym or sentence to help you remember the information."

      "title": "Find a personal connection to the things you’re studying.",
      "content": "Find a personal connection to the things you’re studying. “Find a way to make it apply to you,” suggests Dorsey. For example, if you’re reading a book for English class, try relating some of the plot points to things that have happened in your life. Assess whether any of the characters remind you of friends or family members, and then connect them in your mind. The more you personalize the information you’re learning, “the more likely it’s going to stick,” says Dorsey. [8] X Expert Source Ted Dorsey, MA Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 11 December 2019."

      "title": "Varying your study techniques helps you pick up information more quickly.",
      "content": "Varying your study techniques helps you pick up information more quickly. Doing the exact same thing during every study session can get a bit dull, and if you’re not focused and engaged, you won’t learn the information quickly. Instead, try out new study methods on a regular basis to keep things fresh. Your brain has to adapt to the new situation, which ingrains the information in your memory faster. [9] X Research source For example, instead of just reviewing your notes, try playing a learning game, inviting classmates over for a group study session, or taking a new creative approach to remember the information (like making an artistic poster or writing a study song)."

      "title": "Even a short pause gives your brain some time to refocus.",
      "content": "Even a short pause gives your brain some time to refocus. Your brain gets tired when you overload it with information, so breaks are essential to keep your study sessions productive. Try to give yourself a few minutes every hour to rest and step away from what you’re learning. After giving your brain some time to recharge, it’ll be easier for you to focus and pick up on the information quickly. [10] X Research source Try the Pomodoro technique. Stay focused and work hard for a 25-minute chunk of time, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat the process until you’re done studying. During your breaks, avoid scrolling through social media or surfing the internet—these things can disrupt your focus and make your study break less effective. Good activities to do during your break include hydrating and grabbing a snack, doing something creative, stretching or moving around, having a quick conversation with a friend or family member, or doing a 5-minute meditation.

      "content": "Multitasking makes it harder to remember information. If you’re watching TV, checking your phone, or trying to study two subjects at once, you’re more likely to get confused and have to go back to review the topics later on. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source When it’s time for you to study, get in the zone, eliminate distractions , and focus on only one subject at a time. This will help you cut down on learning time and retain the information better on your first go. If you have a hard time resisting the temptation to check your phone while studying, consider turning it off and putting it somewhere out of reach from your desk or even keeping it in a different room."

      "content": "If you think you can learn something, you’re more likely to succeed. It can be a little daunting to learn something complex, but it gets a lot easier if you trust in yourself. [13] X Research source Whenever you have a negative thought about learning, try to replace it with something positive instead. [14] X Research source With a positive mindset , you’ll be more eager to learn and more confident in your abilities, so you’re more likely to get the hang of new skills quickly. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, if you find yourself thinking, “This is way too much to learn. I’ll never be able to remember all of it,” try to reframe the situation in a more positive way. Tell yourself something like, “This may take a while to learn, but with a little patience and determination, I can do it.” [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Sleeping helps lock in the memories you’ve formed during the day. While you’re asleep, your brain also links the new memories you’ve made to earlier ones, which can help you recall new concepts more easily and quickly. [18] X Research source Because of this, getting some sleep after learning something new will likely be more effective than staying up all night to keep studying. Aim to get around 7–9 hours of quality sleep every night. [19] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source To improve sleep quality, try to follow the same sleep schedule every day, keep your room cool and dark, and avoid devices that emit blue light (like your phone) right before bed.
