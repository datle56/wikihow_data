    {
      "title": "Start with lines (straight or curved) shaped like a star.",
      "content": "Start with lines (straight or curved) shaped like a star. If it’s helpful, make a small dot in the center of your paper, then extend your lines in 5 different directions, like the shape of a star. This represents the skeleton of your starfish, allowing you to add details to its basic form. Use reference images of different types of starfish to make sure your lines are a realistic length. [1] X Research source It’s best to draw with a pencil so you can erase any mistakes you make. For example, if your starfish has long, thin arms, you can make the lines longer. If your starfish is thicker and has shorter arms, you’d make the lines shorter."

      "title": "Use the lines as a guide to create your outline.",
      "content": "Use the lines as a guide to create your outline. Start your new line just above the end of one of the lines you drew in the previous step and trace a star shape around the rest of the lines. Each section between the starfish’s arms should resemble a wide “V.” Decide whether you want a thin or a fat starfish and adjust the lines accordingly: [2] X Research source Thin starfish would have long, narrow arms that connect close to your central point, while thicker starfish would have shorter arms that connect about halfway between your central point and the end of the arm. For a realistic drawing, search pictures of live starfish and use them as references."

      "title": "Add in dots or curved lines to create a unique appearance.",
      "content": "Add in dots or curved lines to create a unique appearance. For a realistic starfish, draw clusters of small circles along the first set of lines you drew, then add some smaller dots to create more depth. Be creative and original with your designs so your drawing catches people’s eye. [3] X Research source Tips for kids: If you want to draw a cartoon starfish, add eyes and a smiling mouth instead of dots. This will make the drawing easier and more fun for young children."

      "title": "Trace your drawing with ink for a professional look.",
      "content": "Trace your drawing with ink for a professional look. Add the ink to the outline of your starfish, then erase any remaining guidelines or unnecessary details. If you’re afraid of making mistakes, make a copy of your drawing so that you can freely experiment. [4] X Research source Alternatively, scan your drawing into your computer, then use art software to trace your starfish. Tips for kids: Have an adult trace the starfish with ink to avoid making a mess. Or, skip this step altogether and get right to coloring!"

      "title": "Shade darkly",
      "content": "Shade darkly in areas that fall under a natural shadow. Conversely, shade lightly in areas that face a light source (like an imaginary sun). For example, if there’s a light to the right of the starfish, you’d include shadows on the left side of your starfish’s legs and body and shade lightly on the right side. [5] X Research source Take a look at a photo of a real starfish. Pay attention to where the shadows are and try to recreate them in your own drawing. Since starfish live underwater, your light source would naturally come from above, so there likely won’t be any shadows on the center of your starfish. Try hatching or cross-hatching with a soft pencil, like a 4B or 6B . To cross-hatch, sketch several lines close together over a shadow and add a second layer of lines going in a criss-cross pattern. Or, use water-soluble pencils and roughly shade over an area, then go back over the pencil with a wet brush to fill in the area. Tips for kids: Skip this step if you aren’t interested in making a realistic starfish. To try shading with crayons, push down harder in some areas to create a darker color."

      "title": "Choose your favorite shades and fill in the details.",
      "content": "Choose your favorite shades and fill in the details. Color pencils or special drawing markers are the best choices for those who wish to color traditionally . Another option is to color the starfish digitally with art software. If you’re coloring with children, use crayons or washable markers and let them choose their favorite colors. If you have trouble deciding on the best colors, use pictures of real starfish as references. [6] X Research source If you're mixing colors , experiment with different hues and ratios until you get the desired tone. Tips for kids: Let your imagination run wild! If you want your starfish to be a more realistic color, try using orange or pink. However, color your starfish any way you want. You can even make it rainbow!"
