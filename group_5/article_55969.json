      "title": "“In queue” refers to a physical line of people or cars in British English.",
      "content": "“In queue” refers to a physical line of people or cars in British English. “Queue” is a British synonym for the word “line.” Rather than saying “I’ll be in line,” a person speaking UK English would say “I’ll be in the queue.” In casual conversation, it usually refers to a line that someone has to wait in. [1] X Research source “Would you mind holding my spot in the queue for me? I have to run to the bathroom.” “I’ve been in this queue for almost an hour.”"

      "content": "“In queue” can refer to a digital waiting line in all kinds of English. If you’re buying tickets for a popular concert online, you and the other concert-goers might be put in a digital “queue” before getting access to the ticket sales page. You might also be put in a queue after logging in for a popular video game. Many streaming services also have a “queue” feature, which lets you put your must-watch shows and movies in a separate category/list. [2] X Research source “I’ve been in queue for this League game for like 10 minutes now LOL” “Went to buy tickets for the big concert and my estimated queue time was 45 minutes…” “There are like 50 TV shows in my Netflix queue right now.” You might hear the word “queue” used with printers, too. If you’re printing something out at a popular printer, your document might be added to a queue of documents. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Although “queue” is primarily a British word, it’s sometimes used in American English, too. For instance, Disney World sometimes has a “virtual queue” feature that let visitors virtually stand in line for a ride while they do a different activity at the park. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Chat about a long line you’re in if you’re using British English. Maybe you got caught in a long grocery check-out line, or there were way more people at the bank than you thought there would be. You could say something like: “Ugh. I’ve been in the queue for so long!” “I’ve been in queue for almost 2 hours now…” American English speakers are more likely to say “waiting in line” rather than “waiting in queue,” but they’ll likely understand what you’re saying."

      "content": "Discuss a digital queue if you’re talking about something technological. “In queue” is more of a universal term in the digital world, so there’s a good chance that everyone will be on the same page if you use it in a technological conversation. “My paper’s in the printer queue right now.” “My favorite online shop is launching a new product, but they put us all in queue so the website wouldn’t crash.”"

      "title": "“In queue” or “in the queue” is the proper form of the phrase.",
      "content": "“In queue” or “in the queue” is the proper form of the phrase. Whether it’s physical or digital, think of a queue like a line. Whether you’re waiting in person, in a car, or on a computer, you are in the line rather than on it. The same principle applies to the word “queue” as well. [5] X Research source What Not to Say: “I’m on the drive-thru queue waiting for my food.” What to Say: “I’m in the drive-thru queue waiting for my food.”"

      "content": "No, a “cue” is a signal to start something, like a performance. The words “cue” and “queue” can be pretty difficult to tell apart sometimes—after all, they sound exactly the same! However, “cue” with a “C” is all about getting a signal to start something, while “queue” with a “Q” is a line for waiting. [6] X Research source “The actor waited for his cue to go onstage.” “My sister waited in the queue for almost an hour.”"
