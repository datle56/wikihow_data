If the car or brake pedal has been shaking when braking, you'll need to have the rotors resurfaced (called \"turning\"), or replace them. [1] X Research source If the car pulls to one side while braking, but stays straight otherwise, you may need calipers. [2] X Research source This is a sign of uneven wear of your brake pads caused by uneven pressure in your brake lines. If the brakes have a grinding noise, this means rotors are done, spent, wasted, or whatever you want to call it, just replace them."

You may need both SAE and Metric sizes of wrenches and sockets, as well as bleeder screw wrenches. Also, you may need a set of hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a hex or star bit socket set. Consider using line wrenches to remove calipers. Theses wrenches have a better bite and reduce the chances of rounding off hex nuts fitting on the hose end."

Caution: a floor jack's wheels need to be able to roll and the jack needs to travel a little and so it must not embed (sink) into a soft floor or surface. [4] X Research source Never work without jackstands that are on solid flat surface like stepping-stones or wide scraps of strong wood to keep the jackstands from sinking, leaning or tilting and falling, etc. Position the jackstands under a solid part of the car — the frame or subframe. You can easily damage the underside of the car, or even break something. Give the car a couple of good hard, small shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift, slide off the jackstands, sink into asphalt, dirt or gravel, or just twist around and fall, better to learn now while the wheels are on than when you're partially under it with the wheels off."

(Some smaller economy-car calipers are simply held together by spring-clips, and it is very easy to remove the pads and to compress the piston without difficulty.) Larger car and truck calipers are much more hefty and are bolted in place. The pads may come out with the caliper, or stay in the bracket, depending on the car. Place the caliper on top of the steering knuckle, or hang it with a piece of clothes hanger wire or any other place where its weight won't be hanging on the brake hose, and will not fall ."

You may need to siphon out some brake fluid from the master cylinder to accommodate the fluid being forced out (by the brake caliper piston). You should remove the cap to the brake fluid reservoir and cover it with a paper towel or rag to prevent any foreign matter getting in there. [5] X Research source Some calipers have pistons that are made of ceramic or other sensitive materials, and merely prying them back with a screwdriver can crack them and require replacing the entire caliper. Consider using a C-clamp or piece of wood to force the piston back and allow the pads to be freed, as described below in installing new calipers. If either pad is down to the metal pins or backing, you'll need to machine (turn) or replace the rotors. This is also a good time to compare the wear pattern of the brakes on the left side of the car to the ones on the right side. If there is a vast difference, you'll need to replace the calipers or rotors. Some rotors easily slide off from the wheel lug bolts, but some are made into the wheel-hub and will require getting into the wheel bearings and grease repacking see below. Modern disc brake pads are ceramic, but older brake pads may contain asbestos, which can be harmful if inhaled in the form of \"brake dust.\" If your brake pads contain asbestos, you can learn about how to clean and/or dispose of them here ."

Try not to remove any of this where applicable. If these parts are dry and not lubricated, consider replacing the caliper, as you will probably notice other damage or signs of problems."

[6] X Research source If the brake rotor and hub are one piece, remove the grease cup, cotter pin, and castle nut from the axle to allow removal. (Only if necessary, unbolt the pad bracket from the steering knuckle.

Call before starting your job to verify hours; most machine shops are only open until noon on Saturday and are closed on Sunday. Rotor/hub assemblies can be turned if they are not badly worn or damaged, but consider replacing them if they are grooved. The shop should refuse to turn them if they are thin or damaged. [7] X Research source The replacement parts may be expensive, especially if you're replacing the hub and its bearings instead of putting the old hub and bearings back on the car. Be aware that not all new rotor/hub assemblies include the bearings (although they may have new races in place, so that you can just \"drop in\" the new grease-packed bearings). You may have to install races and seals yourself, as well as pack them with grease. So a set of bearings may be a necessary purchase as well. When applicable, this is also a good time to repack your front wheel bearings. Refer to your service manual or lubrication guide for this procedure. You'll need some new cotter pins and wheel bearing grease for this, as well as a pair of needle-nose pliers."

If you accidentally switch the left and right calipers and install them on the wrong side (easier to do than you think!), the bleeder fittings will be in a lower position, which will result in trapped air inside the caliper fluid chamber, which will make bleeding the brakes impossible to do.

      "content": "Compress the caliper piston, or in some cases screw them in if necessary. Yes, some caliper pistons (such as some Nissan) do actually screw in and out . If so, there will be notches for a tool to engage the top of the piston. Pressing that kind of piston in will strip the threads and ruin the calipers and pistons. [10] X Research source Using the large C-clamp: if this is the press-in kind of piston, take one of the old brake pads and place it in the caliper against the piston to place the C-clamp against. Usually a heavy duty 8\" to 10\" size (inner measurement) C-clamp will do, (lighter duty clamps will spring, bend or break). Slowly and evenly compress the piston back into the caliper. An even easier way to compress this piston is use a special (but inexpensive and readily available) Lisle Corp Brake Pad Spreader tool (Lisle part #24400 $7.95) made specifically for this — it beats hauling a heavy 10\" iron C-clamp around — plus it's much faster to use! Note: Prior to compressing the piston back into the caliper it's recommended you open the bleeder screw to allow the brake fluid to come out of the caliper while you compress the piston. This keeps the dirty fluid from going up through the brake line and possibly damaging the Master Cylinder and the internal parts of the ABS System if your car has ABS. This also eliminates the mess that may occur from brake fluid that will be forced into the master cylinder."
