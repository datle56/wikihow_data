      "content": "“SAHM” means stay-at-home mom. A stay-at-home mom is a mother who raises her children and manages a household full-time. [1] X Research source It’s often pronounced like “saw-m” or “sam.” This acronym is often used on TikTok and other sites to talk about different parts of motherhood, including the work involved and common misconceptions of being a mom. “People don’t realize that being a SAHM is a full-time job.” “If I was not a SAHM, I'd have to hire someone to do what I do—take care of the kids—like a nanny or daycare center.”"

      "title": "A SAHM is the primary caretaker of their kids.",
      "content": "A SAHM is the primary caretaker of their kids. It’s a full-time job, just one you don’t get paid for. SAHMs are busy 24/7 caring for their children and taking care of the house, from getting groceries and prepping meals to doing laundry and dishes. For many families, it’s necessary work that enables the other parent to work a full-time, paying job that covers the bills, while Mom covers everything else. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Being a SAHM is incredibly rewarding.",
      "content": "Being a SAHM is incredibly rewarding. It’s true that being a full-time parent is exhausting. But it also means you get to watch your child grow up right before your eyes, and you won’t miss a moment of it. You’ll be there for their first steps and their first word, and for many, that’s better than any paycheck. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Being a SAHM can also be lonely.",
      "content": "Being a SAHM can also be lonely. When the only people you interact with for most of the day are your kids, your world can get pretty small. [4] X Research source Yes, children are a joy, but it’s hard to talk to them about grown-up things, especially when you’re in the middle of changing a diaper."

      "content": "Some say being a SAHM isn’t “real work,” but that's not true. Many people assume stay-at-home moms have more free time, or that being a full-time mom isn’t as hard as having a full-time career. The truth is that being a mom is hard work! SAHMs take care of their kids at all hours, with very few breaks. They do everything from preparing meals, feeding their children, and changing diapers to giving baths, managing tantrums, preparing crafts and entertainment, teaching skills and lessons, and countless other tasks.

      "title": "People might think SAHMs lack ambitions or interests, but they don't.",
      "content": "People might think SAHMs lack ambitions or interests, but they don't. Some think that because a mom spends most of her time raising her kids, she doesn’t also have other goals or dreams. While childcare takes up quite a bit of energy, there’s no reason a mom can’t also foster a career, hobbies, or a social life, too. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Some may say that being a SAHM is anti-feminist, even though it's not. Another puzzling notion is that staying home to care for your kids is somehow counter to what a “modern woman” should be. The truth is that having the choice to be a SAHM is just another aspect of empowerment. Not to mention that many SAHMs simultaneously pursue their education and careers on top of motherhood.
