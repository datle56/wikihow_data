      "content": "Find the heart-shaped icon on a user’s pics, bio, or profile prompts. Before writing the compliment, figure out what part of their profile you want to attach the compliment to (between their pictures, bio, or prompts). Then, click on the yellow icon with a heart inside a speech bubble located on the bottom left-hand corner of the feature you want to compliment. [1] X Research source Anyone can send a compliment on Bumble, but compliments count as right swipes—and you only have a limited number of free right swipes per day (depending on whether you pay for the app’s premium services or not)."

      "title": "Write a compliment that’s 150 characters or less.",
      "content": "Write a compliment that’s 150 characters or less. When you click on the yellow icon, a text box will pop up in the app where you can write your compliment. However, keep it short and snappy, because space is limited! Type out a compliment that falls under Bumble’s 150-character limit. Then, press the yellow “Send” icon in the bottom right corner of the text box to send the compliment. [2] X Research source After that, congratulations: you’ve made the first move and complimented someone on Bumble! If you’re able to make the first move and match with someone you send a compliment to, it also counts as starting a conversation. If you’re not able to make the first move, you’ll only be able to message someone if they respond to your compliment."

      "content": "Save your compliments for profiles that really interest you! The number of free compliments you can send is currently limited to 2 per week—so it’s better to use them sparingly unless you’re prepared to pay extra for more (or stop sending them until they refresh the next week). When the compliments feature first launched, users could send 1 compliment per day, but that has changed as of 2024. [3] X Research source If you do choose to buy more compliments, all you have to do is start writing a compliment as you normally would and press “Send.” From there, you’ll be prompted to make a purchase. Any compliments you purchase won’t expire, even if you don’t use them the same day you buy them. Currently, the prices to buy compliments are: 2 compliments for $10, 5 compliments for $20, 15 compliments for $40, or 30 compliments for $60."

      "title": "Compliment them about something specific.",
      "content": "Compliment them about something specific. In other words, don’t just say, “You’re cute!” or “Cool photos!” Instead, pinpoint something specific about them that’s super cool, and point it out in your compliment so they can see exactly why they’ve caught your eye. It also shows them that you’ve actually put some thought into the compliment (and that you’re genuinely interested). Example compliments include: [4] X Research source “This pic is lovely. I love how the light brings out the gold in your eyes!” “Wow, you’re a really great photographer. I love the angle and lighting in this pic! 📸” “You have an awesome fashion sense. This is such a cool shirt!” “Is that your dog? So adorable—and he looks so happy! 🐶” “Gorgeous photo! Your smile lights up the whole room. 😊” If possible, try looking for smaller details in photos—like the design on their shirt or the instrument in the background. It shows you’re looking at more than just appearances!"

      "content": "Deliver compliments in a creative, conversational manner. When you’re complimenting a specific aspect of someone’s profile, get creative with your response. Inject some personality into it, and give them something to build off of if they decide to start a full conversation with you. The more unique and memorable your compliment is, the more likely you’ll be to get a reply! For example: [5] X Research source “Your taste in movies is awesome! There’s one line in particular in The Princess Bride that’s burned into my brain forever.” “Woah, you have so many travel photos and they’re all breathtaking! I’m dying to know what it’s like to visit Scotland.” “You have incredible taste in music! I’m a fan of Paramore, too—I finally got to see them a couple months ago and I was blown away! 🤯”"

      "content": "Follow up your compliment with a question. Compliments can also be conversation starters! Expert dating coach and matchmaker Laura Bilotta explains that “Asking a question shows that you're interested in getting to know the other person and can help keep the conversation flowing.” So, find something to ask about—whether it’s their favorite travel destination, episode of a TV show, or their hobbies. For example: “Love that you quote The Office in your profile! Do you have a favorite episode?” “This beach pic is so beautiful! Where is it?” “Is that a bass guitar in your pic? So cool! What kind of music do you like playing?” “I’m in love with your kitty! 🐱 What’s its name?”"

      "content": "Make sure your compliments stay respectful. While things might get steamy later down the road, once you’ve been talking to someone for a while, a first message to someone isn’t the time to be overly sexual. In addition, avoid objectifying or fetishizing them, since that behavior goes against Bumble’s guidelines. Be kind and respectful to have the best chance of matching with someone! [6] X Research source If you’re not sure whether a compliment is appropriate, that’s probably a sign to revise it or come up with a new one. As long as you’re coming from a place of respectful interest, you should be fine! Be yourself, be sincere, and have fun. According to Bilotta, a genuine compliment can go a long way toward building rapport!"

      "content": "You can view compliments in your potential match feed. When someone sends you a compliment, you’ll see their profile pop up in your potential match feed alongside the compliment. From there, if you like the compliment (and the rest of their profile), you can match with them just as you normally would by swiping right. [7] X Research source If you swipe right, the compliment will appear in your chat, and you’ll have 24 hours to respond to it. After that, your match will expire.

By clicking on it, you’ll be sent to your Beeline, where you can unlock up to 5 compliments per day and view a shortened version of the sender’s profile. [8] X Research source You can only unlock more than 5 compliments if you pay for Bumble’s premium subscription, which offers unlimited Beeline reveals. Beeline shows you people who have swiped right on you, but you haven’t swiped right on in return yet."
