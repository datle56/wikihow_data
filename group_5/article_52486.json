[2] X Research source For instance, say you have 3 liters. Simply multiply 3 liters by 1,000 to get 3,000 milliliters. Therefore, 3 L = 3,000 mL."

      "content": "Remember that milliliters (mL) are smaller units than liters (L). Keep in mind that “milli” means “one-thousandth,” so a milliliter is one-thousandth the size of a liter. Therefore, there will be fewer liters than milliliters. [4] X Research source"

If you don’t have a lot of experience measuring volume in milliliters or liters, that may be because you aren’t familiar with the metric system , and both mL and L are metric units.
