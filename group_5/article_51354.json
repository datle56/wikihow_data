      "content": "Count the number of drinks. In order to calculate BAC using the Widmark formula, you will need to count how many drinks have been consumed in a given period. To be as precise as possible, the number of drinks counted should be based on a standard drink size and alcohol content, rather than the number of glasses, bottles, etc. consumed. This is because the volume and content of drinks vary widely. The standard drink size varies from country to country and from drink to drink. In the United States: The standard drink size of an 80-proof version of a distilled spirit such as gin or whiskey is approximately 1.5 ounces. This is about forty percent alcohol. The standard drink size of a beer with a five percent volume of alcohol is twelve ounces. The standard drink size of a wine with a twelve percent volume of alcohol is five ounces. In the United States, a standard drink contains approximately fourteen grams of alcohol."

      "title": "Find the alcohol dose.",
      "content": "Find the alcohol dose. Once you have the number of standard drinks consumed, multiply that number by 14 to derive the alcohol dose in grams. This will give you the alcohol dose—the amount of alcohol consumed. You can also find the alcohol dose using the formula: (Volume of drinks) x (AC of drinks) x 0.789 = grams of alcohol consumed If your area has a different alcohol content in a standard drink, you will need to multiply the number of standard drinks consumed by that alcohol content in grams."

To do this, use the following formula: BAC as a percentage – (elapsed time in hours x 0. 015)"
