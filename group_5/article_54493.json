      "content": "Scrape the scuff mark with a dull knife if it won’t come out. Scuff marks happen when the suede fibers get too matted down. Use a butter knife or something similar to lift the fibers. Pull the edge of the knife against the grain slowly, taking care not to touch the undamaged portion of your shoe. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a knife, you could also try using a plastic razor or an emery board.

      "title": "Heat creases and stains with steam if you still can’t remove them.",
      "content": "Heat creases and stains with steam if you still can’t remove them. Cover the shoe with a towel. Then, set an iron to the steam function or its lowest possible setting if you don’t have that option. Once the iron gets hot, move it across the towel to make the damaged portions of the suede more pliable. Remove the towel when you’re done and brush the suede out again. Heat can be very damaging for suede, so don’t apply the iron directly to your shoes. Also, keep the iron moving at all times so it doesn’t linger in any spot for more than 3 seconds. Another way to do this is to boil a pot of water on the stove, then hold the shoe over it. Let the steam hit the damaged area, then scrub it with a brush."

      "content": "Blot moisture out of the shoes with a cloth or paper towel. As soon as you notice a liquid spill on your suede shoes, treat it to remove as much of the moisture as you can. Pat the damp areas. Replace the cloth or towel with a fresh one once it gets saturated with water. Keep patting the suede until you are unable to absorb more water off of it. By treating the suede quickly, you can lessen stains before they form. Always dry out the existing moisture before trying to treat any stains you notice."

      "content": "Wait up to 24 hours for the shoes to dry out. Suede becomes more prone to damage when it is wet. You won’t be able to get all the moisture out by patting the shoes dry, so let them air dry on their own. Keep them away from heat and direct sunlight during this time. After the wait, check that the shoes feel completely dry to the touch. The amount of time you need to wait will depend on how soaked the shoes got. If you got caught in the rain, for instance, expect to need to wait the whole 24 hours. Treating the shoes before they dry could lead to cracks in the suede. Don’t rush to treat stains if the shoes don’t feel dry."
