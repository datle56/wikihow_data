      "content": "Hang foil or pie plates around your porch to reflect light. Reflective light creates a visual deterrent for birds since the sun bothers their eyes. Poke a hole in your foil or disposable pie plates and feed a string through it to make a loop. Hang the reflectors on your porch around posts or nails so birds avoid flying or roosting in the area. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Audubon Society Nonprofit environmental organization focused on conservation, citizen science, and public science education Go to source Attach shiny pinwheels to any posts around your porch to make a reflective deterrent that moves in the wind. When the blades spin, the light will reflect in different areas. [2] X Research source You can also use small mirrors or old CDs to reflect light. [3] X Expert Source Roger J.

      "content": "Put a fake owl near your porch to scare off birds. Birds won't go where they may be trouble, so keeping a fake bird of prey next to your porch will be sure to scare them away. Look for a fake owl with a bobbling head so it looks like it's moving in the wind. Once every few days, move the fake owl to a different place to make it seem like it's flown to a new spot. [4] X Research source You can find plastic owls at most home and garden stores."

      "content": "Keep a set of wind chimes near your porch to deter birds with noise. Use metal wind chimes so they also reflect light. Hang the wind chimes near the corner of your porch or near any patio furniture you keep on your porch. [5] X Research source Hang multiple wind chimes 10–15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) apart if you have a large porch."

      "title": "Move bird feeders or birdbaths away from your porch if you have any.",
      "content": "Move bird feeders or birdbaths away from your porch if you have any. Bird feeders and baths attract wild birds to your yard. If you have any, keep them at least 30 feet (9.1 m) away from your porch so birds don't come close to your home. [7] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Get rid of feeders or bird baths entirely so birds are discouraged from coming to your yard."

      "content": "Sprinkle baking soda around roosting areas to keep birds from perching. Coat common perching areas, like eaves or the tops of outdoor lights, with a thin layer of baking soda. Birds don't like the feeling of baking soda under their feet so they'll avoid landing there. [8] X Research source Baking soda needs to be replaced after it rains or gets wet."

      "title": "Choose a narrow set of bird spikes.",
      "content": "Choose a narrow set of bird spikes. Bird spikes are long metal rods attached to a base to prevent birds from landing or roosting and are sold in sets made for either small, medium, or large-sized birds. Choose the narrowest set of spikes since birds that will normally come near your porch are smaller songbirds. [9] X Research source Bird spikes can be found in many home and garden stores or online. Bird spikes are a humane way to deter birds since they do not harm them in any way."

      "title": "Break the base of the spikes or combine multiple pieces to fit your space.",
      "content": "Break the base of the spikes or combine multiple pieces to fit your space. Measure the length of the area you want to attach your bird spikes with a tape measure. To make a long row of spikes, snap the ends of each base together. If you need to make a piece shorter, look for the notched break points along the plastic base. Bend the spikes at their break points to snap them apart. [10] X Research source Many sets of bird spikes are sold in kits that cover 50–100 feet (15–30 m). Choose the kit that works best for the length you need."

      "title": "Glue or screw the bird spikes on areas where birds may land or roost.",
      "content": "Glue or screw the bird spikes on areas where birds may land or roost. Use a caulk gun and clear epoxy glue to adhere the spikes to the area if you want a permanent installation. Place 3-4 dabs of epoxy per 1 foot (0.30 m) of bird spikes. For a less permanent option, use a drill to drive self-tapping screws in each of the base's screw holes. [11] X Research source Although bird spikes aren't sharpened, don't put them in an area where they could harm pets or children."

      "title": "Use gutter clips to install the spikes onto your overhang.",
      "content": "Use gutter clips to install the spikes onto your overhang. Gutter clips should be included in your bird spikes kit so you can hang them over your eaves. Feed the ends of the clips onto the base of your spikes so you have 2 clips per 1 foot (0.30 m). Use the other end of the clip to hang the spikes inside your gutters. [12] X Research source You can easily remove and reinstall the spikes if you need to clean your gutters."
