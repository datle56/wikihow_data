      "content": "Use the tip of a small knife to take a peek inside. When you first start cooking the fish, it’ll have a shiny, translucent color and appearance. As it cooks, the fish will change both texture and color. It’ll become more opaque, meaning it won’t be see-through. Stick the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part of the fish. If it’s opaque all the way through the meat, then it’s finished cooking and ready to eat. Fish like cod and mackerel will be white all the way through. Other fish that have a deeper color, such as tuna or salmon, will be opaque and won’t look translucent when they're done."

      "title": "Fully cooked fish will flake easily.",
      "content": "Fully cooked fish will flake easily. Stick the tines of a clean fork into the thickest section of the fish at a 45-degree angle. Gently twist the fork and check to see if the meat is flaky and opaque. If it is, then you’re good to go! [2] X Research source Try not to shred the fillet. A simple flake test should be enough. Some fish, like salmon and tuna, may not flake as easily as white fish like cod. But they’ll be fully opaque when they’re finished."

      "content": "Use this restaurant secret to avoid destroying a delicate fillet. A cake tester is a specially designed pastry tool used to check if a cake is done baking. Slide the thin metal rod onto the thickest part of the fish and hold it there for 3 seconds. Then, remove it and touch the tip of the cake tester to the skin under your bottom lip. If it’s warm, then the fish is cooked all the way through. [3] X Research source This is a great trick for super delicate fish, such as flounder, which may fall apart if you use a fork to check it."

      "title": "If it’s crispy, it’s done.",
      "content": "If it’s crispy, it’s done. Fish with the skin on should always be cooked skin-side down first so it crisps up. Take a spatula and lift the fish to check the skin. If it’s firm and crispy, it should be finished cooking, especially if it’s a thin fillet. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Cook perfect medium salmon with this simple test. Salmon is at its juiciest when it’s cooked to a medium temperature rather than a fully well-done, which can be dry and chalky. Take a fork or use your finger to gently press down on the top of the salmon fillet. If the flesh separates easily along the white lines that run across it, then it’s ready to go.

      "content": "Follow this simple rule of thumb to avoid undercooking. Measure the thickest part of the fish. Calculate 10 minutes of cooking time for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of thickness. Cook each side for half of the total time so it’s evenly cooked. For instance, if you have a fillet that’s 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, cook it for 5 minutes on each side. [7] X Research source"
