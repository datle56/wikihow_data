      "content": "Give your pet a natural flea bath. The first step to treating your flea-infested pet is to give it a bath. You can take your pet to the vet to get a chemical bath, but if you'd prefer to address the problem with a natural approach, try the following flea bath solutions: Make a rosemary dip. Cover 2 1/2 cups of fresh rosemary sprigs with water and boil for 1/2 hour. Add the rosemary water to a gallon of warm water. While the water is still warm, pour it over your pet. Use soapy water. It may also be effective to use a solution of water mixed with a gentle foaming soap. Bathe your cat or dog carefully using warm water. [1] X Research source"
