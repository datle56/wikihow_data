The device using your iPhone as a hotspot will need to be closer to your iPhone than would be necessary with a traditional Wi-Fi router. [1] X Research source If you're using an iPhone 12 or later with Maximum Compatibility mode turned off, keep the devices no more than 15 feet (4.6 m) apart. For all other iPhones (and iPhones 12 and later with Maximum Compatibility mode turned on), keep the devices within 30 feet (9.1 m) of one another for the best possible speeds. You'll also want to eliminate interference from other devices in range, including 2.4GHz cordless phones and Bluetooth accessories, and remove any physical obstacles (including large furniture) between the two devices."

If Maximum Compatibility is enabled, your iPhone will be a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi access point, which provides slower Wi-Fi speeds than 5GHz. [2] X Research source Disabling Maximum Compatibility forces your iPhone to function as a 5GHz access point, which can give devices faster speeds. Open your iPhone's Settings. Tap Personal Hotspot . If the Maximum Compatibility slider is On (green), tap it to turn it off. This should give devices an instant speed boost if they are in close range. Keep in mind that while 5GHz is faster than 2.4GHz, a 5GHz access point has a shorter Wi-Fi range than one broadcasting at 2.4GHz.

Because your iPhone is sharing its cellular connection rather than its own Wi-Fi connection, cellular network issues can result in a slow hotspot. [4] X Research source Check the top-left corner of your iPhone's home screen to see how many \"bars\" you have—the best time to use your iPhone as a hotspot is when you have full bars. If you have 3 or fewer bars, try to improve your signal by increasing your elevation, moving outside or near a window, or away from physical and electronic interference."

If apps are actively using your cellular connection, the device using your iPhone as a hotspot will have to compete for data. Similarly, if you're playing a game or watching a video on your iPhone, you might be bogging down the processor. Closing apps while your iPhone is acting as a hotspot can free up much-need bandwidth. To close open apps on an iPhone that doesn't have a physical Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the Home screen and pause in the middle of the screen. Then, swipe each of the apps you're not using upward to close them.
