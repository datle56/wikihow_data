      "content": "Loose or broken fuel cap The Check Fuel Cap error on a Honda Accord usually appears when your vehicle’s EVAP system senses a leak near the fuel cap. It could mean the cap wasn’t properly screwed on, the rubber gasket is worn, or there’s damage preventing a tight seal. [1] X Research source Other symptoms: strong gas smell, reduced fuel efficiency [2] X Research source Diagnosis: Open the fuel door on your Honda Accord and unscrew the fuel cap. Inspect the cap for damage, and check the round rubber gasket for cracks or tears."

      "content": "Faulty purge valve The purge valve (or solenoid) is a cylindrical piece next to your vehicle's engine intake and prevents fuel fumes from escaping into the air when your engine is off. When the purge valve fails, it may get stuck open and trigger a Check Fuel Cap warning. [3] X Research source Other symptoms: poor engine performance, rough idling, reduced fuel efficiency, and hard starting after adding fuel [4] X Research source Diagnosis: Connect a vacuum pump to the intake on the purge valve and squeeze the handle. If the vacuum pressure goes down after pumping, then the purge valve is leaking. [5] X Research source"

If the vent valve gets stuck open, your Honda may detect a leak and trigger the Check Fuel Cap message. [6] X Research source Other symptoms: lit Check Engine light, strong fuel smell, gas pump clicks off when filling up [7] X Research source Diagnosis: Disconnect the vent valve from your gas tank and connect the intake to a vacuum pump. If the pressure slowly drops after you squeeze the handle, then the vent valve has a leak. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten the fuel cap. Turn off your vehicle and open the fuel door on your Honda Accord. Check that the fuel cap is tight by wiggling it around. Then, unscrew the fuel cap completely and inspect the threadings for damage. Put the fuel cap back on and turn it clockwise until you hear it click and restart your vehicle. [9] X Research source After tightening your fuel cap, it may take a few drives for the warning message to turn off. If you still see the message after 2 days, then there may be another issue. If you notice any dirt or dust built up on the fuel cap or where it connects to the gas tank, wipe it off with a clean lint-free cloth. The dirt or dust may have been preventing a tight seal. [10] X Research source If your fuel cap is damaged or missing, then get a replacement cap . Typically, they only cost $10–15 USD, and you can install the gas cap on your own."

Disconnect the electric connector and the hoses from the old valve, and unscrew the bolts to remove it. Install a replacement purge valve in its place and reconnect the hoses and wires. [11] X Research source Purge valves typically cost $15–30 USD. You may be able to clean the purge valve with mass air flow cleaner instead of replacing the part."
