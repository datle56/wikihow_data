      "title": "Arrange 3 large bins or bowls next to each other.",
      "content": "Arrange 3 large bins or bowls next to each other. Choose containers that are large enough to hold the clothes that you want to lighten. If you'd like to fade several items, you might want to bleach them individually so you don't accidentally overprocess the clothes. If you don't have 3 bins, you could use your sink or tub and a few buckets."

      "title": "Pour 1 part bleach and 10 parts hot water into 1 bin.",
      "content": "Pour 1 part bleach and 10 parts hot water into 1 bin. Get out a large measuring cup or jug and fill it with as much bleach as you'd like. Pour this into the leftmost bin and then fill your measuring cup with the same amount of very hot water. Add this to the bin along with 9 more parts of hot water to the bin. This creates a bleach solution that's safe for your clothes. [1] X Research source For example, if you're using 1 cup (240 ml) of bleach, add 10 cups (2.4 L) of water."

      "content": "Fill the second bin half full with cold water. Position this bin so it's in the middle of your bleaching station. You'll use this second bin of cold water to rinse the clothes, so don't fill it too full or the water may spill over the top of the bin. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Combine chlorine neutralizer and water in the third bin.",
      "content": "Combine chlorine neutralizer and water in the third bin. Buy a container of chlorine neutralizer from a pool supply store or online. Follow the manufacturer's directions to dilute the chlorine neutralizer with water and pour the mixture into the rightmost bin. Use enough solution to fill the bin half full. [3] X Research source You may also be able to find chlorine neutralizer at some hardware stores."

      "title": "Hold the fabric under hot running water.",
      "content": "Hold the fabric under hot running water. Turn on the faucet and let the hot water run until it's very hot. Then, put the clothes under the running water until they're soaked. Squeeze out the excess water, but don't twist or wring the fabric. [4] X Research source The heat will help open the fibers so the bleach can penetrate the fabric and fade it."

      "title": "Submerge the clothes in the bleach bin for 1 to 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Submerge the clothes in the bleach bin for 1 to 15 minutes. Place the clothes in the bin with the bleach solution and push down until the fabric is soaked. If you only want a light change in the fabric, leave the garment in for a minute or two. To dramatically lighten the clothes, soak the clothes for up to 15 minutes. [5] X Research source Since the soaking time varies so much depending on your clothes, pay close attention so you can remove the clothes as soon as they're as light as you want."

      "content": "Remove the clothes from the bleach and squeeze the solution out. Once the clothes are as faded as you like, lift them up so the solution drips back into the bin. Gently squeeze the clothes to remove the excess solution before you rinse the items. [6] X Research source Remember to keep your gloves on when handling the clothes."

      "content": "Put the clothes in the neutralizer for 10 minutes. Take the clothes out of the rinse water and squeeze the water out. Then, submerge the clothes in the neutralizer solution, which stops the bleach from continuing to lighten the fabric. The neutralizer also reduces the smell of the bleach. [8] X Research source There's no need to rinse out the neutralizer. Just squeeze out the liquid before you machine wash the lightened clothes."

Turn on the machine and wash your clothes with your standard laundry detergent. Then, hang or machine dry your newly lightened clothes.

Pour 1 part of bleach into an empty spray bottle and pour 5 parts of water into the bottle. Then, screw on the spray nozzle. For example, pour 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) of bleach and 2 1 ⁄ 2 cups (590 ml) of water into the bottle for a mild solution.

Keep spraying until the clothes are as faded as you want. You could spray evenly across the fabric for a uniformly faded look or spritz just a few areas that you want to lighten.
