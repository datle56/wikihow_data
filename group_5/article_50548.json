      "title": "This couple's personality differences make it hard to connect emotionally.",
      "content": "This couple's personality differences make it hard to connect emotionally. A Virgo is a very cold sign emotionally since it's ruled by Mercury. This means the Virgo woman will act based on her intellect and logic, but she'll have trouble expressing her feelings. As an air sign, Libra tries to reflect the feelings of his partner. Since Virgo doesn't share her feelings easily, the Libra might bottle up his emotions. Compatibility tip: To prevent the Libra guy from resenting her, the Virgo woman needs to identify what she's feeling and be more open with him. These two need to check in with each other regularly, so they don't have explosive arguments when feelings finally bubble to the surface."

Compatibility tip: Although the Virgo woman's not as romantic as her partner, he should realize that the little thoughtful things she's always doing for him are her way of showing him that she cares."

      "content": "These two signs are skilled communicators, but they have to be empathetic. Libra is the diplomat of the zodiac. He's always trying to bring harmony and understanding to his relationships. Virgo is a great communicator since her sign is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication and information processing. Trouble for this couple can pop up if she's overly critical and always expects to be right. Compatibility tip: It's easy to sensitive Libra and self-sacrificing Virgo to be offended by each other. If they can see issues from the other person's perspective and appreciate their differences, they won't take everything personally, and it will be much easier to talk."
