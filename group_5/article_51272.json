      "content": "Determine the size of the doghouse: Measure your dogs length, then add 12” to determine the width of the doghouse. Add 18” to determine the length of the doghouse. Measure your dog's height, and then add 9” to determine the front of the doghouse and add 3” to determine the height of the back of the doghouse."

      "content": "Once you have determined the size the doghouse, begin by cutting the floor joists using the 2x4's. You will need to cut two joists for the length of the doghouse and three for the width. Butt the length parts up to the width parts making a rectangle. Screw ends together using 3” exterior screws. Center the third width part in the rectangle and screw to secure it. Now you have the frame of the floor of the doghouse."

      "title": "Now to build the sidewalls.",
      "content": "Now to build the sidewalls. Cut ¾ plywood to the width of the doghouse. Measure along the left side, using the measurement determined in step 1 for the front of the doghouse and add 3 ½” to allow coverage of the floor 2x4. Make a mark on the measurement. Then, measure the left side using the measurement determined in step 1 for the back of the doghouse. Be sure to add 3 ½” for coverage of floor 2x4. Mark on the measurement. Next, take a straight edge, line it up to the two marks, and draw a line. Cut along line. This determined the angle of the sidewall. Trace the sidewall on the ¾\" plywood and cut to make the other sidewall. This making both sidewalls the same."

      "title": "Screw sidewall to the floor using 1 ¼ “ exterior screws.",
      "content": "Screw sidewall to the floor using 1 ¼ “ exterior screws. Cut a 2x2 for each corner, the same angle as sidewall. Attach 2x2's to each corner. Cut front and back panels using the ¾” plywood. Attach only the back panels using 1 ¼\" exterior screws. Now cut 2x2 for the top and bottom of the front and back panels. Attach to the back only, this will give you a place to screw the interior plywood to the walls."

Cut 2x2 for edge, this will give a place to put the foam insulation and screw the two peaces together. A piano hinge can be installed on the back and roof to make the doghouse easier to clean."

      "content": "Drill a hole in the back of the doghouse in the corner, down near the floor. This hole needs to be just big enough for the end of the cord to the heated mat to go through. Lay the mat down on the floor and put the cord through the wall. Be sure the cord is all the way outside to prevent dog from chewing it. There you have an insulated and heated doghouse."
