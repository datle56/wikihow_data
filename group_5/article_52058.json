Leather sandals often show spots or discoloration from contact with water, which might look unattractive but isn't \"dirty\" per se. One quick remedy involves a 1:1 ratio of white vinegar and water, which you can light blot on the discolored areas-- this also works on salt stains on leather boots in the winter. [1] X Research source Be sure not to saturate the leather. Dirty sandals carry everything from streaks of mud to deeper stains of oil, wine, or other liquids. You will need to consider the type of stain and desired results to clean leather sandals properly. You may also just want to polish or buff out scratches, scuffs, or other marks. If you only have a small stain, dish soap or liquid hand soap will work fine. Avoid bar soap, which has a higher pH level than leather, [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source and can cause it to dry out. For larger or stubborn stains, try leather conditioner, available at your local big box store or shoe store, or online at most big retailers.

      "content": "Rub away any dirt and other solids. You should always remove any dry debris from your shoes before applying any type of cleanser or moisturizer to the leather. Otherwise, you'll create a muddy mess that will be harder to remove. Use a dry, soft cloth or soft-bristled brush (an old toothbrush will work well) and a very gentle hand. Keep in mind that soft, supple leather can be easily scratched, so if you are wiping off dirt and you use too much force you might actually cause a permanent mark on your shoe."

Although you want to reduce the level of moisture that you're introducing into the sandal, it's important to wipe away any cleaning products from clean sandals. A damp cloth is the best way to do this. If one cloth is not enough to remove the product, use another."

Natural light and sun are the best way to dry leather footwear, but don't place them in direct sunlight. The sun can break down the leather and cause cracking.

[5] X Expert Source Susan Stocker Stain Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Place shoe inside a large zip top plastic bag. Sprinkle the inside of the shoe liberally with baking soda. Seal the bag and leave it overnight. You can also try adding a drop or two of essential oils, like lavender or sweet orange oil, to add a pleasant scent. Put the oil directly on the baking soda before applying to the shoes, not on the shoes themselves. Don't add more than a few drops, as the oil can cause even more problems by sticking to the shoes and attracting dirt. Be sure to wipe out all of the powder before putting the shoes on again.

If you don't have any handy, you can use the little disposable socks available at most shoe stores for customers trying on new shoes. Fill the foot end of the pantyhose with a scoop of cat litter. [8] X Research source If you don't have a cat, ask a friend who does if you can have a bit of litter. You will only need about two cups total, so it's really not worth buying a whole bag. Tie off the pantyhose and stuff it inside the shoe, again leaving it overnight. [9] X Research source The litter is formulated to absorb smells and many brands will also leave behind a nice aroma."

      "content": "Replace your insoles. The smell inside of leather shoes is often contained in the insole, where dirt and sweat get trapped and bacteria cause a stink. Taking out the insoles is often the only way to salvage the shoes. If your insoles are removable, replace them with fresh ones. You can buy insoles based on your shoe size at any big box store or online. Look for a brand that gets good customer reviews and that is specially designed for open shoes. If your shoes do not have removable insoles, you might want to take them to a shoe repair expert. Often a cobbler can cut out the insoles and fashion new ones. This is probably only worth trying if your shoes are expensive and/or no longer available for purchase, since a cobbler will charge quite a bit to replace the insoles in your shoes."

At the end of every day, spray the inside of your shoe with a commercial shoe deodorizer or disinfectant that is specially formulated to kill bacteria. [10] X Research source Look for a shoe spray that is marketed for use in athletic shoes; these are the strongest available since athletic shoes tend to be the smelliest. You can also try making your own natural disinfectant spray from water, tea tree oil, and vinegar, and using this to spray your shoes instead. Be sure you leave your shoes to dry thoroughly before wearing them again. You can place them outdoors on a warm, dry day, but be sure to place them out of direct sunlight. You can also place them atop the dryer or in another warm spot inside."

      "content": "Keep your sandals dry. Leather discolors if it becomes wet, and saturating your sandals can also lead to odor problems. Choose synthetic materials for your rainy-day footwear, such as rainboots or rubber flip-flops. If you want to wear your fancy leather sandals for a special occasion, stash them in your purse or backpack and change when you're inside where it is dry. Be sure to let your sandals air out completely if they do happen to become wet. Place them in a warm, sunny, and dry place until dry. Don't leave them in direct sunlight, though, as that can dry out the leather and lead to cracking. [11] X Research source A window is a good location."

      "title": "Don't allow dirt to get in your shoes.",
      "content": "Don't allow dirt to get in your shoes. During hot weather, dirt, dust, or sand often gets trapped inside sandals. When the dirt combines with your natural foot sweat, it can create a very stinky situation. This can be particularly noxious in humid climates, where moisture in the air contributes to the wet, warm environment in your shoes. This is why people who don't typically have smelly feet might suddenly develop foot odor in the summertime. Wear closed shoes like tennis shoes if you will be walking through sand or dirt, like when you go to a playground or beach. If you want to feel the sand in your toes, take your shoes off, and donâ€™t put them back on until you can wash your feet properly. Be consistent in keeping dirt out of your shoes. It only takes one time for dirt to get into your shoes and create a stink problem, especially if your shoes have a fabric footbed that is hard to clean."

      "content": "Practice good foot hygiene. This might seem like a no brainer, but sometimes stinky shoes are caused by stinky feet, and the only way to address the smell is to take better care of the feet that go in the shoes! Clean your feet with soap and water every day when you get home from school or work, and again before bed at night. Apply a daily foot powder, which will help to absorb odors and reduce sweatiness. You can also try a foot antiperspirant, which can actually help to prevent sweatiness in the first place. To find a good product, try doing an internet search and look for a product with high customer reviews."
