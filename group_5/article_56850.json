      "title": "Combine the dry ingredients.",
      "content": "Combine the dry ingredients. In a large bowl, mix together the sifted flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and sugar until evenly combined. [2] X Research source You could try using other spices, as well, including cinnamon or allspice. Use up to 2 tsp (10 ml) cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) allspice. Similarly, you can use spice blends that combine nutmeg and spices with similar flavor profiles, but you will need to vary the amount based on the proportions of each spice used within the blend. Mix the ingredients together with a mixing spoon or whisk."

      "title": "Cut in the butter.",
      "content": "Cut in the butter. Sprinkle the cut butter over the surface of the dry ingredients. Use a pastry blender or fork to cut the butter into these ingredients, continuing until the butter is evenly dispersed and until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. The butter must be softened and cut into small cubes before you add it to the dry ingredients. Instead of simply stirring the butter into the other ingredients, you need to press the butter into the ingredients so that it can come into contact with the dry ingredients at a better pace. This is easiest to accomplish with a pastry blender or fork. If neither of these options is available to you, you could also use your hands."

      "title": "Combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla.",
      "content": "Combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well-blended. Add the vanilla and whisk again until it, also, is evenly combined with the other ingredients. For a slightly different twist on the traditional flavor, consider using coconut extract instead of vanilla."

    {
      "title": "Gradually combine the dry and wet ingredients.",
      "content": "Gradually combine the dry and wet ingredients. Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the egg mixture inside this well, then gradually mix the dry ingredients from the sides of the well into the center. Continue mixing until the wet and dry ingredients are fully combined. You could also try adding the wet mixture a little at a time, mixing after each addition. Form a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour one-third of the egg yolk mixture in the center. Mix completely, then add another one-third and mix again. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture."

      "title": "Knead the dough",
      "content": "Knead the dough . Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand several times, just long enough for it to become smooth and somewhat elastic. [3] X Research source You should also lightly dust your hands with flour as you work with the dough. Otherwise, they might stick and create more of a mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chill the dough.",
      "content": "Chill the dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it back into its bowl. Place it in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. If the dough seems firm enough, you might be able to skip this step, especially if you can work fast. Chilling the dough allows it to harden up a little, which can make it easier to work with in the long run and less likely to stick to surfaces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll out the dough",
      "content": "Roll out the dough . Place the chilled dough on a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is an even 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick all the way around. Try to keep the dough in the shape of a rectangle as you roll it out. If there are uneven edges, use a knife to trim them away before cutting the main part of the dough into pieces. The scraps of dough should be re-kneaded together and re-rolled after you form pieces from the main portion. Cut additional pieces from these scraps once you roll the scraps back into a workable form."

    {
      "title": "Cut the dough into small squares.",
      "content": "Cut the dough into small squares. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the rectangle of dough into strips that are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide. Cut the dough crosswise into another set of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) strips, ultimately forming 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) squares. [4] X Research source You could make the pieces a little bigger, if desired, but keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternatively, create knots.",
      "content": "Alternatively, create knots. Cut the dough into 2 inch (5 cm) squares. Cut each square in half diagonally, then poke a small hole in the center of each triangle. Carefully pull one corner of the triangle through the hole, forming a knot. To form 2 inch (5 cm) squares, cut the flattened rectangle of dough into 2 inch (5 cm) strips with a knife or pizza cutter. Cut another set of 2 inch (5 cm) strips crosswise, forming the squares."

      "title": "Heat the oil in a deep saucepan.",
      "content": "Heat the oil in a deep saucepan. Pour 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) canola or vegetable oil until a medium skillet or saucepan. Heat on high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). [5] X Research source The saucepan or skillet you use must have a heavy bottom and deep sides to prevent as much hot oil splatter as possible. Check the temperature of the cooking oil using a candy thermometer or a frying thermometer. If you do not have a thermometer, you can check the approximate temperature of the oil by tossing a small piece of dough into it. If the oil immediately begins to sizzle, the oil should be ready."

      "title": "Fry the chin chin in batches.",
      "content": "Fry the chin chin in batches. Add the chin chin pieces to the hot oil one handful at a time. Fry for 3 to 8 minutes, turning only as needed, until the pieces turn golden-brown on all sides. [6] X Research source The small squares will usually only need 3 to 5 minutes. They may not need to be turned during the cooking process, either. The knots may need a bit longer, from 6 to 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to gently flip them over once, after the bottom begins to brown, so that both sides will cook evenly. Watch the temperature of the oil as you cook the chin chin. It may rise once you remove the pieces and lower once you add them. For best results, adjust the temperature controls on your oven to consistently maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius)."

      "title": "Drain on paper towels.",
      "content": "Drain on paper towels. Remove the fried chin chin using a slotted spoon. Place them on a plate lined with clean paper towels to drain off the excess oil. [7] X Research source Repeat the frying and draining steps until the entire batch has been cooked."

      "title": "Preheat the oven",
      "content": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Prepare two large baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or wax paper. Strictly speaking, chin chin should be fried and not baked, so you cannot get a fully accurate taste by baking them. These baking instructions will give you something as close to the traditional taste as possible, though, and are a decent alternative if you are looking for a healthier, oil-free method of cooking the chin chin. Avoid using aluminum foil. If necessary, though, nonstick cooking spray can be used instead of the parchment paper."

      "title": "Bake for 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the chin chin pieces on your baking sheets in a single layer. Transfer the pans into your preheated oven, then bake until the tops begin to turn slightly golden. Make sure that the pieces are kept to a single layer and are not touching. The pieces will stick together if they touch while baking, and they will not cook evenly if they overlap one another."

      "title": "Flip and continue baking.",
      "content": "Flip and continue baking. Flip the pieces over using a spatula. Continue baking them for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until both sides have become golden brown. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Let cool slightly.",
      "content": "Let cool slightly. Remove the chin chin from the oven when done and allow them to cool slightly for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet. The pieces should not be allowed to cool completely. You simply want them to be cool enough to handle."

      "content": "Dust with powdered sugar, if desired. Chin chin are often sprinkled with a little sifted powdered sugar. Transfer the pieces to a serving platter and dust the tops with sugar before presenting them to your guests. An easy way to dust the chin chin with powdered sugar is to use a small sieve. Hold the sieve above the chin chin and place the sugar in the sieve. Gently sift the sugar through the sieve and onto the pieces of chin chin below."
