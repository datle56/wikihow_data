      "content": "Develop your interest in law in high school. You don't have to wait until law school to start gaining skills and experience that will help you in the practice of law. Join your high school's debate or moot court team, and participate in other activities relevant to the legal field. [1] X Research source It doesn't hurt to take Latin if your school offers it. Many legal terms are in Latin, so knowing the language will give you a heads up and keep you from having to memorize a bunch of foreign terms. Take classes such as criminal justice for electives, if offered. These classes will give you an introduction to the legal issues faced by attorneys every day."

      "title": "Get a bachelor's degree from a four-year college or university.",
      "content": "Get a bachelor's degree from a four-year college or university. A bachelor's degree (or an equivalent degree) is a prerequisite for admission to law school. While majors in English, Philosophy, Economics, Business, Psychology, Criminal Justice, and Political Science provide a good foundation for law school, the American Bar Association (ABA) does not endorse any particular major. It's essential to choose a major that interests you the most. The only exception is if you want to practice patent law. In that case, you must major in a scientific or technical field to be eligible to take the patent bar examination. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Bar Association Leading professional organization of lawyers and law students Go to source If you want to practice criminal law, you should look into getting a degree in criminology or criminal justice. If you wanted to work in insurance or healthcare law, a nursing degree is recommended. A business or accounting degree is very helpful for corporate and real estate law. Try to keep your GPA as high as possible to improve your chances of getting into a good law school and potentially qualify you for scholarship money. If your GPA is below average, you will need a higher LSAT score to compensate for it. Avoid too many withdrawals on your transcript. Although law school admissions do not care if you withdrew once or twice, many withdrawals may leave the admission officer suspicious and question your dedication to your academics."

      "title": "Work part-time at a court or law firm.",
      "content": "Work part-time at a court or law firm. While in high school and college, if you can find work at a law firm or a local courthouse, these will give you exposure to legal issues and help prepare you for practicing law. If you know what area of law you want to go into, try to find work in that area. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source Don't worry if you're not sure what area of law you want to practice in yet. You have plenty of time to decide, and many people don't make their final decision until they're already in law school. Use this time to explore areas that capture your interest. It is a good idea to work at a law firm as a file clerk or receptionist so you can see the behind-the-scenes work of what lawyers actually do to help make a more informed decision if lawyering is for you. It is generally advised you do not work as a paralegal because it is a separate career that can be heavy in terms of the workload and hours."

      "content": "Take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). The LSAT is a half-day standardized test that you must take to enroll in an ABA-accredited law school. It is very important to note what makes the LSAT unique is it is a skills test (much like a road test needed to obtain your driver's license), there is nothing for you to remember, but the LSAT makers want to see what you're capable of so it is very important you work on your critical thinking skills right away. [4] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source The LSAT is a measure of your reading comprehension and verbal reasoning skills. You can pick up study guides online or in bookstores. There are also prep classes available that you can attend. Start studying for the test as soon as possible. Do at least 3 practice tests under simulated test conditions before you sit for the actual test. If you receive testing accommodations for a disability, you may request accommodations for the LSAT through the Law School Admissions Council website."

      "content": "Apply to several accredited law schools. After you've got your LSAT scores, you can sign up with the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC). This agency coordinates your test scores, applications, and recommendation letters and distributes them to schools on your behalf. You cannot apply to law schools unless you go through this agency. [5] X Research source Apply to at least one \"reach\" school. This is a school with a low acceptance rate, or one for which your test scores and GPA fall at the low end of acceptances. Choose 2 or 3 schools where your test scores, GPA, and other credentials are competitive. You should fit comfortably in the middle of the range of students accepted by that school. Add on 1 or 2 \"safe\" schools. These are schools where your credentials are at the top end of the range of students accepted by that school, if not above the average range."

      "content": "Dedicate yourself to success in law school. Once you choose your law school, be ready to focus and work hard for all 3 years. Join clubs and groups that are related to your legal interests to study law properly. [6] X Research source Do the readings for each class, and try to give yourself time to review before each class. Most law school professors teach by Socratic method, where they randomly call on students and ask questions about the assigned reading. It's important to be prepared. Take notes and prepare an outline for each of your classes. This will help you study for the final exam. Most law school classes have only one final exam at the end of the semester. Your performance on this exam determines your grade for the entire course. Joining a study group can help you make better sense of the readings and understand the major themes for each class."

      "content": "Graduate from law school with a relatively high rank. Law firms pay attention to class ranks. The higher your ranking in your law school class, the more likely you'll secure a high-paying position at a large law firm. [7] X Research source If you want to clerk for a federal judge, you generally want to be in at least the top quarter of your class. Large law firms typically recruit from the top 30 percent of classes at higher ranked law schools. The lower your law school is ranked, the higher your rank should be in your class to compensate."

      "content": "Decide where you want to practice law. Each state has its own bar admissions process. Choose the state where you want to practice law as soon as possible during your law school career so that you can start preparing for that state's bar. [8] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source It's usually best to practice in the state where you go to law school. Your law school will be well known and there will be plenty of alumni hiring. In addition, law schools typically discuss the law in their state, but seldom the law of other states. If you want to practice law in another state, it will be up to you to learn the law for that state."

      "content": "Start filling out your bar application as soon as possible. The bar application is a hefty, detailed document. In most states, the initial application is 15 or 20 pages long and covers specific details over the last 10 years of your life. It may take you some time to complete it. [9] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source When you get your bar application, skim through it first.

      "title": "Enroll in a bar study program.",
      "content": "Enroll in a bar study program. It's possible to pass the bar without taking any preparation programs or courses. However, bar passage rates are significantly higher among students who take prep courses. The cost of a bar study program pales in comparison to the stress and financial burden of having to take the bar exam twice. [11] X Research source Bar study programs typically cost several hundred dollars. They primarily get you ready for the multi-state bar exam (MBE), the multiple-choice portion of the bar exam. However, they also have practice essays to get you ready for the state portion of the exam. Bar study programs offer tests in simulated test conditions, which makes them the most valuable. The bar exam is a grueling, stressful experience. The more practice you have working under those circumstances, the calmer you'll be."

      "content": "Spend the summer after you graduate studying for the bar. You may have a hard time passing the bar if you just take a single bar study course and do nothing else. Create a study schedule for yourself and spend time each day studying for the bar. Take a practice test under simulated test conditions at least once a week. [12] X Research source If you've accepted an offer from a large law firm, your firm likely has a bar study course and other resources available to you. Take advantage of them. Specific information about the topics covered by your state's bar exam can be found on the website of your state's board of bar examiners."

      "content": "Complete an interview with a member of the local bar. Most states require you to sit down with a member of the local bar, who will ask you questions about your legal interests and why you want to practice law. While this may feel like a job interview, they typically aren't looking to hire you. Rather, they're trying to determine if you have the discipline and character necessary to serve as a member of the bar. [13] X Research source You may also be asked questions about information from your bar application, including your educational background and experience."

      "content": "Take the bar in the jurisdiction where you intend to practice law. If you're approved for admission to the state bar, you've got one additional hurdle. The bar exam is an 18-day multiple choice and essay test that typically takes place over 2 or 3 days. [14] X Research source Unless you live extremely close to the bar exam testing site, it's a good idea to get a hotel room nearby for the duration of the test. This will allow you to focus and not have to worry about making long drives or arranging a ride. If you hold a law degree from (or practiced law) in another country other than Canada, you must refer to your state's bar exam eligibility to see if you qualify."

      "content": "Wait to find out your bar exam results. After you take the bar exam, you'll have to wait several months to find out if you passed. In the meantime, you can start looking for a job (if you don't have one already). While you can't represent clients as an attorney until you've passed the bar and completed your state's licensing process, you can draft legal documents and do a lot of other legal work. [15] X Research source The test results are typically posted online on a specific day, so you can find out if you passed immediately. Your final score on the bar exam typically isn't made available. If you find out you didn't pass you can take the test again. You can take the bar exam as many times as you need to, although taking it more than 2 or 3 times would be quite a setback for your legal career."

      "content": "Take your oath in court. Assuming you passed the bar exam, you will appear in court to be sworn in as a member of the bar. The swearing-in ceremony typically includes everyone else who passed the bar in your area, and you all take the oath at once. [16] X Research source The oath is a ceremony to which you typically can invite family and friends. Afterward, there's usually a reception. Local attorneys come to the reception to meet the newest members of the bar, which can provide you with valuable networking opportunities."

If the professor offers more than one course, take all of them. Go to office hours, and get to know them as much as you can. [18] X Research source In addition to writing reference letters, law professors frequently know practicing attorneys in the area. They may be able to provide you with a connection or introduce you to attorneys in a field you're interested in."

      "content": "Use your law school's career services office. Every law school has a career services office with resources to help you find a job as an attorney. These services are available not just to students but to graduates and alumni as well. [19] X Research source It is in the law school's best interest to have high rates of employment among graduates. The career services office is going to do everything it can to help you find a position and ensure that you succeed."

      "title": "Take advantage of networking opportunities.",
      "content": "Take advantage of networking opportunities. Finding a good position as a lawyer is less about what you know than about who you know. Go to state bar association mixers and other events to meet practicing lawyers who can help you find your place. [20] X Research source Always act professionally at mixers or other events where members of the bar are present. Talk to as many people as you can and get your name out there. If alcohol is available at an event, limit yourself to one drink. Getting drunk or even getting \"buzzed\" won't impress practicing attorneys – even if they are imbibing themselves."

      "title": "Go to informational interviews.",
      "content": "Go to informational interviews. Informational interviews don't necessarily lead directly to a job. Rather, they are a way for you to bend the ear of a practicing attorney and learn more about the local bar and the market for attorneys where you live and want to work. Some informational interviews can lead you to find a mentor, but don't push it. When you meet someone who can mentor you in the profession, you'll feel it."

      "title": "Mail your résumé to prospective firms.",
      "content": "Mail your résumé to prospective firms. Unless you have a job offer when you graduate, you'll likely have to \"cold call\" firms looking for employment. Most of these are done through email. However, if you take the extra step of mailing a paper résumé and cover letter, you'll likely get a better response. Few people go to this extra effort, and it will mean something to the hiring attorneys. [21] X Research source Buy heavier bond paper and put some effort into making your résumé and cover letter look professional. Keep in mind that hiring attorneys typically are older. They may appreciate getting a paper résumé since this is a medium they're familiar with."
