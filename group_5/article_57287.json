      "content": "Measure the width, depth, and length of your mattress. This will help you determine how much fabric you should purchase or cut to size. If you don’t want to buy new material, take a larger flat sheet you already own. So, if you’re making a twin-sized fitted sheet, use a queen or king-sized flat sheet. You’ll only need to measure the depth of your mattress using this method. [1] X Research source You can use an online bed size chart, but be careful. Each mattress may have a different depth. Measure yours to ensure your fabric will fit. Twin-sized sheets: 35 in (W) x 75 in (L) Full-sized sheets: 53 in (W) x 75 in (L) Queen-sized sheets: 59 in (W) x 79 in (L) King-sized sheets: 71 in (W) x 79 in (L) [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut a piece of fabric based on your measurements. Use the formula to cut your fabric to size: Mattress Width + (2 x Mattress Depth) + 16 in and Mattress Length + (2 x depth) + 16 in (40 cm). The additional 16 in (40 cm) will be used for seam allowance and tuck-in, 8 in (20 cm) on each side. An average twin-sized mattress would be 38 in + (2 x 8) + 16 in and 75 in + (2 x 8) + 16 in. If you want to make the process of sewing fitted sheets even simpler, use a flat sheet instead of a large piece of fabric to sew the sheet. If you do this, it may help to level one side of the sheet to the bottom edge of the mattress. This way, you’ll only have to cut two sides of the sheet instead of all four. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your tape measure to measure from the corner of the fabric. Along the mattress’s outer edge, measure over the mattress’s depth and add 8 in (20 cm) from the corner of the fabric. Using a pen or fabric marker, mark this spot. Measure up the depth of the mattress plus 8 in (20 cm) from the marked spot. Put a dot at the spot. Draw a line connecting that dot to the mark on the edge of the sheet. Draw another line connecting the dot to the edge of the fabric on the other side. This will give you a square shape on the corner of your fabric."

In this gap, you’ll be able to thread elastic through to make the fitted sheet snug. [10] X Research source You can also create a casing that goes the entire length of your project. If using this method, you’ll need more elastic."

      "content": "Cut 4 pieces of elastic that measure 16 in (40 cm) long. The elastic is used to cinch the corners of your fitted sheet to your mattress. Suppose you want elastic to run along the edges of your sheet. In that case, you’ll need to calculate the perimeter of your sheet by adding the Width + Length = Amount x 2 = Perimeter. For example, a twin-sized mattress would look like 38 in + 75 in = 113 x 2 = 226. Generally, you want to use ⅔ of elastic for your distance. [11] X Research source To calculate this, multiply 2 x Perimeter. Then divide your answer by 3. For instance, 2 x 226 = 452 / 3 = 150.6 inches (382.5 cm) of elastic. [12] X Research source"
