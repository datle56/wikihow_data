Many national and regional financial institutions offer special checking accounts to consumers who cannot open a standard bank account.

They are typically accompanied by monthly fees, and the financial institutions offering these accounts may require eligible consumers to undertake financial management classes in order to maintain an account. [19] X Research source Some financial institutions will convert a second chance account into a standard checking account after a consistent period (such as 12 months) of financial responsibility. [20] X Research source Every state in the US except New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont has a financial institution that offers some type of second chance checking account.

Many consumers mistakenly believe that ChexSystems denied them from opening a bank account, when in fact it is the financial institution that a given consumer tried to do business with that accepts or declines their account. ChexSystems merely provides financial institutions with a consumer's credit score and financial history. ChexSystems is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, meaning federal guidelines are followed to ensure that any information in a consumer's file is accurate, and that the consumer's privacy is protected. However, mistakes do happen from time to time, which underscores the importance of discovering your ChexSystems file and taking the appropriate actions. [25] X Research source Under federal guidelines, consumers are entitled to one free copy of the ChexSystems consumer report every 12 months. Be aware that the company primarily deals lists negative information. If you request a ChexSystems report and the file they send you is blank, that is generally a good thing. [26] X Research source"
