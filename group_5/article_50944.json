      "content": "Practice by moving through graduated levels. Choose a school team, local club, or district team that you can attend regularly and that has a good coach. The best option would be an academy, known for grooming young players to become professionals. Continue with youth teams every year, progressing to more competitive and selective teams every time you level up. Eventually, move from youth teams to amateur/semi-professional level teams or soccer academies, especially if you're in the United States or Canada. This will help you develop skills to play for a club in Europe, where the world's most elite clubs are. Climb the levels gradually, being sure to play against senior players."

      "content": "Assess yourself as a player. After you've played for a while, seriously look at your skills. Find out what position your innate skills are best suited to. When working this out, don't just think about yourself. Think about how your skills feed into your teamwork, and how your strengths fit into the game as a whole.

A player who is too much of an individual player, or refuses to communicate properly, is a liability on a team and not likely to go far. If your coach notices this, he will most likely bench you. If you are in a tryout, this is especially very unappealing to scouts, regardless of your skills."

      "content": "Be strong mentally . Playing professional soccer is uncertain and unstable. Prepare for short-term contracts, the risks of injury, inevitable aging, little playing time, and loss of skill. These realities can create feelings of insecurity and burnout. [3] X Research source Martin Roderick, <i>A very precarious profession: Uncertainty in the working lives of professional footballers</i>, Work, Employment &amp; Society, (2006),Vol. 20, No. 2, 245-265 Public exposure can be overwhelming if you do make it to the top. This can be tiring and even lead to depression because people expect a top player to play consistently well. Consider seeing a sports health professional or sports psychologist to develop coping strategies if you don't already have these skills soundly in place. Learn early that it's okay to talk things out with someone you trust rather than keeping worries bottled up inside."

You should also show that you can be calm and focused under pressure. Remember to play your best at all times. You never know who's in the crowd."

      "content": "Be prepared to move often. Clubs and agents will expect you to move quickly to meet their wants, without caring much about your personal life or the long-term prospects for your career. Be fully prepared for this and continue to focus on your soccer skills. Before you move, consider: how often you'll be playing, if you speak the language of where you'll be moved if the pay is adequate if the club is challenging and has a good reputation, and if there is good medical treatment if you suffer an injury."
