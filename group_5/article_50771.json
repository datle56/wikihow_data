Imagine yourself achieving your goal in as much detail as you can, and think about the different routes you can take to get there. [6] X Research source For example, if you are interested in traveling around the world, you might set a goal to save the money for a plane ticket and other necessities. Then, to get you inspired to work towards the goal on a daily basis, you might imagine, in vivid detail, yourself arriving at your first destination. Think about the sights, sounds, and smells you will encounter to make it seem as real as possible. Write your goals down to help make them more concrete and read over them daily to remind yourself what you are working towards.

By focusing on the positive things in your life, no matter how small or large they are, you prime your mind to seek out more positive events and stay optimistic. To make gratitude a habit, try keeping a gratitude journal. Every night before you go to bed, take a few minutes to write down several things you felt thankful for that day. You can also use a phone app to help remind you to add to your gratitude journal daily."

Your mind perceives reality in a distorted manner, leading to rumination or persistent obsessing over negative events or experiences. There are many cognitive distortions recognized in popular psychology. Some are listed below. All-or-nothing, or black-and-white thinking- seeing everything in absolutes, either this or that no in-between (e.g. \"If they do not love me, they must hate me.\") Emotional reasoning- attaching your reality to your current emotional state (e.g. \"I feel crappy today, so no one will want to be around me.\") Labeling- identifying shortcomings excessively (e.g. \"I'm a loser.\") Jumping to conclusions- either mind-reading or predicting a negative future by fortune-telling (e.g. \"I saw Chelsea today and she didn't speak to me. She must not be my friend anymore\" or \"I already know I will make myself look like a fool at the talent show.\") Magnification- blowing things out of proportion (e.g. \"I made an F on my English paper. I'm going to fail the class and have to take it over again.\") Should statements- using \"should,\" \"ought to,\" \"have to,\" or \"must\" in your self-talk (e.g. \"I should have known better than to think he liked me.\")"

Doing this gives you power over your thoughts and teaches you to become a constant observer of what's going through your head. If you notice yourself playing into negative thought patterns, try the following strategies: [8] X Research source Start by examining the accuracy of your thoughts. For example, you say \"No one likes me.\" You need to pay attention to see if this seems accurate or not in your life. Consider the evidence. Are you always alone? Do people purposely try to be with you sometimes? Do your friends and family ever comment about how they enjoy your company? Practice mindfulness. It's no fun to beat yourself about your thoughts. When you notice yourself thinking negatively or unrealistically, practice deep breathing and mindfulness . Inhale the positive; exhale the negative. Notice the cognitive distortions, but think of them as ships coming into your harbor. Steer away the negative and allow the positive to safely dock."

Research has found that people who take responsibility for their choices and believe in their own self-control tend to do better at overcoming their difficulties.

Having a clear-eyed view of yourself can help you decide which traits and beliefs are helping you and which ones you need to change. [10] X Research source However, make sure that you do not compare yourself to other people. Just stay focused on yourself. Ask yourself which beliefs, either conscious or unconscious, you hold about the world. Are these thought patterns helping you or bringing you down? For example, maybe you have come to believe that people are incapable of fidelity because your last partner cheated on you. How is this helping you? Will it be a positive contribution to your future relationships? No, it won’t. If you need help coming up with an objective judgment of your personality, ask a trusted friend for their perspective on your flaws and positive traits. Friends can help you to see yourself objectively and point out things you might not notice."

Laying out a concrete, workable plan is the surest way to make sure your goals become realities. Plans don’t have to be complex to be effective. However, a good plan should include a “when” component and a “where” component. Planning when and where you’ll do an activity makes you far more likely to follow through on your commitment. [14] X Research source For instance, instead of telling yourself “I’ll study later tonight,” tell yourself, “I’ll study at the library at seven o’clock tonight.” A great strategy to make habits stick is the \"if-then\" planning method. Put simply, this method states that \"if X happens, then Y should follow.\" X can be a time, place, or event. Y is the action you will take in response to it. For instance, if it's Monday at 7pm (X), you know that you should spend 2 hours at your university library (Y). Research shows that you are 2 to 3 times more likely to succeed at your goals by following this method. [15] X Research source"

Your success or failure has a lot to do with the way you handle setbacks.

If your expectations are unrealistic, then this may cause you to feel disappointed sometimes. Consider whether or not your expectations for yourself are realistic, and if they are not, then consider how you might adjust them to be more realistic. For example, if you always expect to get A+ grades on every test you take, then you might feel incredibly disappointed if you get an A- on a test. However, this is still a great grade, so you might want to adjust your expectations to accept a wider range of grades."

When you’re feeling pessimistic, take a step back from your emotions and think about where your feelings are coming from. If you find that you’re holding onto self-defeating ideas or a negative self-image, remind yourself that these ideas aren’t rational and they don’t have to hold you back. Make sure that you are surrounding yourself with optimistic people as well. You can meet new like-minded people by searching for groups on sites like Meetup.com."

When you start having pessimistic thoughts, ask yourself, “Is this really true?” Often you’ll find that pessimism is driven by emotions that don’t have much to do with reality. Maintaining a rational mindset can help you see these thoughts for the illusions they are. [18] X Research source For instance, if you have the pessimistic feeling that one of your coworkers doesn’t like you, instead of dwelling on the thought, ask yourself why you think that. Is there a more likely explanation? Perhaps your coworker is having a bad day, or they simply have a gruff demeanor."

Remind yourself of the good things you’ve achieved in the past to guide yourself back into a better state of mind. As much as you need to, bring to mind all the accomplishments you have achieved and all the obstacles you have already overcome in your life. Pay yourself on the back for graduating college. Give yourself a round of applause for finally detaching from your toxic best friend."

      "content": "Avoid all-or-nothing thinking. All-or-nothing thinking can easily put you in a negative state of mind because it views any mistake, even a minor one, as a failure. In reality, no one and nothing is perfect. For example, all-or-nothing thinkers may view others as “either you love me or you hate me,” when, in truth, it’s entirely possible to love someone but not like all their habits or qualities. Identify areas of your thinking that match this framework and challenge how realistic they sound. Let go of all-or-nothing thinking by focusing on making progress instead of being perfect. Commit to improving on your mistakes while taking your successes into account, too. Also, be willing to let go of control sometimes and accept that life is unpredictable and uncertain."

If you’ve been feeling down or negative, reach out to someone else – a family member, a friend, a coworker – who can help you get back into a positive frame of mind. Social support is a powerful tool for boosting your hope and optimism, so don’t hesitate to ask others for help when you need it. [19] X Research source Doing something as simple as calling a friend and saying “Hey, I’ve been feeling down lately, do you have a minute to chat?” can work wonders for your state of mind. If you are constantly feeling pessimistic, then consider seeing a mental health professional to help you with this."
