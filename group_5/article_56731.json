      "title": "Fast",
      "content": "Fast . Ramadan is the perfect month to tune up our physical, mental, and spiritual health. If, during this month, we eat only the pure and unprocessed foods that Allah has provided us with (such as fruits, vegetables, wheat, grain, and beans), we can be guaranteed weight loss. The Qur'an says, \"They ask thee what is lawful to them as food. Say, 'Lawful unto you are all things good and pure.'\" [1] X Research source During Ramadan, many people eat lots of unhealthy fried food for iftar; this is a bad habit and will end up making you feel bloated during suhoor, ruining your appetite for the rest of the day."

    {
      "title": "Avoid the excess.",
      "content": "Avoid the excess. This speaks for itself. A good Muslim eats to live, not lives to eat. The Qur’an says, \"eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess\". [2] X Research source The Prophet (peace be upon him) emphasized \"No human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach. Sufficient for any son of Adam are some morsels to keep his back straight. But if it must be, then one third for his food, one third for his drink, and one third for his breath.\" [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Eat satisfying, but small, meals.",
      "content": "Eat satisfying, but small, meals. The remaining food can be saved for later or donated to the poor. It’s important to remember that if you stuff yourself with food, you not only run the risk of gaining weight, but become sluggish and tired. Also, as the Prophet told us, the stomach is the home of disease, and the more unnecessary food you eat, the weaker your immune system may become. We shouldn't stuff ourselves with food just to make ourselves full; we should enough food to last us the rest of the day or to give us the energy for any tasks that may be done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat breakfast.",
      "content": "Eat breakfast. Eating breakfast speeds up the metabolism of the body; it nourishes us early in the day so that we don’t eat meals late and then sleep on them. The Prophet (saw) said, \"Eat your meal at dawn, for there is blessing in the meal at dawn\", and \"there is blessing in three things: the early morning meal, bread, and soup.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Drink sufficient water.",
      "content": "Drink sufficient water. Not only does water aid in weight loss, but it also flushes toxins from the body and hydrates skin so that we glow! The Qur'an says, \"eat and drink from the provision of Allah\". [4] X Research source Instead of drinking unhealthy beverages like soda when you’re thirsty (which, incidentally, slows your metabolism and is a factor in tooth decay), try drinking more water. Try to have 8-10 glasses of water per day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have patience.",
      "content": "Have patience. So many diets are ruined because people lose heart and go back to regular routine. The Qur'an says: \"We will certainly test you with some fear and hunger, and some loss of possessions and lives and crops. But give good news to the steadfast.\" [5] X Research source Persevere and remain steadfast, instead of giving up."

      "title": "Pray the five prescribed daily prayers",
      "content": "Pray the five prescribed daily prayers . As well as their spiritual benefits, the five prescribed daily prayers also provide physical toning benefits to the body and patience is often the greatest test we face when we decide to lose weight."

    {
      "title": "Walk",
      "content": "Walk , walk, walk. Enjoy a good morning walk. Walk to work if you can and have a little walk after every meal. Try to go the long way around to the shops or to and from home. Try to take a hilly street or when you’re walking in the park walk up a hill. Walk in the park after you wake up, as it is very good for a person to take in fresh air and be in natural surroundings. The Prophet (peace be upon him), said \"Give glad tidings, to those who walk to the mosques in the dark\". [6] X Research source"
