      "content": "Ask \"What song is playing?\" to Siri or Google Assistant. After a few moments, Siri or Google Assistant will show you what song is playing in the Snapchat video. Note that on iPhone, your device will temporarily turn up the volume very high so Siri can hear the song. If Siri or Google Assistant can't identify the song, try turning the volume up on your device. If they still cant identify the song and the song has lyrics, try to remember some of the words. Then, search those lyrics in your favorite search engine with the word \"lyrics\" at the end. You can also ask the person who made the video (if you are friends with them) if they remember what song they used."
