      "content": "Wear comfortable clothes. No matter what kind of concert you’re going to, you will want to be comfortable. If your clothes are too tight, they'll be distracting and hard to dance in. Jeans can be great, but if they're skinny jeans make sure they have some stretch so you can move. Shirts or dresses that restrict your arm movement will make it difficult to dance or move through a crowd. When you try on an outfit, move around in it and see if it's too binding."
