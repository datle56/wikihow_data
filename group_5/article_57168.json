      "title": "Make sure your school provides free period products.",
      "content": "Make sure your school provides free period products. Period poverty means that not everyone has access to period products. Having free period products not only helps those who cannot afford them, but also those who may not have any on hand with them. Point out that nobody chooses to have a period, so it doesn't make sense that people should have to pay for them. Ideally, these products should be in all sets of restrooms, including disabled and staff restrooms. [1] X Research source There should also be some at the school office, as well as with the school nurse and any guidance counsellors. There may be trans people at your school who menstruate, so it's a good idea to have a small supply in the boys' restrooms too, but try to have then in a discreet place, such as inside a cubicle. Make sure all restrooms in your school have a bin to dispose of any disposable period products, and make sure it gets emptied frequently enough. Make sure there is a variety of choice so people can choose the right period products for themselves. [2] X Research source This includes reusable products that people can take home and keep."

      "title": "Ensure that sufficient restroom access is permitted.",
      "content": "Ensure that sufficient restroom access is permitted. This not only means people are able to go to the restroom when they need to, but also that there are enough restrooms open in your school. Period products need to be changed often enough to avoid any leaks or infections. While pads can last up to eight hours, and tampons six, they will often need to be changed sooner than that if they get full quicker. Restroom access is important in case people start their periods and need to put on a product or if the product they are currently using is getting full. Not changing products can lead to discomfort as well as leaking. Remind your school of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). This is a rare, but potentially fatal disease that can be caused by wearing a tampon for too long. To minimize the risk, people should be allowed to change their tampon whenever necessary. You may wish to advocate for more restrooms if you feel your school doesn't have enough. [3] X Research source Restrooms should also be regularly cleaned and maintained. Some teachers may be more open to letting people out of class to the restroom if there is a bathroom pass or a sign out sheet."

      "title": "Request that people are taught about menstruation in school.",
      "content": "Request that people are taught about menstruation in school. Periods can start as early as eight, so it is important that people are aware of what they are and how to deal with them. Many people start their periods without sufficient knowledge, which means they end up being worried and stressed when it starts, as well as not knowing what to do. Teaching about periods from an early age not only helps people be prepared for them, but also reduces stigma around them as they get to speak about them more openly. Make sure people have the chance to ask questions too, either directly or anonymously. Period education should be for everyone, not just people who can menstruate. People who can't menstruate will have questions too and need to know about periods so they can support those who have them. Avoid using euphemisms such as \"that time of the month\" or \"Aunt Flo\". This just reinforces the old-fashioned idea that there is something awkward or embarrassing about periods and creates more stigma. Instead use clear, direct language, such as \"periods\" and \"menstruation\". Make sure the person educating about periods knows enough about them so they don't end up spreading myths or misinformation."

      "content": "Get staff training on periods. Many staff, including those who have periods themselves, don't know how to respond to a student being on their period. Having training for all members of staff so they know more about periods, how it can affect students on their period, and how they can help. This means that pupils can have an easier time being open about their period. This includes awareness of conditions such as endometriosis and PMDD. [4] X Research source Make sure that staff know some students may not be feeling their best mentally during or just before their period. [5] X Research source Extending deadlines for certain tasks may help people perform better in school."

      "content": "Take periods into extra consideration for PE . For many people who menstruate, PE can be the hardest part of school. Some people may experience cramps, which affect their performance. Make sure the teachers are aware that not everyone can perform at their best all the time and that some might need time to sit out during some lessons. Unfortunately, some PE teachers might not be sympathetic towards those on their period and reduce it to \"just an excuse.\" For this reason, it's especially important that PE teachers are aware about how periods can affect exercise. If your school does swimming , allow for people to sit out if they are on their period. Although menstrual cups and tampons are an option, not everyone feels comfortable using them, so people shouldn't be forced to in order to participate."

      "title": "Make sure people are aware of the policies.",
      "content": "Make sure people are aware of the policies. Having the school's policies on periods clearly stated means that people are fully aware of what their rights are and are able to hold the school accountable. If the policies are uncodified (not written down), it can be easier for the school to deny that these policies exist or to debate the rules. Having them written down means that people can clearly state if they feel they aren't being met. You should also make sure that the policies are open to being modified if something isn't quite right."

      "title": "Speak to your head teacher.",
      "content": "Speak to your head teacher. Your head teacher is in charge of your school and therefore has a responsibility to take feedback into consideration. It's up to you how you speak to them (face-to-face, through email, or through a letter). Alternatively, you could speak to a deputy head teacher or anyone else in senior management who you believe could help. Keep in mind that your head teacher may be quite busy, so you may want to schedule a time to speak to them."

      "title": "Start a petition",
      "content": "Start a petition . Petitions can either be online or on paper. The purpose of the petition is to show that a specific policy has substantial support. Make it clear on your petition what it is you are advocating for, and share it with the people in your school, as well as parents and members of staff. Make sure every signatory can be identified; this ensures that there is no falsification of signatures and everyone who signs is a verifiable person."

      "title": "Hang up posters and hand out leaflets.",
      "content": "Hang up posters and hand out leaflets . Posters and leaflets are a great method of making people more aware of the issue and letting people know what they can do about it. Make sure that the posters/leaflets are eye-catching and readable so people don't ignore them. If you can, get more people to help with distributing leaflets and hanging posters to make the message spread further and faster. Having more people helping in the design process can also help make the posters / leaflets as effective as possible."

      "title": "Join your student council.",
      "content": "Join your student council . As a member of the student council, you get a say in how the school is run and can express your opinion on certain policies. This way, you can suggest how the school can become more period friendly. You can also listen to other people's suggestions and take them into account. If you are not a member of your school's student council, you can still pass on suggestions or feedback. After all, they are there to represent you."

      "title": "Protest",
      "content": "Protest . If you are struggling to get your voice heard another way, organising a protest can be a good way of getting your school to listen. Let everyone at your school know about the protest (and where and when it will be), and prepare beforehand by making placards . The protest may be more effective if you do it during class time as the teachers will want you to be in class, and a large class walkout can show that you are not willing to ignore the cause. The protest should take place somewhere on your school campus, such as in the school playground or at the entrance of the school. Be clear on what it is you want and what you are protesting for. For example, if your school bans going to the restroom during class, you could protest that. This way, the changes you want the school to make are obvious. Be aware that protesting could get you in trouble. The more people you get involved in the protest, the less likely you are to get in trouble for it, and the more likely people are to listen. Keep the protest peaceful. While you want to make a statement, do not resort to violence or vandalism to do so, as this will just draw attention away from the cause."

      "title": "Get teachers and other members of staff involved.",
      "content": "Get teachers and other members of staff involved. It is likely many members of staff in your school will support your cause. Having their input can be really valuable. On top of this, many staff members have influence on school policies and can help make positive change. Explain what it is you are advocating for and why you are requesting their support. Teachers can also help spread the message to other teachers, so if you are unsure about talking to multiple teachers, you can approach one teacher (or another member of staff) that you feel comfortable speaking to and ask them if they could help spread the message around."

      "title": "Ask for the help of parents and guardians.",
      "content": "Ask for the help of parents and guardians. By asking your own parents/guardians to get involved, and getting other people at your school to do the same, you put more pressure on the school. Parents can phone or email the senior management at school to ask it to implement more period friendly policies. If your school has a parent council, ask for them to bring up the issue to the school."

      "title": "Take action to change the law.",
      "content": "Take action to change the law . If you want to take things a step further, you can campaign to have the law changed so that schools are required to be period friendly. If you do, make sure to be specific in what you want, such as free period products, access to restrooms during class, or more awareness. You can help change the law in a number of different ways, such as contacting a local representative (such as a councillor or MP), protesting , starting petitions , or starting an online campaign. This means that the rules will be changed not just in your own school, but in other schools too, making schools legally bound to be period friendly. If you want to make a change politically, be specific about what you want. \"Making schools period friendly\" is a vague aim, so be sure to specify what exactly it is you want changed."
