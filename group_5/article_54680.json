      "content": "Freezer spells are performed to “ice out” people you’re in conflict with. This isn’t a spell to be taken lightly. This ritual is to be performed only when you’ve lost all hope of becoming friends with your enemy . The spell originates from traditional Hoodoo spirituality and takes advantage of an everyday refrigerator. When successful, it will deter your adversaries so they care less about bugging you—or it may “freeze” them in their tracks so that they can’t bug you anymore, even if they want to. [1] X Research source People might use this spell on exes who are having trouble getting over the breakup and won’t leave them alone, bullies who are making their life miserable, or gossipy folks who refuse to mind their own business. Keep in mind this spell is a last resort: try reaching out to the person you’re having a hard time with and see if you can convince them to lay off before turning to defensive magic. If you’re dealing with someone abusive, put the freezer spell on the back burner and reach out to the authorities for help. Communicate what’s going on to some trusted friends or family. Your safety is paramount, and unfortunately, the freezer spell really can’t guarantee that."

      "title": "People cast freezer spells by freezing items related to the target.",
      "content": "People cast freezer spells by freezing items related to the target. Generally, spellcasters prep for the spell by collecting an item that belongs to or relates to the target, writing their name on a slip of paper, and inserting the totem and the scrawled name into a small container to be frozen in the freezer. Exact instructions for performing a freezer spell vary, especially as the tradition gained traction on social media and became more streamlined to be easier for wider audiences. [2] X Research source Modern spells may also be simplified to be more palatable to more social media users. For example, some older recipes suggest storing hair clippings of the target inside a cow’s tongue coated in the spellcaster’s urine, while many current guidelines merely advise storing the target’s name and belongings in a paper packet doused in vinegar."

      "content": "Some spellcasters add relevant magical herbs to the container. Different herbs are said to hold different magical or spiritual properties—for instance, poppyseed may be added to the spell to make the target confused or forgetful. Not every recipe requires the caster to add herbs, but some spellcasters may opt to do so to make their spell more potent. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "The caster then disposes of the spell after it fulfills its purpose. Once the spellcaster’s target has been iced out (which may take several days or weeks), they may opt to get rid of the container. However, some people prefer to keep the container frozen indefinitely. [4] X Research source People might dispose of their containers by tossing them in the trash, burning them, or leaving them outside for animals to eat (after removing anything that may harm the animal). Keep in mind that freezer spells have not been proven to work. Some folks claim freezer spells have been effective at keeping certain people at bay, but there’s no science backing this ritual."

      "content": "Freezer spells originate in hoodoo tradition. Hoodoo is a spiritual belief system cultivated by enslaved Africans in the Southern United States as a form of resistance against oppression. [5] X Research source It blends traditional African spirituality, Christianity, and indigenous botanical knowledge. Hoodoo continues to be practiced mostly, but not exclusively, in the Black community, with many hoodoo traditions being passed down ancestrally. [6] X Research source Hoodoo is not the same as voodoo, though they’re sometimes used interchangeably and may seem similar from the outset. [7] X Research source Voodoo is an organized religion, including rituals, leaders, teachers, representatives, and services, and 2 discrete branches: the Vodou of Haiti and the Vodou of New Orleans and Louisiana. Hoodoo, meanwhile, is only a form of spirituality, not a religion. It is practiced by individuals, who sometimes call themselves root doctors or root healers."

      "content": "Freezer spells have been around for centuries but gained popularity in the 1930s. Hoodoo practitioners have been performing freezer spells—also called “ice box” spells—since the 18th century using ice harvested from frozen ponds. They understandably grew in popularity in the 1930s and ’40s, when people began to acquire their own electric freezers. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask yourself if you have played any role in the problem. Your problem may very well be due to one person, but before resorting to defensive magic, think over the situation carefully to make sure you can’t take any steps on your own to make things better. Is there any way you may have contributed to the situation, or are there things you could do to stop it from happening? [9] X Research source For instance, if you’re upset that your professor keeps overloading you with extra work, consider they may not realize you need more balance in your life. Talking to them and letting them know how the heavy workload is affecting you may make them pare back. If your ex won’t stop texting you and bothering you, consider if they realize that their behavior is inappropriate and upsetting. It might seem obvious, but people sometimes don’t realize how their actions affect others unless they’re told."

      "content": "Talk to your adversary directly. Defensive magic has a time and a place, but before resorting to it, make sure you’ve exhausted your other avenues. Direct communication with the person you’re having a hard time with could yield a positive outcome, even though it’s super hard to confront people who make us miserable. You might not come out the other side of the conversation best friends, but you might get them off your back. Tell them directly how their behavior makes you feel: “I feel ____ when you ____.” What exactly do they do that upsets you? Does it make you feel angry, scared, low, frustrated? [10] X Research source Rely on “I” language (“I feel this way”) instead of “you” language (“you make me feel this way”). “You” language may make the listener feel defensive. [11] X Research source Set boundaries with them by letting them know what you expect of your interactions in the future: “I won’t tolerate this behavior anymore. I expect to be civil with one another from here on out.” This advice only applies if your enemy isn’t a physical threat to you. You never, ever need to put yourself in a dangerous position to try to “get along” with someone who poses a threat."

      "content": "Distance yourself from your adversary. If possible, avoid your adversary so that you don’t have to deal with them anymore. If the person giving you problems is an ex-friend who won’t stop texting you, block their number. If your professor won’t stop overloading you with work, drop their class and take another one if you’re able to. Consider reporting your enemy to an authority figure if appropriate. For example, if you’re being harassed by a coworker, approach your boss about their behavior if you feel comfortable doing so."
