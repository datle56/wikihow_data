      "content": "Know that error codes i50, i60, and iC0 equal a system failure. See if the error code on your dishwasher falls into the “i” family of possible issues. While there are a variety of different Frigidaire error codes starting with a lowercase “i,” codes i50, [1] X Research source i60, and iC0 all indicate something wrong with your dishwasher’s system overall. If any of these 3 abbreviations pop up, it means that something is wrong with your wash motor, water heating system, or electronic control system, respectively. Resetting the power to the dishwasher usually alleviates these issues. There are other “i” related errors including i10, i20, i30, i40, and iF0, but all of these pertain to leakage and drainage issues instead of a system failure. These can be fixed by checking the drain hose ."

      "title": "Be aware that PF means power failure.",
      "content": "Be aware that PF means power failure. Note that something may be wrong with the dishwasher’s power supply if “PF,” or “power failure,” pops up on the screen. This error will appear any time the amount of power feeding the dishwasher drops or cuts out completely. Don’t be alarmed if you see this particular code, as power failures have many causes, such as power outages. Don’t confuse this error with dP or FL, which refer to drain pump and water valve issues, respectively."

      "content": "Recognize that errors UF, ER, CE, and CL are all related to wiring issues. Make sure you understand what’s wrong with your dishwasher before you go to reset it. Codes like UF, ER, CL, and CE (or Vent Open, Stuck Key, Close Door, and Configuration Error, respectively) mean that something is funky in your wiring system. Before you consult an electrician, see if resetting your machine does the trick. [2] X Research source Don’t try to fix your dishwasher’s wiring unless you’re positive that you know what you’re doing. If you need help at any time, feel free to call Frigidaire’s USA number at 1-800-944-9044, or their Canadian number at 1-800-265-8532."

      "content": "Hold down the cancel button for at least 3 seconds. Find the cancel button on the far-right side of the control panel. To reset the dishwasher, hold this button down for 3 seconds or until the light display disappears or changes. This is the quickest way to shut off your dishwasher without disconnecting the power. [3] X Research source Lingering lights don’t necessarily equal a mechanical issue within your dishwasher. If you’ve just washed a load of dishes, the green “clean” indicator light will stay on even after you open the door."

      "content": "Wait 5 minutes before turning the dishwasher back on. Keep the dishwasher off for several minutes before pressing the “start” button for 1-2 seconds. On most models, the “start” button is located on the upper half of the “cancel” button. If the reset process is successful, then the error code will no longer be visible. [4] X Research source The start button can also be located on the right side of the control panel."

      "content": "Switch off the circuit breaker if turning the dishwasher off doesn’t work. Find the circuit breaker that powers your Frigidaire dishwasher and turn it off for 5 minutes. Disconnecting the power gives the dishwasher a few moments to recalibrate, and can be more effective than simply turning the machine on and off. [5] X Research source Check your home’s schematics if you aren’t sure where the circuit breaker is."

If the screen doesn’t display any error codes, try running a test load with a few plastic or non-valuable dishes on a rinse only cycle. If everything runs correctly, you can use your Frigidaire dishwasher as normal! [6] X Research source Call customer service or a repair service if neither of these methods work."
