      "content": "Use an online calculator. You can calculate your total calorie needs with the number of available online calculators. [2] X Research source These may be easier to use and less complicated than doing the required mathematical equations yourself. You can find a variety of calculators from weight loss and wellness clinics and some medical associations' websites. Make sure you're choosing a reliable website and do not use calculators from blogs or other personal sites. Most of these calculators operate in the same way. You'll input your height, weight, gender, age and activity level. Have this information handy when you calculate your needs."

      "content": "Determine your basal metabolic rate or BMR by equations. Your BMR is the amount of calories your body requires just to perform daily, life sustaining functions. It's the rate of your metabolism or the amount of calories your body burns at rest. [3] X Research source Your body needs a set number of calories just to stay alive and function normally. Anything from keeping your heart beating, breathing or digesting food requires energy in the form of calories. It accounts for the largest amount of total calories burned each day. The BMR equation for the average American woman is: (4.7 x your height in inches) + (4.35 x your weight in pounds) - (4.7 x your age in years). Add 655 to this total for the BMR.. The BMR equation for the average American man is: (12.7 x your height in inches) + (6.23 x your weight in pounds) - (6.8 x your age in years). Add 66 to the total for the BMR. You will use your BMR in the Harris Benedict equation to find out how many calories you burn with activity included."

      "content": "Calculate your total energy expenditure using the Harris Benedict Equation. The Harris Benedict Equation can help you calculate an estimate of how many calories you burn each day by multiplying your BMR by your average activity level. [4] X Research source Multiply your BMR by your activity level. This will give you a fairly accurate number for your daily total caloric intake. If you're sedentary (little to no exercise) multiply your BMR by 1.2. If you are lightly active (exercising about 1-to-3 days each week), multiply your BMR by 1.375. If you are moderately active (exercising moderately and/or play sports 3-to-5 days) multiply your BMR by 1.55. If you are very active (people who engage in strenuous sports or hard exercise 6-to-7 days a week) multiply your BMR by 1.725. If you are extra active (people who engage in very physically challenging jobs or exercise, such as 2-a-day workouts) multiply your BMR by 1.9."

      "title": "Consider body fat percentage.",
      "content": "Consider body fat percentage. More muscular bodies or people that have low body fat and high levels of lean muscle may need more daily calories than more average people. If you're an athlete or naturally have a lower body fat percentage, you may need more calories than predicted by online calculators or mathematical equations. Lean muscle mass burns more calories than fat mass. Eating a small amount more may help you reach a more appropriate calorie goal. Also note that overweight or obese people may overestimate daily calories with the Harris Benedict formula."

If you notice unwanted weight loss or weight gain, revisit your total caloric intake and adjust as necessary."
