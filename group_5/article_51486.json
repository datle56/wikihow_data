      "content": "No, but most gameplay features don't cost money. If you want to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons online with long-distance friends or family, exchange custom designs with other players, or explore their Dream Worlds, you’ll need to pay for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. If you don't need to play online, the game is free to play on your personal device. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, you can play multiplayer if you’re all in the same physical location.",
      "content": "Yes, you can play multiplayer if you’re all in the same physical location. On Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are two multiplayer modes for players without an online subscription: Party Play and Local Multiplayer. Neither of these require Nintendo Switch Online, and they both support up to four players at once. [2] X Research source Party Play is for players who play Animal Crossing on the same Switch. You’ll need your own controllers, but you can play split-screen with each other. (It’s a good option for family members.) Local Multiplayer is for players who all have Animal Crossing on their own individual Switch. You’ll need to be in the same room to play together, but you don’t need to share controllers or screens."

      "title": "A one-person subscription is about $4 USD per month.",
      "content": "A one-person subscription is about $4 USD per month. Nintendo Switch Online lets you play quite a few games online, including Animal Crossing—but it does cost money. A one-month subscription is $3.99 USD a month ($47.88 per year); a three-month subscription is $7.99 ($31.96 a year); and a one-year subscription is $19.99 per year. [3] X Research source The subscription will automatically renew itself by default. If you don’t want to renew your subscription, you’ll need to cancel automatic renewal through your Nintendo eShop account. If you use your Switch regularly and would play online often, it’s cheapest to get the yearlong membership. If you don’t play for weeks or months at a time, though, the one- or three-month membership (without automatic renewal) might make more sense. You can also get a weeklong free trial, but you can only use it once."

      "content": "No; there are no Animal Crossing computer games. Unfortunately, Animal Crossing doesn’t have an official computer or browser edition. Some people have created third-party emulators, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll work properly or be free of viruses. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Yes! Don’t despair if you can’t get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. You can play the mobile version of Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp , for free on your Android, iPhone, or iPad. If your friends have the game on their phones, too, you can add each other and play together. [5] X Research source"
