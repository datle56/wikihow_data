    {
      "title": "Create a New Game.",
      "content": "Create a New Game. Choose New Game and then tap on “Parasite.” If you have a saved game previously, it will be replaced and can no longer be recovered. Select “Brutal Mode” for the level, then proceed to giving your plague a name."
    },
    {
      "title": "Modify the Genetic Code.",
      "content": "Modify the Genetic Code. At this part, you will be able to assign Genetic Code for your Plagues. Genes are unlocked after you have beaten the previous stages. You can refer to the guide below for your Genetic setup, but you can choose whatever you see is effective for this level. Under the DNA Genes, choose “Cytochrome Surge.” This will give you more DNA points whenever you pop an orange DNA. For the Travel Gene, Teracyte is advisable since it increases the chance of your plague to spread by land. It can cross borders as long as there's enough host. The Evolution Gene should be Sympto-Stasis; this will make the plague easier to cure but the symptoms in the later part of the game doesn't increase it's DNA points requirement. This is a very important part of the strategy. You don't have to worry about the Cure percentage in this stage since we will be using the 'undetected' approach until we have spread the plague in every part of world. Choose Genetic Mimic for your Mutation Gene. This will make the Parasite harder to cure, a good choice to counterbalance the Sympto-Statsis' drawback. Lastly, Extremophile is the best option for your Environment Gene. This will give minor bonus in all environments, giving your Parasite a faint boost to enter nations with different types of climate."

      "title": "Start in India.",
      "content": "Start in India. The best and most favored starting country to many Plague Inc. players because of its high population and access to airport and seaport. China is a good alternative, but at some level of the games it shows that China may spread your plague in a very slow pace. Alternatively you can choose Saudi Arabia as it tends to infect the somewhat problematic Madagascar easier, and will spread to India quickly. If you choose India, the very first country that will be infected is most likely China. From there, the plague will spread faster and effectively since there are already a good number of host from India. After choosing your starting country, pop red and yellow bubbles to gather DNA points. Don't forget to speed up your game to fast forward. You can find the option at the upper right of the screen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Symbiosis.",
      "content": "Evolve Symbiosis. Keep in mind that every plague type has unique abilities which can give you huge advantage. Parasite possesses Symbiosis, an ability to make your plague more in tune with the host, making it less likely to be noticed; evolve this until Level 3. Continue popping bubbles until you have gathered enough DNA points. Don't add any symptoms or transmissions yet until you have evolved Symbiosis to its last Level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Cyst and Anaemia.",
      "content": "Evolve Cyst and Anaemia. After you have successfully evolved Symbiosis to Level 3, you can now evolve Cyst and Anaemia. You can find these Symptoms in the DNA Window and then tap on “Symptoms” tab. Cyst is a painful lump containing pockets of pathogen which has a slight chance of bursting which can spread the Parasite. To put it simple, this symptom help increase the infectivity of your plague. Anaemia is a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood which can lead to hypoxia in the organs. This, too, increases the infectivity. Generally, evolving Symptoms at the earliest part will make humans aware of the plague, causing them to do research for the cure before you could even infect the whole world, but with the Parasite's ability, Symbiosis, level 1 and level 2 symptoms are less likely noticed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Air and Water.",
      "content": "Evolve Air and Water. Since we have evolved the Cyst, it's time to make use of its pathogen. As mentioned, cyst contains lumps that releases pathogens when it burst. To add infectivity, we need to evolve Air and Water. These Genes can be found under the “Transmissions” tab. Evolve Water to 1 while Air should be Level 2."
    },
    {
      "title": "Devolve High Lethal Symptoms.",
      "content": "Devolve High Lethal Symptoms. There are chances that the Plague will mutate random symptoms which is fine, since mutated genes doesn't reduce your DNA points, but make sure to devolve any symptoms that has lethal level. “Lethal” will alarm the researchers, causing them focus on creating the Cure to eradicate your plague so make sure to keep Lethal low."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Drug Resistance.",
      "content": "Evolve Drug Resistance. As you have notice, the spreading of your plague is still slow despite having a high level of transmission. The reason to this is that civilians can use medication to fight against your parasite. To stop this, evolve your Drug Resistance to 1. It can be found under the “Abilities” tab. Your plague will dramatically spread to other nation in decent speed, especially in poor countries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Cold Resistance.",
      "content": "Evolve Cold Resistance. One of the obstacles in spreading to other nations is the climate. Evolve your Cold Resistance to Level 2. This will strengthen your Parasite and will be able to spread quickly in cold countries such as Canada, Greenland, etc. Don't forget to devolve symptoms with Lethal. There's no need to evolve the Hot Resistance since you have lay your plague in India; it is already immune to warm climates. Save your DNA points for the later part of the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Hypersensitivity.",
      "content": "Evolve Hypersensitivity. If this symptom hasn't evolve, use your DNA points to do so. Again, this increases the infectivity of your plague. After this, return to your game and pop more bubbles and wait until all the nations are infected, or until a message “There are no healthy people left in the world” appears on your screen."
    },
    {
      "title": "Evolve Major Lethal Symptoms.",
      "content": "Evolve Major Lethal Symptoms. As soon as you receive a message announcing that there are no healthy people left in the world, it's time to evolve the deadly symptoms. Go to your “Symptoms” tab and then evolve the following: Paralysis, Total Organ Failure, and Coma. This will start killing people and cure will start to increase, as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use Your Extra DNA.",
      "content": "Use Your Extra DNA. As the population starts to decline, you will receive a generous amount of DNA Points. Use this to evolve Internal Hemorrhaging, Hemorrhagic Shock, and Necrosis. Don't worry about the cure percentage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your Cure Low.",
      "content": "Keep your Cure Low. All nations will be working together in order to create a cure. Stop this by evolving the Genetic Hardening Ability and Genetic Reshuffle. This will reduce the cure amount which will increase your final score. Before the cure reaches 50%, humanity has been eradicated by your killer Parasite. Congratulations, you won the game!"
