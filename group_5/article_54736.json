If it is enabled, it means that once you choose the wrong pink slip after the contest with Angie, you can never go back and try to right your wrong. On the other hand, with autosave disabled, you can keep retrying till you end up with the elusive pink slip!"

Since Angie’s Dodge Charger R/T is a Muscle, a great way to beat her is to race her in a Tuner with upgraded engine performance. This will give you good speed and acceleration while retaining the good handling of Tuner cars and allow you outrun her on the corners."
