You’ll encounter Cynthia, the Lake Guardians (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit), and Cyrus on your way down, who you’ll eventually battle. After the fight, chat with Cynthia and let her restore your team.

Giratina is a Ghost/Dragon-type Pokémon, so it’s naturally weak to Dragon-, Ghost-, Ice-, and Dark-type moves. Giratina’s moveset includes Ominous Wind (Ghost-type with 15 PP), Ancient Power (Rock-Type with 5 PP), Dragon Claw (Dragon-type with 15 PP), and Shadow Force (Ghost-Type with 5 PP). [2] X Research source Shadow Force allows Giratina to disappear for 1 turn, and then come back and deal damage on its next turn. [3] X Research source This is a great opportunity to switch out your Pokémon or heal up whichever one you have in battle."

[8] X Research source If you come prepared with lots of different Pokéballs, you should have no trouble successfully catching Giratina. If you end up killing Giratina by mistake, simply reload your save and try again! Worst case scenario, you can always rematch Giratina later in the game after you’ve become the Pokémon Champion (in Turnback Cave)."
