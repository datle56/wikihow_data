      "content": "“Down bad” most often means that someone is desperate for sex. When you see someone on Twitter say they’re “down bad,” it usually means they’re going through a serious drought of the birds-and-bees business, a lack of lovin’, a dearth of doin’ it—they haven’t had sex in a while, we mean, and things are getting desperate. [1] X Research source So desperate, in fact, that it makes them act strangely or irrationally. Examples: “We have to find you a partner, dude. You’re seriously down bad.” “I can tell she’s down bad because she keeps flirting with everyone.”"

      "title": "“Down bad” sometimes refers to someone’s strong desire.",
      "content": "“Down bad” sometimes refers to someone’s strong desire. “Down bad” isn’t always sexual. Sometimes it’s simply used to express how totally, hopelessly, head-first-in-love someone is, like when talking about an intense crush. Often, however, that crush is unrequited, which causes some serious love pangs or mopey behavior. Examples: “Carl is down bad for Catherine, but she keeps rejecting him.” “Mary only came to Janice’s party because she’s down bad for her.”"

Examples: “Would you stop making eyes at every guy we see? It’s so obvious you’re down bad.” “Sorry I’m acting so weird, I’m just down bad.”"

      "content": "Down bad originated sometime around 2009. Usage of “down bad” can be traced back to tweets made in at least 2009, but back then it wasn’t about someone’s lack of sex.

It wasn’t until later that “down bad” earned its sexual connotation. [3] X Research source In 2019, the song “Down Bad” by Dreamville ft. J.I.D, Bas, J. Cole, and Nudy revitalized the term’s popularity."
