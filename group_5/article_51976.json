If your veins look green or yellow, you are warm toned. If they look purple or blue, you are cool toned. [2] X Research source If you have cool undertones, you tend to look best in cool colors like blue, gray, and silver. If you have warm undertones, you tend to look best in earthy, warm colors like brown, gold, and dark green."

This will help you further refine which colors look best with your undertone. [3] X Research source Dark-Cool: You have cool undertones and dark hair without reddish highlights. Try bright, vibrant jewel tones like turquoise or indigo. Avoid warm pastels, like peach and soft pink. Light-Cool: You have cool undertones and blonde or light brown hair without reddish highlights. Try pale, cool colors like baby blue and lavender, and avoid saturated, earthy tones. Warm-Dark: You have warm undertones and brown hair with reddish highlights or dark red hair. Try earthy, saturated colors like gold, olive, and rust. Skip the bright red shades. [4] X Research source Light-Warm: You have warm undertones and blonde hair with reddish highlights, bright red hair, or golden blonde hair. Try soft, pale colors like ivory and powdery pink. Skip harsh, saturated colors like deep black or navy. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider your eye color. Nothing is more dramatic in style than wearing a dress that brings out your eyes. You can also match your dress to your eye color. For example, if you have deep blue eyes, you could make them stand out with a deep blue dress. [6] X Research source Blue, green, and hazel eyes look great when paired with lighter colored dresses. Dark, earthy shades tend to make brown and very dark eyes look nice."

      "content": "Remember that some colors look good on most people. Black or darker shades of gray are another failsafe, and there’s a shade of white or off-white that flatters just about everyone. There’s even a shade of red for every skin tone. [7] X Research source All it takes is to match your undertone. For example, a warm red will suit a warm undertone, while a cool red will suit a cool undertone. If white looks too stark on you, try going a shade darker, like ivory. If black looks too harsh, try a dark gray instead."

Shade (light/dark) and undertone (warm/cool) are not iron clad rules; plenty of people fall somewhere in between, and some colors can look good with unexpected shades and undertones. Bottom line: if you see a color you like, try it on. It just might look fabulous on you. [8] X Research source Spend some time trying on different dress shades in the fitting room and getting a feel for how certain hues look on you. Photograph of yourself in different colored dresses. Sometimes, it's easier to decide what looks good based off of a photograph than a reflection in a mirror. Consider getting other people's opinions, but remember to take them with a grain of salt. There's a difference between honest, helpful advice and hurtful bullying."

There are other ways to sneak the color into your outfit. The further away from your face a color is, the less it matters if it flatters your coloring. Wear an unflattering, trendy color at the bottom of a long dress or in your tights. Wear unflattering but trendy colors in accessories away from your face like shoes or bracelets. Sometimes a little more makeup will do the trick too. Concealer, foundation, and blush can help tired, sallow skin look more lively. As a result, you’ll look better in more colors.

      "content": "Decide what message you want your dress to send. Some colors convey symbolic meaning. If you want to subtly convey a message to your date, host, or somebody you know you’ll see at the event, color might be the way to do it. Some colors can even evoke physical responses in their viewers! For example: Red conveys emotional intensity and passion. It can suggest sexuality and lust, and is also very effective at grabbing attention. Orange conveys enthusiasm and creativity. It is also visually stimulating and suggests heat. Yellow conveys joy and energy and also draws attention. Be careful not to overdo it, however; too much yellow can be overwhelming and might not be flattering on you. Green conveys nature, growth, and fertility. It can make people feel safe and stable. It is also the color of money. Blue is associated with calmness and loyalty. Try pairing blue with warm colors, like red or yellow, for more impact. Purple is historically associated with royalty, so wearing purple conveys power, wealth, and luxury. It is also associated with magic. White is most often associated with purity. It conveys innocence and perfection—as long as you can keep it clean! Tip: Unless you’re the bride, don’t wear a white dress to a wedding. Black conveys power and confidence. It’s hard to get more elegant than a black dress with a perfect fit."

Wearing a neon green mini-dress to a black tie event will get you some dirty looks—and may get you kicked out. Dark colors are standard for formal evening events, but if you want to stand out and draw attention, wear something bright instead. [11] X Research source Prints and patterns are better for casual or daytime events, so an evening gown should be made out of solid-colored fabric.

For example: If you’re going to a luau, bright, tropical colors will fit perfectly into the theme. If you’re going to a celestial-themed formal dance, a metallic-colored gown—maybe even one with sequins!—will remind people of the stars, moon, or sun."

      "content": "Consider what your date is wearing, if you have one. While you’re not necessarily expected to match your date perfectly, some color-combinations can be cringe-worthy and should be avoided. If you’ll be spending the bulk of the night with one person, and especially if there will be photos, you might want to ask your date what he or she is wearing to make sure that you won’t clash with each other. If one of you is wearing a neutral color like black, white, gray, brown, or navy, you’ll probably be fine. Keep in mind that some darker shades of blue and brown don't pair well with black. If both of you are wearing bright colors, you could get into trouble. For example, bright shades of red and purple, can clash and ruin the aesthetic. Red and green are generally a no-no combination, unless you’re going to a Christmas party. Have your date send you a photo of their outfit (or at least the color) so that you can check that you won’t clash. If both of you are in love with your outfits and they happen to clash, wear them anyway! You can even make a joke out of it and introduce yourselves as “The Clash.”"

      "content": "Take your body shape into consideration when choosing color. Different colors can change the way your body looks because of the way the eye takes them in. There are lots of tricks you can use to draw attention to or from certain body parts or attributes. Wear darker colors in places you want to look smaller. For example, if you’re self-conscious about your hips, a dark skirt will make them look slimmer. [14] X Research source Wear bright or light colors in places you want to accentuate. For instance, if you want to draw attention to your chest, choose a dress with bright colors around the bust line. This can also help draw attention away from areas that you don't like. Wear a solid-colored dress under an open jacket of a different color. This will create a “column” effect, which can help hide a bigger midsection. You can also use a well-placed shawl or scarf, as well. Draw attention to your face, by wearing flattering, brighter colors as accents near your face. Colors that match or complement your eyes and lighten your face are especially effective."

      "title": "Consider the cut and your body type.",
      "content": "Consider the cut and your body type. Women come in all shapes and sizes, and every shape looks best in something different. The key to choosing a dress that will look fabulous on you is knowing your body type and finding dresses that work with it. You’re not doing yourself any favors if you insist on wearing your “dream” dress even though it’s not flattering on you. Busty women have large breasts, but narrow hips and straight waists. They look best in dresses that draw attention to their faces and balance out their lower halves with a full or A-line skirt. Watch out that your skirt doesn’t get too short; it’ll make you look top-heavy. [15] X Research source Pear-shaped women have wider hips and smaller breasts, with a well-defined waist. To create a balanced look, wear a dress which is strapless or has an open neck and has embellishments and detail around the neck or bust. A fitted waist is best, and a full or A-line skirt which is knee-length or lower will hide your wide hips—if you want to hide them. [16] X Research source Apple-shaped women have long, slim legs and a short, undefined waist. Wear an empire-waisted dress to elongate your torso and draw attention to your top half with an embellished neckline. A full or A-line skirt will draw attention away from your torso, and a short skirt will allow you to show off your gams. Slender women are thin throughout their bodies. Wear a fitted dress to emphasize your lean frame. To add curves to your silhouette, try an empire waist. A slit or an asymmetric neckline will also work for this. The hourglass figure has proportionate bust and hips with a well-defined waist. If this is you, pick a dress which will accentuate that waist, with a fitted bodice and V- or open neckline. Hourglass figures look great in both full and form-fitting skirts. [17] X Research source Petite women are 5’3” or shorter. If this is you, an asymmetric hemline will make you look taller, and shorter skirts are generally more flattering. V- necks and vertical prints will make you look longer. Very long skirts—and especially long, full skirts—will usually overwhelm your frame and make you (and your legs) look shorter. [18] X Research source Showcase the parts of your body that you’re most proud of. If you love your back, a dress with a low back or a beautiful keyhole will attract attention there. If you’ve got great legs, a shorter skirt or half skirt will let them take center stage."

      "title": "Think about length.",
      "content": "Think about length. Depending on the event, some lengths may night be considered appropriate. If you’re going to a formal event, you will generally be expected to wear a longer dress (slits are generally okay, as long as they’re tasteful). At a more casual event, or a semi-formal event which calls for a cocktail or party dress, shorter skirts are acceptable, again, as long as they’re tasteful. Don't worry about the season, since the material and color will make up for it. For example, you can wear a short, velvet dress in winter or a long, cotton dress in summer."

      "content": "Learn the color wheel. The color wheel is exactly what it sounds like: a big circle broken into different colors, which allows you to look at 12 colors at once. Each color on the wheel represents all shades of that color, so the green wedge on the color wheel represents dark, pale, and bright greens. Once you know the tricks of the color wheel, it can be super useful for figuring out which accessories in which colors will work best with the color of your dress. [19] X Research source Start out by picking the color on the wheel closest to the color of your dress. The color across from your dress color is its complementary color. A pair of complementary colors is vibrant and high-contrast, especially if you use bright shades of the colors. You should accessorize with complementary colors in small doses. The colors next to your dress color are its analogous colors and pair well together. Choose one color to dominate (the dress) and one to support it (shoes, scarf, bag). If you want to use the third color, use it as an accent (small jewelry or details). You may find it helpful to print out a copy of the color wheel and hang it up on the inside of your closet door. That way you can refer to it easily whenever you need to. It’s generally a good idea to keep your outfit down to three main colors or fewer. [20] X Research source"

It’s a nice chance to experiment with different colors or styles without having to spend any money. This covers both accessories that you already own and accessories that you plan on buying. If you're bringing your own accessories from home, notify the shop keeper so that they don't think you're stealing. Be aware that not all stores allow you to bring accessories into the fitting room.
