Skip this step if you already have a table of inputs and outputs. Take the left value (the x value) of each ordered pair and place them vertically in the left column (input) of a 2 column table. Repeat for the right values (the y values), placing them in the right column (output)."

      "content": "Move a vertical line across the graph. Use a straight-edge (like a ruler or another sheet of paper) to move a vertical line (parallel to the Y axis) across the entire graph. If the vertical line hits two or more points at the same X location, the relation is not a function. In other words, if two or more points have the same X value and different Y values, the relation is not a function. The relation is a function if you move the vertical line across the graph without hitting two or more points at the same time."
