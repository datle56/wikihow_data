      "content": "All you need is white vinegar and a soft cloth! You'll have the easiest time cleaning the cooktop if you wipe it down after every use. Fill a spray bottle with white vinegar and spritz it on the cooktop once you turn it off. Then, wipe the entire surface with a damp soft cloth. That's it! [1] X Research source This is best for keeping your cooktop free of crumbs, smudges, and dust. If you've got grease, stains, or food messes, plan on using a ceramic cleaning product. Vinegar is great for removing hard water stains. You can also use a melamine foam eraser with vinegar to get rid of tough hard water stains."

      "content": "Yes—it's a good way to prevent accidental burns. You might think that because an induction cooktop doesn't heat the surface like an electric cooktop you can simply start cleaning. However, it's a good idea to turn off the cooktop and wait a few minutes so you don't accidentally get a burn if you're wearing a metallic bracelet or wristwatch while you're cleaning.

      "content": "Scrape off stubborn burnt bits with a razor. We've all been there—you look away from the stove for a second and food bubbles over onto your cooktop. Remove the hot pot and turn off the burner. Carefully hold a razor at a 45-degree angle to scrape up the burnt bits.

Always check the razor first and don't use it if it's bent or chipped."

      "content": "Apply ceramic cooktop cleaner and wipe it off with a soft cloth. Use a gel or cream ceramic cooktop cleaner that has citric acid in it and squirt about 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of the cleaner directly onto the dirty induction cooktop. Take a soft, clean cloth and rub it across the surface. Then, take a clean damp cloth and wipe it over the cooktop to remove the cleaning product. Take a second to buff the surface with a soft dry cloth. [5] X Expert Source Ashley Matuska Professional Cleaner Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. [6] X Research source You can buy ceramic cooktop cleaner from hardware stores or online."

      "title": "Try a non-abrasive cleaning powder to lift surface scratches.",
      "content": "Try a non-abrasive cleaning powder to lift surface scratches. You may notice dull, white marks on the surface of the cooktop if you've used it for a few years. These are actually tiny scratches, not stains, so vinegar and ceramic cleaner won't be very effective. Spritz water on the cooktop and sprinkle non-abrasive cleaning powder over it. Use a soft cloth to rub the product in. Then, take a damp cloth and wipe it clean. [7] X Research source The non-abrasive cleaning powder can help fill in tiny scratches so they're not as visible. These cleaning powders don't have silica, quartz, calcite, or feldspar, which can all scratch the surface of your cooktop. To prevent white haze caused by scratches, don't slide your cookware back and forth across the induction cooktop."

      "content": "Skip the glass cleaners which can damage the cooktop. Window cleaning spray has ammonia which can permanently stain the flat surface of your cooktop. Instead, reach for white vinegar to clean your cooktop. Vinegar is a weaker acid, but it's a great, natural cleaner. [8] X Research source You should also avoid chlorine-based products that are designed to lift stains since these are also too tough for your induction cooktop."

      "content": "Avoid using harsh products or cleaning tools which can damage the cooktop. It's really easy to accidentally scratch or stain your induction cooktop, so reach for soft cloths instead of steel wool, coarse scrubbers, or abrasive cloths. Stick with vinegar or approved ceramic-cleaning products and avoid ammonia when you clean. [9] X Research source Take care not to drop things on the cooktop or use it as a cutting board."

      "title": "Use smooth, flat cookware and don't drag it across the cooktop.",
      "content": "Use smooth, flat cookware and don't drag it across the cooktop. It's tempting to just slide a pot or pan onto a different burner when you're cooking, but resist the urge! Your induction cooktop is glass with a layer of quartz that can scratch easily. To move pots, simply lift them and set them down carefully on a different spot. Try to avoid cookware that's rough or uneven on the bottom, too. [10] X Research source For example, cast iron skillets can be too rough for your smooth induction cookpot. Use ceramic cooktop cleaner after you finish cooking. This can remove tiny particles of food debris or dirt that can eventually lead to scratching or pitting."
