Rinse your hair with hot water and use a dye brush to apply the homemade mixture evenly. Let it sit for 5-15 minutes before blow-drying to check the color. [4] X Research source You may need to do this more than once to get the desired results. Add 1 tbsp (14 g) of hair bleach powder to the original recipe to create a stronger mixture.
