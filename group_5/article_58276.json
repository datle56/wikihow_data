      "content": "Pisces’ power colors are light, seafoam green and aquamarine. A zodiac sign’s power color brings out their best qualities, natural strengths, and helps them stay true to themselves. For Pisces, oceanic light greens or green-blues are where they feel most at home. In particular, seafoam green is soothing and healing for Pisces’ kind and sensitive soul—it radiates vitality, suggests new and exciting beginnings, and reduces this emotional sign’s insecurities and anxieties. [1] X Research source Seafoam green mixes the grounding energy of the earth with the deep and mysterious oceans. This combination of lifegiving green and spiritually vibrant blue helps emotional Pisces feel renewed and ready to show empathy and vulnerability in their relationships. Similarly, aquamarine combines green and blue and is a very prosperous color for Pisces. It’s also Pisces’ primary birthstone. [2] X Research source In Vedic astrology, Pisces’ power color is yellow. In this astrological practice, Pisces is ruled by Jupiter (not Neptune), which radiates bright and powerful shades of yellow and orange. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Turquoise and other shades of blue Pisces is a water sign symbolized by two fish and ruled by Neptune (a deep blue planet). All of these factors make most shades of blue very lucky and peaceful for this sensitive sign. Turquoise, which combines both blue and green, is particularly special, as is any oceanic shade that resembles the waters of the sea. [4] X Research source These can include hues like gray or blue-gray, green-gray, blue-purples like indigo, or even lavender. Lighter blues, like sky blue, are more positive and can make Pisces feel tender or soft. Darker shades are more powerful and make Pisces feel elegant or extravagant."

      "content": "Wear clothes and jewelry with seafoam green, blues, or other lucky colors. The fastest and easiest way to feel more confident and at peace is to simply wear your power color.

[7] X Research source Pisces are often colorful, musical, fashionable, or artistic in some way. Feel free to get creative with your shoes, nail colors, jewelry tones, and outfits!

      "content": "Decorate your home with blue-green walls, furniture, or decor. Calming seafoam green and other oceanic colors work wonders in the kitchen, living room, or bathroom, so try painting one wall as an accent color or incorporating blue-greens into your furniture, wall art, or other decor items in these rooms. If you prefer the blue side of blue-green, use shades of blue in the bedroom to promote tranquility and restoration . Try adding small pops of pink, orange, or yellow to a room with throw pillows, curtains, accent blankets, or other knick-knacks you can put out on display. If you prefer neutral shades in your house, choose gray-blues or gray-greens for a more subdued (but still spiritually beneficial) look. Prioritize these colors in a room where you need help feeling calm or focusing, like a home office or creative studio. Decorating according to your zodiac preferences can soothe your mind, keep you on-task and motivated, and even help you get material or financial gains. [8] X Research source For example, you could deck out your home office with orange office supplies, or paint your home gym light green for energetic and healing vibes."

      "content": "Fill your home with green plants and pink, orange, or yellow flowers. Like seafoam green, green plants radiate life and vitality and are soothing and inspiring for Pisces to look at. In general, keeping plants indoors can reduce stress and anxiety, sharpen your attention and productivity, speed up recovery time from an illness, and increase your overall happiness and life satisfaction. [9] X Research source This is extra true for Pisces, who sometimes needs the grounding earth energy of plants to calm their watery whirlpool of emotions. Try adding plants with pink, orange, or yellow blooms and flowers. [10] X Research source These bright colors may be too overwhelming for Pisces to feature as their primary decor colors, but a few accents here and there can brighten their mood and increase their energy."

      "content": "Steer clear of dramatic, bold, dark colors like deep reds and black. These colors encourage negativity for Pisces and exacerbate their sometimes turbulent emotions. Dark red symbolizes rage, anger, and wrath, which can make it hard for Pisces to express their feelings in a productive way and continue to mature emotionally. Similarly, black makes Pisces feel distressed and represents depression, aloofness, and pessimism. [11] X Research source If you’re a Pisces, this doesn’t mean you can never wear or be around these colors. If you feel yourself getting agitated in their presence, do some breathing exercises to center yourself or find a soothing green or blue object to focus on."
