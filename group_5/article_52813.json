It is assumed that you already have some knowledge of the 5 parameters often used in finance: FV (future value), PV (present value), Rate, Nper (number of periods) and PMT (payment). The function of this calculator is, given any 4 of these parameters, to calculate the 5th parameter. You also may need to include type. In Excel, type is either 0 or 1. The type is 0 if payments are due at the beginning of the period. The type is 1 if payments are due at the end of the period."
