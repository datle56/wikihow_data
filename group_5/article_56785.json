      "title": "Follow the product’s instructions for charging it the first time.",
      "content": "Follow the product’s instructions for charging it the first time. Most lithium-ion batteries come pre-charged. Typically, you’ll start using them immediately and will charge the battery before it drops below 50%. However, read and follow the instructions included with your product to make sure your battery is properly charged. [1] X Research source Some batteries need to be hooked up to a charger when you turn on the device."

      "title": "Charge your battery often rather than letting it run all the way down.",
      "content": "Charge your battery often rather than letting it run all the way down. While some older batteries may get damaged if you charge them too often, lithium batteries function better if you keep them charged. Hook the battery up to its charger as often as you can to prevent it from getting too low. [2] X Research source If your battery gets too low, it may die completely. This is actually a safety feature of lithium batteries, which can explode if they get too low in power."

    {
      "title": "Use a battery charger that’s made for lithium-ion batteries.",
      "content": "Use a battery charger that’s made for lithium-ion batteries. Lithium battery chargers include a component that allows them to adjust the charge depending on how charged the battery is. Using a proper charger reduces the risk of damaging your battery. Whenever possible, use the battery charger that came with your battery. If you lose your charger or need to borrow one, check that it’s made for lithium batteries. When a lithium battery is fully charged, the charger will adjust to reduce the flow of the current. Additionally, the charger might open up the battery to release some of the power so the battery isn’t over charged."

      "title": "Allow your battery to go down to 5% once every 30 days.",
      "content": "Allow your battery to go down to 5% once every 30 days. While it’s usually best to avoid running down a lithium battery, nearly draining it once a month may help extend its life. This helps maintain the life cycle length of your battery. Monitor your battery to make sure it doesn’t go down below about 5%. Once it hits this point, hook it up to a charger. [3] X Research source Don’t let the battery die out completely, as it may not take a charge anymore. Lithium batteries may become unstable once they completely discharge, so they’re usually manufactured with a fail-safe that makes them completely die before they get too low."

      "title": "Don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged up.",
      "content": "Don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged up. There’s no harm in leaving your lithium battery-powered devices, such as laptops or phones, plugged into their chargers. Your battery won’t be damaged because the charger automatically adjusts to a trickle charge. Leave your device plugged up if you like. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your battery or device away from temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F).",
      "content": "Keep your battery or device away from temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F). When lithium batteries get hot, they naturally start to lose power and become less efficient. Do your best to keep your batteries away from heat sources, and never leave them in a hot area. This will prolong the battery life and keep your battery charged for longer. [5] X Research source For instance, don't leave your device or the battery itself in a hot car, either the cabin or the trunk. Similarly, don't place your device or battery near a radiator, a hot electrical item, or a heat source. If it's hot outside, it's best to avoid using your device while you're outdoors, as it might overheat."

      "title": "Protect your battery and device from extreme cold.",
      "content": "Protect your battery and device from extreme cold. Your battery will function best at room temperature, which is between 20 to 24 °C (68 to 75 °F). [6] X Research source However, it's okay to use and charge your battery at temperatures as low as 0 °C (32 °F). Don't leave your battery or device in an area where you know it'll be exposed to extreme cold. If you're going to be in a cold environment, wrap up your device and hold it near your body to help warm it. For instance, you might keep your phone in your pocket if it's really cold outside. Don't store your devices outdoors or in an unheated room if it's freezing outside. Similarly, don't put your phone or laptop right in front of an air conditioning vent."

      "title": "Put your device in the shade rather than direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Put your device in the shade rather than direct sunlight. Leaving your device or battery sitting in the sun will raise its temperature. This can overheat and drain your battery, which might cause long-term damage. Place your device in a covered or shaded area when you're outdoors or in a vehicle. [7] X Research source As an example, don't place your device on the passenger seat of your car while you're using it. Similarly, don't place your charger near a window."

      "title": "Take regular breaks while using your device to prevent overheating.",
      "content": "Take regular breaks while using your device to prevent overheating. When you use your device, the battery naturally heats up because it's expelling energy. If the battery gets too hot, it can become less efficient and may drain faster. Give the battery time to cool off by taking a break when the battery or device starts to feel hot. If the battery or device feels hot to the touch, it's time for a break. If you're in a hot environment, you'll likely need to take more frequent breaks. Make sure your device’s vents aren’t blocked by anything. Setting a hot device on a bed or couch sofa, for instance, can cause it to overheat even more and wear out the battery."
