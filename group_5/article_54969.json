      "content": "Use a mole specific trap. These traps tend to be the most effective method of ridding your yard from moles. You can purchase these traps online or at your nearest hardware/home center. These will typically be spring-loaded traps that will require you to assemble and set up in an active tunnel. Look into these popular types of mole traps: Lure traps. This style of trap is an easy and quick one to set up. Set up the trap by placing it firmly in the middle of a tunnel. You won't need to dig anything up, but instead, shove it into a tunnel using your shoe. Circular rodent traps. These types of traps are more economical and can work for gophers and rats as well. For this trap you'll need to dig up the mound carefully. Then place the trap into the mound and seal any cracks that release light with dirt. Loop choking style traps. This type of trap probably requires the most work, but the community suggests it is very effective once you get the hang of it. You'll need to cut two slots into an active tunnel. The trap is then lowered into the tunnel in a way that the choker loop is ready to catch unwanted moles."

      "content": "Gas the moles. Unless you are a trained professional, you should not use any type of gassing agent other than dry ice. You should also avoid using anything that becomes poisonous when it comes into contact with water. These can be very dangerous, and even fatal. If you do decide to use a gassing agent, you'll need to be extremely careful. If you successfully gas a major nest or repeat gassing them, you should have positive results. You can find different types of gas solutions, such as \"Revenge Rodent Smoke Bombs\" or \"Whole Control\". [2] X Research source If you have children or pets, take precautionary steps to ensure they are not exposed to the gas."

      "title": "Use a mouse trap.",
      "content": "Use a mouse trap. Mice and moles are about the same size, so mousetraps can be effective for capturing moles. Prepare a piece of bait when setting up the trap. Then, place the mousetrap at the opening of a mole tunnel. Check back on the trap several hours later to see if it has captured any moles. If nothing's been caught, it's possible the trap was not concealed well enough, or the moles have moved to a new tunnel."

Nest boxes look like a large bird house that attaches to a tree high off the ground. Once you assemble the nest box, set it up high in a tree and fill it with straw. It's only a matter of time before an owl is attracted to it. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Trap the mole using shovels.",
      "content": "Trap the mole using shovels. This will require a lot of time waiting around from you. First, pat down the mole trail by walking over it. This will allow you to notice when the mole is actively using the tunnel. Wait nearby for the mole to begin moving around. When you notice the mole, enclose this section of the trail off with two shovels. This will trap the mole. Throw a trashcan or a large bucket over the trapped mole, and then scoop it up and transport it away from your lawn. Keep in mind that this method is probably the least effective option. Try other methods first."
