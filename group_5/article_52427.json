      "content": "Measure the angle. Place the origin hole of the compass on the angle’s vertex, lining up the base line with one of the angle’s rays. Look at the degree mark where the other ray falls. This will tell you the degree measurement of the angle. [1] X Research source For example, you might measure an angle that is 160 degrees wide. Remember that protractors have two sets of numbers. To know which set of numbers to look at, think about the size of the angle. Obtuse angles are greater than 90 degrees, and acute angles are less than 90 degrees."

      "title": "Divide the number of degrees in half.",
      "content": "Divide the number of degrees in half. An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. [2] X Research source So, to find where the angle bisector lays, divide the number of degrees in the angle by 2. [3] X Research source For example, if the angle is 160 degrees, you would calculate 160 2 = 80 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {160}{2}}=80} . So, the angle bisector is at the 80-degree mark of the angle."

      "content": "Draw a point marking the measurement of the bisector. Again, line up the origin hole with the angle’s vertex, and line up the base line with one of the rays. Find the halfway point using the protractor. Mark this point in the angle’s interior. [4] X Research source For example, if the bisector of a 160-degree angle lies at the 80-degree point, you would find the 80-degree mark on the protractor and draw a point at this location in the angle’s interior."

      "content": "Draw an arc across both rays. Open the compass to any width, and place the point of the compass at the angle’s vertex. Swing the compass so that the pencil draws an arc that crosses both rays of the angle. [6] X Research source For example, you might have angle BAC. Place the compass tip on point A. Swing the compass so that it draws an arc intersecting ray AB at point D, and ray AC at point E."
