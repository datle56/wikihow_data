      "content": "Career and job questions are classic conversation starters.

From there, you could ask other questions too—like what they do as part of their job every day. “What’s your favorite thing about your current job?” “What’s the worst job you’ve ever had?” “Is there one job you’d never ever do?” “What type of job do you want after this one?” “What energizes you about your career?” “Do you get along with all your coworkers?”"

      "content": "Ask about their favorite shows—and why they like them so much.

      "content": "Bring up reading and ask them for a few book recommendations. Once you know what their favorite books are, ask them what makes them the best, or ask for a synopsis of the plot.

Which ones?” “Do you prefer audiobooks or paper books?” “What’s the fastest you’ve ever read a book?” “How many books would you say you read every year?” “Who is your favorite author?”"

Why?” “Have you ever seen your favorite team play live?” “What’s your favorite sport to play personally?”"

      "content": "Pets are a lighthearted topic that often sparks more exchanges. If your new acquaintance has a pet, keep the conversation going by asking to see a photo—or, if they don’t have a pet and you do, you could be the one to show them a pic.

What were their names?” “What kind of activities do you do with your pet?” “Is your pet clingy or super independent?” “Do you want to get a pet? What would it be?”"

      "content": "A person's indulgences can also tell you a lot about their values. You never know what kind of answer you’ll get—they might splurge on fine teas or pay for a monthly subscription to indulge their love of comic books, for example.
