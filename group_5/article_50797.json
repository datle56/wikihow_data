      "content": "It’s a slick way to let them know you’re paying attention to them. Casually drop something they did or that they’ve recently accomplished in a message and compliment them for it.

      "content": "It’s an easy way to get them engaged and responding to you. Try sending them a choice between 2 options and ask which one is better.

A little fun frustration can make you look confident and smooth. [4] X Research source Try texting, “Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Which is better and why?” You could also try something really silly like, “So, I need to settle this. Is cereal soup? It has all of the properties, what do you think?”"

      "content": "Poke a little good-natured fun to get them smiling. Show them you aren’t a suck-up or trying hard to get them to like you. Prod them a bit with your texts so they’ll see how cool and confident you are. For instance, you could try, “So you’re good with numbers? What are you, some kind of nerd?” You could also try, “Yeah the new pizza place is good, but I know you hate cheese and deliciousness, so you probably won’t like it.”"

Yes, I have the sense of humor of a 50-year-old dad.”"

When they see it, they’ll smile, appreciate that you get them, and probably be excited to respond. [9] X Research source For example, if they’re huge Star Trek fans, you could send a meme with Captain Picard and say something like, “Thought you might like this” with a winking emoji. You could even make a meme out of an inside joke that you have with them using a meme-making app if you’re feeling extra creative."

Use questions to heat up the conversation by asking them what they’d like to do with (or maybe to) you if you were together right now. You could also send a risqué photo of yourself and ask them what they think about it. Show them how confident and into them you are and they may just take the bait and play along with you. [12] X Research source For instance, you could send, “What would you do to me if we were alone together right now?” You could also send a shot of yourself in a bathing suit and say something like, “I feel slightly overdressed.
