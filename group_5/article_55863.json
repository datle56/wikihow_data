However, these things can give you some big clues as to whether you're experiencing allergies or if you might have a cold or another illness. Specifically, check these things: [5] X Research source The color of your mucus: If you have allergies, it should stay clear. If you have a cold, it will get thicker, cloudy, and yellow. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Type of cough: If you have a nagging, dry cough, chances are, it's just allergies. On the other hand, if you're coughing up mucus, it's likely a cold, although it could also be a virus like the flu or COVID-19. Sore throat: If you're sick with something like a cold or the flu, you'll often get a sore throat, but that's uncommon with allergies. Fever: Severe allergies can sometimes lead to a fever, but it's pretty rare, and you'll likely have other severe allergy symptoms. Fever is much more common with illnesses like a cold or the flu."

Note anything you ate or drank, whether you touched any animals, any lotions, soaps, or cosmetics you used, and anything else you can think of that might be relevant. You might even write down what you were wearing—you could be allergic to a certain fabric or laundry detergent. [7] X Research source In addition, write down where you were—like whether you were indoors or outdoors. Try to think back for at least a couple of hours before your symptoms occurred. Allergies symptoms usually show up pretty quickly after exposure to your allergen, but they can sometimes take a while to develop.

Although it's fine to discuss your allergy concerns with your primary care provider, it's best to see an allergist for further testing and treatment. At your first appointment, go over your allergy diary with your allergist. They'll also likely talk to you about your family history, and they may do a physical exam. [9] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source Your allergist will likely recommend testing to determine exactly what's triggering your allergies.

During this test, a drop of an allergen will be placed on your skin (usually your arm or back), then the allergist will prick your skin gently. They'll usually test several different substances at once. If the location of the prick turns red, you're likely allergic to that substance. This can be a little uncomfortable, but don't worry—it's not painful. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If the results of your skin prick test aren't clear, the allergist might do a second test where the allergens are injected under the first few layers of your skin. This is called an intradermal test.

If you've ever had a severe food reaction, it's probably not safe to do an elimination diet at all. Your allergist might also recommend an oral food challenge, where you'll eat small amounts of a trigger food to see if you have a reaction. Because you could have a life-threatening allergic reaction, this should only ever be done in your allergist's office or a hospital setting, and only under direct medical supervision.
