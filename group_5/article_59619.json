      "title": "Sagittarius risings are honest, intellectual, and adventurous.",
      "content": "Sagittarius risings are honest, intellectual, and adventurous. Sagittarius is the sign of wisdom, education, and experience. If you’re a Sag rising (a.k.a. Sagittarius ascendant), you live your life authentically and with a sincerity other signs relish—as long as you’re not offering your opinions too bluntly, which, let’s face it, you’ve probably been known to do. Above all, you’re kindhearted and idealistic, and absolutely restless with wanderlust: the world is big and exciting and we only get one life, so why not spend it learning new things and exploring new horizons? While your sun sign refers to your motivation and ego, your rising sign represents the energy you put out into the world. Basically, it's the \"you\" people first see when they meet you. Sagittarius rising quick facts: Element: Fire Modality: Mutable Ruling planet: Jupiter Symbol: Centaur Celebrity Sag Risings: Nicolas Cage, Winona Ryder, Jodie Foster, Brad Pitt, Oprah Winfrey, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kim Kardashian, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Gloria Estefan."

      "title": "Optimistic",
      "content": "Optimistic Jupiter, Sag’s ruling planet, is the planet of optimism, and you’ve got that in spades. When faced with a tough situation, your intellect and creativity combine to help you see a way out, even if nobody else does. Tip: Your optimism is largely a blessing: thanks to your adventurous spirit, you’re able to view a challenge as an exciting opportunity to try something new and grow. But remember that Sagittarius is also the sign of wisdom, so be sure to employ caution alongside your positivity; optimism without prudence can lead you astray (and “toxic positivity” can annoy the bejesus out of other people)."

      "title": "Adventurous",
      "content": "Adventurous Sagittarius is the risk-taker of the zodiac, and as a Sag rising, you’re always seeking your next big adventure. The Sag stereotype is that you’re always rushing off to some foreign country or another, and that might ring true for you—but your adventurous spirit doesn’t have to be as overt. It might translate instead to spontaneously signing up for cooking classes, getting involved in every local club you can find, and reading everything the library has to offer. Tip: Your thirst for adventure can make you somewhat fickle and even flakey at times. What you lack in follow-through, you make up for with enthusiasm and genuineness—but try to pause before jetting off on your next adventure or seeking your next high. Remember that there’s value in sitting still."

      "title": "Magnetic",
      "content": "Magnetic Because of your endless optimism and adventurous spirit, you easily draw others to you. You have no shortage of friends, lovers, or professional contacts, thanks to your charming but genuine persona: people just feel good around you, not only because you believe in yourself, but because you believe in them, too. Tip: Thanks to your kindness and generosity, people are always ready to lend you a hand or offer their services—let them! Don’t take advantage, but remember that Jupiter is the planet of wealth, expansion, and good luck, and you can manifest all 3 by being your charming, optimistic self."

      "title": "You know what you want from a partner—and won’t settle for less.",
      "content": "You know what you want from a partner—and won’t settle for less. Despite Sagittarius rising’s innate optimism and dreaminess, you’re really quite practical in matters of the heart: you know what you’re looking for and you know it when you see it. That being said, when you find your soulmate , you're all in, and you’ll fight for them with all you’ve got. Tips: Because Sagittarius rising is so creative, intellectual, and adventurous, you’ll likely pair well with someone with similar traits—or, if they’re not the adventurous type, they at least have to be pliant enough to let you sweep them away on a grand escapade. You're quick to commit when you meet someone you really vibe with, but you may struggle to work as a team sometimes, preferring to take the lead. Even if your partner is more \"follower\" than \"leader,\" this dynamic can erode your relationship over time, so try to be vulnerable and take a backseat once in a while."

      "title": "No one knows a Sag rising's body like...well, themselves.",
      "content": "No one knows a Sag rising's body like...well, themselves. As a Sagittarius rising, you've likely taken time to explore your carnal desires, and you know them pretty well. Or, if you don't know, you're confident enough to experiment. Whether you're with a partner or flying solo, you like to take control and ask for what you want, which helps ensure you get it. Tip: Sometimes, your curious mind and need to understand things clash with your sexual desires, because often, desire is mysterious, and to a certain extent, it's supposed to be that way. Try not to overanalyze things in the bedroom. As long as you're enjoying yourself and any potential partners are enjoying themselves, just go with the flow."

      "title": "Your positive and adventurous vibes attract friends like a magnet.",
      "content": "Your positive and adventurous vibes attract friends like a magnet. Thanks to your creative, outgoing, and open-hearted attitude, you have no shortage of buddies. You may even be the center of your gang, always leading everyone into the next group adventure or taking one-on-one time with everyone in your crew to foster intimacy and make all your buds feel seen and valued. Tip: While your interest in literally everyone on the planet is genuine, your natural charm and openness may make you seem more invested than you perhaps are. Be aware of the vibes you give off, lest casual acquaintances begin to think there's more between you than there is (and be gentle with the inevitable hoards of people you barely know who will fall in love with you)."

      "title": "You may have a tendency to overindulge in food or drink.",
      "content": "You may have a tendency to overindulge in food or drink. As Jupiter is the planet of excess, prudence may be necessary when it comes to eating and drinking. What can we say, you enjoy a good time, and what’s a good time without food? That being said, practice mindful eating if you notice you’re not feeling so hot after a meal or a night of heavy drinking: mindful eating, unlike dieting fads, isn’t about being overly strict with what you intake—rather, it’s about enjoying your meals slowly and listening to your body to find out what it wants.

      "title": "You thrive in a work environment where you can learn and grow.",
      "content": "You thrive in a work environment where you can learn and grow. You’re unlikely to settle for a position that just pays the bills, preferring a role where you can make a real difference, learn new things, and explore your passions. You’re pretty flexible and positive, but you take pride in your work, which means you can be picky about what you do—and there’s nothing wrong with that. Tip: You might excel in a creative field, like writing or arts; something travel-related, like a flight attendant; or in academia, like a professor. In fact, teaching is likely the perfect job for you, as it involves learning new things, helping people, and taking a leadership role—the perfect combo of Sag rising values!"

      "title": "You value exploration, curiosity, and adventure.",
      "content": "You value exploration, curiosity, and adventure. You know this already, but it bears repeating: a Sag rising's raison d'être is to see what's never been seen, go where nobody has gone, reach the limits of humankind's potential. It may feel as if everyone around you has taken it for granted that there are innate rules and traditions that need to be followed, and you rebel against that assumption like your life depends on it. Tip: While your appreciation of exploration and adventure is the sort of thing that'll help you change the world, be careful that it's not also a means of distracting yourself from the silence of solitude. Don't make the mistake of viewing a small life as...well, small. There is value in quiet and in tiny movements. There is value in drinking coffee in the early light and in washing your dishes by hand, one after another."

      "title": "Despite your adventurousness, you likely appreciate a little discipline.",
      "content": "Despite your adventurousness, you likely appreciate a little discipline. It may sometimes feel as if your wanderlust and tendency to thrill-seek are out of your control. You know the world is vast and that there's so much to explore, yet being boundary-less, seeing the potential in everything, the acute awareness of all the lives you could be living...it can be overwhelming at times. Sometimes, you just want someone to tell you \"No.\" Tip: Your thirst for structure may translate into a desire, maybe a deep-seated one, to be told what to do. This is understandable, but in moments of desperation, it can open you up to other people's control, and that may include bad actors. Try to find the balance between independence and dependence."

      "content": "You likely have an open, inviting expression that draws people in. There’s no one standard Sagittarius rising look, but some people believe they’re more likely to have big smiles and expressive faces, confident posture, and a strong, lively body. [2] X Research source Whether this description fits you to a T or not, you nevertheless give off the vibe of someone who keeps it real, is kind, and does their own thing. Tip: Fashion is a great way to showcase your personality and values: for instance, you might opt for casual clothes that are chic but allow you to jet off on an adventure at the last minute, or you may don enigmatic black to showcase your philosophical, artistic nature. Or both!"

      "title": "You’d be most compatible with Gemini, Aries, and Leo ascendants.",
      "content": "You’d be most compatible with Gemini, Aries, and Leo ascendants. When it comes to rising sign compatibility , Sag risings pair well with fellow fire signs Aries rising and Leo rising. Your shared passion and energy means you’re usually on the same page, and Aries and Leo won’t get worn out by your endless adventurousness. Gemini rising is an air sign, but because of this, they share your curiosity and cleverness, making Gem rising another good match. Sagittarius risings may be reasonably compatible with Libra risings as well. Libra risings are famously chill and easygoing, making them a perfect sidekick on your adventures. Generally, Scorpio and Taurus risings are a little too individualistic and stubborn to pair well with Sagittarius rising. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give Scorpios and Tauruses a chance, but they may not be the best matches."
