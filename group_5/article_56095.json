If there is plenty of space, you can choose a traditional split level with a landing, or a straight set of stairs. [1] X Research source For a small, or more crowded area, you may need to install a spiral staircase. For the purpose of this article, we will choose the simplest, a diagonal up and down wood staircase."

The staircase can add beauty to a home as long as it isn't located in an inconvenient part of the room. Ideally, the staircase should be placed against a wall, which will give it more stability."

The stringer is the part of the stairs that the steps, or threads, and risers will be attached. The risers are the vertical pieces perpendicular to the threads. [2] X Research source"

Align the second stringer for the correct width and height. The second stringer should be supported by a standard frame wall. Brace the wall under the stringer and secure with framing nails."
