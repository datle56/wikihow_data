      "title": "You’re entitled to feel sad.",
      "content": "You’re entitled to feel sad. No matter what anyone tells you, know that you’re allowed to feel confused and upset at your situation. [1] X Research source Only after giving yourself time to grieve and process can you start thinking about ways to heal! It can help to say to yourself out loud, “I’m not alone in this,” or “It’s ok to be sad.” Affirming your own feelings in this way can help you move on from them."

      "content": "You can’t allow society’s expectations dictate how you feel. Don’t let morals and ethics get in the way of how you’re actually feeling! In a situation like this, you can’t think too much about what’s “good” and “bad.” [2] X Research source Focus on the relationship itself, and how you want to move forward with it. Look at yourself in the mirror and say, “I’m not a bad person.” Believe it! Just remember: it takes two to have an affair. It’s not fair for you to have to carry all the guilt yourself."

      "title": "Constantly fixating on feeling heartbroken is draining.",
      "content": "Constantly fixating on feeling heartbroken is draining. Get your mind off it for a while by investing time and energy into other areas of your life. Focus on things that make you feel successful, like work or hobbies. Allow yourself some distance from your heartbroken feelings so you can return to them later with a fresh perspective. Engaging in physical activity is a great way to distract yourself from negative thoughts. Exercise is a great example of this! Spending time with friends and family is another way to get your mind off things for a while. Self-care is a good way to help yourself calm down during this tough time.

      "content": "Don’t isolate yourself. No matter how embarrassed or scared you feel, it’s crucial that you stay in contact with friends and family who show you unconditional love and support. Like a heartbroken person under any circumstances, you deserve sympathy! [4] X Research source The desire to retreat is natural during heartbreak, but severing connections will do more harm than good over time. Try regularly chatting with people you trust. You don’t have to disclose details if you feel it’s unsafe. Just tell them you’re going through a tough time and ask for their support."

      "title": "Talk to a friend about your situation.",

Sharing your situation with someone openly and honestly can help you feel less “stuck” in a situation that makes you feel hopeless or directionless. [5] X Expert Source Vernita Marsh, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Consultant, & Speaker Expert Interview. 7 April 2022. That being said, it’s important that you pick your confidant wisely. [6] X Research source Consider these factors before talking to a friend: Are they a good listener? Make sure this person is someone who has shown you attention in the past. Eye contact and “supportive sounds” (wow, tsk, sigh, etc.) are signs of this. Are they supportive? Avoid talking to someone who might want to play devil’s advocate. Pick someone who you know will be on your side as you tell your story. Are they empathetic? Choose a friend who usually “gets” things from your point of view and verbally affirms that they understand how you feel. Are they likely to make things about themselves? Don’t talk to someone who will inevitably make the conversation about themselves. Are they loyal? Make sure this person is someone who can keep a secret, in case you don’t want certain information being spread around."

[7] X Research source They may feel they have to pick sides, which can get in the way of supporting you. If you need an ear to listen or a shoulder to cry on, consider reaching out to friends of yours who aren’t involved with your partner. Avoid reaching out to the other person your partner is involved with. If they reach out to you, that’s a different story. Whether you respond is up to you."

      "content": "Recognize if the root of your heartbreak is wishful thinking. When you’re thinking about the future of a relationship you’re in, it can be easy to conflate fantasy with reality. This is especially true in an affair. [8] X Research source Take a moment to step outside of your emotions and objectively ask yourself these questions: How has my relationship with my partner been growing? Does my partner care about making me happy in the long run? Will my partner ever leave the other person they’re with to be with me? If my partner is willing to lie to the other person they’re with, could they lie to me? Can I realistically have a loyal and loving long-term relationship with my partner?"

[10] X Research source Try making a list of things you want out of a long-term relationship, like moving to a new city or raising kids together. Will your partner do these things with you?"
