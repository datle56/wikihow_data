      "content": "Watch for a happy bunny to lay its ears back. When your rabbit’s ears are lying down on their head, intersecting with each other in the back, they are resting. This means that they are content. If your rabbit’s ears are lying back against its head but are not touching, this can be a sign that it is frightened. Look at other body language cues to verify if your rabbit seems to be resting or agitated. If the rabbit’s eyes are half closed and it is lying down, it is probably happy. If it is growling, it is probably angry and afraid."

Try to avoid giving your bunny treats or sweets or you may see more begging behavior."
