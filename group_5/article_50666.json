      "title": "Put a property up for auction if it is not purchased.",
      "content": "Put a property up for auction if it is not purchased. When you're playing Monopoly , a player has the option to purchase an unowned property from the bank when they land on it. If the player doesn’t want the property for the list price, then the banker immediately puts it up for a public auction. [1] X Research source When a player goes bankrupt , it also triggers a single auction for all the properties that the player owned. If multiple players want to build houses, hotels, or skyscrapers but there aren’t enough pieces left , the banker starts an auction for them. If you land on the Auction board space in Monopoly: Mega Edition , an auction begins. The player can choose any unowned property to put up for auction if there’s one available. [2] X Research source Auctions speed up the game so that all properties are sold quickly and the game can progress to the trading and development phase."

      "title": "Have players call out their bids.",
      "content": "Have players call out their bids. During the auction, players can yell out any price they’re willing to pay for the property, starting at $10. All the players, including the one who initially landed on the property, are allowed to bid in the auction. [3] X Research source Each bid must be higher than the bid made before it. The player order doesn’t matter during an auction, so any player at any time can shout out their bid. The player who didn’t originally buy the property can bid to jack up the price so an opponent pays more, or they can try to get the property for cheaper so they save money."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the property to the highest bidder.",
      "content": "Give the property to the highest bidder. Players can keep bidding until they want to stop or if they can’t make a higher bid than the previous player. If no one else wants to put out a bid, the banker collects the money from the highest bidder and gives them the matching property card. [4] X Research source It’s possible that the bids go higher than the price listed on the property card. This may happen if multiple players want the property to gain a monopoly over a certain color. If no one bids on the property at all, then the auction ends and the property stays unowned."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy all properties that you land on.",
      "content": "Buy all properties that you land on. Expert Monopoly players rarely pass up an opportunity to purchase a property. The costs of most properties are reasonable and you will likely end up getting into a bidding war and paying more. If you have enough money, always opt to purchase the property right away. Buying the property right away keeps it away from your opponents who may need it to complete a monopoly. That way, you can offer a trade later in the game for other properties that benefit you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Auction properties only if you can’t afford them.",
      "content": "Auction properties only if you can’t afford them. If you purchase the property, you could trade it with another player later for a property you need or cash. Choosing to go to auction when you could buy the property gives your opponents a chance to get it for cheaper, or drive up the price so you aren’t able to buy it. Even if you’re afraid of running out of money or aren’t collecting that particular property color, avoid letting it go to auction if you’re able to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid paying more for a property in auction than its original worth.",
      "content": "Avoid paying more for a property in auction than its original worth. If a property goes up for auction during a game of Monopoly, try not to get caught up in a bidding war. Always keep in mind the original cost of the property and do not pay more than that price. You may be able to get a property for a deal periodically, but in most cases, people will end up paying more for a property through an auction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Allow players to pass properties without sending them to auction.",
      "content": "Allow players to pass properties without sending them to auction. Rather than going to an auction when a player doesn’t buy a property, let it stay unowned until someone lands on it and purchases it. [5] X Research source Playing without auctions can increase the length of the game."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play full-auction Monopoly to sell every property at an auction.",
      "content": "Play full-auction Monopoly to sell every property at an auction. Rather than playing with the fixed prices on each property card, start an auction any time a player lands on a property. Give all the players an opportunity to bid on the property. [6] X Research source This is a fun variation of the game because it allows players to interact more and lets them bluff and trick their opponents into overpaying for certain properties."
    },
    {
      "title": "Agree on an auction rule before you begin playing.",
      "content": "Agree on an auction rule before you begin playing. If you decide to play with house rules, discuss the rules with each player before you begin playing. Come to an agreement on how you’ll follow the auction rule throughout the game. That way, you’ll get in fewer disagreements about the rules while you play."
