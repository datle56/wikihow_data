If the other person has read your message but hasn't sent a reply, the word \"Seen\" will be visible just above the typing area at the bottom-right corner. If the message is a group chat , you'll see the names of everyone who has read your message next to \"Seen.\" \"Seen\" will disappear once the person replies to your message. While you can't turn off read receipts on Instagram, there are some workarounds that let people sneakily read DMs without being seen. The workarounds are pretty involved, so most people don't use them. Instagram is reportedly working on allowing users to turn off read receipts, but the feature hasn't rolled out yet.
