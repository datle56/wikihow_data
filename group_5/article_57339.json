Use a small object, like a penny or a roll of tape, to trace 2 circles onto your construction paper. [1] X Research source To make a rainbow Pop It, try tracing circles onto all different colors of construction paper. For a larger Pop-It, you can trace as many circles as you’d like. If you want to add designs, like smiley faces or flowers onto your Pop It, now is the time! Draw those before you move on to the next step."

Use clear packing tape to cover all of your circles. Flip your circles over and add more tape on the other side. [2] X Research source Make sure you use clear packing tape, not brown packing tape. Otherwise, your construction paper colors won’t show through!"

Then, pinch a piece of foam paper in between the straightener and hold it for about 5 to 10 seconds. [18] X Research source Heating up foam paper makes it melt slightly. If your foam paper turns black or starts to smoke, take it off the heat right away and let it cool down before touching it again."

Once the foam paper is warm, press it down on top of a bouncy ball, and use the circle inside a roll of tape or lid to hold it there. Let it sit for about 10 seconds, then take the foam paper off of the bouncy ball. [19] X Research source Once you’ve done this with 1 square of foam paper, do it with the rest of your squares, too. Use a bouncy ball that fits in the center of your foam paper. Using a smaller ball will make smaller pops while using a larger ball will make larger pops."
