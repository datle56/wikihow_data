      "content": "Use titles that accurately describe the news topics. Titles should contain between 2 and 22 words and consist of major keywords about the subject. Place titles in bold lettering directly above your articles in a news-style format. Try to use titles that are unique compared to other news sites. Google News may filter out your articles if the titles match those of other articles that have already been published by other news sites. For example, if your news article is about celebrities who get married, try a unique title such as \"Celebrity A: 3rd Marriage a Charm to Celebrity B\" instead of \"Celebrity A Marries Celebrity B.\""

      "title": "Work with your webmaster on enforcing specific technical requirements for Google News.",
      "content": "Work with your webmaster on enforcing specific technical requirements for Google News. Establish unique URLs for each article to allow for proper indexing by Google News. Google News will only recognize URLs that contain at least 3 digits and do not resemble years. For example, Google News will index URLs with \"995\" in the title, but not \"2010\" because it resembles a year. Ensure that the platform hosting your website can incorporate keywords of your article into the body of the URL. This will help Google News rank your articles more efficiently. For example, have your Content Management System (CMS) modified if your article URLs are published strictly with numbers instead of keywords."
