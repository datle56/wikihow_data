      "content": "Heat lasagna leftovers in a 350 °F (177 °C) oven for 30 to 45 minutes. The best way to reheat refrigerated lasagna is in the oven. Simply place the lasagna in an oven-safe dish (if it isn’t already), cover with aluminum foil, and bake for 30 to 45 minutes (or until heated through). [1] X Research source To brown the top, remove the foil and place it back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Try putting more sauce or cheese on top of your lasagna to help it stay moist while reheating."

      "content": "Sprinkle water on lasagna to reheat in the microwave. While reheating a lasagna in the microwave isn’t the best way, it is the quickest. Place a slice of lasagna on a microwave-safe dish. Then, sprinkle a small amount of water or sauce on top and cover. Heat the lasagna in the microwave for 1 minute. If the lasagna isn’t heated all the way through, continue microwaving in 30-second intervals until it is. [2] X Research source Cover the lasagna with a napkin, paper towel, or microwave-safe bowl, plate, or lid. Keep in mind that while a microwave is the fastest way to reheat lasagna, it’s not always the most reliable. Lasagna can burn and crisp in the microwave because there’s not enough moisture, so microwave in short increments."

      "content": "Reheat individual slices in the toaster oven. If you have leftover lasagna that’s already cut up, skip turning on the oven to reheat one or two pieces. Instead, place the slice(s) in a foil-lined baking dish and reheat at 325 °F (163 °C) for 20 minutes (or until heated through)."

      "title": "Fry leftover lasagna on the stove.",
      "content": "Fry leftover lasagna on the stove. Turn your leftover lasagna into a new, crispier version of itself by heating it up in a frying pan. Cut out thick slices of the lasagna. Then, add it to a frying pan or cast iron skillet with a little bit of olive oil over medium-high heat. Flip the lasagna occasionally until each side is crispy and heated all the way through. [3] X Research source If it’s taking a long time to heat the center of the lasagna, cover the pan with a lid to help lock in moisture and heat it faster."

      "title": "Thaw the lasagna in the fridge overnight.",
      "content": "Thaw the lasagna in the fridge overnight. Reheating frozen lasagna isn’t that different from reheating leftover lasagna from the fridge; however, it does take an extra step or two. Start by moving the lasagna from the freezer to the fridge the night before to start the thawing process. [4] X Research source You don’t necessarily have to thaw the lasagna overnight; however, it’ll take at least twice as long to reheat without thawing. If you forget to thaw the lasagna in the fridge, no worries! Pop it in the microwave for about 5 minutes on the defrost setting."

      "content": "Let the lasagna sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Before heating up your lasagna, set the dish on the kitchen counter or table for at least 30 minutes. This will help the lasagna bake evenly. [5] X Research source Try doing this while the oven is preheating to save even more time."

      "content": "Cover the lasagna in aluminum foil. If your lasagna isn’t already covered in aluminum foil, take this time to do so now. Ensure that the top of the dish is completely covered. This will trap in steam and create an efficient baking environment. [6] X Research source"

If your lasagna was baked before it was frozen, stick to a 350 °F (177 °C) temperature and bake until heated all the way through. If your lasagna wasn’t baked before it was frozen, follow the original recipe instructions for baking. [7] X Research source The cooking time may be longer depending on the size of your lasagna and whether or not it was completely defrosted."

      "content": "Uncover the lasagna and cook for another 5 minutes. Once your lasagna is heated all the way through, take it out of the oven and remove the aluminum foil. Place back in the oven for another 5 to 10 minutes to brown the top. [8] X Research source To speed up this process, use the broiler setting on your oven. Just be sure to watch the lasagna carefully to ensure it doesn’t burn."

      "title": "Should you let your lasagna sit before serving?",
      "content": "Should you let your lasagna sit before serving? Yes! It’s best to let your lasagna rest for at least 10 minutes before serving or eating. This ensures that all the ingredients are cooled down and settled, making the dish easier to cut and eat. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "How do you reheat lasagna without it drying out? Add more sauce to the top of your lasagna, or cover it with foil before heating to ensure it doesn’t dry out. An extra layer of sauce adds more moisture to the overall dish, and foil helps lock in steam while reheating. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Can you use an air fryer to reheat your lasagna? Yes, you can use an air fryer to reheat your lasagna, but it may come out crisper than expected. Lasagna is known for its gooey cheesy center, and while air fryers are fast, they can also remove moisture from food. To avoid this, add extra sauce to your lasagna before reheating. Then, air fry at 370 °F (188 °C) for 6 to 10 minutes. [11] X Research source"

A fully cooked and warmed lasagna should have an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). [12] X Research source Use a food thermometer to check if your lasagna is ready to eat."
