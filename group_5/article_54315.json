[1] X Research source You might not be given the length of all 4 sides, which is another reason why you’d need to use an equation to find the perimeter instead of just addition."

If you know the height and base of the triangle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side lengths. [15] X Research source For example, if an isosceles triangle has a height of 10 cm and a base of 6 cm, you can think of the height creating two right triangles. Since the height bisects the base, one side length of the right triangle will be 3 cm. The other side length will be equal to the height: 10 cm. The missing side length is the hypotenuse. Set up the Pythagorean formula, plugging in the side lengths: 10 2 + 3 2 = c 2 {\\displaystyle 10^{2}+3^{2}=c^{2}} . Make the necessary calculations to find the missing side length: 100 + 9 = c 2 {\\displaystyle 100+9=c^{2}} 109 = c 2 {\\displaystyle 109=c^{2}} 109 = c 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {109}}={\\sqrt {c^{2}}}} 10.44 = c {\\displaystyle 10.44=c} . An isosceles triangle has 2 equal sides. So, the perimeter of the triangle is equal to 2 x + b {\\displaystyle 2x+b} , where x {\\displaystyle x} equals the length of one side, and b {\\displaystyle b} equals the base. So, if you know the length of the base and one side, you can find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle: P = 2 ( 10.44 ) + 6 = 26.88 {\\displaystyle P=2(10.44)+6=26.88} .
