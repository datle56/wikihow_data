      "content": "Effective communication isn’t in a toxic person's wheelhouse. If someone is toxic, you may leave conversations feeling worse about yourself.

A toxic person may raise their voice and push aside your needs because they want to be in a place of power. They like to be in control of the relationship, even if that means sacrificing communication. Try to avoid reacting to their silent treatment with anger or passive-aggressive behavior. Instead, collect yourself and instigate a thoughtful conversation about why their behavior is hurting you."

Whether it’s saying white lies or flippant apologies, it’s hard to know when they’re being honest. [3] X Research source Think of it this way: in a toxic person’s eyes, they’re the main character of their and everyone’s stories. They’ll do whatever it takes to have things be in their favor.
