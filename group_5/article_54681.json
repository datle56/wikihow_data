      "content": "The “French tuck” is a term for tucking in only the front of your shirt. This styling trick involves tucking the front part of an oversized, billowy top into a mid or high-rise bottom, while leaving the rest of the shirt hanging loose. This has the effect of elongating your figure, balancing your proportions, and defining your waist. [1] X Research source Tan France, the fashion expert on the Netflix show Queer Eye , is responsible for popularizing the style and coining the term. [2] X Research source The French tuck is a popular style for all genders."

[3] X Research source When you tuck in the front part of this type of shirt, it creates the effortless, chic draping effect associated with the French tuck. [4] X Research source Pretty much any type of oversized top works for this style, including button-downs, blouses, T-shirts, sweaters, and sweatshirts."

      "content": "Mid rise or high rise bottoms The French tuck is meant to elongate your legs and define your waist. Because of this, it’s important to pick mid-rise or high-rise bottoms, since these tend to sit closer to your natural waist than low-rise bottoms do. You can do the French tuck with trousers, jeans, or a skirt—whatever fits your style best! [5] X Research source"

      "content": "With a button-down Tuck in the front part of the shirt until you reach just before your hip bones on both sides. Leave the sides and the back of the shirt completely loose and untucked. Once the front of the shirt is tucked in, adjust the fabric until it’s draped to your liking. This may require pulling some of the shirt out or tucking more of the shirt in to create the right amount of volume in the area where it's “poofing” out. For a fun variation, try tucking in just one side of your button-down in the front. [6] X Research source Leave the last few buttons of the shirt unbuttoned, then tuck the side with the buttons into the front of your bottoms. Leave the side with the buttonholes loose.

      "content": "With a blouse The process for doing a French tuck with a blouse is essentially the same as doing one with a button-down. Just tuck in the front of the blouse, leaving the sides and back untucked. However, since some blouses are made with silky fabrics that tend to be pretty slippery, consider adding a belt to the look. This will help keep lighter weight fabrics in place once you tuck them in. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "With a T-shirt",
      "content": "With a T-shirt Tuck in the front of the T-shirt slightly off-center to create a more casual look. If you’re wearing jeans or trousers, tuck the shirt into your waistband near the first belt loop next to the button on your preferred side. If you’re wearing a skirt or bottoms without a belt loop, tuck the shirt in slightly to the right or left of center. Adjust the fabric so that it drapes down either side of the tuck. If you prefer to do a centered French tuck with your T-shirt, that works too! Just tuck the front of the shirt into your pants in the space between the two front belt loops, then adjust the draping as needed. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "With a sweater or sweatshirt Knit sweaters and oversized sweatshirts tend to be a bit chunkier, and they require a little more room than other shirts when tucked in. To accommodate this, consider wearing bottoms that have a roomier or stretchier waistband. From there, tuck the front part of the sweater or sweatshirt into your bottoms and let it drape around the sides of the tuck. [10] X Research source Both a centered and an off-center French tuck work for sweaters and sweatshirts—it’s just a matter of your personal preference!"

The French tuck is pretty simple, but it usually does take a little finessing to get the shirt to drape and billow out the right way. You’ll likely need to pull some of the fabric out or tuck more of it in a few times to get the look you’re going for, so be patient and persistent. [12] X Research source"

Feel free to experiment with your bottoms to create a look that fits your own personal style. For example, wide-leg trousers, straight leg jeans, and midi skirts all look great with a French tuck.

      "content": "Try out a mini French tuck with shorter tops. Although the French tuck is usually done with longer oversized tops, it can also be a super cute look with cropped (but still loose-fitting) shirts or sweaters. Since you’ll have less length at the bottom of the shirt to work with, tuck only a small amount of fabric into the front of your pants. [14] X Research source You’ll get a polished and chic look, just with a bit less of the billowy draping effect of a regular French tuck."

      "content": "If you’re having trouble achieving the look, stick to lighter-weight tops. It’s easiest to do the French tuck with lighter, silkier fabrics (as opposed to bulkier sweaters or sweatshirts). If you’re new to the French tuck and you’re struggling to get it to drape the right way, opt for thinner T-shirts, button-downs, and blouses to start. [15] X Research source Once you get the French tuck down with these fabrics, you’ll be better equipped to try it out with chunky knits or sweatshirts!"
