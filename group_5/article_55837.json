      "content": "They feel a strong emotional or physical connection to you. If someone tells you they “want to be with you so badly,” they may be trying to tell you they crave your company because they feel really close to you. It may also indicate they want to be sexually intimate with you (or at least have a good solid makeout sesh). You might say this to someone after you've established some sort of romantic interest. Maybe you're actively dating, or you've been out once or twice and things are really starting to heat up."

      "content": "Take note of their body language. If you’re not sure whether they means “I feel emotionally close” or “I want to sleep with you,” carefully observe their body language . If they're more flirty, you’re probably safe to interpret the sentence as sexual, whereas if they're a little more physically withdrawn, they may not mean it in a sexual way. Are they leaning toward you, making direct eye contact, or licking their lips? These are signs they may be physically interested in you. [1] X Research source Another sign of sexual interest is physical touching: do they lightly tap or stroke your shoulder? Are they holding your hand? Alternatively, if their body language is more reserved, they may just mean to convey emotional affection. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source Also remember that someone might say this when they find you physically attractive but aren't ready to take things to that level yet! \"I want to be with you so badly\" is almost always said in a romantic context."

      "title": "Consider your conversation leading up to this.",
      "content": "Consider your conversation leading up to this. Are you talking to a friend who you haven’t seen in a while about how much you miss them, or are you texting after a hot date with your new beau? For instance, if you say, “I’m going to see the new Twisters movie tonight” and they say, “I want to be with you so badly!” they might just mean they wish they could see the movie with you. On the other hand, if someone you went out with last night texts you to tell you how great you looked in your dress and follows it with, “I want to be with you so badly 😛” it might be a sign they're into you in a romantic and sexual way. On that note, check for emoji usage—if they pair the text with a sexy emoji , like 🍆 (eggplant), 🌷 (tulip), 🍑 (peach), 💦 (water droplets), 🥵 ( hot panting face ), or 😛 ( face with tongue out ), they might be a li’l turned on. But if they pair it with a ❤️ (heart), 😙 (kiss), or other affectionate emoji, they might just be being romantic, and not necessarily sexual."
