As you may have seen on my resume, I have 5 years of experience in the field and have put all of my energy and focus into programming intuitive programs. At my last position, I was able to develop the software they use every day from the ground up, so my skill set definitely matches what you’re looking for. Can we schedule a time to call each other, so we can talk more in-depth? I’d love to discuss what the position entails and what I can bring to the table. I’m available: January 18th at 5 PM January 19th at 12 PM January 20th at 9:30 AM and 5 PM Let me know which dates and times work best for you. Not only that, but I look forward to hearing more from you. Best, Timothy Smith"

While I am searching for a new opportunity, I would like to find a position that allows me to move upwards from my current position as a writer. The Writer position you offered sounds a little off from what I’m currently looking for. I noticed on your company’s site that there is a Content Manager role available that I would love more information about. After 3 years of experience writing under tight deadlines and pitching new ideas, this feels like the next step. Would I be able to talk to you or a colleague about the opportunity? I’ve attached my resume, so you can see my qualifications in more detail. I look forward to hearing from you! Regards, Grace Spelling"

However, I would still love to hear more information to see if there’s anyone I know that’s a better fit that I can recommend for the position. Let me know if you still want to discuss the role. Best wishes, Fred Rogers"
