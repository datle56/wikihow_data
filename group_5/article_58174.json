Now, there doesn't have to be a gap between boxes like in American Marvel Comics. Usually, the borders separating each panel are just thin yet bold black lines. In some cases, the borders of a given panel will be left out entirely. This technique is called 'bleeding out' frames. [4] X Research source"
