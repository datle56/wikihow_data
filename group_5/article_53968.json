This means you ultimately have the freedom to do what you want with your time and money—and you have more time and money than people saddled with relationships and families. Choose what makes you happy and what makes you feel more fulfilled. [2] X Research source For example, if you decide you want to paint your bedroom purple, you can do that. You don't need to talk to your partner about it first or work the project around other people's schedules. This also means you can do things that sound positively indulgent to people who have a partner and kids. For example, if you want to sit down and read the latest bestseller cover-to-cover in one evening, you can do that without letting anything else fall by the wayside."

      "content": "You don't need to take anyone else's feelings into consideration. By the time you're in your 40s, you probably have a really good idea of what you want out of life—and being single means nothing is standing in your way of reaching for it. There's no need to compromise or make sacrifices, as you might need to do if you were part of a couple. [3] X Research source For example, if you decide that you want to leave a secure job to work at a nonprofit or pursue a creative career with less stability. You can do that—the only needs you have to take into consideration are your own. Because you don't have to worry about anyone else's competing interests, you can do \"extra\" things without any pressure as well. For example, if you want to join a bowling league, you don't have to ask your partner if they'll be okay if you're not at home on Tuesday and Thursday nights."

If it takes a lot of time and effort to get your project off the ground, so what! You've got the freedom to see it through. It might not ultimately result in any financial gain, but you'll feel more fulfilled for having done it.

Now you have the time, energy, and experience to get those recipes and stories down. Another factor is financial stability. Typically you're enjoying a stable career by the time you hit your 40s, which gives you more resources to put towards your passion project."
