So, I started branching out into the community. I participated in library events, attended a few cycling classes, and even starred in a few community theater productions. I met a lot of people by doing things I enjoyed.” - Staff Writer Aly R. Her advice: “Don’t be afraid to try new things on your own! While it may be scary at first, you never know who you’ll meet or who you’ll strike up a conversation with. Most of the new friends I’ve made were during moments when I was by myself.”"
