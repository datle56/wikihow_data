      "content": "A low charge can cause your controller not to work. Plug your remote in with a USB-C cable to charge it enough so you can use it. A red light at the top will indicate that the remote is charging. Allow the remote to charge until the charging light turns off. [1] X Research source If your solar remote works at all, you can also check your power levels at Settings > All Settings > General & Privacy > Power and Energy Saving to see your current charge. Tip: When you're not using the remote, turn it upside down and in the sun so the solar cells are soaking in the sunlight."

      "content": "Your Samsung SolarCell Remote may not be paired correctly. To re-pair your remote, turn on the TV, point the remote at it, and press and hold the \"Return\" and \"Pause/Play\" buttons at the same time for 3 seconds. Once you see a message on your TV screen, release the buttons and follow the on-screen instructions to complete pairing your remote and TV. [2] X Research source If the TV says that there are no remotes to pair, try pairing your remote with a second Samsung TV (like another TV that you own, a neighbor's or friend's Samsung TV, or a store with Samsung on display), then pairing it again with the original TV."

      "content": "This will let you know if you need to charge it more or get a new remote. You need a smartphone or camera for this process: Look at the tip of the remote (the part you aim at the TV) through your camera app on your phone or camera's screen. Press the \"Power\" button on the remote. If you see the IR light, your remote works. If you don't see the IR light, charge your remote with a USB-C cable or in sunlight and try again after the remote has charged for a while (like 30 minutes). If you still don't see a light, something might be wrong with your battery, so contact Samsung for more support or purchase a new remote . [3] X Research source"
