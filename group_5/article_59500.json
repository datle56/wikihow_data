      "content": "Vacuum any dust and dirt. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to suck away dirt and dust. Brush away dirt with the attachment to loosen any stubborn areas. [1] X Research source If you can't remove all of the dirt, don't worry. You can scrub away more with soap and water later."

      "title": "Get the brick wet before using any cleaners.",
      "content": "Get the brick wet before using any cleaners. Dry bricks will absorb the cleaning solvent and fade or discolor over time. Fill a spray bottle with water and saturate the brick's entire surface before using any cleaners. [2] X Research source Washing a dry brick can also cause it to grow unsightly white or greenish scum. If you're washing a brick outside, you can also use a garden hose to get it wet."

      "title": "Scrub the brick with a mixture of dish soap and table salt.",
      "content": "Scrub the brick with a mixture of dish soap and table salt. Combine 1 c (0.24 L) each of dish soap and table salt to make a spreadable paste, then spread the paste in an even layer over the surface. Working from top to bottom, scrub the paste into the brick with a bristle bush. [3] X Research source 1 c (0.24 L) of this mixture should be enough to clean 1 small or medium-sized brick. Let the paste sit for 5-10 minutes before scrubbing it with the bristle brush. Remove the paste from the brick with a wet washcloth."

      "title": "Use a sealant to keep the brick in good condition.",
      "content": "Use a sealant to keep the brick in good condition. Let your brick sun-dry or dry it with a towel. Spray a siloxane- or silane-based sealant around the brick's entire surface, keeping the sealant nozzle several inches away to keep the coating even. Use sealants in well-ventilated outdoor areas, reading the instructions carefully to apply them safely and effectively. [4] X Research source Look for brick sealants online or at a home repair store. Spray a water repellent over the brick to prevent water-related damage and protect the bricks if you live in a wet or rainy climate. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Vacuum and wet the brick before applying the cleaner.",
      "content": "Vacuum and wet the brick before applying the cleaner. Like using household cleaners, your brick will absorb the less of the cleaner if it has been vacuumed and dampened with water first. Don't worry about removing deep-set stains, as the acid cleaner will remove them later on. You can also dry brush the brick to remove dirt as an alternative to vacuuming."

      "content": "Wear safety goggles and rubber gloves while handling acid cleaners. Because acid cleaners are hazardous, they can cause serious injuries if they come in contact with your eyes or skin. Put on thick rubber gloves and safety goggles before handling the acid to protect yourself from burns. Read the acid cleaner's safety instructions carefully before using it to prevent injuries."

Fill a bucket halfway with water, then pour in a small amount of acid cleaner. Check the acid cleaner's instructions for the exact ratio, as the cleaner's strength and concentration level can affect how much dilution it needs. [8] X Research source Make sure you pour the acidic cleaner into the water (instead of the other way around) to prevent chemical burns caused by splashes.

      "title": "Wash away the acid and let the brick dry.",
      "content": "Wash away the acid and let the brick dry. After scrubbing away the stain, wash the acid off with a hose and leave the brick to air dry. Inspect the brick for any residual stains. If any stains remain afterward, try increasing the acid cleaner's concentration and applying it again if the packaging says it is safe to do so. Like when removing dirt or minor stains, you can also spray a sealant or water repellent on afterward to protect the brick from future damage."
