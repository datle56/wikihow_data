      "title": "Say hi.",
      "content": "Say hi. When you see your brothers friends in the hallway, don't stare at them. If they're alone and you are the only two there, then you can smile or say \"Hi_____\", but don't be too forward or they will back off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Chat",
      "content": "Chat a little. When you're at your house and they are over, with your brother there of course, make an excuse to go wherever they are and start a conversation. Boys actually like it when you confront them, and some find it attractive. Also don't just go over there and sit down and chat. Your brother will get annoyed, and know something is up. You could casually say something like \"Hey guys, I'm gonna make myself a cup of coffee and just wanted to know if you would like some.\" If your brothers friends are into a sport then go to the games and \"bump\" into him. Don't be shy and make it awkward."

      "content": "Sometimes your looks don't even matter to a guy; it's how you act and approach him. Gain their interests, and don't just talk about yourself to them, talk about them .

The shy guys usually need you to be open but don't get too pushy or involved in their business, it can come off as annoying."

      "content": "Become an object of his desires. You know that if you saw him in the hallway with another girl you would get jealous. Well reverse it. Don't try to make him jealous by flirting with another guy, but casually meet a boy and talk to him in front of your brothers friend. He will go nuts wanting to get the same attention. He will want you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Find out what he is passionate about and use it to your advantage!",
      "content": "Find out what he is passionate about and use it to your advantage! Don't like what he likes, unless you naturally do, but try to learn more about it. For example, he likes bowling. Next time you see him casually mention something about a bowling party. Who knows what he will say when he knows you like the same things as him."
