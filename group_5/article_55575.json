      "title": "There are multiple ways to use the help action in DnD.",
      "content": "There are multiple ways to use the help action in DnD. You can use the help action in combat and out of combat. The rules are similar for both applications, but your DM may decide how and when you can use a help action. Combat: There are two ways to use the help action in combat. [1] X Research source Both of these count as an action, not a bonus action (unless your character's race, class, or feats say otherwise). You help another character with a task. The other character will get advantage on their next ability check to perform or complete the task, as long as they make the check before the start of your next turn. You help a friendly creature attack another creature (both must be within five feet of you). The friendly creature will get advantage on their next attack roll on the creature, as long as they attack before the start of your next turn. Out of combat: You can offer to help another character with a task. This will give the other character advantage on the ability check to perform or complete that task. [2] X Research source Note that this isn't technically a help action since you're not in combat, but many players still call it a help action. Your character must be able to do the task on their own to offer help. For example, if one of your allies is trying to forge a document, your character must have proficiency with a forgery kit to help with the task. The task must be one that wouldn't be hindered by a pair of extra hands. For example, helping your ally break down a door is plausible; helping your ally fill a very small bottle with a potion isn't."

      "content": "Familiars can also use the help action. Find Familiar is a 1st level conjuration spell that can be learned by Wizards. Familiars can't attack, but they can use other actionsâ€”including help. [3] X Research source Familiars must follow the same rules as player characters when it comes to the help action: in combat they must be within five feet of the ally they're helping and the enemy, and out of combat they can only help with a task that they'd be able to do on their own."

      "title": "When an ally is facing a difficult threat.",
      "content": "When an ally is facing a difficult threat. If a nearby ally is fighting a difficult enemy, you might consider helping your ally instead of attacking the enemy yourself. Perhaps your nearby ally is very strong, and you want to ensure that they land a hit on the enemy because the overall total damage would be higher than if you landed an attack."
    },
    {
      "title": "When you have a relevant proficiency.",
      "content": "When you have a relevant proficiency. While your proficiency score doesn't influence the advantage that your ally gets, your proficiency in a skill or tool does matter from both a gameplay and narrative standpoint. From a gameplay standpoint, you can only help an ally out of combat if it was something your character would be able to do on their own. Depending on your DM, they may rely on your proficiencies to determine what tasks you could reasonably do without external help. From a narrative standpoint, if your character is the type to help out their allies, they would be probably more willing to help with something they know how to do. Your ally would also probably be more willing to accept help from someone who knew how to help with the task at hand."

    {
      "title": "When you have nothing else to do.",
      "content": "When you have nothing else to do. If you're a bow-user and you find yourself too close to an enemy to attack without disadvantage (and you don't want to incur an attack of opportunity) or you're a spellcaster who's out of spell slots, you can use your action to help a nearby ally instead of doing nothing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Whenever it makes narrative sense.",
      "content": "Whenever it makes narrative sense. If you have a character that is the type to help anyone and everyone, it might make sense for them to offer to help even when the DM might say no. The worst that will happen is that the DM says no, and they may make an exception if you have a compelling reason to offer up help."
    },
    {
      "title": "When it doesn't make sense.",
      "content": "When it doesn't make sense. A clumsy Paladin wouldn't really be much help when the Rogue is picking locks, and a Wizard's familiar can't help with every single attack roll just because it can do the help action. If you want your character to offer help with the intention that they will be turned down, communicate that with your group beforehand and let the DM know that you're not actually trying to use the help action, you're just roleplaying."
    },
    {
      "title": "When the DM says you can't.",
      "content": "When the DM says you can't. This is pretty obvious, but if the DM has said you can't help an ally with something, don't keep trying. If you're not sure why your DM made that decision, you can always ask them for clarification (but save any lengthy discussions about gameplay for after the session)."

My character, a Dhampir Barbarian, stayed back to help another character hold the rope so the other party members could cross. Because her help action gave her ally advantage, they were able to hold the rope so everyone could cross without falling and taking damage (and she was able to cross by jumping thanks to her high strength stat).\""

I'd given him the Mastermind roguish archetype, which allowed him to use help as a bonus action. After attacking, he used his help bonus action to create a noise behind the enemy with Thaumaturgy to distract them. This allowed his nearby ally to get advantage on their next attack.\""

Because it used the Infernal alphabet, my Tiefling Cleric was able to help an ally decipher what was written due to his knowledge of the script. Together, they were able to figure out what the text said, which gave us a valuable clue to the puzzle we were trying to solve.\""
