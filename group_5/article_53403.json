    {
      "title": "Say thank you.",
      "content": "Say thank you. Let your parents know that you appreciate everything they do for you. This not only includes the big stuff, like putting a roof over your head and feeding you, but also the small things, like doing your laundry or driving you to your friend's house. A simple \"thank you\" goes a long way, so here are some examples of what you can say: [1] X Research source “Thank you for being so patient with me.” “Thank you for attending all of my soccer games.” “Thank you for picking me up from practice every day.” “Thank you for all the sacrifices you’ve made for our family.” “Thank you for showing me what it means to be a kind person.” “Thank you for reminding me to pack an umbrella when it rains.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask your parents for advice.",
      "content": "Ask your parents for advice. If you need help, reach out to your parents for some words of wisdom. Chances are, they’ll feel valued that you trust their opinion and rely on them. Remember to follow up and properly thank them for their support. [2] X Research source For example, you could say “You were right about going to sleep early, instead of pulling an all-nighter. I feel so refreshed and prepared for my exam today. Thank you.” Even if their advice didn’t help you, show gratitude for their time. You might say, “I ended up failing the exam, but now I know that I should go to after-school tutoring if I don’t understand the homework. Thank you for listening to my problems and offering support.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize when you do something wrong.",
      "content": "Apologize when you do something wrong. No one is perfect all the time. If you did something that upset your parents or said something you didn’t mean, tell them you're sorry. [3] X Research source School counselor Evanna Torrecillas says that apologizing “acknowledges the impact of your actions.” It's never too late to say you're sorry! According to Torrecillas, apologizing is your “chance to mend the relationship and show that you’re willing to put in the work to do better.” Instead of trying to dismiss what happened, own up to your mistake and make a genuine apology . You could say, “I’m sorry for lashing out at you when I was hungry. I didn’t mean what I said, and I feel terrible for being so rude. In the future, I’ll stop to think more carefully before I say things.”"

      "title": "Ask your parents about their day.",
      "content": "Ask your parents about their day. Your parents want to feel involved in your life, so make an effort to talk to them at dinner, instead of looking at your phone. Ask them how their day went and tell them about yours. By discussing problems, opportunities, and new experiences you’re going through, you’ll make your parents happy and strengthen your relationship . [4] X Research source If you don’t live with your parents, give them a call at least once a week. [5] X Research source Sharing life updates and asking them how they’re doing is the best way to stay connected. Feel free to call them whenever you can, like when you’re walking to class or eating dinner, or set up a designated time, such as Friday morning or Sunday afternoon."

      "title": "Give your parents a hug.",
      "content": "Give your parents a hug. Wrap your arms around your parents and squeeze tight! Hugging your parents and telling them you love them is sure to make them feel special. You can pat their shoulders, stroke your hands across their back, or smile when you let go to show even more affection. [6] X Research source Even if you’re older, hugging is one of the sweetest (and simplest) ways to express love. Your parents probably miss the days when you were little and used to hug them all the time, making this gesture even more meaningful as an adult."

      "title": "Do your chores without being asked.",
      "content": "Do your chores without being asked. If you have a list of regular chores, make sure to do them on time. [7] X Research source Make sure to clean up after yourself to reduce the amount of work your parents have to do, such as organizing your room and wiping up spills quickly. Other nice things you can do include: Washing the dishes or putting them in the dishwasher. Taking off your shoes so you don't bring dirt into the house. Cleaning the kitchen or living room when your parents are gone. Putting your dirty laundry in the hamper instead of throwing it on the floor."

    {
      "title": "Offer to help your parents when they’re stressed.",
      "content": "Offer to help your parents when they’re stressed. If you notice that your parents are overwhelmed, ask them what you can do to help out. Parents have tons of responsibilities, and offering to run an errand on their behalf (or doing something thoughtful) can take some of the weight off of their shoulders. [8] X Research source You could: Give them a massage. Make them a cup of tea or coffee. Give them space if they seem extremely stressed. Offer to do extra chores, like mowing the lawn or doing the dishes after dinner. Ask to contribute money toward household expenses (if you’re older or have a job)."

      "title": "Give your parents a break and be understanding.",
      "content": "Give your parents a break and be understanding. If you get annoyed or frustrated with your parents, take a deep breath and calm down. They might be stressed with work or paying the bills, so try to cut them some slack. Being kind and considerate is one of the easiest ways to be nice to your parents, and it’ll make them proud to see how mature you are. [9] X Research source If you don’t understand why your parents are disagreeing with you about something, ask them to explain in a polite way. Keep in mind that your parents have a lot more life experience than you. If they don’t want you to hang out with certain people, for example, it might be because they’re trying to protect you. Consider whether your parents’ religious beliefs, cultural background, or upbringing are influencing their opinions and decisions. Even if you don’t share the same values, be respectful of theirs."

      "content": "Give them a heartfelt card. A really simple way to express love toward your parents is to make a homemade card . [10] X Research source Use cardstock or construction paper for the base of the card, then embellish the outside with ribbons, stickers, or small photos. Make a list of adjectives that describe your parents (nice, helpful, loving, thoughtful, etc.), then write them in your card. Explain how much you love them and how they have impacted your life."

      "content": "Buy or make a gift. A thoughtful gift is one of the best ways to thank your parents.

      "content": "Write them a heartfelt letter and list all the things you love about them. One of the best ways to show love is to express your feelings in a letter. Acknowledge the sacrifices your parents have made (and continue to make) for you, and describe specific times they’ve gone above and beyond. Feel free to bring up your favorite memories together, and don’t forget to end with “I love you.” [15] X Research source Some sweet phrases you can include are: “I miss you both deeply.” “I’m so lucky to be your child.” “I hope you have an amazing day.” “I’m so blessed to call you my parents.” “You’re the definition of an incredible parent.” “I love you more than all the stars in the sky.” “You’re doing a great job balancing everything.” “I hope I can be an amazing mom/dad like you.” “Words can’t describe how much I appreciate you.” “Thank you for everything.

Their love and support have been my unwavering foundation.” —Tim Cook “One of the greatest titles in the world is parent, and one of the biggest blessings in the world is to have parents to call mom and dad.” —Jim DeMint “Parents are the ultimate role models for children. Every word, movement, and action has an effect. No other person or outside force has a greater influence on a child than the parent.” —Bob Keeshan"
