      "title": "Identify where Crabrawler can be found.",
      "content": "Identify where Crabrawler can be found. You'll find it at berry trees on Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, Route 5, Route 8, Route 10, Route 16, Route 17, Secluded Shore, Poni Plains, and three areas of Poni Wilds. Route 10 and Poni Plains give the best chance of finding one. Depending on where you're looking, you'll find one between level 7 (on earlier routes) and level 57 (on later routes)."

      "content": "Go to a berry tree in any one of the areas in step 1 and press A on the berries. If a Crabrawler is there, an exclamation mark will appear above your character’s head, and you'll go into a Pokémon battle. If you go without finding a Crabrawler in any of the trees, you'll have to wait for the berries to re-appear to find one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch the Crabrawler.",
      "content": "Catch the Crabrawler. If it's a low-level Crabrawler, you can use a Nest Ball to make catching it easier. You can also attempt to use. a Quick Ball immediately when the battle starts if you’d like to catch it right away. However, since Crabrawler has a relatively high catch rate, Great Balls or even regular Pokéballs should suffice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go to Mount Lanakila.",
      "content": "Go to Mount Lanakila. Level up Crabrawler there, and it will evolve into Crabominable. This works at any level except up to level 100, so you can have a Crabominable as low as level 2 (if you bred a level 1 Crabrawler instead of catching one as described in the previous steps). Note that you cannot access this area until near the end of the game, in Pokémon Sun and Moon. However, in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, this area is available much earlier on.
