      "title": "Apply a small amount of liquid detergent to the stain.",
      "content": "Apply a small amount of liquid detergent to the stain. Use your fingers to rub approximately 1 tsp (5 ml) of liquid dish or laundry detergent onto the dyed area of your skin. [1] X Research source Mix a little rubbing alcohol into the soap to give it extra stain-fighting power. Use a detergent free of dyes and fragrances to avoid causing irritation to your skin. Keep the detergent away from your eyes. Note that this method may work best for your hands, rather than your face, since the skin on your face tends to be more sensitive and may react to the detergent. Use more or less detergent as needed to cover the dyed area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wet the area with warm water.",
      "content": "Wet the area with warm water. Soak a clean rag in warm water and dab the water onto the detergent and dye stain. [2] X Research source You could also apply the water with your fingers, by running the area under your sink faucet, or with a soaked makeup remover pad."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scrub gently.",
      "content": "Scrub gently. Use a rag or cotton makeup remover pad to gently blot at the dye stain until it fades. Note that this only works with weaker dyes and may not be effective against strong dyes or dyes that have been left to soak on the skin for a prolonged period of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat as needed. If the stain fades but does not completely disappear, you might be able to remove the rest with additional detergent. If the first round of detergent does not fade the dye at all, however, try moving on to another method of dye removal."

    {
      "title": "Combine equal parts baking soda and dish soap.",
      "content": "Combine equal parts baking soda and dish soap. Mix 2 tsp (10 ml) baking soda with 2 tsp (10 ml) liquid dish soap. Stir well until completely combined. [3] X Research source The baking soda has an abrasive effect and scrubs off the dead skin cells stained with dye, revealing clean skin underneath. The soap attracts the dye molecules and cleans the skin by lifting the dye off. Use a mild detergent with no added fragrances or dyes, if possible, to reduce the risk of irritation. Do not apply near the eyes. This mixture is safest when used on areas other than the face."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the mixture onto the dyed skin.",
      "content": "Rub the mixture onto the dyed skin. Use a cotton makeup remover pad to scrub the baking soda solution onto the dyed skin, applying it in a circular motion. Scrub the mixture over the dye using gentle pressure. [4] X Research source Use as much or as little of the baking soda mixture as needed to coat the entire stained area of skin. Rub for 30 to 90 seconds. Stop if you feel any tingling, burning, itching, or other signs of irritation. You could also use a cotton ball or clean rag instead of a cotton pad."

    {
      "title": "Rinse with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse with warm water. After scrubbing the dyed skin with the baking soda, wipe the area clean with a damp washcloth. Then, rinse your skin thoroughly. [5] X Research source You may find it easier to rinse the skin under running water. If you rinse the baking soda off with running water, gently rub the area with your fingers to loosen the baking soda under the water."

    {
      "title": "Repeat as needed.",
      "content": "Repeat as needed. If the dye appears lighter but has not been completely removed, you may consider trying this method again. If this method had no effect on the dye, however, attempt a different one."

      "title": "Dab toothpaste onto the dye stain.",
      "content": "Dab toothpaste onto the dye stain. Use your fingers or a clean toothbrush to apply a dot of toothpaste onto the dye on your skin. Spread the toothpaste out so that it covers the stained area evenly. [6] X Research source Only use as much toothpaste as needed in order to create a thin coat of paste over the stain. Toothpaste can be used on dye skins around the face as well as those on the hands. Toothpaste is a mild abrasive and can actually scrape off dead skin cells stained with dye. Any toothpaste will work, but a non-gel formula with baking soda in it may work even better than others since it has larger granules."

Use a cotton ball, cotton makeup remover pad, or a clean toothbrush to gently rub the toothpaste over the dyed area of skin for up to a minute, massaging it in using a circular motion. [7] X Research source Note that you can also use your fingertips to massage the toothpaste into the dye."

      "content": "Rub petroleum jelly onto the stain. Dab petroleum jelly onto your skin and massage it into the dye stain using a circular motion. Continue rubbing until you notice the stain starting to wear off. [8] X Research source Petroleum jelly is safe to use on your face and hands, but avoid getting it in your eyes. You can use your fingers to rub the petroleum jelly onto the dye stain, but a cotton ball or cotton pad may work better since the dye may accidentally transfer onto your fingers if you bring them into direct contact with the dye. If the petroleum jelly soaks into the cotton, though, use your fingers."

Allow the petroleum jelly to sit on the stain overnight. [10] X Research source If you are worried about the dye rubbing off onto your bedsheets in the middle of the night, cover the area with breathable cotton bandages. Alternatively, if the stain is on your hands, you can cover them with cotton gloves as the petroleum jelly sits."

      "content": "Rub a generous coat of baby oil over the stain. Use your fingers to apply a coat of baby oil over the dyed skin. [11] X Research source Alternatively, try another oil, like olive. You can also apply the oil using a cotton ball, cotton pad, or clean rag. Apply enough oil to coat the stained skin but do not apply so much oil that it drips over other areas of your skin. Baby oil is safe to use on both your face and hands, but avoid getting it into your eyes."

      "title": "Let it sit overnight.",
      "content": "Let it sit overnight. Let the baby oil sit on your skin for 8 hours or overnight. [12] X Research source If you are concerned about the oil soaking into your pillowcase or bedsheets, cover it with clean cotton bandages. If applying it to your hands, you can cover them with cotton gloves overnight. Opt for coverings made from a breathable material, like cotton, over those made from plastic."

If it does not do so, you may need to try another method of dye removal."

      "content": "Soak a cotton ball in nail polish remover. Soak a cotton ball or cotton pad in an acetone-based nail polish remover. Wring slightly by squeezing it with your fingers to remove any excess. [14] X Research source The acetone in nail polish remover can be very abrasive and will remove the dyed, dead skin cells on top of your skin while also lifting up the dye. Keep the nail polish remover away from your eyes. Note that this method is risky to use with the sensitive skin of your face and may work better for hair dye stains on your hands."
