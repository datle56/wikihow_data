      "content": "Bop lore refers to someone’s \"promiscuous\" sexual history or background. “Bop” is a relatively new slang term that refers to someone with a lot of sexual history, who posts photos of their body online, or is generally seen as promiscuous. “Bop lore” is a way of subtly referring to a person’s sexual history. The term is isn't nice—and it even has some problematic undertones. For example, the term is often used to slut shame women in particular. Often, TikTok users and others leave comments like “bop lore” on videos of a person discussing their sexual experiences. Example: “Stacy started telling me about her past hookups, and I realized I was getting some juicy bop lore.” Though it can be used in a silly or friendly way (for example, when someone's friend jokingly refers to another friend's sexual history without judgment), it's also regularly used to as way to shame or mock someone for their sexual history. And that's not cool!"

      "content": "“Bop lore” is likely derived from the slang term “lala bop.” A “lala bop” is any promiscuous person. It’s not clear where the term originated, but it was boosted into popularity by the 2022 song “Lalabop” by Almighty Rexxo. Though the song itself doesn’t use the term in this way, it was catchy enough for TikTok users to start using it for videos discussing people they deemed promiscuous. [1] X Research source Another song titled “Lalabop” by the artist Ymb Nuski was then posted to Youtube by the user Velle Vell, this time using the term in its popular context, and as a result, popularizing it even more. At the height of the trend, users would make slideshows of people they deemed “lala bops” while the audio played over it. The lala bop trend was also widely criticized as being thinly veiled slutshaming, and a violation of many people’s privacy."

      "content": "“Bop lore” has been criticized as being a form of harassment or bullying. While the term may describe the sexual history of anyone, it’s most often targeted at women, so it's often seen as sexist. Also, many have pointed out that a person’s sexual history doesn't change someone's value as a person, and it isn't something to make fun of. So commenting something like “bop lore” on a video is pretty disrespectful, immature, and unkind."
