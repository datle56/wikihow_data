      "content": "Talk with your veterinarian. Not all dogs are good candidates for home vaccination. Call or meet with your vet to determine if your dog meets the basic health criteria. If you are concerned about how to give the shots, your vet can also talk you through the process or even let you watch a demonstration in-office.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Vets technically lose money by having you home vaccinate. However, most are more than happy to help you learn if it is in the best interest of your puppy. You'll also want to check the laws for your area regarding animal vaccinations. Some locations do not recognize self-administered rabies vaccinations and may even issue fines."

      "title": "Decide which non-core vaccinations to give.",
      "content": "Decide which non-core vaccinations to give. Veterinarians generally recognize certain vaccinations as central or “core” to your puppy's health, such as rabies and parvovirus. Other vaccinations can be helpful for puppies in certain environments. Leptospirosis, coronavirus, bordetella, and borrelia burgdorferi are all optional vaccines. [2] X Research source For example, if you live in a wooded area where your puppy may be exposed to ticks, then a borrelia vaccine is a good idea as it reduces the risk of Lyme Disease. It's a good idea to consult your local veterinarian if you're not sure which non-core vaccinations are right for your dog. They'll be able to give you an idea of what shots are necessary and which shots you can skip out on."

      "title": "Purchase a puppy vaccination pack.",
      "content": "Purchase a puppy vaccination pack. These packets contain all of the vaccination materials from needles to vials for the full series of puppy shots. Feed store owners, specialty pet stores, and online pet outlets may carry the shot packets. Only get your vaccines from reputable retailers or they could be worthless or even cause harm to your puppy. Expect to pay somewhere between $75-100 for a full series of puppy vaccinations. Before you buy a vaccination pack, ask the vendor how they store the packs before they're purchased. Avoid buying packs that have been stored in excessive heat or cold or the vaccinations might not be as effective."

      "title": "Keep the shots cold.",
      "content": "Keep the shots cold. As soon as you get the vaccines, place them in the drawer of your refrigerator. If you buy online, the company should also ship your shots in a cold container. Some companies will even require that you pay extra for overnight shipping. If the shots drop below a certain temperature, they may become less effective. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Give the first combination vaccine between 6 to 12 weeks of age. To reduce the total number of shots for puppies, between 3 to 5 viruses are usually combined into a single dosage. Your puppy should receive this first major shot fairly early on, so that there is enough time for boosters before they mature. [4] X Research source A standard first-round combination vaccine may container parvovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and distemper. If your puppy has been exposed to some of these illnesses early in life, your vet may recommend that you vaccinate as soon as possible."

      "content": "Give boosters every 3 weeks until 16 weeks of age. The vaccination packet that your purchase will provide instructions regarding the frequency of each shot and what they each contain. Distemper, for example, requires an initial shot and a series of boosters thereafter. Not giving the boosters or delaying them reduces or eliminates any protections for your puppy.

      "content": "Do not alter the injection amounts. The manufacturer of the shots will provide specific dosage instructions on or in the vaccination package. Read these instructions carefully and do not alter them to fit your puppy's age, weight, or breed. Large puppies should get the same dose of vaccine as small ones and vice versa.

      "content": "Plan to inject in your puppy's neck for subcutaneous shots. When you receive your shot kit, you'll notice that each of the shots will be labeled according to the preferred injection site. For shots that need to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin's surface), it's usually easiest to use the back of your puppy's neck as the injection site, as it contains a fair amount of extra skin."

      "content": "Plan to inject in your puppy's thigh for intramuscular shots. Identify those shots in the kit that are labeled “intramuscular” or that require an injection directly into muscle tissue. For these shots, the best choice is usually your puppy's upper thigh because the muscle lies close to the skin's surface. Vaccines rarely require intramuscular injection, and it can be more painful for your puppy. Read the instructions on your vaccines carefully, and inject vaccines subcutaneously whenever possible."

Use your non-dominant hand to hold them still by gently grasping the scruff at the back of their neck. You can also tuck them slightly under your arm and exert a little bit of downward pressure to hold them in position. [11] X Research source Some puppies behave better when placed on a high table for shots. However, you must keep a secure grip on them at all times. Or, they could fall to the ground and be injured. Ask a friend to assist you with the injections. You can also place the puppy on the table and then use your upper body weight to securely pin them down."

      "title": "Raise the skin slightly up.",
      "content": "Raise the skin slightly up. Continuing to hold the puppy in position, move your fingers to the injection site. Grasp the puppy's loose skin and fur and pull slightly upwards. If you are injecting behind the neck, then you'll pull up a good amount of skin. For the thigh, the skin won't be as much, which is okay since you are injecting into the muscle anyway. [12] X Research source Once you've practiced lifting up the skin, wipe down the area with an alcohol wipe or a cotton ball dipped in alcohol. It's okay if you get some alcohol on the fur as well."

      "content": "Check for a vein hit. Once the needle is in place, pull back on the syringe's plunger just a very small amount. Look to see if any blood drained into the syringe. If this happens, then your needle might have hit a vein. Pull the entire needle out and re-insert in once more with a slightly different angle. Inserting vaccination medication directly into a vein creates more of a risk of a reaction on the part of your puppy."

Continue until the syringe is empty and the vaccine is fully injected. Pull the needle out of the skin. [14] X Research source Once you are done, carefully dispose of the needle in the sharps container provided within the kit. If your kit doesn't include a sharps container, then place cap the used needle and place it in a sealed, hard plastic container for disposal."

However, some puppies do experience mild reactions, such as loose stools or a loss of appetite. Other puppies have a more severe reaction characterized by difficulty breathing, heavy panting, and loss of consciousness. If you are worried about your puppy, take them to an emergency vet immediately. [16] X Research source Vaccines can come with a risk of anaphylactic shock. If your dog shows signs of experiencing anaphylactic shock, including vomiting, diarrhea, shock, seizure, cold limbs, or pale gums, take them to an emergency vet immediately."
