      "content": "Anapanasati is a form of meditation that focuses on the breath. Also known as Ānāpānasati Sutti and breath meditation, this spiritual practice is the core of Buddhist meditation. The practice uses inhalations and exhalations to cleanse the mind, body, and spirit. It’s believed that breathing intentionally can cultivate a spiritual awakening and become more mindful. [2] X Research source Traditionally, the practice brings you through 4 foundations of mindfulness to find peace: body, feelings, mind, and mind-objects. Some Buddhists incorporate mantras or affirmations with each foundation, like “I breathe in experiencing joy” and “I breathe out experience joy.” [3] X Research source In Sanskrit, sati means “mindful” and ānāpāna means “inhale and exhale.” [4] X Research source"

[5] X Expert Source Masha Kouzmenko Meditation Coach Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. The practice of breath meditation focuses on the subtle movement of the breath, so stray noises can easily disrupt it. Bring your meditation practice to a quiet place, like a back porch or bedroom. [6] X Research source Buddhist instructional sutras (or suttas in Pali) recommend using abandoned buildings, deep forests, or the foot of a tree for an extended period of practice."

      "content": "Sit cross-legged with your back straight and hands placed comfortably. The Buddha's instructions indicate that sitting with a straight back is the best position for Anapanasati, as this posture allows energy to flow freely. [7] X Research source So, sit up straight, roll your shoulders back, and relax. The more comfortable you feel, the better. [8] X Research source The traditional choice is the lotus position—seated cross-legged with the right foot tucked on top of the left thigh and the left foot on top of the right thigh. If your body cannot accommodate this, use a comfortable cross-legged posture or sit on a chair. If needed, gently and mindfully lay your back against a chair, wall, or tree trunk. Place your hands anywhere that feels comfortable. A common choice is to place them on your lap with both palms upward."

      "content": "Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Take a moment to relax your body and let go of any thoughts that may come. Then, once the mind has settled, start concentrating on your breath. You don’t need to do anything special during this step—just be aware of your breathing and try to rid all other things from your mind. [9] X Research source If you have difficulty concentrating just on the breath, try focusing on a part of your body, too, such as the tip of your nose or upper lip."

      "title": "Count your breaths.",
      "content": "Count your breaths. This step is optional, but it can be very helpful for beginners (and prevent your mind from wandering). Maintain your focus on your breath. Then, start counting the breaths as follows: 1 (inhale), 1 (exhale), then 2 (inhale), 2 (exhale), and so on up to 10. Restart the count once you get to 10. [10] X Research source Stop counting when your mind is focused entirely on your breathing."

      "title": "Follow the breath with your mind.",
      "content": "Follow the breath with your mind. Without consciously altering your breath, follow the changes in its patterns and characteristics. If you take a long breath, note that it’s long. If it’s a short breath, do the same. Notice and experience how each breath feels. [11] X Research source The purpose of this step is to train you to become aware of the natural transition and relaxation of the breath during meditation. As you maintain mindfulness, your breathing will become fine and delicate, and your body should feel more and more at ease."

      "title": "Fix your attention on mental signs.",
      "content": "Fix your attention on mental signs. While you meditate, a mental image or sign may arise, such as a bright light, mist, or wheel. If you notice a sign, bring your attention to it as you continue to breathe. At first, the sign may appear vague or unsteady, but as you focus on it, it may become clearer as you enter a stage of deep concentration. [12] X Research source Attempting to shift focus from your breath to the image might cause it to disappear, but don’t worry! The more you practice, the more success you’ll have at intensifying the image."

      "content": "Turn away from negative emotions. As you meditate, you may experience intense emotions. This experience is what Buddha described as “experiencing rapture” ( PITI ), “experiencing bliss” ( sukha ), and “experiencing the mind.” [13] X Research source These are the aspects of yourself, whether pleasant or negative. Embrace the positive emotions, but do your best to mentally move away from negative ones, like greed and conceit. [14] X Research source Negative emotions are known as “defilements” in Buddhist tradition. Processing these emotions can come in 4 stages: contemplate impermanence, contemplate fading away, contemplate cessation, and contemplate relinquishment. Traditionally, successful Anapanasati is about letting go of (or relinquishing) what no longer serves you. Keep in mind that these stages do not come quickly or easily. But with time and practice, you can find peace. [15] X Research source"

Consider how the breath-driven gradually stilled your body, feelings, and thoughts. [16] X Research source Your practice is done whenever you feel like it is! Set a timer if you’d like to aim to meditate for a specific amount of time or continue meditating until you feel satisfied or come across a mental sign."

Like Anapanasati, Vipassana is a form of meditation; however, unlike Anapanasati, it focuses on the universal law of nature and involves walking along a path with intention. [29] X Research source Vipassana is a logical meditation with the goal of mental purification through self-observation. Through this meditative practice, you dive deep into the mind, shifting through negativities. [30] X Research source In contrast, Anapanasati is an observative meditation that concentrates on inhaling and exhaling to release negativity. Anapanasati and Vipassana work hand in hand. While the core practices have different focuses and goals, you cannot practice one without the other."
