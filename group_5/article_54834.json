      "content": "Act quickly after hair dye gets on your hands. The dye will take a few minutes to pigment your skin. Even if the dye has begun to set, the sooner you treat it, the easier it will be to remove. Your skin is made up of layers, and as the dye seeps into your skin, it will dye it layer by layer. If you allow the dye to sit on your hands, it will be able to dye more layers of your skin and deeper layers of your skin. If the dye stains the deep layers of your skin, it will likely take harsh measures to remove, which may damage your skin."
