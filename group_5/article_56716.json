It’s a casual and friendly way to let the other person know you’re eager to see them, so reserve it for informal relationships like online friends and dates. Once you’ve established when and where you plan to meet, use “Looking forward to meeting you” to politely end the conversation. [1] X Research source Technically speaking, “I am looking forward to meeting you” is more grammatically correct than “Looking forward to meeting you” because it includes the proper subject “I.” So, use “I am looking forward to meeting you” to be polite in formal and professional settings.
