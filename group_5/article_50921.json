Research what others do, such as buyers, merchandisers, pattern cutters, garment and fabric technologists, quality controllers, graders, sample machinists, salespeople, PR and marketing people, fashion journalists, retailers, event organizers, stylists, and so forth. Know how much your customers spend, their lifestyles, where they like to shop, how they like to shop, and what they like and dislike.
