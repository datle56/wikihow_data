      "content": "Ask yourself what triggers you, to begin healing. When you’re judging another person and envying them, what traits, possessions, or circumstances do they have? [1] X Expert Source Sarah Schewitz, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 April 2019. When you acknowledge you’re envying someone else, you can start to cope with your emotions and stop comparing yourself to others . [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Research has found that we usually become envious of people who are similar to us. For example, you may compare yourself to a coworker or a friend. If you have a lower self-esteem, it’s easier to see people as threats and look down on yourself. You may think someone is “funnier” or “happier” than you. \"Malicious\" envy causes you to feel hostile toward others and see them as rivals, while \"benign\" envy can motivate you to be \"better.\" Still, both forms of envy cause you to fall into comparative thinking.

      "content": "List your priorities in order to understand what defines you. To help you work through envy, consider all of your values, needs, and belief systems. All of these concepts are essential to who you are and can't be taken away from you. When you write all of them down, you'll create a representation of your \"core self.\" [4] X Research source An illustration of your \"core self\" will help you process envy because what you feel insecure about is typically outside of your \"core self.\" For example, if you value kindness, need words of affirmation, and believe in reciprocity, you're unlikely to feel insecure about competing with anyone over any of these elements of your \"core self.\" They're just part of who you are."

      "title": "It’s common to compare yourself against others based on your non-core traits.",
      "content": "It’s common to compare yourself against others based on your non-core traits. After you've defined your \"core self,\" begin to identify traits or habits of yours that exist outside of it. For example, if generosity is part of your \"core self,\" but being stylish, witty, or well-spoken is outside of it, then you'll have more information about what triggers your envy. [5] X Research source In the case above, you might compare yourself to people you think are more stylish, witty, or well-spoken than you are. You may feel threatened by them and worry they'll \"replace\" you. Work performance, abilities, or status all exist outside of our \"core self\" and involve the perception of other people, so they can all trigger envy or comparisons. Criticism can also make you feel like you're \"inferior\" to other people or create insecurities. Remember that no one's words can change your \"core self\" or your value."

      "content": "When you’re kind to yourself, you won’t measure yourself against others. Whenever you resent other people because of what they have, pull your attention away from them. Instead, focus on what you need . For example, if you’re bothered by someone’s social media posts, you may wish you had more time for fun or self-care. Remind yourself that disappointment or self-doubt is normal. [6] X Research source A way to swap envy for self-compassion may sound like: “They look like such a perfect couple. I wish I had more quality time in my relationship. I need that sense of connection.” Also steer clear of prideful remarks like: “They might have beautiful wedding pictures, but I have a better house.” This type of commentary keeps you in a cycle of unhelpful comparisons."

      "content": "When you evaluate someone you envy, you only see the \"highlights.\" Usually, envy comes up when you judge someone’s life from the outside—for example, their physical appearance or their online activity. Remember that everyone deals with their own struggles or challenges, so their circumstances are just as complex as yours. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It’s easy to think their situation is perfect if you just look at surface-level details. Typically, people are a lot more discreet about the negative parts of their lives. You’ll humanize others and build empathy when you don’t see them as flawless."

      "content": "Transform negative beliefs into neutral observations to combat jealousy. If you catch yourself placing more value on another’s abilities and devaluing your own, then \"correct\" your false assumption that one skill or quality is better or more valuable than another. To \"correct\" a thought, reframe what you tell yourself and use more encouraging language. [8] X Research source A \"devaluing\" thought : \"I’m not noticed as much in the group now that Justin has been hanging out with us. I used to be ‘the funny one’ and now everyone pays more attention to him. Sometimes I wish he’d have an off day.\" A \"corrected\" thought : \"I know that I am feeling left out or undervalued by my friends, but that doesn’t mean that Justin is funnier. We're just different. We have unique types of humor, and that is okay.\""

After you’ve developed a positive outlook on the gifts, talents, and skills that others have, shine the spotlight on what you’ve been granted or worked hard for. Be thankful and count as many blessings as you can, from valuable friendships to the roof over your head. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your focus will shift away from what you don’t have to what you do have. Trying to search for every possible blessing can be a fun challenge. Expressing gratitude is a stress-relieving activity that can combat frustration."

      "content": "This practice allows you to feel irreplaceable so no one threatens you. Accept that you don’t have to be just like everyone else. Steer clear of labeling any differences as “good” or “bad.” When you label your personality traits or qualities as inferior or superior, you make your self-worth depend on others. Just remind yourself that you’re a unique person who deserves respect. [10] X Research source Remember that you bring a new perspective to any group. Everyone makes mistakes, so choose to look at them as learning experiences. Stand up for inclusivity and diversity instead of drawing comparisons."

      "content": "When you say these kind words, you'll ease feelings of envy. “Unplug” from social media and other people for a bit. Take a pause to reflect on what you offer the world. Use “I” statements and say positive affirmations . These powerful words will help you love yourself and see how special you truly are. [11] X Research source Affirmation about a talent: \"I have a real knack for digital painting.\" Affirmation about a personality trait: \"I am giving and kind.\" Affirmation about self-love: \"I accept myself unconditionally.\""

      "content": "Competing against yourself is more empowering than envying people. Instead of measuring yourself up to other people, think about accomplishing new \"personal bests\" in your journey of self-improvement. For example, rather than focusing on how much a fitness influencer has achieved, try to increase your own endurance or stamina. It'll feel very empowering to keep reaching new goals. [12] X Research source For example, write in a journal, \"Three months ago, I ran an 11-minute mile, and now I'm down to a 9-minute mile!\" You can also set new standards for helping others. You may say to yourself, \"This month, I was able to volunteer at the soup kitchen every weekend!\""

For example, maybe they’re great mentors or they’re very uplifting. When you see that they only want the best for you, it’ll be more natural to praise their successes. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you congratulate others, you practice “capitalization,” a type of social support that makes both you and the other person feel positive. When you compliment others often, it’ll become a reflex that replaces envy. If you model genuine joy for what others accomplish, they’ll cheer you on, too."

Share why you look up to them, how you’d like to improve yourself, and ways you think they can mentor you. You’ll probably find it’s a lot more fulfilling to admire people because they can be your allies. [14] X Research source For example, say, “I noticed that you built such a strong following online.

If you're around anyone who makes it a habit to place themselves above or below anyone else, you might pick up these patterns, too. Limit your exposure to these behaviors so you can focus on appreciating others. [16] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you can, try to change the subject if someone becomes competitive.

Contact a mental health professional, like a trained therapist at BetterHelp , and schedule an appointment. They’re specially trained to help you find the root cause of your envy and change your thought patterns so they’re more positive. [17] X Research source Ask about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can improve how you evaluate yourself and others. It can also help you switch from feelings of envy to more productive behaviors, like self-care or self-improvement."
