      "content": "Engine not cranking or starting Tom Eisenberg, an auto technician, says that “your starter's job is to kick over your engine…your battery sends your starter a little punch, which …starts the engine.” If your engine doesn’t crank when you turn the key, it could potentially be an issue with your starter. [1] X Research source Another potential cause of your engine not turning over is a dead battery. Check your battery by touching the terminals with a voltmeter and looking for a 12 V reading. If a starter is beginning to go bad, then it may take turning the key a few times to turn over the engine."

      "content": "Clicking or whirring noises Auto technician Jason Shackelford says that “when turning the key to crank the engine, sometimes it may just make a click sound” if there’s a bad starter solenoid, or the cylindrical electrical component attached to the starter motor. You may also hear a clicking or whirring noise if there’s damage to the starter’s drive gear or engine’s flywheel, which is the large gear that provides power to your engine. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Oil covering the starter Your starter is a cylindrical metal piece that’s usually on the passenger side of your vehicle’s engine. If your engine leaks onto the starter and it looks soaked in oil, then it could be preventing your car from starting. [4] X Research source Because the oil can get inside the starter and cause it to malfunction, it usually requires the help of a professional mechanic to clean and fix."

      "content": "Smoke coming from under the hood A bad starter may also get stuck and stay engaged after your engine turns over, which can cause it to overheat. If you notice smoke coming from under your engine and there’s a burning smell, then it’s a sign of serious damage to the starter. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Tighten any loose connections on your starter and battery. Pop open your hood and look for the cylindrical starter on the passenger side of your engine. Inspect the wire connections connecting to your starter, and tighten them with a wrench if they feel loose. [6] X Research source Follow the wires connecting to your starter back to the battery, and tighten any loose nuts or bolts that you find. If you see rust or corrosion on the battery terminals, clean them with toothbrush soaked with a mix of 1 tbsp (17 g) of baking soda and 1 c (240 ml) of warm water."

      "content": "Test the power wires and fuses on the starter with a voltage tester . To test your starter , look for the large and small power wires attached to it. Hold the tip of the voltage tester against each wire’s terminal. If both of the wires have a 12 V reading, then it’s a sign your starter is going bad. [7] X Research source When you’re testing the voltage of the smaller wire terminal, turn the key in the ignition to get an accurate reading. To test the car fuses , find the starter fuse using the guide in your vehicle’s manual. Locate the fuse box under the hood under a plastic cover. Look in the middle of the fuse to see if the connection is broken inside. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the starter relay resistance and voltage with a multimeter.",
      "content": "Check the starter relay resistance and voltage with a multimeter . The starter relay is a plug that delivers power to your starter, and it’s located on the positive lead near your battery. Set your multimeter to ohms. Place the multimeter leads on the ignition switch circuit connected with a black thin wire and on the ground terminal of the starter. [9] X Research source If the reading is higher than 5 ohms, then the starter relay is malfunctioning and needs to be replaced. To test voltage, set the multimeter to volts. Hold the red probe to the red connection on the battery and the other probe on the ignition switch circuit. Have someone turn the key and check the voltage. If it’s higher than 0.2 V, then the relay is malfunctioning. Because replacing a relay involves a lot of electrical parts, it’s best to take your vehicle to a mechanic for repairs."

The safety switch prevents your vehicle from starting unless it’s in park or neutral, but a faulty one may prevent your starter from working. Engage your handbrake and shift your vehicle into neutral. Then, try turning the key to see if your vehicle starts. [10] X Research source If your vehicle starts, then the safety switch is probably your issue. If your vehicle still doesn’t start, there may be a problem with another part of your starter. Because the safety switch is difficult to access and could prevent your car from starting, take your vehicle to a mechanic to have it repaired."

Try to tighten any nuts or bolts around the leaking section of your engine. If you notice any damage to the rubber gaskets on your engine, then visit a mechanic to have them replaced.
