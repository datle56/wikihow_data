      "content": "“I’m rooting for you” is a supportive phrase used to cheer someone on. If someone says, they’re “rooting for you,” they’re saying, “I believe in you,” or “I support you.” [1] X Research source They’re being your biggest cheerleader—think of it like them standing on the sidelines cheering you on or giving you a pep talk. It’s an endearing phrase meant to show that you’re not alone. This phrase is commonly used to express support in challenging or exciting times. For instance, a friend might say, “I’m rooting for you,” before you go on a date, run a marathon, or ask for a promotion."

You can say it to a friend, family member, or coworker. For instance, let’s say a colleague says, “I’m rooting for you,” after you mention meeting with a company executive.

      "content": "“Right back at ya!” Be a bit playful by throwing the supportive sentiment right back at them. This response is a fun (and possibly flirty) way to share similar support, especially in athletic or competitive situations. For example, maybe your crush says they’re rooting for you before a basketball game even though they’re on the rival team. Use “Right back at ya!” to say you’re cheering for them, too."

      "title": "“I’m right behind you.”",
      "content": "“I’m right behind you.” This supportive expression carries the same weight as “I’m rooting for you,” only it’s a bit more serious. “I’m right behind you” is a gentle way of saying, “I’m by your side.” It shows that you’re in someone’s corner to help them no matter what.

      "title": "“Rooting” is verbal support, while “supporting” is an act of assistance.",
      "content": "“Rooting” is verbal support, while “supporting” is an act of assistance. While “rooting” and “supporting” can be used interchangeably, they can have slightly different meanings. “Rooting” is often a verbal expression of support or care, while “supporting” involves an act of helping someone physically or emotionally. [2] X Research source Think of it in terms of sports. When you “root” for a team member, you’re cheering them on from the sidelines. When you “support” them, you’re actively helping them on the field by passing a ball or defending them. In Australia, “rooting” is a slang term for sex or sexual intercourse, so use the term wisely when down under. [3] X Research source"
