      "content": "Baking soda and vinegar break residue for an easy, natural cleanup. Baking soda is naturally abrasive, so it works great for scrubbing the inside of your oven without using chemicals. Using vinegar to clean also breaks down debris because it’s acidic, and it fizzes when you mix it with baking soda. [1] X Research source Remove the racks and any other accessories from your oven. Make a paste by mixing ½ cup (170 g) of baking soda with 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of water. For a stronger cleaner, try using dish soap instead of water. Coat the inside of your oven with the paste, except for the heating elements. Allow the paste to sit for 12 hours or overnight. If you don’t have that much time, let the paste sit for at least 40 minutes. Wipe the oven down with a damp cloth. Green cleaning expert Susan Stocker mentions that a pumice stone can help you scrub even more. Pour distilled white vinegar into a spray bottle and spray it inside your oven. Wipe out any remaining residue and put the accessories back inside your oven"

      "content": "Salt and vinegar work best for cleaning spills on the bottom of your oven . If food spilled out while you were cooking, try to clean it up as soon as possible so it’s easier to remove. Salt is the perfect abrasive cleaner and will absorb the spill, while the vinegar will help disinfect and deodorize your oven. [2] X Research source Heat your oven to 150 °F (66 °C) or the lowest temperature setting. Sprinkle a thin layer of table salt onto the floor of your oven. Put on oven mitts, and scrub your oven with a sponge while it’s still warm. Spray distilled white vinegar into your oven, and wipe it out with a damp rag. Dry your oven out with a paper towel."

      "content": "Lemons act as a natural degreaser and deodorizer. If you have a lot of smelly residue coating the inside of your oven, lemon is the perfect cleaner. The citric acid in the lemons breaks down all the gunk and leaves behind a fresh citrus scent when you’re finished cleaning. [4] X Research source Cut 2 lemons and squeeze the juice onto a baking tray. Fill the tray one-third full with water and set the lemons on it. Place the baking dish in the oven at 250 °F (121 °C) for at least 30 minutes. Use a scouring pad to remove the loosened build-up once your oven cools down. Dip a sponge in the leftover lemon water in the baking dish and rinse off the oven. Alternatively, try scrubbing with another freshly cut lemon for extra cleaning power. Dry your oven off with a towel."

      "content": "Letting oven racks soak breaks apart the baked-on food. While you’re cleaning the rest of your oven, take out the racks and clean them separately. While a bathtub is the perfect size for soaking the oven racks, you may also use a large tote bin. [7] X Research source Lay a towel in the bottom of your tub to prevent scratches. Fill your bathtub with hot water and add 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of liquid dish soap. Submerge the oven racks in the soapy water overnight. Scrub the racks with a clean cloth or bristle brush. Rinse the oven racks with hot water. Dry and replace the racks in your oven."
