      "content": "Go to the third island, Ula'Ula island, and beat the third trial, Acerola's ghost type trial at the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart if you haven't already. Getting up to at least the point of beating this trial is essential in order to continue on in this article, as you'll need to catch a Mimikyu . Since this is a ghost type trial, and Mimikyu, the totem Pokémon, is a ghost and fairy type, some good Pokémon types to have on your team are ghost and steel types, as Mimikyu has a 2x weakness to them. Avoid using normal, fighting or dragon type Pokémon, as Mimikyu is immune to these move types."

      "content": "Catch a Mimikyu in the Megamart. This may be tough, as Mimikyu has an extremely low catch rate of 45, and an also low encounter rate of 5%. Therefore, be prepared with a lot of Great or Ultra balls, as well as your ghost and steel type Pokémon. Also, be prepared to see a lot of Haunters, Golbats and Klefkis."

As stated in the introduction, Let's Snuggle Forever is an upgraded version of Play Rough, so it is essential that your Mimikyu knows this move. Unfortunately, if your Mimikyu doesn't know that move, then you'll have to catch another."
