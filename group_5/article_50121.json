      "content": "Define the abbreviation the first time you use it. In formal writing, you must always spell out the abbreviation the first time you use it. Generally, you follow the full name with the abbreviation in parenthesis. [1] X Research source For instance, if you are using the abbreviation for an organization, you would spell out the name first: \"The organization is called Poetry for Poetry's Sake (PPS).\" Not every abbreviation or acronym needs to be spelled out. Certain acronyms have become commonly used as words instead, such as \"radar,\" which actually stands for \"radio detecting and ranging.\" [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Understand the punctuation. Punctuation can be confusing when it comes to abbreviations, and it can vary by style guidelines. However, in American English, you generally use periods with abbreviations such as honorifics (titles for people) and street name abbreviations. [3] X Research source For instance, you use a period when you abbreviate \"Mister\" to \"Mr.\" or when you add \"Ph.D.\" after someone's name to show she has a doctorate. Don't abbreviate a person's title if it's not in front of her name. For instance, you wouldn't say, \"I went to the dr.,\" but rather \"I went to the doctor.\" However, you can abbreviate things like \"Ph.D.\" when it's not after a person's name. You abbreviate \"Street\" to \"St.\" or \"Terrace\" to \"Ter.\" You can find a list of standard street abbreviations from the Post Office. [4] X Research source Don't use periods with units of measure, such as \"ft\" or \"km.\" Don't use periods with acronyms, such as the one used above: Poetry for Poetry's Sake should be abbreviated \"PPS\" not \"P.P.S.\""

(AP Style, for instance, has its own rules about abbreviating state names). Also, don't shorten regular words, such as \"your\" to \"yr\" or \"through\" to \"thru\" in formal writing.

Some style guidelines prefer you leave some of them out; check to make sure it's appropriate for what you're writing by checking the style guidelines for that piece. For example: [6] X Research source use \"etc.\" for et cetera, meaning \"and so forth\" use \"et al.\" for \"et alii\" or \"and others\" use \"i.e.\" for \"id est\" or \"that is\" use \"e.g.\" for exemplÄ« gratia or \"for example.\""

      "content": "Be consistent. As stated, each style guidelines will require you to use abbreviations slightly differently. However, one of the most important rules of abbreviations is to be consistent. Once you choose an abbreviation, make sure you write it the same way throughout the document.

Stick to acronyms for organization names and standard abbreviations that most people know. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the crowd. While generally it may seem like textspeak online and on smartphones is all about breaking the rules, in many ways it's as formalized as abbreviations in other forms. That is, through widespread use overtime, certain abbreviations have come to be considered standard. [10] X Research source \"Textspeak\" just refers to the language and spelling that has developed since the advent of texting. For instance, a common acronym online is \"LOL,\" meaning \"laughing out loud,\" to show amusement, although some people use \"haha\" instead. Capitalizing \"LOL\" has become optional; some people may use \"lol\" instead. If you're unsure what abbreviations to use, you can find any number of abbreviation dictionaries online that give definitions for textspeak, such as on Webopedia."

In fact, online text often deviates from texting abbreviations, as people tend to use fewer abbreviations online. Sites like Twitter are the exception, as it restricts the number of characters a person can use per tweet."

That is, as long as the other person can understand what you are saying, you can shorten words, replace complicated spellings with simple spellings, and make your own contractions. You can also leave out vowels. [11] X Research source"

Whenever you're communicating with a colleague, your boss, or even just someone who's a bit older, it's probably a good idea to drop the textspeak and use regular spellings. Older generations tend to frown on this type of texting, though that's not true across the board. Regardless, it's best to keep it out of professional and work settings, with the exception of like-minded peers. [12] X Research source If you are writing a business email or other formal correspondence, do not abbreviate. Use full words and formal, clear language."
