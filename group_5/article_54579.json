      "content": "This sign can't be rushed into anything, especially romance. Being flirty with a Virgo requires a balancing act between showing your interest without scaring him off by getting too intense. He'll appreciate you taking the initiative, but then he'll need space to decide how he feels and flirts back on his own terms. If you start the flirting, for example, let him be the one to take the next step and ask you out. That way, you're letting him know that you're interested without pushing him for more. When you're texting, wait for his response before sending a follow-up message. Double-texting could make him feel pressured to respond. Being consistent and flexible is a great way to engage with a Virgo guy. [7] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019."
