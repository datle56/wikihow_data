If he asks you out on short notice (as a spontaneous Aries likely will), you might say, \"I've actually got plans today, but I'm free later this week ðŸ˜Š \" If you've been texting back and forth, end your conversation on a high note and use your exit to emphasize the cool things you've got going on in your life. You might text him, \"It's been so fun to catch up, but I've got to head out. Going to a concert with friends tonight! ðŸŽ¸\""
