      "content": "Measure the headboard to determine how much fabric you need. Measure the length and width of the headboard with a tape measure. Measure the thickness of the headboard and add this number to each measurement. [1] X Research source For example, if the headboard is 36 in (91 cm) wide by 24 in (61 cm) tall, and 3 in (7.6 cm) thick, then you need 2 pieces of 39 in (99 cm) by 27 in (69 cm) fabric to sew the cover. You can chose 2 different patterns of fabric for the front and back of the slipcover to make it reversible.

Mark your chosen patterned fabric, fabric liner, and 1 in (2.5 cm) thick stiff quilt batting with a pen to match the measurements you got from measuring the headboard. Use fabric scissors to cut them to size. [3] X Research source You can use an old sheet or any spare fabric to make the liner, since you will not see this part. Make sure that you use the stiffest quilt batting you can find to give the slipcover its structure."

Lay the next piece of patterned fabric face down, then a piece of batting, and finally the last piece of liner. [4] X Research source You will sew the slipcover inside out to hide the seams, and then flip it so the liners are on the inside and the patterned fabric pieces face outwards."

      "content": "Pin all the pieces together with sewing pins. Place pins with the sharp points facing inwards towards the center of the fabric cover and the round heads facing outwards. Put a pin approximately every 6 in (15 cm) to secure all the layers together. [5] X Research source You will remove the pins as you sew, so don’t put them too close together or it will be a very slow process."

Run all 6 pieces together through a sewing machine to create the top seam. Remove the pins holding the layers together as you work so you don’t hit them with the needle. [7] X Research source It’s possible to sew over the pins holding the layers together and remove them after, but if the sewing machine’s needle hits a pin, it could break. You can use a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance on the sewing machine when you sew all the seams."

Sew the next 3 pieces together to create the second bottom seam. [8] X Research source Sewing 2 bottom seams will leave the slit that will allow the slipcover to slide onto the headboard. You may want to fold up the bottom edges and sew a hem to hide the raw fabric edges."

Measure the height, width, and thickness of the headboard to determine how big you need the piece to be. Add the thickness to both the width and height, plus an extra 3 in (7.6 cm) or so to allow it to wrap around the backside. [12] X Research source You can use any large piece of fabric you want, such as a curtain or sheet. It may be helpful to use fabric that has sewn hems to prevent any fraying in the future. For example, if the headboard is 36 in (91 cm) wide by 24 in (61 cm) tall, and 3 in (7.6 cm) thick, then you would want a piece of fabric about 42 in (110 cm) by 30 in (76 cm) so that it can wrap around the backside comfortably."

[15] X Research source You can use as many adhesive strips as you want for added stability. Sew the sticky strips to the fabric if they are not adhesive enough to stick to the fabric on their own."

Add 4–6 in (10–15 cm) to the length and width the get the size of batting you need, add 8 in (20 cm) to the length and width to determine the size of fabric you need, and keep the measurements the same for the foam. [17] X Research source For instance, if the headboard is 36 in (91 cm) wide by 24 in (61 cm) tall, then your upholstery foam piece will be exactly the same size, the batting you use should be at least 40 in (100 cm) wide by 28 in (71 cm) tall, and the fabric piece should be 44 in (110 cm) wide by 32 in (81 cm) tall. You can also make your own upholstered headboard from plywood. [18] X Research source"

Use fabric scissors for the fabric, and a utility knife or scissors to cut the foam and batting to size.

Cover the whole side of the foam evenly, and then press it against the headboard carefully to stick it on. [20] X Research source It’s a good idea to lay something under the foam like an old sheet or a piece of plastic to avoid getting spray adhesive where it shouldn’t be. If you are working inside, then open windows and doors to ventilate the room as much as possible."

Start at the center of the top of the headboard and pull the extra fabric as taught as you can. Work your way around the whole headboard, putting a staple every couple of inches. [22] X Research source When you get to the corners of the fabric, pretend you are wrapping a present to fold the fabric neatly before you staple it. Trim away any excess fabric with fabric scissors when you are done stapling it to the back of the headboard."
