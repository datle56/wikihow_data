      "title": "Determine what material your wall is made from.",
      "content": "Determine what material your wall is made from. Most walls are made from either drywall, plaster, or masonry. If you have concrete, brick, or tile walls, then they’re made of masonry. If you’re trying to tell the difference between plaster and drywall, stick a push pin into your wall. The pin will easily push into a drywall surface but it’ll take a lot of force to push the pin through plaster. [1] X Research source Different wall surfaces require specific hardware or anchors to ensure your mirror doesn’t fall or break. If you use hangers designed for a different material, then they could also damage your walls."

      "title": "Find and mark the spot where you want your mirror.",
      "content": "Find and mark the spot where you want your mirror. Hold your mirror up to the wall to see how much space it will take up. Try to find a place that’s about 60–65 inches (150–170 cm) above the floor so your mirror is at eye level. Once you find a good place, ask a friend to mark the edges or corners of your mirror on the wall using a pencil or some painters tape. [2] X Research source Check your marks with a level to ensure your mirror hangs straight. If they’re out of line, then adjust the level against your wall until the bubble is in the center of the tube and redraw your marks. If your mirror is too large to hold up easily and mark at the same time, measure it with some measuring tape or a yardstick, and see how those dimensions fit on your wall."

      "title": "Check drywall and plaster walls for studs using a stud finder.",
      "content": "Check drywall and plaster walls for studs using a stud finder . Turn on your stud finder and run it against the wall where you want to install your mirror. When you locate a stud and the finder beeps, use a pencil to mark the location on your wall. If possible, mount your mirror on a stud so it’s the most secure on your wall. [3] X Research source If there isn’t a stud right where you want to hang the mirror, that’s okay. You’ll still be able to hang your mirror there, and you’ll just need some extra wall anchors for added support."

      "title": "Add angle brackets to the mirror's frame if it doesn’t have hardware.",
      "content": "Add angle brackets to the mirror's frame if it doesn’t have hardware. Check the back of your mirror to see if it has any pre-installed mounting hardware. If it does, then your mirror is already made to be hung up and has a sturdy frame. If you’re putting an old mirror on the wall and it doesn’t have hardware, then the frame might not support its weight. Place L-shaped angle brackets in each corner of the frame and screw them into the back of your mirror to hold it together. [4] X Research source Check your mirror’s warranty if you still have it. Some mirrors are specifically designed to be leaned up against a wall, so if it breaks when you try to hang it, the manufacturer's warranty will not cover the damage. [5] X Research source If you’re hanging a frameless mirror , don’t worry about adding any angle brackets."

      "title": "Weigh your mirror on a bathroom scale.",
      "content": "Weigh your mirror on a bathroom scale. Ask a friend to help you lift the mirror and set the edge down on top of your scale. Let go of the mirror and let it lean against you as you read the weight on the scale. Hangers and wall fasteners have specific weight limits, so knowing how heavy your mirror is helps you choose the correct hardware."

      "title": "Mark where the tops of the mirror’s hanging hardware lines up on your wall.",
      "content": "Mark where the tops of the mirror’s hanging hardware lines up on your wall. Your mirror will already have D-rings, which are small metal D-shaped hangers, or it will have picture wire. To hang a mirror with picture wire , pull the center of the wire up until it’s taut. Then, measure the distance from the top of the wire to the frame. [6] X Research source If you have D-rings, measure how far apart your fasteners are from one another, and how far they are from the top of the mirror. Transfer the measurements to your markings on the wall so you know where to put the hanger. [7] X Research source If you want to be able to make slight adjustments to your mirror’s position after you hang it with picture wire, pull the wire up in 2 places about 12 inches (30 cm) apart. Measure how far the points are from the top and sides of the frame."

      "title": "Drill holes and attach wall hooks to your wall.",
      "content": "Drill holes and attach wall hooks to your wall. If you’re mounting your mirror directly to a stud, attach the wall hooks 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) wood screws for drywall and 3 in (7.6 cm) screws for plaster walls. If there isn’t a stud or if you have masonry walls, pre-drill holes in your wall and insert wall anchors that are specifically made for the material. Then, just screw the hook directly into the anchor. [8] X Research source Use wall hooks that have a weight limit that’s higher than the weight of your mirror. Toggle bolts are a great alternative to wall anchors if you have drywall or plaster. Make a hole large enough for the end of the bolt to fit through. Push the end of the bolt through the hole so the wings open up. Then, just tighten the bolt against the wall to secure it. If you have masonry walls, be sure to use a masonry bit on your drill since wood bits will get dull or damaged."

If your mirror is too heavy or large for you to lift easily, ask a friend or family member to help out. Once you have the mirror hung up, take a step back to check that the mirror is straight. If you need to make any adjustments, carefully reposition the mirror before checking how it looks again. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Screw your cleats onto the mirror frame if they’re not already attached. French cleats have a bottom half that attaches to the wall and a top half that attaches to your mirror. If your mirror doesn’t already have the cleats pre-installed, position the mirror-side of the cleats with the downward-facing hooks along the top edge of the mirror. Use screws that are shorter than the frame’s thickness to attach the cleats. [12] X Research source Use French cleats that have a weight limit higher than the weight of your mirror. You may only need one cleat for smaller mirrors, or 2–3 if you’re hanging a heavy mirror ."

      "content": "Attach the wall-side cleats to your wall. Measure the distance from the sides of the frame to your cleats, and transfer the measurement onto your wall. Use a level to ensure your marks line up. Once you have them level, position the wall-side of the cleats with upward-facing hooks on your wall to mark the screw holes. Pre-drill holes that are a size smaller than your screws to avoid wall damage. Then, hold your cleats against the wall and screw them in. [13] X Research source If you’re screwing into a stud, then use 2 1 ⁄ 2 in (6.4 cm) wood screws for drywall and 3 in (7.6 cm) screws for plaster. If you’re attaching the cleat through drywall or plaster without a stud, put a wall anchor or toggle bolt into the hole first. Then attach your cleat with the provided screws. If you are hanging the mirror on a brick or concrete wall, install a masonry wall anchor in the hole before putting screws in."

Line up the cleats on the back of the mirror with the ones on the wall, and slowly lower your mirror down onto them. [14] X Research source Push the mirror slightly to the left or right to slightly adjust its position. Just be sure not to slide the mirror off of the cleats. After you hang your mirror, wipe it off with glass cleaner to get rid of any fingerprints or streaks. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach a temporary horizontal wood support to your wall. Get a 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) board that’s the same length or slightly longer than your mirror. Screw the support into your wall every 8–12 inches (200–300 mm) so it doesn’t move around or shift once you set the mirror on top of it. [17] X Research source Because the adhesive needs time to cure, the temporary support holds your mirror in place so it doesn’t fall down. If the bottom of the mirror is against the top of a vanity, then you don’t need to use a support board."

    {
      "title": "Apply adhesive or mirror tape on the back of your mirror.",
      "content": "Apply adhesive or mirror tape on the back of your mirror. Use an adhesive glue or tape that’s specifically made for mirrors to ensure it doesn’t fall down. Place the adhesive in vertical strips every 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) along the length of the mirror. [18] X Research source If you’re using adhesive tape, apply about 12 inches (30 cm) for every 4 1 ⁄ 2 pounds (2.0 kg) that your mirror weighs. [19] X Research source Use adhesive or tape that matches the weight of your mirror. Since adhesives are the weakest hanging product, only use them with lightweight mirrors instead of large, heavy ones. Avoid placing adhesive horizontally since condensation could get trapped behind your mirror and cause water damage to your walls."

Line up the mirror with the marks you made on your wall and slowly press the mirror against it. Hold the mirror in place according to the instructions on the adhesive, which should take about a minute or two. After that, let go of the mirror so the bottom is resting on the support board. [20] X Research source Make sure the mirror is exactly where you want it since it will be very difficult to remove and replace after the adhesive dries."

      "content": "Remove the support in 1–2 days after the adhesive cures. Even if the adhesive looks dry within a few minutes, it needs time to fully harden and cure. While it usually takes 1–2 days, leave the support board attached to your wall for the cure time listed on the adhesive’s packaging. After that, use a screwdriver to remove the board. [21] X Research source Clean off your mirror with glass cleaner and a soft microfiber cloth after it’s fully installed. [22] X Research source After you take off the support board, repair the holes in your wall using some spackle ."
