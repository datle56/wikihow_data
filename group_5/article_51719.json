      "content": "Grab a skate tool or a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) wrench. A skate tool is a T-shaped wrench designed specifically to remove and replace skateboard wheels. If you don’t have this tool on hand, a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) wrench, crescent wrench, or vice grip will also get the job done. [1] X Research source You can buy a skate tool for less than $10 online, or pick one up at a specialty skate shop."

      "content": "Remove the axle nuts and speed washers from each wheel. The axle nuts are the thick, hexagonal, metal pieces holding the center of each wheel in place on your skateboard. The speed washer is the thin piece of metal directly below the nut. Unscrew these nuts and washers with a skate tool or wrench, and set them aside for later. [2] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview. 5 June 2020. [3] X Research source Each wheel will have 2 speed washers and 1 axle nut. One speed washer will be directly on the axle, while the other will be under the axle nut. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the bearing out of the wheel.",
      "content": "Pull the bearing out of the wheel. The bearing is a small metal cylinder that fits in the center of your wheel, and helps keep your wheel attached to the main axle. Slide the wheel off and hold it at a 45-degree angle along the end of the axle. Then, grip the wheel and pull it in an upward motion, which should separate it from the bearing . [5] X Research source There are 2 bearings in each wheel. When completely replacing your skateboard wheels, there will be 8 bearings in total. If your bearings look a bit worse for wear, clean them before installing the new wheels."

      "content": "Press the first bearing into the new wheel. Prop your skateboard sideways, so the axles are pointing directly upward. Then, slide a bearing on the axle with the “open” side facing up. Center your new wheel on top, pressing it onto the bearing with your thumbs. [6] X Research source Skateboard bearings have a “closed” and an “open” side. When you replace your wheels, reinstall the bearings with the open side facing the outside of the wheel.

      "content": "Install the spacer on top of the second bearing. Once you’ve pressed the first bearing into place, slide your second bearing onto the skateboard axle. Then, slip the spacer on top of this second bearing. Press and install the bearing into place as you normally would. [8] X Research source A spacer looks like a thin, cylindrical piece of metal. If you don’t have a spacer, you can skip this step."

      "content": "Fit the second bearing into your new wheel. Slide another bearing onto 1 of the skateboard axles, with the “open” side facing down. Then, flip your wheel over, centering it on top of the second bearing. Carefully press down on the wheel until the bearing is forced into the wheel’s center. Repeat this process with your other wheels and bearings, and set them all aside. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Reinstall the wheels with the speed washers and axle nuts. Slip a speed washer directly on the axle. Then, slide your new wheel on top. Sandwich the wheel between another speed washer, along with an axle nut. Tighten this nut in place with your wrench or skate tool to hold the new wheel in place. Repeat this process with your other 3 wheels, and you’ll be ready to skate again! [10] X Research source You don’t need to tighten the axle nut all the way. Instead, leave a little wiggle room so your skateboard wheel can still spin. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Replace your wheels when they’re misshapen and bumpy. After enough rides, your wheels will start showing signs of wear and tear. It’s probably time to make a change when your ride starts feeling bumpy and your wheels look oddly shaped. [12] X Research source If you skateboard pretty frequently, you’ll probably need to change your wheels once every 2-3 months."

      "content": "No, not necessarily. Flat spots are a common sign of wear and tear, but they aren’t the end of the world. If you notice a small flat spot, perform a few power slides on some rough asphalt to help buff out your wheels. However, if the flat spot changes the shape of your wheel, it’s probably time for a replacement. [13] X Research source To do a powerslide, rotate your skateboard sideways as you’re riding.

To rotate your wheels, just remove and switch the top right and bottom left ones. Then, remove and switch the top left and bottom wheels, as well. [17] X Research source"
