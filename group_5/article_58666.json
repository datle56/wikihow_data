      "title": "Choose a healthy, firm stalk with an established offshoot.",
      "content": "Choose a healthy, firm stalk with an established offshoot. Your cutting is more likely to thrive if it’s healthy, so make sure the parent stalk is firm and green—not yellow or shiveled. [1] X Research source Then, look for a good offshoot. Plant specialist and interiorscaper Ryan Glynn, CPA recommends finding an offshoot that’s “healthy and at least 5–6 in (13–15 cm) 5 or 6 inches long.” If your lucky bamboo has gotten too tall, you can “top” it, or cut off the top 4–6 in (10–15 cm) of the plant and root that portion to create a more balanced plant. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim off the offshoot with a knife or pruning shears.",
      "content": "Trim off the offshoot with a knife or pruning shears. Use a clean, sharp knife or pruning shears to carefully cut the offshoot from the parent stalk. Trim the offshoot as close to the stalk as possible. If the bottom is cut at an angle, trim off an additional 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) from the bottom to make a straight cut. [3] X Research source You can also chop long sections of stem into 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) pieces to try to root them separately. It can help to make an angled cut at the bottom of the stem and a straight one at the top, so you know which end is which. [4] X Research source Make sure to leave at least 2 nodes on each section—one for leaf growth and one for roots. On lucky bamboo, the nodes look like horizontal bands around the stem, so they’re easy to identify."

    {
      "title": "Remove the bottom sets of leaves from the cutting.",
      "content": "Remove the bottom sets of leaves from the cutting. Use your fingers to gently peel off the bottom sets of leaves from the cutting. Removing the bottom leaves will redirect the plant’s energy to producing roots. It’s also important to remove the leaves so they don’t rot when you’re rooting the offshoot—the rot could travel to the stem and kill your plant. [5] X Research source Glynn recommends leaving the leaves at the top of the plant—”it needs its top leaves for photosynthesis.” Should I propagate in soil or water? Rooting a lucky bamboo cutting in soil takes longer than rooting it in water , and it takes a little more work because you have to monitor the soil moisture more closely. But once the roots are established, both methods are fairly low-maintenance."

    {
      "title": "Place the cutting in a jar filled with distilled water.",
      "content": "Place the cutting in a jar filled with distilled water. Fill a glass container with about 4 in (10 cm) of distilled or bottled water. Put the cutting in the water with the bottom of the stem at the bottom of the glass. Don’t completely submerge the cutting. [6] X Research source It’s important to use distilled or bottled water because these don’t contain minerals like chlorine, salt, or fluoride, which will damage the bamboo. [7] X Research source If you have more than 1 cutting, you can put them all in the same jar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the cutting in indirect sunlight for a month.",
      "content": "Place the cutting in indirect sunlight for a month. Transfer the cutting to a bright location that’s protected from direct sunlight. As the cutting sits in the water, it will begin to grow roots of its own. Eventually, you'll be able to plant or grow the cutting as its own plant. The rooting process will take about 30 days. [8] X Research source You should also place the bamboo plant itself in bright, indirect light. Bamboo needs lots of bright light to thrive, but it will burn quickly in direct sun. Find a bright location for the bamboo, such as a partially shaded windowsill, where it will get lots of light every day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Replace the water weekly.",
      "content": "Replace the water weekly. Once a week, hold the lucky bamboo stalk in place and dump out the water from the jar. Replace the water with fresh distilled or bottled water. This will prevent the water from stagnating. As necessary, add more water to the jar to replace what’s evaporated or been absorbed by the growing plant. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone to speed up propagation.",
      "content": "Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone to speed up propagation. Sprinkle a little rooting hormone into a shallow dish, then press the bottom end of the lucky bamboo cutting into the powder. Gently tap off any excess powder, then discard whatever is left in the container. You don’t have to use rooting hormone, but it will help the lucky bamboo cutting grow roots faster. Don’t dip your cutting directly into your container of rooting hormone—this can spread bacteria or illness to other plants."

      "title": "Fill a planter with potting soil and perlite or vermiculite.",
      "content": "Fill a planter with potting soil and perlite or vermiculite. Choose a planter with drainage holes—ideally, the pot should be around 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter. Fill it with a mixture of 2 parts potting soil and 1 part perlite or vermiculite for drainage. Be sure to use a planter with drainage holes; if water doesn’t drain out properly, the lucky bamboo’s roots will rot."

    {
      "title": "Carefully press the end of the cutting down into the soil.",
      "content": "Carefully press the end of the cutting down into the soil. If you’d like, you can use your finger, a pencil, or a dowel to make a hole in the soil first. Push the cutting about 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) into the soil, then gently pat the soil around the base of the cutting so it’s secure. [10] X Research source Place it in an area with bright, indirect light. Keep the soil moist but not soaked while the plant is rooting. Use distilled water to water your cutting—lucky bamboo is sensitive to minerals and chlorine that are often present in tap water. It will take about a month for roots to develop."

      "title": "Transplant water-rooted cuttings after about a month.",
      "content": "Transplant water-rooted cuttings after about a month. After a few weeks, your cutting should have visible roots growing from the part of the stem that’s in the water. Once the roots are about 1 in (2.5 cm) long, it’s time to move the lucky bamboo into a more permanent container. [11] X Research source If you rooted the lucky bamboo in water, you can either keep it in water or transfer it to soil. If you rooted the lucky bamboo in soil, it’s best to keep it in soil—you don’t need to transplant the cutting until it outgrows its original pot."

      "title": "Transfer the bamboo to a larger vase if you’re keeping it in water.",
      "content": "Transfer the bamboo to a larger vase if you’re keeping it in water. When the lucky bamboo offshoot has had about a month to grow new roots, you can transfer it to its own vase. Fill the bottom of a jar or vase with at least 1 in (2.5 cm) of pebbles, marbles, or gravel. Place the stalk into the jar, setting the bottom firmly in the pebbles to keep it upright. Fill the vase with enough fresh, dechlorinated water to cover the roots. Every 30 days, drain the water in the vase and replace it with new water that’s been bottled, distilled, or left out to dechlorinate. If the water drops between water changes, top off the vase with fresh water. Once every two months or so, mix equal parts of liquid all-purpose plant fertilizer and water to create a diluted fertilizer solution, then add that to your plant’s water. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Plant the lucky bamboo in soil if you prefer. Lucky bamboo also thrives in soil. Find a small pot that’s at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep, and that has good drainage holes. Fill the pot with a mixture of 2 parts potting soil and 1 part perlite or vermiculite for drainage. Press the bottom of the lucky bamboo stalk 2 inches (5.1 cm) into the soil, then water thoroughly. [13] X Research source Use bottled, distilled, or otherwise dechlorinated water to water the bamboo anytime the top half of the soil has grown out. Fertilize once a month with an all-purpose houseplant fertilizer to help the bamboo grow. Some people find growing lucky bamboo in water to be a little more low-maintenance than growing it in soil, but it’s really just a matter of personal preference."

      "content": "Dip the cut tip in white, unscented soy wax for extra protection. Light an unscented soy candle and allow it to burn for about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the parent stalk from its container. When there's a small pool of liquid wax, dip the top of the trimmed stalk into the wax to seal the cutting. [15] X Research source This step is optional, but it may help protect the original stem from infection or rot. It’s a good idea to blow out the candle to avoid burning the lucky bamboo stalk. The best type of wax for this is unscented white soy wax. Dyes, fragrances, and petroleum-based waxes could damage the plant."

      "content": "Why is my lucky bamboo turning yellow? If your lucky bamboo is in water, your water may be high in minerals like salt and fluoride. Switch to rainwater or distilled water instead of using tap water. If your lucky bamboo is in soil, yellowing stems or leaves could be a sign of overwatering. Only water when the top half of the soil in the pot has dried out. [17] X Research source Yellowing can also be a sign that your plant is getting too much sunlight—try moving it into a slightly shadier area."
