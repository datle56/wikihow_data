      "content": "Head to Ustengrav, northeast of Morthal. When first reaching Ustengrav, you will come across multiple bandits and necromancers fighting each other outside of the burial site. You can run past them since they are focused on attacking each other, or you can take them down yourself. Using your bow from a distance is a great way to snipe these foes. Before charging into the battle between the bandits and necromancers, make sure to bring along health potions to quickly heal yourself while in battle."

      "content": "Venture through Ustengrav Depths. You will find various enemies while in the depths, including skeletons and Draugr. Eliminate them, and don’t forget to heal right after. You will eventually come across a set of rocks that glow when you pass by them. Each rock opens one metal gate in front of you. The only way to get past these four gates is by using the Whirlwind Sprint shout. Equip this shout in your inventory and begin walking straight towards the gates, starting just before the rock furthest away from the gates. Once the last rock is activated, you must quickly use the shout to spring past the gates before they close. You will know when you pass the four rocks since they each make a sound. Once you hear the fourth sound go off, you will know it is time to use your shout before the gates have time to close."
