Think of the phrase as another way of saying goodbye to someone if you’ve made future plans with them. Technically speaking, the phrase “I will see you then” is more grammatically correct than “See you then” because it includes the subject “I.” So, “I will see you then” is the more appropriate phrase for formal and professional settings.
