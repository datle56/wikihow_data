      "content": "Try not to wait around or drag it out for too long. When you know you aren’t interested in the person you’re seeing anymore, ask to meet up with them. They’ll appreciate you talking it out with them, and it will leave you both free to move onto other people. [1] X Research source It’s not super fair to either of you to keep seeing each other if you know it’s not going to work out. Sometimes, the only reason why you don’t want to see someone anymore is because you just aren’t feeling it, and that’s okay."

[2] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 30 December 2019. They’ll get the closure they need, and you can explain a little better about why you don’t want to see them anymore. [3] X Research source If you’ve only been on a single date with this person, then a text is probably fine. However, if you’ve seen each other a couple of times, it’s polite to talk to them face to face."

      "title": "Go to a coffee shop or out for drinks.",
      "content": "Go to a coffee shop or out for drinks. Try to pick a shorter activity that you can leave quickly, and don’t go to either of your homes. Invite the person to meet up with you within the next couple of days. Try not to go out to dinner, as that can drag your conversation on and be a little awkward. Talking in a semi-public place also ensures that you can both leave quickly if you want to."

      "title": "Tell them clearly that you just don’t think it’s working out.",
      "content": "Tell them clearly that you just don’t think it’s working out. You don’t have to be mean about it, but you shouldn’t leave any room for question, either. Tell them the real reason you don’t want to see them anymore, unless it’s something that could be hurtful. [4] X Research source For instance, you might say, “You’re a really nice person, but I just don’t see us working out long-term. I really wish you luck on your search, though!” [5] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 30 December 2019. Or, “I just can’t commit to a relationship right now, and it’s not fair to you. I’m splitting myself between my work and spending time with you, and I just can’t do that anymore.”"

      "title": "Make sure the other person doesn't feel at fault.",
      "content": "Make sure the other person doesn't feel at fault. Instead of saying something like, “You were taking up too much of my time,” try, “I’ve been feeling overwhelmed by trying to juggle working and hanging out with you.” That way, the responsibility falls on you, not them. [6] X Research source It’s also a good idea to throw in some positives, too. Tell the other person how much you enjoyed spending time with them before you jump into why you can’t be together."

If this came out of the blue, they might be confused about your reasoning or why you’re doing this now. [8] X Research source Oftentimes, people will say something like, “I don’t understand, I thought we had a good thing going.” You might reply by saying, “We did, but I just couldn’t see this lasting long-term.”"

Cut things off clearly without any room for question. [9] X Research source If the other person asks if you two can still be friends, you could say something like, “In the future, maybe. Right now, I really want to focus on myself.”"

      "title": "There’s no need to drag out the conversation.",
      "content": "There’s no need to drag out the conversation. As soon as you feel like you’ve wrapped things up, go ahead and leave. This will let the other person work through their own emotions without you there to watch them. [10] X Research source It's a good idea to have plans afterward, like meeting up with a friend. That way, you'll have someone you can talk to about what happened, but you'll also have a built-in excuse when it's time to leave. [11] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Matchmaker & Dating Expert Expert Interview. 30 December 2019. This is especially important if you two met up at a bar (or anywhere that you can get drinks). The other person might be hoping that you two can have one last hookup before you go, which probably isn’t a good idea."

      "content": "Reaching out to them can send mixed signals. Don’t text, call, or reach out on social media once you’ve broken up with them. Even if you want to check in or be friends with them, it’s much kinder to leave them alone. [12] X Research source If they reach out to you, it’s probably best not to respond. And if they have a negative reaction (as in, they act rude or angry in response), don't feel like you owe them any further communication.
