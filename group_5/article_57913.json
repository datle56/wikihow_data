      "content": "Neutral Evil characters are self-serving and follow an evil moral code. Don’t let the word “neutral” fool you—Neutral Evil characters are evil, through and through. They’re in it entirely for themselves, and don’t care about who they trample over to achieve their goals. [1] X Research source Unlike Lawful Evil characters, Neutral Evil villains don’t follow any specific set of rules or codes when making decisions. Unlike Chaotic Evil characters, Neutral Evil villains are comfortable participating in an established system/organization if it helps them achieve their goals."

      "content": "Neutral Evil is one of the 9 character alignments in D&D. In the roleplaying franchise Dungeons & Dragons , players often choose a “moral alignment” for their character, which is a moral code for how they choose to view and interact with the in-game universe. Neutral Evil is one of 9 total alignments used to classify fictional characters, both in a D&D and non-D&D capacity. [2] X Research source For character alignments, it helps to envision a 3 by 3 chart: the top row has “good” alignments ( Lawful Good , Neutral Good, and Chaotic Good), the middle row has “neutral” alignments (Lawful Neutral, True Neutral , and Chaotic Neutral ), and the bottom row has “evil” alignments (Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, and Chaotic Evil)."

      "content": "Neutral Evil characters tend to fit into multiple categories. There are countless ways to be selfish and evil, and not all villains fit squarely in the Neutral Evil box. Some characters may fall into Lawful Evil or Chaotic Evil territory, while others (like anti-heroes) may even venture into Chaotic Good or Chaotic Neutral. For example, Emperor Palpatine from the Star Wars franchise could be classified as Lawful Evil for the role he plays in recreating the Sith order, though his motivations are arguably more Neutral Evil."

      "content": "Neutral Evil vs. Lawful Evil Lawful Evil characters are often part of an evil organization and follow the values and codes within said organization. Their goals and motivations are typically linked to their evil affiliations, while Neutral Evil characters are more independent. [3] X Research source In Game of Thrones , Cersei Lannister exemplifies Lawful Evil as she commits unspeakable acts in defense of her family, House Lannister. Littlefinger, however, is a known manipulator with his own motivations (which eventually get him killed at the hands of House Stark)."

      "content": "Neutral Evil vs. Chaotic Evil Neutral Evil characters are content to take whichever path leads them to success, even if it means working as part of a group or with an established organization. Chaotic Evil villains, on the other hand, prefer to operate more on the fringe. Think of it this way: Neutral Evil characters might be willing to follow the rules if doing so benefitted them in the long run, while Chaotic Evil characters don’t really care about established rules. [4] X Research source In the DC universe, Lex Luthor is a well-known antagonist with his own goals and motivations. However, he often works within the set system of his world to accomplish his goals, like becoming President. The Joker, however, operates on a platform of anarchy and chaos (remember the money burning scene in The Dark Knight ?), making him the poster boy for Chaotic Evil."

      "content": "Neutral Evil vs. Neutral Good Neutral Evil and Neutral Good are similar in that they don’t operate within the codes of an organization, and that they don’t play completely outside the lines. That’s where their similarities end, though: Neutral Good characters are dedicated to making the world a better place, while Neutral Evil characters are entirely self-serving. [5] X Research source The titular protagonist of the Harry Potter franchise is a great example of a Neutral Good character as he battles against the growing threat of Lord Voldemort. Meanwhile, Peter Pettigrew, an antagonist from the same franchise, made the decision to betray Harry’s parents, and had Sirius Black take the fall for his crimes. [6] X Research source"

True Neutral characters rarely take a stance, while Neutral Evil characters are focused on themselves. [7] X Research source Specifically in The Avengers (not other Marvel movies or TV shows), Loki takes a Neutral Evil stance as he selfishly tries to take over the planet. In the Marvel series What If…? , the Watcher acts as a neutral observer recounting events within the multiverse (until the end of season 1). [8] X Research source"

Through time with the party, maybe your character realizes that their original motivations weren’t all they chalked up to be, and pivot to a slightly more moral outlook on life. [12] X Research source Your character might become Chaotic Neutral, an alignment that’s still selfish but also focused on living in the moment and being spontaneous. Your character might flip to Neutral Good and focus on helping others."
