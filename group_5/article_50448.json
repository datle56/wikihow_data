Serious and/or repeated account violations are unlikely to be overturned. Activision generally will only overturn a ban if it is due to unauthorized activity. However, it is possible that you can appeal minor offenses, such as accidental glitch exploitation or slightly toxic behaviour that has no previous offenses."

The final result will be one of the following: Appeal accepted: If your appeal is accepted, your ban will be overturned and you will be allowed to play again. However, you need to be extra careful to follow the rules and not repeat any violations. Repeated violations will be less likely to be overturned. Appeal Rejected: If your appeal is rejected, then your ban still stands. You cannot regain access to your account and it is unlikely there is anything you can do to regain access. You can try to create a new account, but you will need to be careful to follow the rules and not repeat any violations. Repeated violations may result in your IP address getting banned, or getting banned from purchasing future Activision games. Further investigation needed: If Activision replies and informs you that they need to investigate further, they may ask you to provide further evidence. You will need to continue to be polite and provide whatever they request."
