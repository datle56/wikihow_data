Most foods have serving sizes listed on their packages along with the nutrition information for a serving. Measure and eat only one serving of a junk food item to avoid getting a stomach ache.

Having these foods on hand and eating them instead of junk food will help you prevent stomach aches you may get from eating too much junk food.
