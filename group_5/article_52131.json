      "content": "Sprinkle some baking soda over the cooktop. There’s no need to measure the exact amount of baking soda you use. Just open the lid to your baking soda container and apply enough to lightly coat the area of the stovetop you wish to clean. If your stovetop is really grimy, apply a heavier layer of baking soda. [2] X Research source Baking soda is an excellent cleaner because it is mildly abrasive, dissolves dirt and grease, and removes odors. [3] X Research source Old parmesan cheese containers are ideal for sprinkling baking soda. Similar containers with holes punched through the lids are equally useful. If you have such a container, fill it with baking soda. Then, sprinkle the baking soda from this container over the stovetop. Optional tip : To make the baking soda even more effective, spray white vinegar on top of the baking soda. Just spray a light coat, or enough to get the baking soda bubbling."

Just go over the burned areas and stains nice and slow “so you're not gonna risk getting in there…and scratching [the stovetop] or hurting yourself.” If you’re worried about scratching your stovetop, don’t be—Matuska says “As long as the blade…[is] wet, and the surface that you're trying to clean is wet, you don’t have to worry about it scratching.” Use a light touch to help prevent scratches from forming—there’s no need to forcefully push the razor into the stovetop. Make sure the razor is new and clean before using it on your stovetop, as a dull blade can cause scratches. Plastic scrapers and spatulas work as a great alternative to a metal scraper."
