      "content": "Craft an eye-catching bio by showing off your sense of humor. If you want to make a good first impression (and break the ice), use a silly bio to make people laugh . Throwing in a funny or self-deprecating line lets them know that you’re comfortable in your own skin and you don’t take yourself too seriously. [1] X Research source “Last time I was someone’s type I was donating blood.” “CEO of making things awkward.” “I’m so glad she swiped right. –Your Mom” “I’m the most positive pessimist you’ll ever meet.” “Most likely to steal your heart? No. Most likely to steal your pizza? Yes.” “I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him if he’s going to eat the rest of that pizza.”"

      "content": "Draw people in with a brief and snappy bio. Can’t think of anything super creative? No worries! While Bumble gives you a 300 character limit for your bio, keeping it short and simple can help you draw in more matches. Just use a few engaging words to showcase your personality and leave people wanting more! “Marketing manager by day, wine connoisseur by night.” “Sagittarius. Adrenaline junkie. Always hungry.” “My love language: Making playlists.” “We’ll get along if you know all the words to ‘Rap God.’” “I love sleeping late on my days off, spontaneous road trips, and cheap cocktails.” “Me: 😊🎶🎸☕📖🐶✈️ Our first date: 🌮, 🍻, 🕺🏻, or 🎥?” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a smooth one-liner to strike up a flirty conversation. If you’re ready to chat with potential matches, go for a fun and flirty bio to encourage people to message you. A smooth one-liner can let people know why you’re on the app and help you come across as confident. “Let’s play Minecraft together.” “First round is on me if you can beat me in COD.” “Send me a playlist so I know it’s real.” “Professional shower singer. Seeking a duet partner.” “Why do drugs when you can do me?😉” “Not picky about how tall you are because everyone’s the same height in bed.” “I like to be on top of things. Do you want to be next?”"

      "content": "Catch someone’s attention with a bold opinion or open-ended question. If you really want to stand out from the crowd, add an engaging statement or question to your bio. It’s the best icebreaker for a fun and flirty conversation, and shows that you’re confident and ready to chat with your matches. [3] X Research source “Radiohead > Oasis” “Tell me your first email address.” “Hit me with your best pick up line😜” “Unpopular opinion: A pizza is an open-faced sandwich.” “I love piña coladas, dancing in the rain, and sleeping with socks on.” “You just won a free trip for two anywhere in the world. Where are we going?” “Looking for someone to binge the Harry Potter movies with me. You in?”"

Inform your potential matches that you’re independent, confident, and totally one-of-a-kind with a bold one-liner. “Your newest obsession.” “My favorite position is CEO.” “I’m better than the hype.” “The one and only.” “I’m everything you dreamed of and more.” “50% sassy. 50% sweetheart.

      "content": "Show off your personality with the help of Bumble’s premade prompts. To show people that you’re genuinely interested in making connections, put in effort when answering the prompts, and don’t be afraid to go into detail. Bringing up a specific interest or skill can help you find people who share similar interests (and connect with them on a deeper level). [4] X Research source “I promise I won’t judge you if… you think Shrek is better than Shrek 2.” “Pros: Can cook amazing pasta. Cons: Can only cook amazing pasta.” “A non-negotiable: You HAVE to be willing to break it down on the dancefloor.” “My real-life superpower is… being able to pick a Netflix show in less than 5 minutes.” “Most likely to plan a spontaneous getaway at the last minute. Least likely to fall asleep at a reasonable hour.” “Two truths and a lie: I’m banned from Disneyland. I have a viral TikTok video. I have 5 cats.”"

      "title": "Keep your bio short, sweet, and positive.",
      "content": "Keep your bio short, sweet, and positive. When it comes to dating apps, most users aren’t going to read through a lengthy profile. Create a brief and engaging bio by revealing just enough information to start a conversation . Remember, if someone wants to learn more about you, they’ll swipe right and shoot you a message! [5] X Research source When writing your bio, imagine you’re another user reading through your profile for the first time. Give them a taste of who you are to be mysterious and draw them in. If you’re not sure whether your profile paints an authentic image of yourself, ask a trusted friend to look over it and provide feedback."

      "title": "Highlight your interests and personality.",
      "content": "Highlight your interests and personality. Think of your Bumble profile as an opportunity to show off your most attractive traits. Get creative when answering the premade prompts, and make sure you stay away from clichés. Mentioning your passions, hidden talents, or unpopular opinions can help you stand out. Don’t be afraid to throw in a little humor, too! By incorporating humor into your prompt answers and bio, you put your potential dates at ease and increase their interest in you instantly."

      "title": "Upload clear, high quality photos to your wall.",
      "content": "Upload clear, high quality photos to your wall. When people swipe through your profile, they’re basing their right swipe on the pictures and bio you’ve provided. To get more matches , make sure all your photos are high-quality and your face is clearly visible in them. Include a variety of photos that reveal your personality, and remember to present yourself in an authentic way. Make sure your main profile pic is an individual shot of yourself so other users know exactly who you are. Taking your profile photo in Portrait mode is an excellent option because it blurs your background and highlights your best features."

      "title": "Be honest about your intentions.",
      "content": "Be honest about your intentions. Whether you’re looking for a hookup, long-term relationship, or FWB situation, let people know why you’re on Bumble. You don’t have to state your intentions directly in your bio, but as you chat to people, mention whether you’re searching for something fun or serious. It’ll save you time and energy, and narrow down your matches to reveal your most compatible results. [6] X Research source Before entering a relationship, examine your needs and commitment level. What are you looking for in the short-term? In the long-term? What are your non-negotiables? Think about the type of partner you want and be clear about your expectations so you don’t lead anyone on."
