      "content": "Start placing the cards in eight piles. All of them should be face up (four of the piles will have seven cards and the rest will have six). These columns are called your \"tableau\". There is no reverse deck like in Klondike Solitaire. All of your cards are on the playing area at all times."

      "content": "Start your foundation piles when you get the chance. Move any Aces when they become available. Your goal will be to build up these foundation piles, one for each suit, from Ace to King, in order. Make sure that you will not need a given card before placing it on the foundation. Once you place a card on a foundation pile, you cannot put it back in your tableau or in your free cells."

      "content": "Move cards from one column of the tableau to another, if the opportunity arises. You can do this in order to strategically free up cards that are currently stuck behind others. Unless you have open free cells (see below), move just one card at a time. The cards in the columns must be placed in descending order. They must also alternate between black and red (suits do not matter in the columns). For example, you can place a black 9 on a red 10 or a red Jack on a black Queen."

However, if you want to move a sequence of cards (in descending order), you can move them depending on how many free cells you have: If you have four empty free cells, you can move five cards. If you have three empty free cells, you can move four cards. If you have two empty free cells, you can move three cards. If you have one empty free cell, you can move two cards."
