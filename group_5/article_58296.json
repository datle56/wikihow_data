      "content": "The easiest way to plan your treasure hunt is to work backward. Pick a place that has special meaning for you as a couple, such as your favorite restaurant, the place where you had your first date, or the location of your first kiss. This will be the final location of your scavenger hunt, where your partner will arrive once they’ve deciphered all your clues! If you choose a business such as a restaurant or café as your final location, make sure to talk to the manager to get permission to set up any decorations you might be using. They'll usually be more than happy to help, and they might even throw in a little treat, such as a free cup of coffee at the café where you had your first date!"

      "content": "Choose 4-8 stops for a hunt that lasts 1-2 hours. “Create a map or set of directions that lead your partner to the first clue, which can be hidden in a creative location, such as inside a favorite book or tucked away in a secret compartment,” suggests Bilotta. “From there, each clue should lead to the next, building excitement and anticipation as your partner gets closer to the final treasure!” Try choosing stops that are significant to your relationship. For example, you might include the place where you first met or had your first date. If your hunt includes several locations scattered throughout your city, use a trip-planning app, such as Google Maps, to help you find a logical route. You don't have to create a long route if you don't want to. For a more low-key option, you can have a short treasure hunt inside your own home—no map necessary!"

      "content": "A small gift at each stop makes your partner feel special. Bilotta explains that it’s a good idea to “incorporate elements of surprise and romance throughout the treasure hunt.” Your traditional romantic gifts, such as candy and flowers, work great for this. You can also use the gifts themselves as clues leading up to the final treasure. For example, if your final treasure is a ski trip, you might include gloves at one stop, a hat at the next, then a scarf, and so on. Try things that have special meaning to your partner as well. For example, if your partner collects acrylic pins, you might get a special pin to include with each clue."

      "content": "Use cardstock or construction paper in bright colors that stand out. If you have a theme in mind, try cutting your clues into a shape that fits your theme. You can even draw a picture or design on each one—this is your chance to let your creative juices flow! [1] X Research source For example, if you're doing the treasure hunt for Valentine's Day, you could cut red and pink paper into heart shapes to write your clues on. If arts and crafts aren’t really your thing, you can also type the clues and print them out, then glue them onto the cardstock or construction paper. If you go this route, you can also find graphics online to print out!"

Here are some examples you can adapt and personalize: \"Get ready for an adventure that can't be beat! To find the next clue, you'll have to turn up the heat.\" (The second clue is hidden next to the thermostat.) \"Follow the clues for a special surprise.

To find the next clue, search under the hood.\" (The next clue is under the hood of the car.) \"From the very first date, you revved me up. Before you get the next clue, you'll have to track down our pup.\" (The next clue is attached to your dog's collar.) \"There's no denying you've captured my heart.

Bilotta suggests “incorporating special memories or experiences into the clues.” You could even write the clues so that they form an entire poem about your relationship when read together. This makes an especially great anniversary gift! Here are some ideas to get you going: \"This was a night I'll never forget! Go to the place where our lips first met.\" (The next clue is hidden at the location where you had your first kiss.) “Follow the clues until you’re a winner! The next one is at our favorite spot to have dinner.” (The next clue is at your favorite date night restaurant). “Head to the treasure—the time is now!

If they need to say anything specific to your partner, make sure to give them a written script! This works especially well if your ultimate treasure is a marriage proposal—you can include people who supported you as a couple, and they can all follow along until the end to be a part of this special moment."

If your clue is outside, put it in a plastic bag to keep it from getting wet.

As you do your practice run, put yourself in your partner’s mindset and pretend you don't know where you're going next. You can also ask a friend to run through it with you. That way, you'll have an outside perspective to help you know if your clues are too confusing or difficult. Bring extra paper and other materials with you in case you need to change a clue on the fly!"

According to Bilotta, your final treasure should “include a special gift or experience that your partner has been wanting, such as a romantic dinner, a weekend getaway, or a meaningful keepsake.” For example, if the big prize is a vacation, you could decorate the final location to make it look like the destination you’re traveling to and print out the plane tickets to give to your partner. Or, if your scavenger hunt is a proposal, the final treasure might be you on one knee holding the engagement ring. If you’re worried about timing, have your partner text you periodically along the route to let you know where they are, especially if you have a little work to do to set up the final reveal."

This hunt should be exciting and enjoyable for the both of you!"
