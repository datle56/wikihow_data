      "title": "Cut a piece of fabric into two equal pieces.",
      "content": "Cut a piece of fabric into two equal pieces. How big you cut the pieces depends on the pillow size you want. A standard throw pillow is 18 in (46 cm) by 18 in (46 cm). A standard bed pillow is 20 by 26 in (51 by 66 cm). Use a large ruler to trace the measurements onto the back of the fabric. Add 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) to each side of the fabric for seam allowance and cut with a pair of fabric scissors . [1] X Research source If you’re using a pillow form as your filling, cut the fabric the same size and shape as the pillow form. Use an existing pillow as a template if you’d like. Grab a flexible tape measure and place it seam to seam (horizontally and vertically) to measure. [2] X Research source Use any fabric you’d like, but consider the pillow's purpose. Use soft cotton with a high thread count if you’re using it to rest on. For decorative pillows, try brocade fabric. Cost: Cotton fabric costs $1 to $8 per yard, while decorative fabrics may have a higher price point, like $12 to $20 per yard."

      "title": "Stack the two fabric pieces with their right sides together.",
      "content": "Stack the two fabric pieces with their right sides together. Pin each of the four corners 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from the edge. Place pins at the center of three sides. Leave one edge unpinned so you can turn the pillow inside out later. [3] X Research source If you’d like, add two pins on the bottom edge of the unpinned side so you know where to start and end your stitches."

    {
      "title": "Straight stitch the edges on a sewing machine.",
      "content": "Straight stitch the edges on a sewing machine. Feed the fabric through the machine until you get to the starting corner. Begin at your 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) seam allowance and backstitch for a secure bond. Then, move forward in a straight stitch. When you’re 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from the edge, leave the needle down. Raise the foot on the machine and turn the fabric to sew the other edge. Repeat on all three sides. [4] X Research source Use a matching thread color for a nice, clean, polished look."

    {
      "title": "Turn the pillow right-side out.",
      "content": "Turn the pillow right-side out. If you used thick fabric for the pillow, you might want to cut the corners off first; this will help reduce bulk. Trim as close to the thread as possible. Then, turn your pillow right-side out. Use your fingers, a seam turner, or pencil to help push the corners out so they’re nice and sharp.

      "title": "Fold the raw edges in and iron the seams on all sides.",
      "content": "Fold the raw edges in and iron the seams on all sides. Start at the open edge of the pillow, and fold the raw edge in by 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). Use a hot iron to press the edges flat, making it easier to sew later. Iron the rest of the fabric to smooth out any wrinkles. [6] X Research source If you don't have an iron, pin each folded edge separately. Don't pin them together or you won't be able to stuff the pillow."

      "title": "Stuff the pillow with polyester stuffing.",
      "content": "Stuff the pillow with polyester stuffing. Polyester stuffing is a popular and accessible option for pillow filling. It can be purchased at fabric and craft stores. However, you can also use filling from an old pillow, a pillow form, and scraps of old clothes or fabric as a substitute. Feed the stuffing through the small opening you left. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pin and sew the opening shut.",
      "content": "Pin and sew the opening shut. Squish the filling down. Pinch your fingers to keep the filling in place. Pin close to your finger to keep the filling to the side. Then, pin the open edges together. Feed the edge through the sewing machine. Use a straight stitch and remove the pins as you work along. Once it’s shut, remove the pins holding the filling back. [8] X Research source Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. To sew the opening by hand, use a whipstitch . Poke your needle up through the top layer of the fabric, then circle up through both layers twice. Then, make another angular stitch and repeat the pattern as needed."

      "title": "Cut a square piece of fabric the same size as your pillow.",
      "content": "Cut a square piece of fabric the same size as your pillow. Measure your pillow insert first with a flexible tape measure. Then, cut a piece of fabric according to that measurement. The pillowcase will be slightly smaller than the form itself, so you have a nice, full pillow. [9] X Research source A standard throw pillow is 18 in (46 cm) by 18 in (46 cm). Use any fabric you’d like, depending on what you use the pillow for."

      "content": "Make two smaller pieces of fabric for the back of the pillow. Cut two additional pieces of fabric, each the same width as the pillow but only half the height. Then, add 5 in (13 cm) to create an overlap while accounting for the hem and seam allowances. [10] X Research source For example: A 18 in (46 cm) pillow’s back pieces would be 18 in (46 cm) for the width, and 14.5 in (37 cm) in height. Alternatively, you can make the pieces the same width and two-thirds of the height. The back piece can be the same color and pattern as your front piece, or they can be different."

Press it flat once more with a hot iron, then use a straight stitch to sew it down as close as possible to the inside folded edge. [11] X Research source Repeat this step for the other back piece."

Then, lay the top piece (the large square fabric) on top with the right sides together. Then, flip all three layers over so you’re looking at the back pieces. Pin the edges to keep everything in place. [12] X Research source The raw edges of the back pieces should match the raw edges of the front pieces. Ensure the hemmed edges of the back pieces overlap along the middle of the front piece."

[18] X Research source To thread a needle , cut a piece approximately 18 in (46 cm) to 24 in (61 cm) long to start with.

[20] X Research source For example, if you want a 10 in (25 cm) by 10 in (25 cm) pillow, add 6 in (15 cm) for a total of 16 in (41 cm). Opt for non-fraying fabric, such as fleece or flannel.
