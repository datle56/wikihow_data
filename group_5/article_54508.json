      "content": "Clean the area and let it dry for at least 1 hour. Scrub the damaged area with a household cleaner and a scrubbing pad or the scrubbing side of a sponge. Rinse the sink and use a paper towel or clean cloth to dry. Leave the sink to air dry completely for at least 1 hour before you sand or apply the epoxy. [1] X Research source Make sure the area is completely dry before applying epoxy. If you apply chip repair epoxy to a wet surface, it may not cure correctly."

      "title": "Sand the edges of the chip or crack with fine-grit sandpaper.",
      "content": "Sand the edges of the chip or crack with fine-grit sandpaper. Lightly rub a piece of 400-grit or 600-grit sandpaper back and forth over the damaged area until you don’t feel any sharp edges. The roughed-up area helps the epoxy patching kit bond to the sink. [2] X Research source Try not to sand the undamaged areas of the sink’s surface with the sandpaper. You can use masking or painter’s tape to section off the chip or crack while you sand and apply the epoxy. If you have a hairline crack that doesn’t have sharp edges, skip this step."

      "title": "Purchase an epoxy repair kit, mix the 2 parts, and let it set.",
      "content": "Purchase an epoxy repair kit , mix the 2 parts, and let it set. Buy a generic white repair kit if your ceramic sink is a standard white color. If your sink is an off-white color, get a kit that allows you to mix pigments to create a custom color. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to mix the repair compound. [3] X Research source Many porcelain and ceramic repair kits come with 2 vials that you mix together to create the epoxy, as well as a brush you can use to mix and apply the product. Open up the repair kit and use the plastic part of the packaging as a mixing tray. Use the provided brush or a toothpick to empty the contents of both vials into the tray. Use the brush to mix the liquids thoroughly in the tray for at least 1 minute. [4] X Research source Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for the specific repair product you purchased for directions about exactly how long to wait before applying the epoxy. Most say to wait at least 30 minutes."

      "content": "Apply a thin coat of epoxy with a brush and let it set for 45 minutes. Carefully brush the epoxy into the crack or chip, being careful not to get it onto the surrounding surface of the sink. Wait 45 minutes for the first coat of epoxy to set. [5] X Research source If you apply too much epoxy and get it on the area around the crack, wipe away the excess with a damp paper towel. [6] X Research source Use the tip of the repair kit’s brush or a toothpick to push the epoxy deep into the chip or crack. Make sure nobody uses the sink while the epoxy cures. Try not to worry about making the chip level with the sink with the first layer of epoxy. You can keep applying layers until you get it just right."

      "title": "Apply new layers of epoxy, waiting 45 minutes between coats.",
      "content": "Apply new layers of epoxy, waiting 45 minutes between coats. Gently brush another layer of epoxy onto the crack or chip and wait 45 minutes before applying another coat. Repeat until the filled chip or crack raises slightly above the sink’s surface. [7] X Research source Most minor cracks and chips only need 2 layers of epoxy to fill them in. However, if you are repairing a deeper gouge, apply more coats as necessary. Use a clean cloth to brush away shavings from the sanding process as needed."

      "title": "Let the epoxy dry for 24 hours, then sand down the repaired area.",
      "content": "Let the epoxy dry for 24 hours, then sand down the repaired area. Drying times vary by product, but most recommend not to use the sink for 12 to 24 hours after you apply the last coat of epoxy. [8] X Research source Lightly sand the area with 400- to 600-grit sandpaper so the filled-in area is completely smooth and level with the rest of the sink’s surface. [9] X Research source After the epoxy completely cures, moisten your sandpaper or get the area wet before you finish sanding it to make it look shiny and blend it in with the rest of the surface. Try not to clean the sink for at least 5 days after you’ve finished repairing the sink. If your sink is made of porcelain, apply porcelain touch-up paint over the filled-in chip, scratch, or crack according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These paints are waterproof, form a tight seal over the filler, and come in a variety of colors to match your sink’s finish."

      "content": "Replace your sink if water is leaking from the cracks or holes. If your sink has tiny leaks, draining problems, or holes, water may damage the wooden cabinet (if you have one) or cause mold or mildew. You can replace your ceramic sink yourself or hire a professional to do the job for you. [10] X Research source Installing a new sink is a DIY job many people are comfortable doing, but if you have to rerun pipes or you encounter issues, you can always call a plumber to do it instead. The average cost to replace a sink yourself can be between $50 to $550 for a bathroom or $150 to $750 for a kitchen. [11] X Research source If you decide to hire a professional, it might cost between $380 to $1,400 to replace your sink."

[12] X Research source Use a wrench to loosen and remove the supply hoses from the supply valves, then use a basin wrench to remove them from the faucet on the underside of the sink. [13] X Research source If your water supply lines won’t shut off the water, you can also turn off the main water line to your house. Use a towel, bowl, or bucket to catch any water left in the supply hoses."

[14] X Research source Wiggle the P-trap off the drain pipe into a bucket. [15] X Research source The P-trap is the sideways “P” or U-shaped pipe that connects up to the drain in your sink. Make sure to remove any clips underneath that hold the edge of the sink to the countertop. [16] X Research source"

[18] X Research source If you have a laminate countertop, make sure to fully separate the sink from the counter before lifting it out to avoid damage."

Run the old faucet through the holes in the new sink and reinstall the faucet in the reverse order. Use a wrench to attach the supply hoses back to the faucet. If you’re installing a new faucet , follow the instructions provided to attach it to your new sink. [19] X Research source Most faucets will be held in place by some kind of nut or a set of screws. If your sink uses screws, screw in each one most of the way before tightening them down completely. It can be easier to install the faucet on your sink while it’s separate from the counter since you have more room to work. [20] X Research source"

Apply a .25 inches (0.64 cm) thick bead of silicone caulk all around the bottom edge of the sink. Flip the sink back over, line the drain pipe up with the pipe below, and place the sink into the hole. [21] X Research source After you set it down, lightly press it down to squeeze out the excess silicone and seal the edges to the countertop. [22] X Research source If the silicone didn’t squeeze out to the rim, apply a small bead of caulk inside the edge to fill in that gap. [23] X Research source Spray soapy water onto the sink and use your fingertip to pick up any excess caulk. Use a dry paper towel to clean the caulk up around the edge of the sink. [24] X Research source For a drop-in sink on a laminate countertop, you may have to use a screwdriver to install sink clips to hold the sink in place. [25] X Research source"
