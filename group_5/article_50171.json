Only attempt this method if you are skilled at appearing to shed real tears. On the other hand, you might be able to use the element of surprise to your advantage. If you can start crying suddenly, you might shock people and make them believe that you are genuinely sad."

      "title": "Have an objective.",
      "content": "Have an objective. Well-trained actors don’t “play sad,” since this can come across as melodramatic and staged. Actors that want to convey sadness convincingly try to play an objective. For instance, if an actor is trying to look sad because his grandmother died, he will focus on showing how much he cared about and misses her, rather than just shedding lots of tears. If you are trying to act sad, you can borrow this method. For instance: If you want to act sad so that someone will realize that they hurt you, think about how the person upset you, in addition to using physical signs to convey sadness. If you want to act sad so that people will leave you alone, focus your thoughts on why it is that you genuinely want solitude."
