      "content": "Recognize side-mounted extension springs. There are two kinds of springs your garage door might use: side-mounted extension springs or torsion springs. Before you can adjust the spring on your garage door, you must determine what kind of springs your door has. Side-mounted springs are easier to adjust, while torsion springs are more dangerous to meddle with, so you would be better off calling a professional if you have these. Side-mounted extension springs run above and parallel to the door track, and they'll have an attached pulley and cable. [2] X Research source The cable, which holds the spring, attaches to hooks in the track hanger assembly. There will be two springs: one above each track on either side of the garage door."

      "title": "Recognize torsion springs.",
      "content": "Recognize torsion springs. Torsion springs are mounted above the door and will run along a metal shaft that's parallel with the top of the door. This type of mechanism is usually used for doors that are over 10 feet wide. [3] X Research source Lighter and smaller doors may only have a single torsion spring, while larger and heavier doors may have two springs, with one located on either side of the central plate."

      "content": "Understand the problem. Improper spring tension can cause many problems with how your garage door opens and closes. The problem you're having will help you figure out how you need to adjust the spring to fix the door. Doors that need spring adjustments may: [4] X Research source Be difficult to open or close Open or close too quickly Not close fully or properly Close unevenly and leave a gap."

    {
      "title": "Determine your solution.",
      "content": "Determine your solution. Depending on your problem, you will either need to increase or decrease the spring tension on the door. You will need to: [5] X Research source Decrease the tension if your door isn't closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly. Increase the tension if the door is difficult to open or closes too quickly. Adjust the tension on one side (where the gap is) if your door is closing evenly."

      "content": "Assemble your tools. There are some basic tools and safety equipment you'll need for this job. Your safety equipment includes gloves, safety glasses, and a hard hat. Your other tools are a sturdy ladder, a C-clamp, an adjustable wrench, and a marker or masking tape. If you are going to be adjusting torsion springs, you will also need two winding bars or solid steel rods. The rods or bars should be 18 to 24 inches (45.7 to 61 cm) in length. Solid steel bars can be purchased at hardware stores. You will need to measure the diameter of the holes in the winding cone (the collar that secures the spring to the metal shaft) to determine what size bar or rod to use. Most cones have a hole diameter of 1/2 inch. Do not attempt to use any sort of tool as a substitute for the winding bars or steel rods. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Open your garage door fully. Before you can work, you need to release the tension on the springs. Open the door until it hits the stop bolt and can't go any farther. For an automatic door: Open the door, unplug the opener, and disconnect the door from the opener [7] X Research source by pulling the emergency release cord down and back until the spring locks in the open position. You will then be able to open the door fully and release the tension on the springs."

Once there's no more tension on the spring, remove it from the track hanger. Use the adjustable wrench to remove the nut on the back side of the bracket. You'll now be able to move the hook to a lower or higher hole to decrease or increase the tension."

Once you've moved the hook to its new location, replace the nut on the back and use the wrench to tighten the hook into place. To decrease tension and fix a door that isn't closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly, hook the spring onto a lower hole on the track hanger. This reduces the length of the spring and the tension on it. [10] X Research source To increase tension and fix a door that is difficult to open or closes too quickly, hook the spring onto a higher hole on the track hanger. This stretches the spring and increases the tension on it. [11] X Research source To adjust tension on one side and correct a door that wasn't closing evenly, adjust the spring only on the side where the gap was. Decrease the tension on that side by hooking the spring onto a lower hole on the track hanger. [12] X Research source"

Make another single-hole adjustment if your door is still closing too quickly, slowly, or unevenly (with gaps). Repeat steps one to five until your door is closing properly and evenly, or until your gap is gone."

Shorten the cable to slightly increase the tension, or lengthen it to slightly decrease the tension. [13] X Research source Your cable may be attached to the track by an S-hook, and if that's the case, move the hook to a higher hole to increase tension slightly or to a lower hole to decrease tension slightly.

The cone will have four holes evenly spaced around it, plus two set screws that are used to lock the spring in place on the center shaft.

To increase tension for a door that's difficult to open or closes too quickly, wind the cone up [19] X Research source (in the same direction as the garage door cable goes through the pulley). To decrease tension for a door that isn't closing fully, is difficult to close, or opens too quickly, wind the cone down [20] X Research source (in the opposite direction from how the garage door cable passes through the pulley).

With the bar still in the bottom hole, pull slightly up (toward the ceiling) on the bar and toward the center plate. As you do this: Continue holding the bar up and over and tap on it with the second bar. Tap it just below the winding cone. Tap it away from the center plate and toward the mark on the shaft.
