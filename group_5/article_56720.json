You can also try making your own Lord of the Rings -themed cocktails, especially if you’re already planning to dress the part. Here are a few ideas to get you started: Mirovir Cocktail The Balrog of Morgoth Margarita Mirkwood’s Enchanted Forest Cocktail Gandolf’s Smoke Ring Cocktail Stick ‘Em in a Stew Bloody Mary"

      "content": "Watch all three Lord of the Rings movies in one night. A Lord of the Rings movie marathon takes about 9 hours, which might make this kind of event perfect for a Saturday night with all your friends. Make sure to drink plenty of water and eat snacks throughout the day to keep hydrated and avoid consuming too much alcohol at once. If you want to up the stakes, you can watch the Hobbit trilogy after you finish all three Fellowship movies. For this, you might have to break the event up over two weekends so you don’t spend 20 hours watching all the movies all at once."
