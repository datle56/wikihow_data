      "title": "Find a base.",
      "content": "Find a base. The base for your lamp should be sturdy enough to stand on its own, even after you add lamp apparatus and a shade on top. If you have a hollow base that you need to stabilize, consider partially filling it with something like marbles or sand. Some ideas for lamp bases that you could use: Wine bottles Log or timber Wooden pails or buckets Toys or figurines Hollowed-out books"

      "title": "Buy a lamp kit.",
      "content": "Buy a lamp kit. These can be found at most hardware stores. Note that it's possible to purchase the pieces separately, but buying them together will ensure a better fit. If you do buy the cord separately, choose a #18 size cord. [1] X Research source If you don't want to buy a lamp kit, and instead want to purchase the items separately, you'll need: Detachable harp Cord set Push-through socket and socket shell Finial Assorted hardware, like nuts, bolts and washers"

      "title": "Prepare the base for the rod.",
      "content": "Prepare the base for the rod. The rod is a hollow tube that will run the cord up through the bottom of your base to the lightbulb at the top. Depending on your base, you may have to drill or cut holes wide enough for the rod at the top and bottom of the lamp. [2] X Research source If necessary, you can trim the rod with a hacksaw or pipe cutters, but it's best (and easier) to choose a base that's fitted to your rod. Sawing your rod down to size is not ideal."

    {
      "title": "Stabilize the bottom of the base.",
      "content": "Stabilize the bottom of the base. Your lamp kit might come with a piece meant to stabilize the bottom of your base. If it doesn't, simply purchase rubber stoppers. Affix these at intervals around the base to prevent sliding and lift the base slightly off the table, allowing room for the cord."

    {
      "title": "Thread the cord through the rod.",
      "content": "Thread the cord through the rod. The cord should consist of two covered wires stuck together. Thread it through the rod from bottom to top, leaving 3 or 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) of cord about the base. Before threading, tape the wire ends together so that they fit smoothly inside the rod. When doing this, make sure that the bottom of the plug doesn't rub against the rod's sharp edge."

To tie an underwriter's knot: Bring the left wire down so that it's facing to the right, in front of the doubled wiring. Bring the right wire down so that it's facing to the left, in back of the doubled wiring. Put the right wire into the loop on the left side. Pull the ends of both wires tight, fastening the knot."

Wrap the neutral wire clockwise around the silver (or white) screw, and the hot wire clockwise around the gold (or dark) screw. If you're unsure, check the manual that came with your lamp kit. Using a screwdriver, tighten the screws down over the wires. [4] X Research source"
