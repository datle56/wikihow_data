Your body should be slightly relaxed but ready and focusing on the target. You should choose one of two targets. If you want to punch to the body, chuudan , aim for just below the ribs, called the solar plexus. If you want to punch to the face, jodan , aim for the face. For safety, or if you feel you lack control, your instructor may ask you to aim just below the face rather than at the face. Note punching at other parts of the body is not as effective. If you are not practicing with a partner, imagine an opponent of your size in front of you."
