Nicknamed the Cusp of Mystery and Imagination, this sign combines the opposing energies of grounded and disciplined Capricorn with idealistic and unpredictable Aquarius. These contrasting traits give the Capricorn Aquarius cusp a unique outlook, creative edge, and alluring air like no other sign. With Capricorn’s raw ambition and Aquarius’ innovative spirit, this cusp is a visionary achiever who makes their big dreams a reality. [1] X Research source This cusp’s mysterious energy comes from their planetary rulers. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of discipline and responsibility, while Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of progress, originality, and rebellion. Each sign’s element also makes this cusp intriguing. Capricorn is an earth sign who is practical, stable, and logical while Aquarius is an air sign who is analytical, clever, and social. Some people born at the end of Capricorn season or the beginning of Aquarius season feel like they don’t fit their sign. This is because they were born during the signs’ transition and share traits with both Caps and Aquas!
