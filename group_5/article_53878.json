Now, if you want to record a video for a longer period of time, you can hold down the record button to create a Long Snap, which can be up to 60-seconds long. [1] X Research source When you create a Long Snap, you can trim off the parts you don't want to keep, as well as split it into segments that you can edit separately or remove entirely. You’ll use Snapchat’s integrated editing tools for this. It’s not the most complex stuff of all time, but it’ll get the job done!"

If you want to upload a video you've already created (that's less than 60-seconds long, but more than 10-seconds long), you can trim (but not split it up into separate segments) in Snapchat. To do so: Instead of recording, tap the two overlapping images to the left of the large circle. Tap the Camera Roll tab at the top. Tap the three dots at the top-right corner. Tap Edit Video . After the video loads, you will see a preview, as well as some creative tools for editing."

Otherwise, as you record, a line will move around the circle. Once it makes a full rotation (ten seconds), the next segment of the recording will automatically begin. Release your finger when your video is complete, and you will see a preview, as well as some tools for editing."

Remember, the fewer edits you make the more organic and genuine your video will feel, so don’t trim arbitrarily. It’s okay to publish more than one video!"

To trim or crop a video, drag the handle on the left to the place you'd like the video to begin, and the handle on the right to where it should end.

You can't use this feature on a video you upload from the Camera Roll, but you can use it if you used the Snapchat camera to record. The Split feature is used to break the video into sections that you can edit separately, as well as cut out parts of the video you don't want to keep. To split the video in two at a certain point, wait until the tiny scissors appear at the correct moment, and then drag them upward. Now you'll see two separate video previews. You can tap either of the two videos to edit or trim it separately. If there's a part of the video you want to remove, you'll want to split the video right where that part begins and ends. Once you have that part isolated in its own segment, tap the segment, and then tap the X at the top-right corner."

Even when you make each segment different, they'll still all appear as though they were one video with different editing tricks applied. For example, if you want to add text to just one segment, tap that segment, tap the T to open the text tool, and then add your text. The text will only show up in the video when that segment plays. To add a filter, swipe left or right on the large preview to cycle through the options. Stop swiping when you find the one you like."

If you don't see a Lens you like, tap Explore at the bottom-right to see a gigantic gallery of Lenses that are categorized by type.

If prompted, tap Enable to enable Location Filters (if you're okay with sharing your location) to experiment with filters specific to your area. For example, if you're at a baseball game and are using Location Filters, there may be a special filter for that stadium, or even that specific game. You can also tap a location to bring up other close-by locations, in case that one doesn't match. To layer multiple filters, swipe to one you like, and then tap the stack of papers with a plus symbol on the right side of the screen. Now you can swipe through the filters again and select another."
