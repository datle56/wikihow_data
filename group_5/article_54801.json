      "content": "Mix orange juice with turmeric powder. The vitamin C in oranges is essential for healthy skin. It is also a great bleaching agent due to citric acid. Mix two tablespoons of orange juice and half a teaspoon of turmeric powder together. Apply the balm to the darkened areas, or all over your face, if you like. Leave it on overnight and rinse it off with water the next morning. Use this every day for the best results. Make sure that you completely cover the areas you want to lighten. Keep in mind that turmeric has a staining effect, so your skin might appear orange or tan after using this mixture, which is probably the opposite of the effect you're going for. Don't worry, once that effect fades, your skin will be subtly fairer because of the fruit acids and turmeric."

      "content": "Try mixing dried orange peel with yogurt. This makes a mask that you can use to lighten the skin of your face over-all. You'll first need to dry out an orange peel. Then, grind the peel into a fine powder and mix it with plain yogurt. Smooth the results over your face and leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes. Wash it off with water afterward. Repeat this two or three times per week. The lactic acid in yogurt and the citric acid in the orange peel are natural bleaches."

      "content": "Resurrect a trend from 18th and 19th century France. Very pale skin was in vogue in France during the 1700s and 1800s, so aristocratic women would lighten their skin using cosmetics. We can learn from their mistakes; they typically applied paint made from lead! Instead, try these safe alternatives: Rather than matching your makeup to your face, select a shade of foundation one shade lighter than your actual skin color. Remember to also use concealer and setting powder one shade lighter than your skin. Blend the makeup into the skin at your jawbone and neck so that it fades gradually rather than leaving an obvious line that divides the pale skin on your face from the darker skin on your neck (or better yet, wear a turtleneck or scarf). You can try out a version of this tactic without spending a ton of money on new cosmetics by simply purchasing a finishing powder in a lighter shade. Apply it over your normal foundation and concealer, and if you like the effect, consider buying lighter foundation and concealer as well."

      "title": "Take advantage of the contouring trend.",
      "content": "Take advantage of the contouring trend. Most major cosmetics brands are jumping on the trend, which is also known as highlighting or strobing depending on the technique. You can adapt this trend to create the illusion of fairer skin temporarily. Contouring using makeup involves carefully placing lines of darker color on areas that are meant to recede, like under your cheekbones and along the sides of your nose, while placing lighter streaks of color along areas that are meant to stick out a bit and catch the light, like the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, or forehead. Then, the colors are carefully blended so that you can't tell that you've put color in either place, but it gives a very nice visual effect of well-defined facial features. Learn about contouring techniques from this helpful wikiHow article , but when you go shopping for products, purchase products in shades slightly lighter than you would normally buy. Apply the products using the contouring technique, but at each step, go one to two shades lighter than you would normally go. For instance, when you begin, apply foundation to your entire face in one or two shades lighter than your skin tone. Then, when you contour the darker areas, use a color that matches the natural color of your face (rather than a darker shade). The highlighted, lighter areas should be a shade or two even lighter than the color you began with to really stand out. It's important to stay in the same color family as the rest of your skin. If you are cool-toned, choose products that are meant for cool-toned skin; and if you are warm-toned, choose products that are meant for warm-toned skin. Otherwise your contouring will seem like you've painted your face."

      "content": "Use highlighting cream. [1] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. For a more subtle effect, simply mix a highlighting cream into your regular foundation. It will only subtly lighten the actual color of your skin, but because of its very fine sparkle and luminosity, it will make your complexion appear fairer in the light. Try Josie Maran Argan Enlightenment Illuminizer, NARS Illuminator, or a similar product from your favorite drugstore brand. The key is to choose a liquid highlighter that can be easily blended into liquid foundation, and in a shade that is slightly lighter than your skin tone but in the same color family. The end result should be skin that seems to glow, like a freshly moisturized face; if it seems glittery or shiny then you've added too much illuminator to your foundation."

      "content": "Consider a chemical peel. [9] X Expert Source Jason Phillip Handyman Expert Interview. 2 July 2020. A chemical peel is a procedure in which chemicals are applied to the skin, usually the face, which cause the skin to exfoliate and peel away. Depending on how deeply into the skin they penetrate, chemical peels come in three varieties: superficial, medium, and deep. Superficial peels use alpha-hydroxy acid and only penetrate the outer layer of the skin. Choose this method if the skin discoloration you are trying to address is minor. Recovery time is a day or so. Medium peels use glycolic or trichloracetic acid and penetrate the outer and middle layers of the skin. They are suitable for moderate skin discoloration. Because medium peels penetrate deeper into the skin, it can take 14 days to heal after a treatment. Deep peels are the most invasive and as such, are suitable for the most extreme cases of skin discoloration. Deep peels use trichloracetic acid or phenol, which deeply penetrate into middle layer of the skin. Because of this, they can only be performed once in a person's lifetime. Healing time is the most extensive: 14 to 21 days. Regardless of the type of peel, there are risks. They include scarring and the reactivation of cold sores"

      "content": "Try laser skin resurfacing with the q-switch nd:YAG laser. Laser skin resurfacing works by targeting and destroying the unwanted skin cells with high energy light. The body then generates new skin cells and increases its production of collagen, one of the building blocks for great skin. It does this without damaging the top layer of the skin, which means that there is no downtime. The recommended treatment schedule is six cycles over a two week period. You'll see noticeable results after every treatment, which continue to improve over time. q-Switch refers to this laser's ability to operate at two wavelengths: 1064 nm, or infrared, and 532 nm. [10] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source The Nd:YAG refers to the laser's crystal structure, which is neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet. Minor side-effects such as some skin redness can occur, but this usually resolves within 30 minutes of the procedure."
