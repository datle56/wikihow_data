      "title": "Divide your hair into 2 even sections, following your hairline.",
      "content": "Divide your hair into 2 even sections, following your hairline. Start your part at the very center of your forehead. To do this, place your finger at the middle of your hairline (directly diagonal between both of your eyes). If you have a widow's peak or reverse widow's peak, use it as a guideline or try lining up your part with the tip of your nose. Then, separate your hair so 1 section is on the left side and 1 section is on the right. [1] X Research source Middle parts are a great choice if you have a round shaped face. [2] X Research source Look in the mirror as you part your hair to make sure that you get a straight, even part."

      "content": "Separate your hair with your fingers if you want a simple part. After you find the center of your hairline, divide your hair down the middle until you reach the crown of your head. Move away the hair using both hands to create your part. [3] X Research source The crown of your head begins where the top of your head starts to curve downward. Using your fingers creates a soft, basic part, which is great for casual and professional looks."

      "title": "Use the tip of a rattail comb to separate your hair to make a precise line.",
      "content": "Use the tip of a rattail comb to separate your hair to make a precise line. Instead of using your fingers, you can use the end of a comb to make your part. Simply place the tip of your comb at the middle of your hairline, and draw a straight line down the middle of your head. Remove the comb when you reach the crown of your head. [4] X Research source Once you've made your part, you can comb through both sides so your hair lays flat. Using the teeth of the comb will result in more tangles instead of a clean part. This creates a clean, defined part in the middle of your head."

      "title": "Style your hair so both sides are even if 1 side looks more voluminous.",
      "content": "Style your hair so both sides are even if 1 side looks more voluminous. If you have a natural cowlick in the middle of your hairline, 1 side of your part may look more voluminous than the other side. If you want to even out both sides, shake your fingers through your hair to fluff your hair up on the flatter side. This lifts your hair up so both sides look even. [5] X Research source You can also spray a little hairspray on the flatter side to keep the hold. A cowlick is a lock of hair growing in a different direction than the rest of the hair around it."

      "content": "Make your part .5–2 in (1.3–5.1 cm) from the middle for a basic side part. If you want a simple side part, look in the mirror, run your finger along your hairline, and find the middle of your hairline. Then, pick a spot about .5–2 in (1.3–5.1 cm) from the middle. [6] X Research source Simple side parts look great with day-to-day hairstyles, like updos and styling your hair down."

      "content": "Part your hair 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) from the middle for a dramatic style. Side parts further from the center of your hairline are referred to as “deep side parts.” Look at the middle of your hairline to eyeball the center, and place your finger about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) away from the middle. This is where you can start your part. This looks great if you have a square shaped face or a strong jawline. This part softens the angles of your face. [7] X Research source When you style your hair, you can let some hair in the front fall slightly across your face for a mysterious touch."

      "content": "Use your fingers to make your part if you want a natural, casual look. If you want a simple part great for day-to-day styles, separate your hair on 1 side using your hands. When you find the spot for your part, simply run 1 finger straight back on your head to separate the hair. Stop when you reach the crown of your head, and then smooth over the hair on both sides of the part so they lay flat. [8] X Research source You can look in the mirror if you need help making a straight line."

      "title": "Divide your hair with the end of a comb to make a straight side part.",
      "content": "Divide your hair with the end of a comb to make a straight side part. For defined side part, it is best to use your comb to part your hair instead of your hands. To do this, hold the bristle side of the brush in your hand, and line the tip of your comb up with your hairline on the side. Move your comb back in 1 straight motion until you reach the crown of your head. [9] X Research source This looks great with curly hair, for example. You can create a defined side part for evening looks for a elegant look."

      "title": "Let your hair naturally fall to 1 side to pick a side for your part.",
      "content": "Let your hair naturally fall to 1 side to pick a side for your part. Your hair will naturally fall to 1 side, especially if you have any cowlicks. After you shower, simply tousle your hair in your hands and let it fall however it would like. You will find it effortlessly tends to lay on 1 side. Following your natural part creates beautiful, effortless hairstyles."

      "content": "Flip your hair the opposite way of its natural part for a sexy style. Rather than letting your part fall naturally, you can flip it to the other side to add extra volume to your hair. Since your hair is used to laying the other direction, it will create a simple swoop in the front. This adds a flirty touch to your hairstyles. [10] X Research source In addition, this is a good idea if you want to hide any thin sections of hair."

Position your part on a different side of your head, or try out a different style. [11] X Research source If you usually part your hair in the middle, try parting it slightly towards the side. If you prefer side parts, go with a deep side part next time you go out."

      "content": "Create a messy part for carefree, casual styles. Instead of creating a well-defined part, you can separate your hair and then let it fall into place as it wants to. You can still separate your hair in the middle or on the side, but don't worry if 1 section lays on the wrong side. In addition, you can wiggle your finger back and forth through your part to create an uneven line. [12] X Research source You can do this whether you use a comb or your fingers to part your hair. This looks great with relaxed, casual, and tomboy looks."

      "title": "Try a diagonal part if you want a polished, slimming, sexy style.",
      "content": "Try a diagonal part if you want a polished, slimming, sexy style. To do this look, pick a spot on the side of your head 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) away from the middle, like if you are creating a deep side part. Instead of going straight back vertically, cut your part across your head at a diagonal. Stop your part when you reach the crown of your head on the opposite side. For best results, use the end of a rattail comb, so you can draw a straight, precise line. [13] X Research source Slick your hair back into a ponytail or lower bun, and you can elevate your updos. In addition, you can also create sexy hairstyles wearing your hair down. Curl your hair around a curling iron or spray a styling product to add some volume, and you can create sexy, glamourous looks with diagonal parts. This look also is very slimming on the face. Your eye goes horizontally across your head rather than vertically, which decreases the appearance of any wideness."

      "content": "Make a zigzag part if you want a unique, unconventional hairstyle. This part is flattering for every face shape and adds a casual and fun touch to both updos and down hairstyles. You can use either your finger or a comb to make the zigzag part. Simply position your tool at your hairline, and part your hair about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) back. Then, move your tool 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) in the opposite direction. Continue doing this until you reach the crown of your head. [14] X Research source A zigzag part looks great with 2 french braids or pigtails. You can make a zigzag part either in the middle or on the side of your head."
