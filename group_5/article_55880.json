      "content": "Locate any identifying marks on your jewelry. These markings will be etched into the metal. If the jewelry has a clasp then the marks are probably on the back of the clasp. The jewelry might also have a small metal tag etched with marks hanging from the end. Lastly, search the largest parts of the jewelry. If your jewelry doesn't have any markings at all it's probably not a precious metal."

      "content": "Look for marks indicating silver jewelry. Some coins and jewelry will have a stamp with the numbers “999.\" This indicates that the jewelry is made of pure silver. [1] X Research source If you see a stamp with the numbers “925” followed or preceded by the letter “S,\" you have sterling silver. Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver that's mixed with another metal alloy, usually copper. [2] X Research source Pure silver jewelry is rare as pure silver is soft and easily damaged.

      "content": "Find any marks indicating platinum jewelry. Platinum is a very rare and expensive metal. Therefore, all platinum jewelry will be marked to show authenticity. Look for the words “Platinum,\" “PLAT,\" or “PT” followed or preceded by the numbers “950” or “999.\" These numbers refer to the purity of the platinum, with “999” as the most pure. [4] X Trustworthy Source Federal Trade Commission Website with up-to-date information for consumers from the Federal Trade Commisson Go to source For example, an authentic piece of platinum jewelry might have a stamp reading “PLAT999.\""

      "title": "Run a magnet over the jewelry.",
      "content": "Run a magnet over the jewelry. Most pure precious metals aren't magnetic, so if you place a magnet near the jewelry, you shouldn't see any movement. However, if your platinum jewelry is reacting to a magnet, don't panic. Pure platinum is a soft metal, so alloys are added to strengthen the finish. Cobalt, which is quite hard, is becoming popular as a platinum alloy. Because cobalt is slightly magnetic, some platinum jewelry may react to a magnet. [5] X Research source Platinum/cobalt alloys will usually be stamped as PLAT, Pt950, or possibly Pt950/Co. [6] X Research source The most common alloy used to harden sterling silver is copper, which is not magnetic. If you have a piece of sterling silver jewelry with a .925 stamp that's attracted to a magnet, see a reputable jeweler to verify its authenticity."

      "content": "Use an acid testing kit on hard-to-verify jewelry. If you can't find any identifying stamps and you're unsure about the origin of the jewelry, use a testing kit to find out what the jewelry is made of. Purchase an acid testing kit from an online retailer or jewelry supply store. This kit will include a sanding stone and several bottled acids. Buy a kit that can test for both silver and platinum . The bottle labels will indicate which metal they are used to test for. If the kit doesn't include gloves, buy some separately. If you get any acid on your hands you will burn your skin."

      "content": "Rub the jewelry against the stone. Lay out the black slate stone on an even surface. Gently rub the jewelry against the stone in a back-and-forth motion to create a line. [7] X Research source Draw 2 or 3 lines on the stone or one for each testing acid you'll use. For example, if you're testing for platinum, silver, and gold, you'll draw 3 lines. Choose an inconspicuous part of the jewelry to rub against the stone. The stone will scratch and damage a small section of the jewelry. Lay a towel down underneath the stone to protect your work surface from scratches."

      "content": "Drop the acids on the different metal lines. Select an acid test from your kit and carefully drop a small amount of acid onto one of the drawn lines. Make sure that you don't mix the different acids together or you'll affect your results. Most tests have acids specifically for silver. However, you can also use an 18-karat gold testing acid to identify pure or sterling silver. Always wear gloves while handling acid."

      "title": "Observe the reaction of the acid.",
      "content": "Observe the reaction of the acid. These reactions can take anywhere from a second to a minute. If the line completely dissolves, the test fails. [8] X Research source For example, if you drop the Platinum acid test on a line and the line dissolves, the jewelry isn't platinum. However, if your line doesn't dissolve, the metal is pure. If you use the 18-karat gold acid test to test on silver, the line will turn a milky white color. [9] X Research source This will indicate that your jewelry is pure or sterling silver. If you doubt your results, test the jewelry again to be sure. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a silver testing solution on large, hardy pieces of jewelry. Avoid using this acid on delicately decorated jewelry. The acid will corrode any part of the surface that it touches. If you purchased an acid scratch testing kit, use the silver testing solution included. Otherwise, purchase the silver testing solution online or from a jewelry supply store."

      "title": "Test the jewelry.",
      "content": "Test the jewelry. Drop a small amount of the silver testing solution onto the metal. Choose a hidden area of the jewelry to test. For example, if you're testing a large cuff bracelet, drop some acid on the inside of the bracelet. Alternatively, if you're testing a flat, chunky necklace, drop acid on the back of one of the necklace sections. Wear gloves to protect your hands and work over a towel to protect your workspace. Don't drop acid on clasps or other important sections. The acid may damage any smaller workings in the jewelry."

      "title": "Observe the reaction.",
      "content": "Observe the reaction. The acid will appear dark brown or clear at first and then turn into a different color. The new color will indicate the purity of the metal. For example, if the liquid turns dark or bright red, the metal is at least 99% pure silver. If the solution turns white, the metal is 92.5% silver, or sterling silver. [11] X Research source If it turns a bluish green color, it's copper or another lesser metal."

If you don't see any bubbles immediately, allow the metal to sit in the liquid for about a minute and look for small bubbles forming around the jewelry.
