Each of these has its own associated email: [1] X Research source For first-person, introspective stories about your own experience, email the Personals section at pitch@huffpost.com (for the US website) or ukpersonal@huffpost.com (UK).

      "content": "Write your pitch as a two to three paragraph summary. This isn't a detailed outline of your piece, just a good enough sketch to hook a HuffPost editor's interest and convince them you have a plan. Here are some ideas for approaching this: [5] X Research source To pitch a story about an important event or period in your life, describe the progression of the piece through time. What part of the story will you open on? How will events progress over the course of the piece? If your story involves multiple people, make sure you mention them all in a clear, concise way along with their role in the story. Will you be talking about your family members or lovers in a personal story? If you want to speak for a wider community or describe events that affected many people, do you have key sources that will complement your own perspective? Ultimately, what message can you bring to HuffPost readers? Why is this message particularly timely given recent news events, cultural trends, or the state of the modern world? Why is it important that readers listen to your insights? Include a suggested headline for all submissions. If you're having trouble, browse HuffPost for example formats, or try a brainstorm exercise to jumpstart your imagination."

      "title": "Introduce yourself.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself. Why are you the best person to write this piece? Pitching your story as a personal, even raw account of your experience or events that you witnessed is a great way to get noticed by HuffPost. Aim for a two to three sentence summary of yourself as an authentic person: mentioning that you have X years of writing experience doesn't hurt, but what will really grab an editor's attention is a story that only you can tell. HuffPost is especially interested in writers from underrepresented backgrounds. If you are LGBTQ+ or BIPOC, for example, think about how that perspective affected the experience you want to write about. You don't have to make the piece solely about one aspect of your identity, but if it is relevant, fold it into your pitch."

      "content": "Tailor your pitch to fit the site's content and style. Most of the pitches HuffPost accepts are original stories that turn news or cultural topics into something personal. There are a few ways to make your pitch fit the HuffPost style: [6] X Research source Tie the larger story to your own identity and life. Many HuffPost stories are about how world events affect lived experiences, especially those of marginalized people. Write honest or even painful stories. Opening up about parenting, sex, mental health, and other private and complicated experiences will help you connect to HuffPost's readers. If you can, write a pitch for a current article series. For example, if you can make your idea fit the format of \"Voices in Food\" or \"Conscious Consumer\", it will be easier for HuffPost to publish your article. [7] X Research source"

[9] X Research source Now it is harder to get published on the site, but the writers who do get accepted for the main site are always paid for their work. [10] X Research source The exact amount seems to vary widely, so be prepared to negotiate: guest writers report being paid an average of 20 cents per word, but sometimes as much as 50.
