      "title": "God is both merciful and vengeful.",
      "content": "God is both merciful and vengeful. Yes, you read that right—God is both loving and wrathful. But how can that be? How can a graceful God also be an angry God? To put it simply, let’s think of God as a strict parent. He loves you no matter what, but that doesn’t mean He doesn’t get disappointed or upset by your actions. Everyone sins. Everyone is susceptible to Satan, and this is why God has to be vengeful. He knows that not every intention is pure: “God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth...the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies” (Nahum 1:2). [1] X Research source While the Lord may not bring His wrath onto you, He will show His anger to those who deceive Him. After all, He’s the almighty judge: “But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed” (Romans 2:5). [2] X Research source At the end of the day, God is a loving God. As a loving but righteous father, God wants you to fear Him so you don’t fall under Satan’s spell: “Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you. Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield” (Psalm 5:11-12). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "As a Christian, it’s important to recognize God’s wrath and love. It’s okay to fear God—it’s actually encouraged! [4] X Research source If you fear God’s wrath, you fear eternal punishment, which inevitably pushes you to follow the Lord’s commands. God instills fear through His almighty power to show that He loves you. [5] X Research source So, what can you do to honor the Lord and escape His wrath? Follow His word. Being a devout Christian doesn’t mean you’re absent of sin; it means you do everything you can to ignore temptation and live a faithful life. As the Bible says, “Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’ says the Lord” (Romans 12:19).

      "title": "Mercy is showing compassion despite one’s power.",
      "content": "Mercy is showing compassion despite one’s power. In the Bible, being merciful is the act of helping someone in distress regardless of the ability to punish or harm them. God has the power to be harmful, yet He shows kindness to those who need it most. [7] X Research source Think of mercy as a kind gift given to someone suffering. Mercy can look like not complaining when something has gone wrong or correcting someone gently."

      "title": "Vengeance is the compensation of wrongs.",
      "content": "Vengeance is the compensation of wrongs. In the Bible, vengeance isn’t always a malicious or retaliating act but a term to describe restoring wholeness and integrity. God unleashes His wrath on those who have wronged Him who do not seek redemption. While His vengeful acts may seem vindictive, they are justice-seeking. [8] X Research source As it says in the Bible, “The Lord is a God who avenges. O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve” (Psalm 94:1-2), and, “because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood…Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not” (Joel 3:19-21). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "God is gracious, but He’s also capable of vindictive things. As a father, He cares deeply for His people, but He also can’t ignore deceit. The Lord’s love is what makes Him vengeful, and His vengeful nature comes from the need to protect. As the Bible states, “The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished” (Exodus 34:6-7). [10] X Research source"
