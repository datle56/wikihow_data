      "title": "Cut off the top of the bottle.",
      "content": "Cut off the top of the bottle. To make a bottle ecosystem, you will need an empty 2 quart (2 liter) plastic bottle. It is best to use a clear plastic so that you can see inside the bottle and make observations. Cut off the top of the bottle, about 2 inches below the neck. [1] X Research source To ensure your cut is straight, you can put a piece of masking tape around the bottle and then cut along the edge of the tape. Ask an adult to help you cut the bottle. Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut all the way around the top of the bottle. Set aside the neck of the bottle with the cap for later use."

    {
      "title": "Add soil to the bottle.",
      "content": "Add soil to the bottle. Use a small garden shovel and add 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) of potting soil to the bottom of the bottle. Lightly tap the soil with your hand to help it settle. Make sure you do not press too hard because you do not want to pack the soil tightly. If desired, you can add ½ an inch of pebbles to the bottom of the bottle for drainage. This should be done before adding the soil, but is optional."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create small holes to plant your seeds.",
      "content": "Create small holes to plant your seeds. The depth of the holes will vary depending on the type of seed you are planting. It is recommended that you start by planting green beans. They are hardy seeds that should grow easily. Read the directions on your seed packet to know how deep to make the holes. Use your finger or a pencil to make the holes in the soil. If you are planting beans, the holes should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. Make the holes near the edge of the bottle. This way you will be able to easily see the roots growing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the seeds in the holes.",
      "content": "Place the seeds in the holes. Once you have dug the holes, place one seed in each hole. You should be able to fit approximately 5-6 plants. Cover the seeds with dirt. [2] X Research source Aside from beans, you could also try planting a variety of herbs, such as mint, basil, and oregano. [3] X Research source You could even grow root vegetables, such as carrots or potatoes. Just make sure you provide enough soil for these plants to take root."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle grass seeds on top.",
      "content": "Sprinkle grass seeds on top. Then, place two pinches of grass seeds on top of the soil. Lightly cover them with dirt. If you would like, you can also try adding insects and worms to the ecosystem."
    },
    {
      "title": "Water the seeds.",
      "content": "Water the seeds. Prior to sealing your ecosystem, you need to water the seeds. Sprinkle water into the bottle. You want the soil to be damp, but not soaked. Let the water seep into the soil and then sprinkle a bit more. You want the water to fully permeate the soil. If you tilt the bottle and water runs up the side, you have too much water."

    {
      "title": "Seal with tape around the edges.",
      "content": "Seal with tape around the edges. In order to hold the top of the bottle in place, and to seal the ecosystem, you should tape around the edge of the bottle. This will attach the top of the bottle to the base. [5] X Research source You will no longer need to add water to your bottle ecosystem."

      "title": "Place the ecosystem in a sunny spot.",
      "content": "Place the ecosystem in a sunny spot. Now that the ecosystem is sealed, you should place it in a sunny spot. For example, a windowsill is a great place to keep your bottle ecosystem. The location should receive indirect sunlight for most of the day. You can also add a label to the base of the ecosystem with the date and identifying number. This way you can record notes and compare it with other bottle ecosystems that you make."

Use a utility knife and cut a 2 quart (2 liter) clear plastic bottle, just about an inch (2.5 cm) above the base. The plastic near the bottom is usually quite thick and as a result, you may not be able to cut it with scissors. [6] X Research source You can discard the small base of the bottle because it will not be needed. Place the top of the bottle with the cap to the side, for later use."

Take a second 2 quart bottle and cut all the way around the bottle just below the neck. You can use scissors or a utility knife to cut the bottle. [7] X Research source Keep both pieces from this bottle. The base of this bottle will form the base of your ecosystem and the top will be used to as a cap to seal the ecosystem shut."

Place the lid on a cutting board and then use a pair of pliers or a small handheld vice to hold the cap in place. Carefully drill a small hole through the center of the bottle cap. [8] X Research source You should ask an adult to help with drilling the hole into the cap. Make sure to wear safety glasses when using the drill."

You can either use water from a local pond or stream, or from the tap. Pond or stream water is preferable because you will also get small microorganisms that may be present in the water. [16] X Research source If you have to use tap water, make sure that you let it sit in an open container for at least 24 hours before using in your ecosystem. The chlorine present in tap water may kill any animal or plant species that you add to your ecosystem. Letting the water sit for 24 hours gives the chlorine time to dissipate from the water."
