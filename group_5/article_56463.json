      "content": "Feelings of grandiosity The biggest sign of a god complex is an inflated sense of self. Can you work cooperatively with others, or do you expect everyone to follow your lead no matter the situation? Confidence is a positive thing, but a sense of grandiosity can lead to feeling more special and important than everyone else—and the expectation to be treated accordingly.

Go to source Other people might compare your sense of self to a fantasy world. If you find yourself telling stories and exaggerating your life to make it sound ideal, you might have a god complex. When someone contradicts your perception of yourself and the rest of the world, do you get angry and lash out? God complexes also result in emotional fragility and a quick temper."

A god complex can make you feel like other people are \"challenging\" you when they're just coexisting.

      "content": "Intense need for praise God complexes make it challenging to validate yourself without external praise. Do you need others to praise your work, actions, appearance, and other aspects of your life? Even with feelings of grandiosity and entitlement, a god complex will instill an extreme need for validation and praise to feel like you've accomplished something or enjoy your success. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Do you ever compliment other people just because you can? God complexes also tend to result in one-sided relationships since praise is given but rarely returned. Additionally, do you get upset if someone doesn't praise you when you thought they would? Feeling underappreciated is never fun, but with a god complex, a lack of praise can feel like a betrayal."

However, your reason for isolating can be a giveaway. If you tend to be solitary and avoid close friendships because you want to prove that you can succeed without anyone's help, that can indicate a god complex.

Remember: you can respectfully disagree, but you can't impose your wishes onto someone against their will. [16] X Research source For example, if a friend asks to take things slow and maintains some distance while you deal with the god complex, gracefully accept it. It will build up trust between you and lead to a happier friendship in the future. If you don't know what someone's boundaries are, ask! It's much better to check with the other person rather than assume you know what they want."

Make an effort to acknowledge your mistakes and apologize when you hurt somebody else’s feelings. Mistakes don’t make you a failure, and little miscommunications happen all the time. As long as you’re genuinely willing to learn from each incident, that’s all that matters.

You don’t have to be perfect—and you won’t lose anyone’s respect by letting your imperfections show. It’s also important to take responsibility for dealing with the god complex. The decision to change, learn healthier habits, and improve your quality of life has to be your decision. Nobody can (or should) force you into it."
