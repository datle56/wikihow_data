      "title": "Draw a horizontal oval with a square beneath it to outline his head.",
      "content": "Draw a horizontal oval with a square beneath it to outline his head. First, draw a horizontal oval toward the top of your paper. Then, draw 2 vertical lines coming down from the underside of the oval and connect them at the bottom with a horizontal line to form a square shape. [1] X Research source This will serve as the outline for Squidward's head, although it looks more like a mushroom at this point. Tip: Draw lightly in pencil so you can erase mistakes and outline marks later. Tip: Use these pictures as a reference, or print them out to trace over to help you get started."

      "title": "Outline his neck and abdomen with rectangles and a semicircle.",
      "content": "Outline his neck and abdomen with rectangles and a semicircle. First, add a thin, vertical rectangle under Squidward's face to outline his neck. Then, draw a larger rectangle to outline where his shirt will go. At the bottom of the larger rectangle, add a semicircle to complete his torso."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create Squidward’s arms with squares, rectangles, and triangles.",
      "content": "Create Squidward’s arms with squares, rectangles, and triangles. Choose one arm to sketch first, then copy your outline on the other side. First, outline Squidward’s shoulder by drawing a small square at the top corner of the large rectangle that tilts down slightly. Then, add a thin rectangle that continues outward to make his upper arm. Add a second thin rectangle that angles back in toward his body to form his lower arm. Draw his hand by sketching a scalene triangle with the long side pressed against Squidward’s body. Then, sketch small, equilateral triangles coming off the outside bottom corner of the larger triangles to form his tentacle tips. Tip: In this drawing, Squidward’s arms are bent and his hands are resting squarely on his hips. Keep that position in mind while you outline his arms."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw a large rectangle below the semicircle to outline his legs and feet.",
      "content": "Draw a large rectangle below the semicircle to outline his legs and feet. Start with a plain, vertical rectangle—the longer you make it, the longer his tentacles will be. Divide it into 3 sections with vertical lines (since the fourth leg is hidden behind him). To outline the feet, use scalene triangles with the longest side down on the ground, pointing inward toward his legs. Tip: Draw bigger triangles for his front feet to make them appear larger, and smaller triangles for his back feet to make them seem smaller. This helps add perspective to your drawing."

    {
      "title": "Use ovals to outline Squidward’s eyes and nose.",
      "content": "Use ovals to outline Squidward’s eyes and nose. Draw an oval for each eye toward the bottom of your very first large oval at the top of the drawing. Then, add a large oval or egg shape for the nose between them. Sketch two small ovals inside the eyes for pupils."

    {
      "title": "Outline Squidward’s mouth, eyelids, and eyebrows with curvy lines.",
      "content": "Outline Squidward’s mouth, eyelids, and eyebrows with curvy lines. First, draw two elongated semicircles at the sides of the square to create his mouth shape. Then, draw a line across to form his mouth and lips. For his classic, unamused look, draw a horizontal line midway through his eyes to make the bottom of his eyelids. Then, draw a flat eyebrow line over his left eye and two arched eyebrow lines above his right eye. Try adding some spots on top of Squidward’s head to add more detail that resembles the cartoon. Tip: Alter the eyes and eyebrows to make any expression you want. Feel free to be creative!"

      "title": "Ink the drawing with a pen to complete your outline.",
      "content": "Ink the drawing with a pen to complete your outline. First, go over your outline again in pencil to soften some of the hard corners and angles with slightly curvier lines (for example, add gentle curves and soft points to his feet so they look like tentacles instead of pointy triangles). When you’re satisfied, draw over your final outline with a thin drawing pen (preferably black or navy blue). Lastly, gently erase all of your pencil outline marks. When you’re done, you’ll have an ink drawing of Squidward!"

Finish up with his light yellow eyes and bluish suction cups, and there you go! Squidward Tentacles! Tip: If you’re illustrating on a computer and want your colors to exactly match the cartoon, use these hex codes: [2] X Research source #bbdfd1 (light gray-green) for Squidward’s body #90bfad (dark gray-green) for his eyelids #adaad7 (light purple) for the undersides of his hands and feet #fdf0bc (pale yellow) for his eyes #ad902c (yellow-brown) for his shirt"

      "content": "Outline Squidward’s head in the upper center of your paper. Using a sharp pencil, lightly draw a large oval shape for Squidward's head. Leave some room underneath the oval for his nose and mouth so they don’t get cut off by the bottom edge of your paper. Tip: Draw lightly in pencil so you can erase mistakes and outline marks later.

      "content": "Ink the outline with a thin drawing pen and erase your outline marks. First, go over your outline again in pencil and add in any last details you want (for example, add some spots on top of Squidward’s head, or sketch in some droopy eyelids to make him look grumpy or unamused). Then, when you’re happy with your outline, trace over it in ink. To finish up, erase any pencil mistakes or stray outline marks with a high-quality eraser .

Then, add a square-ish shape underneath with slightly rounded corners to outline his pronounced jaw. End with a long, curved line underneath to define the bottom of the neckline. Then, add in some guide lines to help you place his features. Draw a slightly curved vertical line through the head and jaw shapes (this will be the center of his face). Then, add horizontal cross lines on the head and jaw where you want the center of his eyes and lips to be. Tip: Draw lightly in pencil so you can erase mistakes and outline marks later.

Continue the line downward through the jaw and add 2 more curved bumps on the chin to create his signature “butt chin.” On the left side, add a curve that mirrors the right cheek bone to form the left cheek bone. [4] X Research source Tip: Don’t be afraid to exaggerate this outline. The overly defined face shape and bone structure are what make Handsome Squidward so memorable!"

Starting at your top crosshatch guide line, draw a long, bumped nose with flared nostrils that goes down to about the bottom of the head oval. [5] X Research source Then, add 2 short, curved lines above the crosshatch to outline his brows (these will also form the top of his eyes). Finish with some curved, vertical lines between and above the brows to give him a furrowed, pretentious facial expression."

      "content": "Add his eyes, lips, chest hair, and detail lines to complete his face. Draw 2 ovals underneath his brows to form the eyes, then sketch a line across them for the eyelid and add pupils hanging down underneath. For the lips, use the bottom crosshatch as a centerline—make the bottom lip plump and the top lip overly defined and pouty. Draw a few curly cues above the neckline to illustrate his chest hair. To add more dimension to Handsome Squidward’s eye expression, add some “crow’s feet” lines angling out from the corners of his eyes and a short, curved line underneath each eye. Then, define his forehead even more with a curved, backward “S” line above the left eye. Emphasize the nose with 2 vertical, angled lines coming down and away from the outside of the nostrils."

Use a light greenish-gray for the skin (and a slightly darker shade for the eyelids), pale yellow for the eyes, a maroonish-red for the pupils, and pink for his lips."
