The top of the trapezoid will actually be the bottom of the first rectangle you drew, so you don’t need to draw that line. At the left end of that line, draw a straight line extending down to the left at an angle. Do the same thing on the right end of the top line, but have that line extend down to the right. Finally, connect the ends of the 2 angled lines to close off the trapezoid. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Make the trapezoid about 2/3rds the height of the first rectangle you drew. This will be the keyboard on the laptop."

At one end of the trapezoid, draw a vertical line extending down. Make it about 1/8th the height of the trapezoid. Then, do the same thing on the right end of the trapezoid. Finally, connect the bottoms of the two vertical lines together with a horizontal line. [8] X Research source This rectangle will make the keyboard look 3-dimensional."

On the left half of the trapezoid, angle the lines to the left. On the right half, angle the lines to the right. The center line should be perfectly vertical. Finally, draw 4 horizontal lines across the smaller trapezoid, with each line running from the left side of the trapezoid to the right side. [11] X Research source This grid will be the keys on the laptop. To make a spacebar, erase the 3 vertical lines in the 4 squares that are centered in the bottom row so there’s one long key."
