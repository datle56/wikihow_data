Here are a few simple ways to flirt with him : Glance up at him until your eyes meet, then smile at him. Get him a soda, beverage, or candy to show you care about him. Make jokes and try to make him laugh-- be funny ! Smile and make eye contact with him. Place your hand on his knee or 'accidentally' brush up against him. With a guy who's close to you, sign notes to him with \"Love,\" or \"XOXO,\" for example, end a letter to him with \"Love, Sam.\" Make friends with his friends and be sure you leave a good impression on them too! That way they will talk to the guy you like about you."
