      "content": "Consider how open a person is to change. Narrow-minded people tend to want to stay on one course of action. They are usually resistant to new and innovative methods. [1] X Research source Narrow-minded people may resist change or dislike things that conflict with their worldview. A narrow-minded friend, for example, may be averse to going to new restaurants in town. A narrow-minded colleague may be resistant to changes to your company's policies. While many people do not cope well with change, narrow-minded people may see change as inherently negative. A narrow-minded person may be unable to differentiate between different and negative."

      "content": "Notice how this person talks about others. Narrow-minded people may be very opinionated about those around them. A narrow-minded person may be quick to judge others. They may also make negative comments frequently. [2] X Research source A narrow-minded person make quick and absolute judgments about others. He or she will lack the ability to see the complexity in human behavior. For example, you have a friend who struggles with her weight. When that friend is not around, a narrow-minded person may say something like, \"I think the reason June can't lose weight is a lack of willpower.\" A narrow-minded person is unable to see how weight loss is complicated and will simply judge someone. Narrow-minded people may have a tendency to believe the worst in others. A narrow-minded person may say something like, \"I feel like Kate was late to the movie last week to punish me for bailing on plans Saturday.\" Rather than accept people are just late sometimes, the narrow-minded person assumes malicious intent."

      "content": "See how this person handles conflict. Narrow-minded people are often eager to take sides. They are also eager for those around them to take sides. A narrow-minded person is likely to escalate conflict in most situations. [3] X Research source For example, two colleagues get into a dispute at work. The narrow-minded colleague may be quick to anger. He or she may approach you to talk negatively about the other party. Narrow-minded people cannot fathom differences. A narrow-minded person may be incredulous if you do not take his or her side in a conflict. Even if you don't know the details of the conflict, a narrow-minded person may say things like, \"But you know what Jamie did was wrong, right? How can you not understand that's wrong?\""

      "content": "Evaluate whether this person shows an interest in others. People who are empathetic and curious take a genuine interest in those around them. Curious people may become less judgmental as they get to know multiple viewpoints. [4] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source A narrow-minded person, conversely, may lack this curiosity. Narrow-minded people may not be interested in the opinions of others. They may be convinced they have things figured out, and may scorn input from those around them. A narrow-minded person may not, say, ask you about your day. If you talk about politics with a narrow-minded person, he or she is more likely to argue than ask you why you feel the way you do."

      "content": "Evaluate this person's moral code. Narrow-minded people can often be spotted due to a rigid moral code. Narrow-minded people have trouble contemplating difference, and tend to see their way as the best way. [5] X Research source Narrow-minded people can move quickly from judging a person's actions to judging a person. For example, a narrow-minded person may not see an action as morally wrong. They may only see the person who committed that action as morally corrupt. You can detect moral code in how someone judges others. A narrow-minded person may be quick to condemn unconventional behavior. For example, you may have a friend in an open relationship. A narrow-minded person may be inclined to say something like, \"That will never work\" or \"That's just reckless behavior.\""

      "title": "Find out if this person can accept being wrong.",
      "content": "Find out if this person can accept being wrong. Narrow-minded people may see their way as the only way. They may be unwilling to admit that any of their opinions, ideas, or ways of doing things are flawed. A narrow-minded person will stick to his or her guns, even when confronted with opposing facts. He or she may become hostile when his or her beliefs are challenged. For example, a narrow-minded person may mix up the name of an actor in a movie. When you correct the narrow-minded person, he or she may insist on being correct, even after you present information to the contrary. A narrow-minded person may be difficult to talk to. He or she may expect others to listen and agree at all times. In personal relationships, a narrow-minded person may be self-focused. He or she may constantly nitpick and give others advice. For instance, if you express frustration about struggles with weight loss, then a narrow-minded person may immediately say something like, \"I feel like weight loss is all a matter of willpower.\""

      "content": "Watch for stubborn tendencies. Narrow-minded people are difficult to change, even if change is necessary. They may be resistant to insights or facts that challenge their beliefs. [6] X Research source For example, a narrow-minded person may reject facts. He or she may insist on the validity of debunked scientific studies and act hostile or condescending to those who challenge him or her. Narrow-minded people may actually enjoy power struggles more than they enjoy the healthy resolution of conflicts. You may feel like you're being forced into an argument when dealing with a narrow-minded person."

      "content": "Pay attention to hostility. Narrow-minded people can be quick to anger. A narrow-minded person may become quite hostile in the face of criticism. They may yell, throw fits, and refuse to work with those who challenge them. For example, if you have a disagreement with a narrow-minded colleague, he or she may grow angry and walk away from the project. For narrow-minded people, it may be easier to get angry than to confront the fact they may be wrong. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Be assertive when necessary. This is especially important in your work or home life. Living or working with a narrow-minded person can be stressful. It's important that you assert yourself to avoid getting walked all over. Be respectful, but also stand up for yourself. Do not blame or demean the person, but assert your rights and feelings. For example, your narrow-minded boyfriend is insisting that it's petty for you to want to stay out late with your friends. Do not say something like, \"That's ridiculous and you're being controlling. There's no reason why I can't spend the night with my friends.\" You want to make sure your needs are heard, but voice them in a productive fashion. Instead, say something like, \"I can see you get frustrated when I stay out late, and you would like us to spend more time together, but please don't judge my character based on my actions. My relationships with other people are important and need to be nurtured as well.\""

      "content": "Deal with a narrow-minded loved one. You want to correct poor behaviors if you're close to a narrow-minded person. Do so respectfully, as not to escalate the situation. It's important to teach people how to treat others better. Address the situation in the moment. Wait until a narrow-minded person is being critical to provide feedback. For example, say you are struggling at work. Your boyfriend, who works in a different field, starts listing everything you're doing wrong. Stop him and say something like, \"I appreciate your feedback, but I'm not looking for advice. Can you please just listen to me?\""

For instance, say there is a new policy in place in your office in terms of clocking hours. You are trying to follow the policy, which you find easier, but the narrow-minded co-worker is complaining. Your co-worker insists you should take his or her side on the issue, and help him or her confront your boss. Say something like, \"Look, I like the new system. I appreciate you sharing your opinion, but I'm not interested in getting into a confrontation over it.\""

      "content": "Present facts. This can often stop a narrow-minded person in their tracks. If someone is insisting their way or method is right, present facts to the contrary. For example, a colleague may insist on taking a particular driving route when carpooling. He or she may insist it is faster. You can pull out your phone, and look up your route on the GPS. Be polite. Say something like, \"I actually think this way is faster. It's less miles, and the time the GPS is giving me is also shorter.\""

      "content": "Take a break on occasion. Narrow-minded people can be difficult to be around. It's completely normal to sometimes need a break. If a narrow-minded person is getting to you, walk away from the situation. End the conversation politely. You do not want to make an already hostile person more hostile. Say something like, \"Okay, thanks for talking\" and then make up an excuse. For example, \"I have some work to catch up on.\" Go do something you enjoy to help yourself disengage. Read a book, watch a movie, or go for a walk. Pick a relaxing activity to take your mind off of your frustrations."

      "content": "Be willing to consider the reasons for someone’s behavior. Saying that someone is narrow-minded may indicate that the person is resistant to change due to their perception that something is difficult, and any changes to the person’s routine may cause the person to feel anxious. To avoid being narrow-minded about narrow-minded people, it is important to consider the reasons why someone might behave in narrow-minded ways. These reasons can include: Life circumstances. Past negative experiences. Mental illness. Low self-esteem. Other things beyond what you know about the person."

If someone behaves in ways that you consider narrow-minded, it might be due to something beyond his or her control, such as a mental illness. Rigidity—which is associated with narrow-mindedness—is a symptom of some mental illnesses. For example, some personality disorders might cause a person to behave in narrow-minded ways. [8] X Research source Someone who has social anxiety disorder might seem narrow-minded about going out to parties or different social venues. However, the person might simply be avoiding these activities because of his or her anxiety. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider why someone might be resistant to change. Some people might be afraid of change due to past circumstances, such as losing a job or a painful breakup. These negative experiences with change may result in a person developing some narrow-minded behaviors. For example, someone who had a negative experience after moving to a new city may be resistant to the idea of ever moving again."
