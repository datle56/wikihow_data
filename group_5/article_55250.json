While you’re not required to physically catch all 210 Pokémon in the regional Sinnoh Pokédex, you are required to run into them all at one point or another.

At that point, Professor Oak visits and upgrades your device to the National Dex.

As you’re exploring the Old Chateau, walk around the second floor until you run into a wild Rotom. [4] X Research source The Old Chateau requires Cut (HM01) to reach. Note: If you ran into this Pokémon before becoming Pokémon Champion, it should spawn again in the Old Chateau once you’ve entered the Hall of Fame. [5] X Research source Beyond this, however, you will only get one chance to catch Rotom so make sure you do not knock it out. Save before battling it."

On the desk, inspect the book that’s there—a picture of Manaphy is printed, which registers the Legendary as “seen” in your Pokédex. [7] X Research source Pokémon Platinum held an event back in the late 2000s that allowed players to catch this Pokémon; however, this event is no longer available. Inspecting the book is your best bet in filling out your Sinnoh Pokédex."
