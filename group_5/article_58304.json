      "content": "Find and measure the right location to plant your bamboo fence. The recommended distance from any underground structure is 1.5 ft. This prevents the root from causing any problems. Always call (811) before any project that involves digging more than 6\" below the ground. Bamboo typically prefers partial to full sun. Bamboo needs a similar amount of water as your average lawn grass. It needs a well drained soil. Avoid swampy places."

      "content": "Decide if running (leptomorph) bamboo or clumping (pachymorph) bamboo is right for you. Running bamboo grows quicker and easier, but is likely to spread to undesired areas. Due to this, running bamboo should be potted or surrounded by well built, underground barriers. Clumping bamboo grows slower but is much easier to control, and therefore the advised choice."

      "content": "Determine the size of bamboo fence that you would like. Bamboo can reach a max height anywhere from 2 ft - 100 ft. Websites and other databases typically provide a maximum growth height for each species. [3] X Research source Maximum height is only reached in ideal conditions and after many years. Typically, your bamboo will not reach maximum height, only ~70% of maximum height."

      "title": "Choose the aesthetic.",
      "content": "Choose the aesthetic. Bamboo comes in a variety of stem and leaf colors. In some species of bamboo, leaves turn color in autumn and fall off. Others maintain their leaf color year round. Different shapes are found in different species. The largest factor in determining the shape is whether it is a clumping or running bamboo, though among each type variation does exist."

Here are the necessary details to consider for the bamboo species Fargesia denudata : [4] X Research source ttp://www.bamboogarden.com/Fargesia%20denudata.htm&gt; It is a shade loving species It is hardy in USDA zones 4-9. Detroit is in zone 6b. It is a clumping variety, so there is much less worry of spread to neighbors' yards. It has a maximum height of 15 ft, which means an expected max in Detroit of 6-9 ft The foliage stays green year round It is common, and therefore cheap ($20 for 1-3 ft tall plant)"

      "title": "Decide when to plant.",
      "content": "Decide when to plant. Younger, shade-loving bamboo are sensitive to strong sunlight. Plant these in spring to allow time to grow. Recently planted bamboo will fall victim to the summer afternoon sun and bamboo needs time to establish itself before enduring the winter. In warmer climates, bamboo may be planted in the fall."

For a dense fence using young bamboo, allow 1-3 ft between each potted plant.The hole diameter will be 2x the diameter of the root ball. Try to keep the bamboo 1.5 ft away from any permanent underground structure. Bamboo roots are very strong and can go through most things."
