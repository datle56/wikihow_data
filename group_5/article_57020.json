    {
      "title": "Pick your setting.",
      "content": "Pick your setting. Making out with a stranger is going to be easier in a setting where that's at least somewhat normal, like a bar or nightclub. Walking up to someone on the street and trying to kiss them is unlikely to get you all that far."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say \"Hi\" to the stranger you want to seduce.",
      "content": "Say \"Hi\" to the stranger you want to seduce. A good and friendly introduction gets you off on the right foot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find something to talk about.",
      "content": "Find something to talk about. You might start with small talk, or you can ask the stranger how to get to your destination. That's the easiest way to get a stranger to talk to you, without him/her being overly suspicious or uncomfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give them a compliment.",
      "content": "Give them a compliment. That's the easiest way to attract someone; if they seem open to chatting more, keep the conversation going."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to start a flirtatious chat.",
      "content": "Try to start a flirtatious chat. That's not very hard and awkward after the compliment is given. Just stay in tune with their cues for whether they want to talk to you or not; if they seem into the conversation, continue, but if they're trying to end the conversation, move away from you, or using very closed body language , give up and move on. You can't win them all."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for signs they're interested.",
      "content": "Look for signs they're interested. Honestly, many people aren't going to be too keen to kiss somebody they just met. But if the setting is right and they're showing you with their interactions and body language that they're into it, you might be in luck. See if they're showing signs of physical interest, like touching you or leaning in to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for it, if the signs are good.",
      "content": "Go for it, if the signs are good. When you feel ready, close in for a kiss. That is when the stranger supposedly feels very comfortable and you do too. It's hard to decide when this happens."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get comfortable.",
      "content": "Get comfortable. You are in a world with your partner, remember, not yourself. Read their cues, and respond to them; if they start to pull away, break the kiss."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take it from a kiss to making out, if they want to.",
      "content": "Take it from a kiss to making out , if they want to. Again, read their cues to see if this is appropriate and consensual. Lick the lips of your partner when you want to add tongue. If you've read the other WikiHow articles on how to French Kiss , you'll know that you need to show signs of tentative tongue touching. Remember, this could be your last time seeing that person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know when to pull away.",
      "content": "Know when to pull away. A big part of sharing a good kiss is knowing when to end it, to stop things from getting awkward and keep enjoyment high for both of you. When the time comes, pull back your head slowly, keep eye contact, and smile. See if you can segue into more conversation (or dancing, or cuddling, or whatever else strikes both your fancies). Making out with a stranger is unlikely to indicate a long-term relationship - so, read the signs, and keep kissing as long as you're both happy to. When it's time to come up for air - or even part ways - do so."
