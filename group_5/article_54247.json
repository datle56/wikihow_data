You can write, “I made an in-person request on September 1, 2016 to review the books. However, Ms. Smith told me that I would need permission from the entire board even though Section 12.3 of the CC&Rs gives all members a right to review the HOA books.

During binding arbitration, a judge-like third party will listen to each party present their case. At the end of this presentation, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion stating who won and what the award will be. Because this is binding arbitration, both parties will be bound by the arbitrator's decision."

In addition, even if the CC&Rs do not contain attorneys' fees provisions, some state statutes allow prevailing parties to recoup attorneys' fees. Be aware of this before you file a lawsuit.

[7] X Trustworthy Source United States Courts Official website for the U.S. court system Go to source If you are suing for a personal injury, then you can sue in state civil court.

Generally, you can serve notice in the following ways: [9] X Research source Have the sheriff hand deliver the notice. In many counties, you can pay the sheriff a small fee to make hand delivery. Hire a private process server. For a small fee, process servers will make hand delivery on the HOA. You can find process servers in your phone book or online. Ask someone 18 or older to make hand delivery. Usually, any adult can make hand delivery provided they are not part of the lawsuit. For example, don’t ask your child who lives with you to make hand delivery. However, you could have a colleague at work deliver it for you. Mail it to HOA management.

The HOA might also raise “affirmative defenses.” These are defenses which allow the HOA management to win the lawsuit even if all of your allegations are true. [11] X Research source For example, one affirmative defense is that you waited too long to sue. If the management company raises affirmative defenses, then you should talk about them with a lawyer."

After receiving the management company’s response, the case will enter a fact-finding phase called “discovery.” In discovery, you and HOA management will swap information and answer questions under oath.
