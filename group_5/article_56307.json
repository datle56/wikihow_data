The two are a devilishly simple but effective combination. Check your closet or dresser drawers, as you may have left some lying around from recent purchases. If you can't find any, packets of silica are available in bulk for very economical prices online. Silica packets are largely available with the following items: Beef jerky Shoes and shoe boxes Cat litter"

      "content": "Embed the silica into the pumpkin. Remove the top of the pumpkin. Take a silica bead and embed it into the interior of the pumpkin.

      "content": "Mix 1 teaspoon bleach per gallon of water to create enough water to dunk the pumpkin into. You'll need a vat and a good amount of bleach/water, depending on the size of the pumpkin. The idea is that bleach is an antimicrobial, and that water will hydrate the skin of the pumpkin like a moisturizer would on human skin."

      "content": "Every day, moisturize the pumpkin with the bleach solution. Spray the outside and inside with the bleach solution used to treat the pumpkin initially. Soak up any excess moisture after spraying. Moisture is the ally of mold."

      "title": "Spray the pumpkin with the preservative or dunk the pumpkin into the preservative.",
      "content": "Spray the pumpkin with the preservative or dunk the pumpkin into the preservative. Spraying is more convenient, but dunking may be more long-lasting. If choosing to dunk, be sure to pat the pumpkin dry. Remember that mold hits where moisture fits."
