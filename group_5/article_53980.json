They hate rocking the boat, and they'll do anything to avoid tension. [8] X Research source Because they're always going out of their way for others, Type 9 often ends up feeling overwhelmed or burnt-out. [9] X Research source To overcome this : To combat your people-pleasing tendencies , practice asserting yourself, and saying “no” when you need to. Remind yourself that your voice matters, and that your loved ones want to hear what you have to say, even if you disagree with them. Come up with an empowering mantra to remind you to speak up and stand firm. This could be something like, “My opinion is valuable,” or “I’m allowed to say no.” [10] X Research source"

This is an asset when mediating conflict, but it has some negative consequences, too. Type 9 may be so used to seeing things from others’ perspectives that they lose sight of their own opinions and desires. This makes it tough for them to make important decisions. [13] X Research source To overcome this : When you’re making choices, you likely find yourself endlessly going back-and-forth. To combat this, try setting a time limit. For example, you could give yourself a deliberation period of 15-30 minutes for a smaller decision, or a few days for a major one. Once your deliberation period is up, make a choice, and stick with it!< [14] X Research source"

These subcategories are called “wings.” 9w8 : A Type 9 with an 8 wing is a bit more assertive than a typical Type 9. Taking on the characteristics of confident Type 8s, this subtype is able to stick up for themselves and stand their ground.
