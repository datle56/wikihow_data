      "content": "Push the paperclip into the connector. [1] X Research source When inserting the paperclip, be sure to use the small, straight end that juts out at a 90º angle. Using the analogies above, it would be the top of the eighth note/Z/S."

      "title": "Search for channels.",
      "content": "Search for channels. Look through the available channels by manually flipping from channel to channel or using your TV’s Auto Program feature (if available). The closer you are to a broadcasting station, the more likely you will be to find some channels. If you have a Vizio TV, scan for channels using either Auto Search or Auto Channel Scan. On an Android TV, use the Auto Program feature to find your channels. For other TV brands, try searching online to see if your TV has an autoscan feature."

Add a second mark 5.75 inches (14.6 centimetres) from the first mark, a third mark 5.75 inches (14.6 centimetres) from the second mark, and one final mark 5.75 inches (14.6 centimetres) from the third mark. Go in 0.5 inches (1.3 centimetres) from the edge at each of those marks, then make a clearer mark to denote where you will screw. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the hooks off of the coat hangers, then cut four hangers in half. Your metal hangers will essentially serve as wires in this antenna, so there is no need for the hooks to remain attached. Once you have cut four hangers in half in the middle of the long base section, you should be left with 8 V-shaped hanger pieces. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim each leg of each V to 8 inches and bend them so they are 3 in (7.6 cm) apart. These Vs will face outwards from your antenna, picking up TV channels from nearby stations. Also, try to make the angle at the base of the V as well defined as possible. Some coat hangers have a more gradual curve at each end, but it will be easier to build the antenna out of pieces with sharp angles. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Weave your straightened hangers around the screws. One hanger should wrap around the outside of the bottom-left screw, the outside of the two middle-right screws, and the outside of the top-left screw. Then, wrap the second hanger opposite the first, starting at the bottom-right screw, then continuing along the board. [6] X Research source Individually, the hangers should look something like brackets with bent ends. Once both hangers are attached to the board, the resulting shape should resemble a rectangle with an hourglass on each end."

Stopping the two wires from coming in contact will essentially prevent an electrical “feedback loop” in your antenna.

An impedance-matching transformer allows maximum power transfer by matching the impedance of the antenna and the TV. [7] X Research source Depending on the transformer, you may be able to attach it using two more screws in the middle of your long wires or by soldering it on . If you are using more screws, be sure to sand the long wires where they touch the screws to increase the flow of electricity through the antenna!"
