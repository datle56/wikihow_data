[1] X Research source The term caught on and became so popular that Gen Z content creators began using it to playfully mock Gen Alpha slang. Cenat also posted a compilation video of Fanum stealing food to his YouTube channel in June 2023. In the last clip of the compilation video, Cenat attempts to barricade his door. When he believes Fanum is locked out, he yells, “I evaded the taxes!” and “It’s tax evasion, bro!” [2] X Research source Streamer Fanum says that “fanum tax” isn’t about stealing. In a GQ video he said, “The tax is pretty much, you know what I’m saying, feed your friends. People confuse it like you got to take food from your friend.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Gen Alpha has an entire language of creative slang terms. Many of these terms come from social media or gaming, and are inadvertently spread even further by older generations mocking Gen Alpha slang on TikTok. Here are a few of the most common terms: “Gyat” or “Gyatt”: “Gyatt” means an attractive backside, usually on a girl or woman. It comes from the phrase “gyatt-damn” or “goddamn.” For example: Brianna’s dress is fire. Look at the gyatt on her!” “Rizzler”: A “rizzler” is a person with charm or charisma. “Rizz” means charm , and is short for charisma. It transformed into “rizzler” to describe a charming person or someone with “game.” For example: “I’ve never seen someone so smooth. He’s a rizzler for sure.” “Skibidi”: “Skibidi” is a nonsense word that means nothing or takes on meaning from the context. [7] X Research source Use “skibidi” as an adjective to describe or intensify the meaning of just about any other word, especially other slang terms. For example, “That’s some skibidi delulu thinking right there.” “Sigma”: A “sigma” or “sigma male” is a type of guy who’s self-reliant, confident, and individualistic. Use “sigma” to refer to nonconformist men who don’t care about social status. For example: “Joseph is so sigma. He’s cool, confident, and has zero interest in what anyone thinks about him.” “Ohio”: “Ohio” means that something is weird, but it’s not always a bad thing. Some believe this slang came from using “only in Ohio” to describe an odd occurrence or person. Use “ohio” to describe someone or something that’s creepy or cringe. For example: “My cousin is so ohio. He said he saw Bigfoot in our upstairs bathroom.”"
