      "content": "Virgos don’t like to end relationships, so he’ll try to motivate you to end it. He won’t hug you, kiss you, or say “I love you”—instead, he’ll try to push you to your limit. If he isn’t treating you with love and respect, he’s probably trying to convince you to end things. To get the ball rolling, he might: [2] X Research source Nitpick every little thing you do Criticize the way you look Refuse to spend quality time with you"

      "content": "Everyone forgets to reply to texts sometimes, but he makes it a regular occurrence. Maybe you ask him how his day was, or if he’d like to hang out later on. No matter what the message is, it never seems important enough to grab his attention. Unfortunately, leaving you on read is a classic sign that he’s trying to pull away . Try to give him the benefit of the doubt first. Let him know how you feel when he doesn’t reply to your messages, and see if he tries to make an effort. You could say something like: “I understand that you’re busy, but I feel like I’m not a priority when you blow off my texts. Do you think we could come to some sort of compromise?” Super-delayed replies to your texts aren’t a great sign, either."

      "content": "A happy, content Virgo will love chatting and spending time with you. [3] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. If he’s pushing you away, he might avoid striking up conversations or asking about how your day went. As a true test, try chatting with him about some of his favorite topics, like a hobby. If he’s acting disinterested and closed off, he’s probably pulling back. [4] X Research source Look for a pattern of distant, disinterested behavior, too. If he only acts this way once or twice, he could just be having a bad day."

      "content": "Your sex life shouldn’t be nonexistent if you’ve been intimate in the past. Unfortunately, a disinterested Virgo may cool things down indefinitely just to make a point. Think about the last time you both took a roll in the hay. If weeks and months have passed since your last romp, there’s a good chance that he’s pushing you away. [5] X Research source Try to keep context in mind before jumping to any conclusions. If he had a really long day at work, he could just be too tired to be intimate that night."

      "content": "Virgos tend to follow a strict daily schedule and will make time for those who matter. Invite him to spend some time with you and see how he reacts—an engaged, interested Virgo guy will be more than happy to pencil you into his daily life. If he’s never able (or willing) to prioritize you, there’s a good chance that he’s pushing you away. [6] X Research source Ask him to hang out on multiple occasions. You might say “Would you like to head over to my place and watch a movie together?” or “Wanna grab a bite to eat at the food court tonight?” Even if he’s busy one day, an interested Virgo should still be willing to prioritize you later on."

      "content": "Committed Virgo men love to lend a helping hand. From household chores to tough homework problems, Virgos want to be as supportive and helpful as possible. With this in mind, pay close attention to how he treats you each day. Is he looking for opportunities to make your life a little easier, or is he leaving you to your own devices? A distant, unhelpful Virgo may: [7] X Research source Let the door close behind him instead of holding it open for you. Skip over chores that he’s usually eager to help with. Refuse to give you advice when you’re having a tough time."

      "content": "All Virgos are a little bit critical, but their criticism shouldn’t be toxic. A kind, helpful Virgo guy will probably point out if your shirt is wrinkled or if you have something stuck in your teeth. However, his comments and critiques are meant to help you, not harm you. If he’s really trying to push you away, he might make pointlessly critical, borderline nasty remarks. He might say: [8] X Research source “Your room is such a pigsty” instead of “You could really speed up your morning routine if you organized your room.” “You look like you got dressed in the dark” instead of “Your shirt and pants don’t match very well.”"

Does he seem genuinely interested and invested in what you have to say, or is he just shrugging off your thoughts and opinions? A distant, uncaring Virgo may be trying to push you away. He might: [9] X Research source Act like his opinion matters more than yours Not pay attention when you tell him something important Not remember things you mentioned in previous conversations"

      "content": "Petty remarks, snide comments, and bouts of silent treatment are big red flags. Pay attention to how he treats you on a day-to-day basis, and how he reacts to minor inconveniences. Does he seem to make a big deal out of nothing, or turn the slightest inconvenience into a huge issue? Non-stop passive-aggressive language could definitely be a sign that he’s pulling away. [10] X Research source He might say: [11] X Research source “I’m not mad” when he’s clearly upset. “Fine. It’s whatever” instead of sharing how he’s really feeling. “I was just joking” when he says a clearly hurtful remark."

      "content": "An unhappy Virgo man isn’t afraid to dig into past arguments. He might rake you through the coals over an argument from eons ago, or randomly mention something hurtful that you did a long time ago. Long, pointless grudges are a big red flag that he’s pulling away from you. [12] X Research source Pay close attention to the intent of his words. Is he digging up the past solely to drag your name through the mud, or is he genuinely hurt about something?"

Virgo men usually love to keep things peaceful and harmonious, so it’s a very bad sign if he’s always butting heads with you.

He might: [13] X Research source Bicker about something minor, like a household chore Blame you about something Treat you like the bad guy"

If he’s constantly pointing out how little you have in common, he might be trying to send you a message. He might say: “I can’t believe we’ve been together for 2 years. I don’t think we like any of the same things.” “I have such a hard time hanging out with you sometimes. You really like going out, and I’d rather spend a night in.”"
