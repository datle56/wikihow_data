      "content": "Make your parents think you care more about your social life than dating. Tell them about your packed schedule with all your buddies. For example, if you plan to go bowling with your boyfriend, just say it’s a group activity. Have your friends pick you up where your parents can see them. Your parents will think your story checks out. You can just meet up with your boyfriend later. [1] X Research source It’s easiest to tell most of the truth. If you say you’ll be with your friends, plan to spend part of the day with them. That way, you'll look relaxed when you explain yourself to your parents. [2] X Research source If you want to wear a fun outfit when you meet your boyfriend, keep it in a bag or backpack. Leave your house in an everyday look, like one you’d wear at school, so your parents don’t think you’re out on a date. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Impress your parents with how responsible you are. Remind them how much homework you get, and tell them that it’s impossible to tackle on your own. Say that you’ve signed up for as many study groups as you could. Make sure that you really do keep on top of your studies even when you go on dates. When you come home with great grades, your parents will approve of your choices. [4] X Research source You can share how many hours you have to spend on homework to make a super strong case. For instance, you can say, “I get assigned 15 to 20 hours of homework a week!” [5] X Research source You can also be honest and talk about how tiring homework is. You can tell them, “It’s hard to do all these assignments on my own, and it feels more motivating to be with other people.” You can even set a goal to do your homework with your boyfriend, and then relax together. Both of your parents will love that you take school seriously."

      "title": "Your parents will never worry about you if it’s just a friend calling.",
      "content": "Your parents will never worry about you if it’s just a friend calling. Rename your boyfriend in your contact list. Keep any romantic emojis like hearts (💕) or fire (🔥) off his name, too. You can just swap out his name with a best friend’s. For example, if you always talk about a bestie called “Taylor,” you can call your boyfriend that. Your parents will just think you’re really close with your buddies. [6] X Research source It’s totally possible to have two contacts with the exact same name. Leave off any clues, like “Taylor 2.” If your parents see that, they might wonder what’s up."

      "content": "Your parents will think you’re single. Post pictures of fun activities with your friends, inspirational quotes, or thoughts about your future. Make sure there isn’t any evidence of you cuddling up to your boyfriend, and check that you aren’t tagged with him in other photos. If your social media doesn’t have any hints of romance, your parents will think that dates aren’t on your radar at all.

      "content": "Distract your parents from learning about your relationship. Bring up random topics at different times of the day. For example, you can talk about trivia from your history class while you eat breakfast. Then, you can talk to your parents about your hopes and dreams during dinner. Since they’re already curious about you, they’ll appreciate learning so much about you. [8] X Research source In the morning, you can say something like, “I never knew I’d love World History so much! I learned this about the spice trade…” During dinner, you can share what you want for your future. For example, you can say, “I think I really want a double major in Foreign Language and Economics one day!” Studies suggest you’ll increase your social skills and boost your self-esteem if you talk to your parents regularly.

      "content": "Visit spots they don’t know to keep your relationship stress-free. Check out settings that your parents or their friends wouldn’t think to go to. For example, maybe there’s a local rec center, an arcade, or a skating park where teens hang out. If you stick to settings that adults aren’t really interested in, then they won’t see you and your boyfriend. [10] X Trustworthy Source Pew Research Center Nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion, demographic trends, and social trends Go to source School is also a great place to hang out with your boyfriend because you can have lots of fun talks during your breaks. When your parents are at work, you can also hang out with your S.O. and mutual friends at one of your houses. You can also join extracurriculars with your boyfriend. For example, you both can sign up for the drama club and spend a ton of time together at rehearsals."

      "content": "Cozy up with him when it’s just you two to keep everything special. Skip the PDA on social media or out in public places. You’ll make sure neither of you have to deal with comments from your parents, peers, or family friends. You can always give your S.O. lots of hugs and kisses when you get some time to yourselves. [11] X Research source If your parents and friends can’t judge your relationship, then you’ll both be able to focus on each other. When you’re alone with him, give his hand a squeeze and tell him you’re glad to see him again. You can even tell him something like, “It feels really special when I get to sneak a kiss since no one’s watching!”"

      "title": "Learn about their values so you can understand your parents.",
      "content": "Learn about their values so you can understand your parents. You can ask them if they were able to date at your age. You can even see if they think times have changed. See if they’d ever let you have a relationship. If they say they wouldn’t, let them explain their point of view. They’ll love that you’re a good listener, and they might wonder if they can be less strict. [12] X Research source You can start a discussion with something like, “Were you ever able to date when you were my age? Did you want to?” Bring up how your generation is a little different from your parents. For example, you can say, “It seems totally normal for people my age to hang out after school. What do you think about that?” You can even learn about their idea of consequences. For instance, you can ask, “What would happen if I did get a boyfriend?”"

Let them see your grades, social calendar, and sleep schedule. If you show your parents that you’re really driven, you’ll prove that you can manage a relationship on top of everything else. [13] X Research source If you've taken on some responsibility outside the home (like in the community or at school), use this to demonstrate that you're capable of handling additional freedom. If you’ve arranged some study groups that you take seriously, tell your parents that. Explain that you have a support network of peers that are just as ambitious as you are. Share that health really matters to you. When they know you will take care of your body and your mind, your parents will feel relieved. They’ll also respect that you’ll make good decisions. Remind your parents that social connections are really important and that you just want an S.O. that has your back."

When you go out, invite your boyfriend to volunteer with you. It’ll be really romantic to be a team, and you’ll definitely make a difference. [14] X Research source You can just tell your parents that he’s a volunteer buddy instead of your boyfriend. Share all the benefits of community service with your parents. For example, you can say, “Not only will it make me feel really confident, but I’ll make friends and get some work experience.” [15] X Research source Remind your parents that you’ll also pick up a lot of “community service hours,” which will look great on college applications and resumes."
