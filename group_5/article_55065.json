It is not necessary for your hair to be freshly washed, but if you do wash your hair before styling it, you may find it useful to add some volumizing spray to it before you blow it dry. You can apply some products after blowdrying your hair, so just be sure to follow the instructions of whichever product you choose."

      "content": "Separate hair into three sections. With your hands, use your thumbs along the sides of your head to help you separate the top third of your hair from the bottom. Use a clip to hold this section in place. To create the other two sections, simply separate the remaining hair into two halves with your left and right hands. Lay the left section over your left shoulder, and the right section over your right shoulder. It is not necessary to clip these two bottom sections."

      "content": "Wrap 1- to 2-inch sections of hair around a 19mm (3/4-inch) curling wand. Starting at the back of your head and moving toward the front, alternate between curling towards and away from your face. For the pieces of hair that frame your face, you’ll want to curl away from your face. Each curl should look like a little spiral. Hold each strand on the wand for roughly 20 seconds. It could be slightly less time depending on the quality of your wand and the thickness of your hair. If your hair is fine or damaged, you may want to start at 10 to 15 seconds to see if that works for you. Curling away from your face means pulling your hair away from your face to wrap it around the wand. Curling towards your face means pulling your hair towards your face to wrap it around the wand. If your hair doesn’t hold curls well, as you let the curl slide off the wand, let it fall into the palm of your hand and hold it there until it cools off. [1] X Research source"

For a slightly softer look, lightly run a paddle brush (a large, flat brush) over the top layer of your hair while also working it with your fingers until you get a look that you are happy with. This will make the curls look more natural."

      "title": "Purchase a pair of high-quality hair scissors with short blades.",
      "content": "Purchase a pair of high-quality hair scissors with short blades. The longer the blades, the less control you have, so aim for something on the shorter end. If the actual cutting part of the scissors is around 2.5 inches (roughly 6.5cm), that should work well. Some stylists even recommend using cuticle scissors, but you will likely have more luck achieving this particular style of fringe (i.e. the blunt style) with a pair of scissors that are specifically designed for cutting hair. If you do use cuticle scissors, ensure that they are not curved, as this will likely make it more difficult for you to cut where you want to cut."

      "title": "Section off hair to be made into bangs.",
      "content": "Section off hair to be made into bangs. If you already have bangs and are just looking to reshape them into Taylor Swift’s blunt look, ignore this step. Depending on the shape of your head and face, if you pull your bangs into a ponytail that drops down over your face, the part around your bangs (where you can see your scalp) will resemble a rounded triangle, with the wide base of the triangle being where your hairline meets your forehead. Exactly how long (i.e. how far back on your head) and wide (i.e. how far it spans across your forehead) that triangle is depends on your facial shape. Look in a mirror and experiment with different lengths and widths until you find the section of hair that best works for you. Be very careful not to go too wide. If you’re unsure, start narrow and move outward. A good rule of thumb is to stick to the hairline on top of your head, and leave the hairline along the sides of your face alone. Once you find a shape that you're happy with, tie it with an elastic to make a ponytail that hangs down the middle of your face. Pull down on the ponytail very gently (if you pull down hard, your hair will come out shorter than desired), and cut it so that your hair, when out of the ponytail, lands between your eyes and eyebrows (aim for somewhere in the middle). Ultimately you’ll want your bangs to be just at eyebrow level, but you don't want to cut to that level right away. Give yourself some room to work with!"

To replicate Taylor Swift’s hair with these bangs, you would either straighten all of your hair with a flat iron for the purely straight look, or straighten just your bangs and then add light wave to the bottom of your hair for the wavy look. To make the bottom of your hair wavy with a flat iron, start at the top of your hair, pull the iron about 40% of the way down your hair, then, holding the bottom of your hair lightly, twist the iron so that your hair is wrapped around it, with the bottom strand still coming out the bottom of the iron, then drag the iron down the rest of your hair until it reaches the end. Go more slowly for more defined curls. To make curls with a flat iron that cover more of your head, start higher up on the hair strand — for instance, right away instead of 40% of the way down)."

Starting at the side of your part that has less hair, wrap different-sized chunks of hair around the barrel of a 1.5-inch (38mm) curling wand. Pull the chunks of hair towards your face as you wrap them around the wand, and hold them there for 10 to 20 seconds. [2] X Research source How long you should hold your hair on the wand will depend on the power of your wand and the type of hair you have. For example, if you have fine hair, it will take less time than if it’s thick. The chunks of hair should be more vertically thick (going from the top of your head to the bottom of it) than horizontally thick (going from one side of your head to the other), as you want long, soft, waves more than tight curls. If you are unsure of what size each chunk of hair should be, aim for between 2 and 3 inches thick."

Spray waxes are also great for maintaining hold and flexibility, and are less likely to become flakey and white if you overdo it.
