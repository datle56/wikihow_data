      "title": "Find a holding tank.",
      "content": "Find a holding tank. Your fish will need to be placed in a temporary holding tank while you clean and refill their permanent home. So find a suitably sized bowl, container or bucket that will serve as a temporary holding tank. [1] X Research source Use a bowl or container that has not been washed with soap, as the residue from many soaps can be harmful to fish."

      "title": "“Age” the water.",
      "content": "“Age” the water. You will need to age the water you will use in your holding tank to equalize the temperature and PH balance. Let the water sit overnight after filling the temporary holding container to achieve the proper temperature and to allow the levels of chlorine in the water to neutralize. If you don't want to wait for water to age overnight, then it is wise to treat this water with a dechlorinator. These products neutralize the chlorine levels found in most city and municipal water sources. Make sure the water in this temporary holding tank is the same temperature as the water in the permanent tank. You may also wish to cover this tank with a lid to prevent the fish from jumping out."

      "content": "Avoid direct light. Don't place the temporary holding tank in a window or under a bright light, as the heat from these sources can raise the water temperature, potentially harming your fish. Also, be sure to place your temporary holding tank in a place where children and other household pets can't bother the fish. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Move your fish.",
      "content": "Move your fish. Take your fishnet and scoop your fish out of the fish bowl and put them into the temporary holding tank of fresh water. Use a large bowl for this holding tank so that your fish have plenty of room to swim. When using a fishnet to transfer fish from one container to another, make sure the containers are close together. This will reduce the amount of time the fish is out of the water, thus reducing its stress levels. Alternatively, you can use a small, clean bowl to transfer your fish. Make sure the bowl does not have soap or soap residue on it and select a rounded bowl with smooth edges. When using this method, simply dunk the small bowl into the fish tank and allow the fish to swim into it. Be patient and don't chase the fish around its bowl. This could stress the fish out."

Look for changes in their behavior, color and activity levels. The following signs should be an indicator that the water in the temporary tank is too warm. Hyperactivity Changes in the fish's color “Yawning” at the surface of the water (although some fish, like labyrinth fish, breathe this way) If the water is too cold, your fish may exhibit the following signs: Inactivity Sitting on the bottom Changes in color"

      "content": "Allow the bowl to sit. After washing and rinsing the fish bowl, allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes. This will give the glass of the bowl time to cool down from its exposure to the warm water used to wash and rinse it out. Allowing the bowl time to return to room temperature will help to ensure the bowl is the ideal temperature when the fish are returned."

If you choose to use dechlorinator, be careful not to spill it, as it could leave a chemical smell on your carpet or furniture. [5] X Research source Again, you may wish to use a dechlorinator rather than waiting overnight for chlorine levels to neutralize. If this is the case, make sure allow the water temperature to equalize before placing the fish back in the tank. Be sure to cover the water or put it out of reach if you have pets or children. This will help you ensure the water is not contaminated while it is aging."
