      "content": "Understand what a free account can do. Free accounts can be leveled up to Level 20 (out of a possible 120 levels), and can continue to play after hitting the cap (without accruing additional XP). Free accounts are also limited to 10 Gold. Free accounts also have limits on in-game communication, and cannot join Guilds. [1] X Research source If you have a subscription that's lapsed, your account will turn into a Starter account with all the same restrictions except that your character will have the ability to join the same Guild as any of your other characters. You won't have access to any of your characters above Level 20, but you can create new characters. Starter accounts are a great way to play for as long as you want to decide if World of Warcraft is for you."

      "content": "Understand the process. On April 6th, 2015 an update to World of Warcraft introduced WoW Tokens. These are items that players can redeem for 30 days of a World of Warcraft subscription. Tokens can be purchased for real money and then sold in the in-game Auction House for Gold. This allows you to effectively purchase your subscription from Gold you earn playing the game. [2] X Research source Because Starter Accounts can't access the Auction House, and because WoW tokens are very expensive, this isn't a viable method for free Starter accounts. You'll need to be a paying subscriber in order to access the Auction House and earn enough gold to extend your subscription."

      "title": "Gather enough gold.",
      "content": "Gather enough gold. When the Wow Tokens launched, they were put on the Auction House for around 200k-300k gold (depending on the server). The price is now set by the players, and fluctuates based on supply and demand. Regardless, WoW Tokens are still quite expensive, so you'll want to have an ample regular income of Gold to afford it monthly. If you farm for Gold efficiently, you can earn around 1,000-2,000 Gold per hour. This means you could reasonably expect to be able to afford a WoW token after a few weeks of farming."
