      "title": "Nothing makes a Gemini man happier than talking for hours.",
      "content": "Nothing makes a Gemini man happier than talking for hours. Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication and thinking—ask him a question and he'll go on and on. You Water-bearers are no slouch at conversations either, so this is your time to shine. He'll light up when you ask him a deep philosophical question or seek his opinion on some current controversy. Both Gemini and Aquarius love to be intellectually engaged, so this is a great match. Rest assured there is nothing too obscure for the Gemini man's interest. He flits about from subject to subject and knows at least a little about so many things, you're unlikely to stump him. Don't be surprised if he passionately discusses one side of an issue, then immediately flip-flops and offers the most compelling arguments of the other side. Twins pride themselves on their ability to see things from all sides. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Cerebral Geminis are attracted to brilliant concepts.",
      "content": "Cerebral Geminis are attracted to brilliant concepts. Ruled by Uranus, the \"disruptor\" planet, Aquarians are known for thinking outside the box. Chances are, you have all kinds of off-the-cuff ideas you can charm him with. [2] X Research source He'll never get bored with your endless stream of innovative thoughts. Given the famed Aquarian humanitarian streak, it's likely a lot of your ideas involve helping others. While Geminis don't have the same motivation, they'll appreciate your drive. Don't worry if you don't have any practical plans to turn your idea into reality—he doesn't have much patience for the process anyway. He's more interested in the wild idea that would potentially turn conventional thinking upside-down."

      "content": "A Gemini guy tends to prefer more traditionally feminine women. Aquarian ladies are known as the chameleons of the fashion world, changing your look effortlessly from one day to the next. Go for light, flowing fabrics in cuts that accentuate your curves. For a date, you might opt for a longer, flowing skirt with a trim button-down or T-shirt. This combo showcases the \"mix and match\" style Aquarians enjoy so much. At the same time, make sure you leave a little something to the imagination. A Twin tends to be more conservative and won't be impressed by anything that's too revealing."

      "content": "A Gemini guy will enjoy the adventure of a thrifting treasure hunt. Aquarius women tend to have an eclectic sense of style, so it's likely you're no stranger to sifting through racks of cast-offs in search of that uncommon prize. The Twin is an enthusiastic partner in this quest—don't be surprised if he goes home with a few choice finds as well. Geminis are often attracted to well-made luxury items, but they're practical with money and don't care for the luxury price attached. He'll feel at home thrifting for bargains. This excursion also gives you a chance to showcase your creative side, which he'll find endlessly amazing and interesting. Show him how great that dull maxi skirt sparkles as a tube dress, thrown together with the vintage man's belt—he'll be in awe."

      "content": "The extroverted Gemini is more himself when surrounded by people. He's the ideal social butterfly who is more alive around people. [4] X Research source While as an Aquarius woman you can easily tolerate alone time, you also enjoy the swirl of social activities. Large-scale events give you both the opportunity to see and be seen, make new friends, and engage with diverse people. Local parties and gatherings are an obvious choice, but you might consider a larger event, such as a fantasy or sci-fi convention. Since you both love learning about other cultures, you might also check out unique cultural events, such as traveling to New Orleans for Mardi Gras."

      "title": "Both of you love to explore new places and have unusual experiences.",
      "content": "Both of you love to explore new places and have unusual experiences. Neither of you is really the dinner-and-a-movie type. Instead, plan on meeting up at a local café or pub and then going from there. Your Gemini guy feels trapped by a strict itinerary and you love the freedom to be spontaneous, so this is the perfect option for both of you. Gemini will be most attracted to someone who keeps them amused. Scavenger hunts, escape rooms, and mystery tours are also options that will keep both of you interested and excited. Twins and Water-bearers alike are known for their love of the outdoors. Since both of you have energy to burn, a refreshing hike gives you a taste of the wilderness and a wonderful bonding opportunity."

      "content": "Gemini guys are known for excitedly jumping into new things. You both enjoy learning and neither of you is shy about making mistakes to gain skills and experience. Taking on something new is a challenge that will strengthen your bond with each other. For example, you might try your hand at glass blowing or throwing pottery. Take an introductory class together and see what you can create. Since you're both active, social people, you might also consider joining a community sports league.

      "title": "Both of you are slow to settle into a committed relationship.",
      "content": "Both of you are slow to settle into a committed relationship. Gemini guys have a reputation for only staying around until they get bored, then quietly moving on to someone else. You certainly have all the traits to keep him interested long-term, but he knows himself well enough to avoid getting your hopes up. As for you, relationships tend to start as friendships and be more mental than physical affairs—meaning romance will come later, if at all. Intimacy is something difficult for both of you, which can make it hard to kick off a more romantic connection. At the same time, if you're both content with a more platonic relationship you might not even see this as a problem. Reader Poll: We asked 367 wikiHow readers what kissing style they enjoy from a Gemini Man, and 50% of them said passionate and sensual. [Take Poll] So, making a deep connection is worth the wait, Aquarius!"

      "title": "Unlike you, a Gemini guy doesn't usually stick with one thing for very long.",
      "content": "Unlike you, a Gemini guy doesn't usually stick with one thing for very long. As an Aquarius, you tend to be loyal to your favorites. You've used the same soap since childhood, but to him, that smacks of boring monotony. His willingness to abandon things simply because they're no longer exciting and unfamiliar might annoy you. He'll be drawn to you if you show patience with this peculiar trait of his. For example, he might proclaim a band his favorite and listen to them nonstop for a week. But hold off on buying tickets for their concert next month—he'll probably be on to someone else by then. Just accept this as one of his personality quirks. It's not likely you'll ever truly understand it, and that's okay."

      "content": "Both of you love traveling to offbeat and out-of-the-way locations. Ideally, you can book a flight somewhere on another continent where neither of you knows the language and have to get by on your wits. But if a far-flung excursion isn't in your budget, you can still find weird and wacky spots closer to home. Campy roadside attractions (haven't you always wanted to see the world's largest ball of yarn?) and tourist traps will also entertain you both—especially if they give you the opportunity to chat up the locals. Given that both of you are also attracted to unconventional lifestyles, it's just as likely that the two of you might decide to travel the country for a year in an old school bus you've turned into a mobile home."
