Special Research tasks are assigned by Professor Willow, and Field Research tasks are obtained by spinning PokéStps.

      "content": "Collect Rare Candies as a potential Adventure Sync reward. Adventure Sync allows Pokémon GO to track your walking distance even when the app is off. If you enable Adventure Sync, you can get weekly rewards for walking certain distances. You can collect Adventure Sync rewards at 9 a.m. local time on Mondays. If you walk 25km you can potentially get 3 Rare Candies, and if you walk 50km you can potentially get 5 Rare Candies. However, you can also potentially get a bundle of Silver Pinap Berries or a special Egg. You can avoid getting an Egg by keeping your Egg slots full in your Pokémon Box, which would then leave you with a chance of getting Rare Candies or Silver Pinap Berries for your Adventure Sync rewards. To enable Adventure Sync, tap on your avatar image in the bottom-left corner and tap the button that says Enable Adventure Sync in Settings for more rewards! . Click through any pop-ups your phone gives you, making sure to give Pokémon GO the permissions it asks for when they come up. To claim your Adventure Sync rewards, go to your profile and tap on the mystery berries under the \"Rewards\" banner once you've achieved them."
