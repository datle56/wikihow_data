      "content": "The side detection system scans your blind spots for you. When a cyclist passes your vehicle or someone walks into your blind spot, does something happen in your car? If your mirror lights up, you hear a warning chime, or your screen displays a camera, that’s your side detection system. It’s designed to warn you when a vehicle, cyclist, or pedestrian enters your blind spot. [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If nothing happens when something enters your blind spot or your chimes/warnings are going off when there’s nothing there, your side detection system isn’t working. In some newer vehicles, the service side detection system can also be adjusted to automatically turn away from collisions or stop your vehicle for you in emergencies. Not every car has one of these systems. In fact, most vehicles built before 2016-2018 don’t have one of these systems, and a lot of newer foreign vehicles don’t either. The majority of modern American vehicles have a service side detection system (or something similar to it under a different name—usually “blind spot awareness system” or “blind spot warning system”)."

      "content": "Sensors, radar, or cameras monitor the sides of your car. Every side detection system works basically the same way—your vehicle is equipped with some sort of radar or sensor that constantly scans for objects or vehicles entering your blind spots. Older vehicles used literal cameras for this instead of sensors or radar. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source When a vehicle or object is detected, you’ll get some kind of warning. It could be a chime, a light on your dashboard or mirror, or all of the above. If these chimes or lights aren’t popping on when a vehicle passes you, the detection system isn’t working as intended."

      "content": "Contact a dealership to ask about recalls and repairs. Side detection systems have historically been prone to software problems. If your system isn’t working correctly, contact a local dealership. Ask them if there are any recalls for the side detection system. If there aren’t, ask them what it’d take to reset or repair your system and take it in for repairs. [3] X Research source The side detection system is almost entirely software-based. There aren’t really any mechanical components. As a result, it’s not quite something you can replace or swap out if you’re a gearhead."

      "content": "Clean your mirrors and remove any debris. Every vehicle is different, but most of these systems are built into the side mirrors. As a result, your system may not work if your mirrors are dirty. Start by cleaning your mirrors with glass cleaner or white vinegar and water. Then, remove any leaves, dirt or mud you find packed around or on your side mirrors. This may fix any issues you’re having with the side detection system. [4] X Research source Do you see any small sensors or lenses under or inside of your side mirrors? If so, these are almost certainly your side detection system sensors. Clean them off the same way you clean your mirrors."

      "content": "Plug an OBD2 scanner into the dash and reset the computer. Many side detection systems are integrated with your vehicle’s computer, which means you can reset the dashboard light with an OBD2 scanner. Locate the OBD2 port under your steering wheel and insert an OBD2 scanner. Power the scanner on and look to see if there’s an error code for your side detection system. If there is an error, try resetting the code. If the error doesn’t come back, cleaning the mirror fixed the problem. If the error does come back, contact a local dealer and explain that you need them to fix your side detection system."

      "content": "Mirror lights or warning chimes don’t come on If cyclists, pedestrians, or other vehicles pass nearby or enter your blind spot and nothing happens, your detection system isn’t working as intended. It should automatically alert you whenever something enters your blind spot, so the fact that it isn’t signaling anything means it’s not functioning correctly. [6] X Research source Check your vehicle’s computer settings on the main dash screen. It’s possible that you accidentally turned the system off if it never comes on."

These warnings should turn off automatically once the obstruction is gone. [7] X Research source Don’t assume the system is busted if the warnings come on in whacky weather. Snow and heavy rain can confuse the sensors sometimes."

If a sensor isn’t working correctly or the software is buggy, your side detection system won’t work correctly. Either the program needs to be debugged or patched, or the sensor needs to be cleaned or replaced. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Damage to your mirrors The side detection system is almost always built into the side mirrors. As a result, if your mirrors get knocked off, hit, or generally damaged, it can mess with your side detection. Once the mirrors are repaired, ask the mechanic or dealership to reset the detection system and things should go back to normal. [9] X Research source During heavy rain or snow, water can get into the mirror. That water might cause your side detection system to not function correctly."
