      "title": "4 is associated with creation and divine order.",
      "content": "4 is associated with creation and divine order. The number 444 itself doesn’t appear in the Bible, but the number 4 does many times. It is often used to symbolize God’s creations and the divine order of our universe. It may also be a reminder to bow before God's glory: as Ezekiel 44:4 says, Then the man brought me through the north gateway to the front of the Temple; I looked and saw that the glory of the Lord filled the Temple of the Lord and I fell to the ground with my face in the dust."

      "title": "4 may symbolize God’s omnipresence.",
      "content": "4 may symbolize God’s omnipresence. As 4 is evocative of the 4 winds, the 4 directions, and the 4 days it took to create the Earth, it may represent God’s eternal presence. He is always with us, in every corner of the world."

      "title": "444 is a sign of angelic presence.",
      "content": "444 is a sign of angelic presence. 444 may also be considered an angel number, or a message from God passed to you via your guardian angels. The four winds are said to carry the messages of the angels, so 444 means your angels are nearby, protecting you. “Think of the 4’s vibrational or energetic signature as the 'bridge between worlds,’” says Arbeau—in other words, the bridge between God’s kingdom and the earth. “It allows spiritual energy to slow down its vibration enough to take on physical realm qualities—whether that’s an entity, message, or otherwise.” The Hebrew word for \"angel\" ( mal'akh ) has a numerical value of 444, which is why the number is often associated with the presence of angels."

      "content": "God created earth in 4 days. According to Genesis, God completed the creation of the earth in 4 days—including the 4 cardinal directions and 4 winds. Essentially, the earth is constructed of 4 quadrants. “The 4 is all about building a foundation, symbolized by the square and its 4 sides,” as Arbeau says. Moreover, there are 4 rivers flowing out of the Garden of Eden, the place where the first humans lived in harmony with God."

      "content": "Number 444 corresponds to the Hebrew alach , which means “prosper.” Though the literal number 444 doesn’t appear in the Bible, the number 444 corresponds to the Hebrew word alach , which means to go on, to advance, and to prosper. This word appears in the Bible in multiple spots, notably in Jeremiah 29:11, which says, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope.”"

      "content": "The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse appear in Revelation. The final book of the Bible is Revelation and says much about the end of the world. In Revelation 6:1-8, the four horsemen are said to signify the end times. [2] X Research source The first horseman is a conqueror with a bow and crown and rides a white horse. Scholars believe this horseman signifies Christ or the antichrist. The second horseman wields a great sword and rides a red horse, symbolizing war and bloodshed. The third horseman carries a balance scale and rides a black horse, and symbolizes famine. The fourth horseman rides a pale horse and is identified as Death."

      "title": "Remember God is always with you.",
      "content": "Remember God is always with you. 444 is a sign of God’s eternal omnipresence. He is everywhere, forever, and He is watching over you, as a shepherd watches his flock. No matter where you go, whether north, east, south, or west, God will be there. You can never stray too far from His love and mercy! Even in times of fear and need, trust that God will provide, as it says in Isaiah 44:4: For I will pour water on the thirsty ground and send streams coursing through the parched earth. I will pour my Spirit into your descendants and my blessing on your children. They shall sprout like grass on the prairie, like willows alongside creeks."

      "title": "Some people believe 444 is a warning or an omen.",
      "content": "Some people believe 444 is a warning or an omen. As the four horsemen signify the end times, 444 could be a sign that a major change is around the corner. On the other hand, the 4 gospels represent good news, so the change that is around the corner may be good. As Arbeau says, “Oftentimes, [4] is a message that what you have been working on actively manifesting is coming to physical reality soon.” So if you’ve been praying for something in particular, it might be just around the corner! But whether the change is a blessing or not, you’ll likely need to prepare and rely on the Lord for courage and strength to get through. Take heart: remember you have God and your guardian angels looking out for you and holding you close, always!"

      "content": "444 may signify a spiritual awakening. As 4 represents the link between the spiritual and material worlds, seeing the number 444 may signify that major spiritual transformation is on the horizon. This spiritual growth may occur as a result of the changes foretold by the number 444: in times of flux, you may be forced to reevaluate your faith and rely on the Lord more than ever before. The experience is sure to teach you more about yourself and your relationship with God."

      "content": "444 is a sign of divine encouragement. Not only is God always with you, but He is cheering you on and supporting you through life’s many trials and tribulations. Don’t lose faith , but instead rely on God, even when you cannot see Him or feel discouraged. He’s there, and He loves you. Remember to rest on the Sabbath, as the fourth commandment instructs. Take this day to relinquish the grip the material world can sometimes have, and instead, reflect on the Lord’s goodness and on your own spiritual well-being."
