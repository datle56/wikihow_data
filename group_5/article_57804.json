Then, open Steam, right-click on the Properties option, and click on the “Launch Options” part of the “General” menu. In the box, paste what you copied from the installer window. GOG: Create a new Notepad file with the following text: start \"\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GOG Galaxy\\Games\\Stardew Valley\\StardewModdingAPI.exe\" . Save this file as start.bat . Then, open up the GOG client, open up the settings for Stardew Valley , and click on “Manage installation” followed by “Configure.” Toggle the “Custom executables/arguments” box, click the “Add another executable/arguments” option, and choose the start.bat file that you made earlier. After selecting this file, click on the “Default executable” option. Xbox app: Click the ... button on the Stardew Valley profile, along with the “Browse…” button within the “Files” tab. Once you’ve opened the Stardew Valley > Content folder, copy the complete file path. Install SMAPI as you normally would, but paste the file path when the installation window prompts you to.
