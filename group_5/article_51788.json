      "content": "Clean the engine with the proper degreaser thoroughly before beginning. Having your engine clean allows you to better locate any leaks or worn parts. It also makes the job less messy overall. Never clean or work on your engine while it is hot. Keep in mind that the degreaser and oils you are washing off of your engine can kill your grass and pose an environmental threat. This should be done somewhere that is properly set up to drain and filter the chemicals used."

This may be stamped directly on the engine (either on the cylinder head, valve covers, or intake manifold) and sometimes listed in the owner’s manual specifications. You can also use a service manual to determine firing order. This will be necessary to know because later you will need to check your number one cylinder (the one that fires first in the firing order)."
