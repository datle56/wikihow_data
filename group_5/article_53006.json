      "content": "Invite your friend to join the group. This might feel hard if your friend has made occasions with your other friends uncomfortable in the past. However, stay positive. If your friend knows they’re wanted in a situation, they may be less likely to act out of jealousy. [1] X Research source Don’t remind your friend of times they may have made social situations uncomfortable in the past. This may make them feel more insecure about re-entering a situation like that. Emphasize that it’s their choice. They don’t need to feel obligated to hang out if the idea makes them uncomfortable. If your friend has been cruel or manipulative to your other friends in the past, inviting them to join the group may do more harm than good."

I miss you when you’re not around.”"

      "title": "Choose an activity that will be comfortable for them.",
      "content": "Choose an activity that will be comfortable for them. If you truly want to include your friend, make sure you invite them to do something that they would enjoy. Otherwise, you could end up fueling their feelings of insecurity and jealousy. [4] X Research source Choose a place that’s easy for your friend to get to, and where they feel comfortable. For example, don’t choose somewhere that is close to you and your other friends but a long bus ride from where your friend lives. Pick something that you already know they enjoy. For example, don’t invite them over to play a game that your other friends know but your one friend doesn’t. If you’re going to go out to eat, you can ask your one friend to pick the restaurant. You want your friend to feel comfortable, but you don't want them to have all of the control. Make sure you're not being manipulated into simply doing whatever this one friend wants to do."

      "content": "Be yourself when combining friend groups. If you haven’t spent much time with your one friend and the rest of your friends together, you might feel a little uncomfortable at first. Stay true to yourself. Don’t worry about how your friends may expect you to behave. [5] X Research source If you have inside jokes with a certain friend, you can acknowledge them without excluding the others. You can simply say, “I’m sorry. That was just a reference to something funny that happened to us last week.” Or, if it makes sense, you could take the time to explain the joke. If a friend accuses you of not acting genuinely, you can explain yourself. For example, if a friend says, “I thought you didn’t like those kinds of movies,” you can explain that, “I actually have started watching movies like that recently and I do like them. I guess I just haven’t talked to you about it.”"
