    {
      "title": "Choose a genre for your story.",
      "content": "Choose a genre for your story. The genre you choose to write in will affect the kind of characters and plot you'll create. Pick a genre that you’re comfortable writing in and passionate about. For instance, if you're interested in the strange and unusual, you might want to focus on horror or science fiction. Romance and fan fiction are two very popular genres on Wattpad. Focus on one of these for the widest audience."

    {
      "title": "Write profiles for your characters.",
      "content": "Write profiles for your characters. Doing character profiles can help you create strong, vivid characters. Start by profiling your main character. What do they look like? What’s their personality? What are their dreams, goals, and fears? What significant events happened in their past? Once you've profiled your main character, move on to the supporting characters. Your story doesn’t need to include all the details you put in the profiles. However, the more you know about your characters, the easier it will be to write them. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Figure out your basic plot.",
      "content": "Figure out your basic plot. Some authors like to have their plot completely figured out before they start writing. Others start with the basics and fill in the rest as they write. Many fall somewhere in the middle. All are valid approaches! Start with a simple plot outline and go from there. [2] X Research source A great way to start thinking about the plot is to think about questions you want your story to answer. For example, the Lord of the Rings trilogy answers questions like, \"What happens when the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of a hobbit?” and \"What happens when friends embark on an exciting and dangerous adventure together?\""

    {
      "title": "Write the first draft.",
      "content": "Write the first draft. The goal of your first draft is to get the foundation of your story on paper (physical or digital). You’re not necessarily trying to write a perfect story at this point. Focus on getting your characters on the page and writing out the events you want to happen. Don’t focus too much on grammar and spelling at this stage. Correct basic stuff as you go, but you'll do intensive editing later. Wattpad stories can be different lengths, from novelettes (about 7500 words) to full-length novels (over 40,000 words). Write as much as you need to tell your story without padding it. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Review and edit your story.",
      "content": "Review and edit your story. After you’ve written your first draft, go through your story, and read it carefully. Correct grammar and spelling mistakes. Look out for parts of the story that don’t make sense and revise them. Add character detail, context, and subplots, as needed. Ask friends and family to read your story, too. They can give you important feedback as you make your revisions. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Complete your final draft.",
      "content": "Complete your final draft. Improvise your edits and continue to hone your story until it feels complete to you. It should have a clear beginning, middle, and end. All of the chapters are important, but make sure you begin with engaging chapters to really hook your readers. Polish any outstanding grammar and spelling errors. Focus on making the final product as professional as possible."

    {
      "title": "Upload an interesting profile image.",
      "content": "Upload an interesting profile image. Try to use an image that captures your writing style. For example, if you write horror fiction, go for something dark and sinister. If you write romance, aim for something dreamy or whimsical. Use a high-quality image with decent resolution, so that it looks crisp and professional. [5] X Research source The image doesn't have to be of yourself. It can be any cool picture you've taken!"

      "title": "Write an intriguing profile description.",
      "content": "Write an intriguing profile description. Think of your profile description almost like a cover letter. Write something brief but engaging that draws readers in. Don't forget to include a few interesting facts about yourself, as well! [6] X Research source You could write something like, \"I'm a part-time writer, a full-time dreamer who explores reveries, hallucinations, nightmares, and visions. During the day, I moonlight as a psychology student at Berkeley.\""

    {
      "title": "Upload engaging, high-resolution covers for your stories.",
      "content": "Upload engaging, high-resolution covers for your stories. Many people will pick up a book just because they find the cover art interesting, and it's no different on Wattpad! A great cover should stand out with bold colors and compelling images. Pick imagery that represents an important part of your story (without spoiling it of course). If you have friends that are good artists, you can ask them to design a cover for your story. Make sure to give them credit on your profile. [7] X Research source You can find high-resolution stock photos on websites like Pexels and Shutterstock. Most of these websites aren't free to use, but you may find the fees worth it. Don't neglect the font when designing your cover. The font color and size should make the title stand out, and the font style needs to match the tone of the book. For example, if you're writing a humorous story or one aimed at younger audiences, you might be able to opt for a quirky font; for a more serious book, however, choose a more sophisticated font."

Spend some time brainstorming some ideas before making a decision. [8] X Research source Use action words and strong verbs in your titles to get attention, like \"Things Fall Apart\" or \"Breaking Through Barriers.\" Try something mysterious to interest readers, like \"Caves of Crystal and Blood\" or \"The Light in the Ruins.\" Consider a punchy, one-word title, like \"Torrential\" or \"Wanderlust.\" [9] X Research source"

Use keywords that accurately describe what your stories are about. Mention genre, subject matter, main themes, and any other relevant tags and categories that will get your work to the right audience. For instance, if you write war fiction, use tags like \"history,\" “WWII,” and “war.\" [11] X Research source"

Depending on the nature of the content, you could use tags like \"strong language,\" \"mature readers,\" \"adult fiction,\" and \"sexual content.\" If you're writing for young people specifically, use tags like \"YA,\" \"teen fiction,\" and \"young adult fantasy\" to reach the right audience."

Break up your story into smaller chunks, such as chapters or acts. Choose a schedule to upload your story, such as once a month or once a week. [12] X Research source Make sure you don’t miss an upload date, as this will hurt your number of readers. Life happens, and if you do miss a promised update on rare occasions, it probably won't mean the end of your Wattpad popularity. However, you should avoid doing this routinely as it can cause your readers to lose trust in you. Try to make sure your updates seem worth the wait each time, and especially when you have to take a longer break than usual. If you write your story before you start uploading it, you won’t have to worry about struggling to keep up. [13] X Research source"

Some readers might post criticism of your story, constructive or not. Accept any feedback you get graciously unless it’s insulting. Thank your readers for any polite comments they share, regardless of whether those comments are praise, constructive criticism, or a combination of both.
