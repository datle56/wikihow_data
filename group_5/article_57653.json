      "title": "You have powerful intuition.",
      "content": "You have powerful intuition. The 8th house represents your approach towards life, death, and the deep hidden truths in the world. When it comes to evaluating the circumstances and people around you, it might seem as though you have a real sixth sense about what's really happening just below the surface. The planet Mars gives you the motivation to act on that intuition to transform the world and the lives of those around you. People born with Mars in the 8th house often have no problem easily understanding other people's motives and why they do the things they do. There's a danger to having such powerful intuition. If you trust your intuition too much, you could be drawn into speculation and gambling, which could cause you problems financially."

      "title": "You embrace challenges and approach them head-on.",
      "content": "You embrace challenges and approach them head-on. Having Mars in the house of transformation means that you aren't afraid of even the most profound changes that could potentially uproot your entire life. Mars gives you an understanding that change is a part of life and not something you should back down from or be afraid of. You also tend to have a pretty strong survival instinct. Even if something seems scary or painful, you know that you can do what it takes to get through it. You're unlikely to stumble if obstacles arise that keep you from achieving your goals. You recognize that anything worth having is worth working for and you're not afraid to put a little effort into the process, especially if your goal is related to your personal growth."

      "title": "You are proactive when dealing with financial matters.",
      "content": "You are proactive when dealing with financial matters. The 8th house can also tell you something about how you handle shared resources—the things that you get from or share with someone else. Mars in the 8th house gives you an intuitive understanding of how to manage those resources so that everyone benefits. The flip side of this is that you might occasionally take too many risks. You'll have a more peaceful financial life if you can rein in the impulsive urge you sometimes get to act on your instincts."

      "title": "You have a strong drive to get to the bottom of things.",
      "content": "You have a strong drive to get to the bottom of things. Mars is the planet of action and passion. In the 8th house, it means that you have a natural ability to uncover hidden truths. You're not afraid of diving deep and might feel drawn to psychology or the occult to satisfy your desire to understand the real meaning of the world around you. This innate drive means people born with Mars in the 8th house tend to excel in careers that require constant analysis and investigation, such as counseling or detective work. You do have to be careful not to let their emotions get too tangled up in their work and destroy their objectivity. People born with Mars in the 8th house aren't afraid to do the deep dive on themselves either!"

      "title": "You likely have strong sexual energy.",
      "content": "You likely have strong sexual energy. The 8th house is normally ruled by Scorpio, which is perhaps the sexiest sign in the zodiac. When Mars is in the 8th house, it turns that sexual energy into something active and magnetic. Sex for you is an intense experience, both physically and emotionally. These natives often enjoy experimenting with kink or with alternative lifestyles. Their drive for truth can also lead them to explore taboo practices that other people might look at sideways."

      "title": "You can find it hard to trust others.",
      "content": "You can find it hard to trust others. You have a fear of betrayal that makes it difficult for you to believe that other people truly have your best interests at heart. You might assume that they're more self-interested or that they won't hesitate to leave you behind when the going gets tough. Either way, it takes a lot for you to let your guard down. [3] X Research source An aspect of this is that, if you were born with Mars in the 8th house, you might have a hard time opening up to others, especially when it comes to sharing your problems or difficulties. These natives have a much more enjoyable and satisfying life when they learn how to express their feelings more directly rather than pushing them down."

      "title": "You can be prone to jealousy.",
      "content": "You can be prone to jealousy. The 8th house is naturally ruled by Scorpio, a sign that's known for its jealous streak. With Mars, the planet of action, seated here, you might find that feelings of jealousy creep in if you don't know where your romantic partner is or what they're doing. This can start with a vague sense of discomfort but you could become increasingly agitated if you're unable to get the emotional validation you need from your partner. You might also project jealousy or envy about the accomplishments of others, particularly those that involve spiritual growth and transformation."

      "title": "You might be troubled by a vague sense of fear and doom.",
      "content": "You might be troubled by a vague sense of fear and doom. This sense of fear seems to permeate everything for people who were born with Mars in the 8th house. Although this placement gives you really strong intuition and passion, you might not fully experience these until later in life. You have to get over your fears (at least to some extent) before you'll feel comfortable following your gut. Some of this is also related to your difficulty trusting people. You might not find it easy to trust yourself either, which can lead you to doubt that your intuition will lead you down the right path. With wisdom and experience, you'll gradually learn to trust yourself more so that you can transform into the person you were meant to be."

      "title": "Mars brings a period of intense change and transformation.",
      "content": "Mars brings a period of intense change and transformation. Regardless of the rest of your chart, when Mars enters the 8th house, get ready for spiritual and psychological intensity. If you were born with Mars in the 8th house, this period will only be intensified. During this time, you could have fundamental realizations that shake the foundation of your beliefs. This can be extremely disruptive for people who prefer to stick to their routine and dislike confronting long-held beliefs. Spiritual and psychological enlightenment is possible if you embrace these changes and shifts in perspective and are open to learning and growing, both as an individual and in your relationships with others."

      "title": "Mars in retrograde emphasizes your need to be introspective.",
      "content": "Mars in retrograde emphasizes your need to be introspective. When a planet appears to be moving backward through the sky, it's said to be in retrograde. [4] X Research source If Mars enters the 8th house in retrograde, all that focus on change and transformation turns inward. You're more likely to have profound realizations about yourself that could potentially send your life in another direction. As with Mars in transit, the introspective nature of Mars in retrograde can be really upsetting for some people—especially those who are uncomfortable putting their own psyche under the microscope. Those born with Mars in the 8th house won't have as much of a problem with this because they aren't as afraid to take a long, hard look at themselves and throw away thought patterns that are no longer working for them."

      "content": "You feel strong, transformative sexual energy. Synastry deals with astrological compatibility based on the positions of another person's planets in your chart. [5] X Research source If someone's Mars falls into your 8th house, you can expect to have a passionate and intense connection with them. You'll likely feel safe dealing with some pretty heavy emotional challenges with each other. [6] X Research source Expect these relationships to be extremely emotionally charged. They can be volatile in some respects, but that volatility can also lead both of you to profound realizations about yourselves."
