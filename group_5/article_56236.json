      "title": "When writing a resignation letter",
      "content": "When writing a resignation letter Including the phrase “It was a pleasure working with you” keeps your resignation formal and is good to add if you want to maintain a good relationship with whatever company you’re leaving. Many people who voluntarily leave their position will include this line to make their resignation letter a bit warmer and more friendly. For example: [1] X Research source “It has been a pleasure to work at the Smith Company for the last 5 years.” “It was a pleasure working with you and the team, and I consider my time at this company to be one of the highlights of my career.” “It has been a pleasure working with you, and I feel that I have gained valuable knowledge that will help me in the future.”"

      "content": "When celebrating a special event or work anniversary If your office is throwing a party to celebrate an achievement or a special anniversary, it’s not uncommon for some people to share a few words of gratitude and appreciation toward their colleagues and overall company. Telling everyone that it’s been a pleasure working with them lets them know how much you value them and the work you get to do together. In this kind of situation, it makes more sense to say, “It has been a pleasure” since saying, “It was a pleasure” can make it sound like you’re leaving your job or won’t be working with your colleagues in the future. “It has been such a pleasure to work with you all. It’s amazing what we can achieve as a team.” “It’s been a pleasure to work with everyone here, and I’m truly amazed at seeing the great things we’ve done together.” “Happy 25th anniversary to this amazing company, and it has truly been a pleasure to be able to work with all of you.”"
