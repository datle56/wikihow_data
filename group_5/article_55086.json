      "content": "Create social media accounts for your Twitch. You can repurpose a personal social media account if you want, but it looks more professional to have a social media account just for your Twitch stream. This isn't to say you have to only post about Twitch, but a good rule of thumb is to keep your posts on your streaming social media relevant to gaming or your stream. Some of the most popular social media sites for streamers are Twitter/X, TikTok, and YouTube. You can also make a Facebook page, Tumblr, and Instagram, depending on what viewer market you're targeting. Due to recent volatility with Twitter/X, some users are switching to alternative microblogging sites like Bluesky."

      "content": "Save clips and VODs to post to YouTube and TikTok. Short form content is very popular with TikTok and YouTube shorts. If something funny, cool, or exciting happens during your stream, take a clip of it and post it to TikTok or YouTube. Make sure to use hashtags and relevant keywords to get your clip noticed (and so it could potentially go viral). While Twitch can save VODs (video on demand), you should upload them to YouTube in order to reach a broader audience and to ensure they don't get erased."

      "content": "Pick a game to play based on some specific parameters. Streamers usually play a variety of games, but selecting some of your first games to play to help bring in viewers can be difficult. There are a few things to take into consideration when picking a game to play: Pick a game that you like. Playing a game that you hate simply because it's popular will be obvious to the viewers you have. Pick a new game. New releases will have more viewers tuning in to watch, so there's a higher likelihood they will click on your stream. Pick a game that is popular, but not too popular. When Twitch users look for gaming content to watch, the streams are sorted by viewer count. If you decide to stream Minecraft or Fortnite exclusively, you might have a hard time getting noticed. Use TwitchTracker to select games that have a similar average viewer count to what you usually get. Pick a game you're good at (or really bad at). Most users like to watch streamers play games that they're really good at, but if you're going for a comedy angle you can try to play a game you know you'll be bad at. Keep in mind that these tips are guidelines. There's no secret formula to picking the right game, but if you notice that you're not getting many viewers, switching up the game you're playing could help draw in more watchers."

      "content": "Make sure to enjoy what you're doing. While some streamers are popular for getting angry or being negative, most people want to watch someone having fun. If you're not enjoying a game that you're streaming, don't be afraid to switch it up every once and a while—your viewers will enjoy watching you have fun and have fun alongside you."

      "content": "Make a schedule and stick to it. Consistency is key so the viewers you have will know when to expect that you're live, and so new viewers will know when to find you. Don't push yourself to stream more than you're able, but you should try to stream three to four times a week if you can."

      "content": "Talk with your chat and engage with them. Make sure you're checking messages in chat and responding to questions and comments. Most users don't want to ask a question or make a suggestion and then simply get ignored. You should also include your viewers in your stream—if you're playing a game with decision-making, ask your chat which option they think you should pick. If you're stuck, someone in your chat might have the answer to help you progress."

      "title": "Make sure to be yourself.",
      "content": "Make sure to be yourself. It is easier than ever to get into streaming these days, so being yourself and staying true to who you are will help you stand out among the rest. Don't try to emulate the personality or brand of other streamers—your viewers are watching you for who you are and what kind of content you create."

Not every single stream will have a huge stand out moment (a big reveal in a story game, a cool headshot in a first-person shooter, or a decisive win in a competitive game) but strive to make the kind of content that you think is fun to watch."

      "content": "Invest in quality streaming tools and assets. While having top-of-the-line equipment doesn't ensure you'll get a ton of viewers, it will make your stream easier to watch and allow viewers to understand you better. Here are a few tips to improving the quality of your stream: Get a good microphone. You don't need to start off with a fancy mic that uses an audio interface, but having a good-quality USB microphone to start will make your streams easier to listen to. A good USB mic can help block out background noise and pick up your voice more accurately, as well as avoid peaking if you tend to be very animated during stream. Invest in a quality webcam. If you use a webcam, invest in one that is good quality and can record in high resolution (or even 4K). Some webcams allow for a lot of customization, but simply starting with a good external webcam that can auto-focus is a huge step above a built-in webcam. Buy or create quality stream assets. There are many services out there that sell stream asset packs, but you can also make your own if you know some basics of graphic design. You might even consider commissioning a set of custom assets, though this might be costly for a brand new streamer. If you're a vtuber or pngtuber (i.e. you use an animated or static drawn image as an avatar instead of your actual face), get a quality avatar made for you or make one yourself, if you're artistic. Write interesting and compelling stream titles. You can improve the quality of your stream titles by introducing some SEO elements: use keywords, appeal to emotion, or use a call-to-action."

      "content": "Make a pre-stream checklist to ensure you're ready to go live. Your pre-stream checklist can have anything on it that you want, but some common tasks are to make sure your game is ready, ensure your webcam and microphone are working, have your \"going live\" Tweets and/or Discord messages ready to go, and to get food and water before you go live."

      "content": "Promote your stream on social media, Reddit, or in games. There are specific subreddits dedicated to promoting your Twitch stream, such as r/TwitchIntros or r/VGStreams . You can also add \"TTV\" to your username in games to let people know that you stream (though make sure your username also includes your Twitch name). Most games and Reddits don't allow you to spam advertisements. Be respectful of ToS when promoting."

      "content": "Ask friends or family to watch your stream. Just like with promoting online, don't pester or spam your friends or family to watch—simply send the link and ask them to tune in if they're interested. Be aware that if you ask friends or family to watch that you may want to consider the content of your streams (i.e. don't invite your parents to watch your stream if you talk about things or act in a way that you don't want them to see)."

While this might not be a great way to gain viewers if you have little to no viewers already, if you've got a handful of regulars this could be a good way to expand your audience.

      "content": "Pick a good time to stream. While there are multiple opinions on when Twitch's peak hours are, most streamers are streaming at night. You don't want to stream in the middle of the day when Twitch's viewership is low, but you want to avoid the middle of peak hours so you have a chance of standing out in searches. While picking an ideal time can help get viewers, make sure you're first and foremost picking a time that works for your schedule."

The brand can be based around anything, but make sure it's unique and relates to you or your stream—for example, if you really like ducks and viewers can see your collection of duck figurines behind you while you stream, you might make a logo that's a duck and call your followers the Duck Pond."

If it's within your budget, ask your ISP to upgrade you to a high-speed Internet plan with a decent amount of bandwidth. You should avoid using a mobile hotspot , and invest in a mesh router if your stream room doesn't get a good signal."
