Say, “Lately, our relationship hasn’t seemed as strong as it was in the past. I love you so much, so I want us to start prioritizing our marriage.” Schedule time for your partner to spend alone with you, as well as time they can spend with the children.

      "content": "Create a united front when it comes to rules and discipline. Rules and discipline are a big cause of issues in a blended family. Your stepchildren may not see you as a parental figure yet, so enforcing rules can be hard. As a family, create a set of rules and consequences for all of the children in your household. In the beginning, it’s best for you to discipline your kids, while your partner discipline’s theirs. [7] X Trustworthy Source Child Mind Institute Nonprofit organization providing evidence-based care for children with mental health and learning disorders and their families Go to source You could tell your partner, “I’m having a lot of trouble enforcing the rules when you’re not around. I think it’s best for you to be the disciplinarian until the kids start seeing me as a parent.” For instance, you might agree that the kids will treat others nicely, will use respectful language, and will respect other people’s property. If your stepchild says a curse word to you, say something like, “Remember what your dad said about using respectful language?” Leave it there and let your partner handle it when they come home. Once your stepchildren view you as a parental figure, you’ll likely be able to take on a disciplinary role. In general, it usually takes 3 to 5 years for stepchildren to fully accept you as a parent. If they were teens when you married their parent, it may be more difficult for them to see you this way.

We all need to respect the house rules.” Leave it at that. Then, talk to your partner about what happened. If you become a step parent to a very young child, they may accept you as a parental figure after a few years. At that point, you might start disciplining them.
