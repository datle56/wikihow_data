      "content": "Add ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a snack bag. After adding the baking soda to the larger sandwich bag, pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a smaller sealable bag like a snack size Ziploc bag. Then seal the zip on the bag completely. Make sure that the snack size bag in which you put the vinegar is smaller than the bag that you put the baking soda in. Leave a little bit of air inside the snack bag of vinegar, as opposed to pressing it before sealing and letting the air escape. You need to initially separate the vinegar and baking soda because they react almost instantly, which means that if you poured them in together, you wouldn't have time to seal the bag before the pressure builds. Adding them in separately ensures that the reaction in the bag will be able to build up to an explosion."

      "content": "Punch the snack bag to release the vinegar. Once you seal the larger bag, place the bag on a surface that is either outside or can be easily cleaned. Then hit or punch the snack bag inside the sandwich bag. Because you left some air inside the snack bag, the pressure of your punch should open up the seal of the bag slightly to let the vinegar escape into the larger sandwich bag. If punching the bag doesn't partially open the seal, use your fingers to try to pinch the sides of the snack bag of vinegar and pull the seal partially open without opening the larger sandwich bag."

      "content": "Jiggle the bag and toss it down. Once you have partially opened the seal of the snack bag of vinegar, give the bag a good shake to allow some of the vinegar to escape into the larger, sealed sandwich bag of baking soda. Once you have jiggled the bag and see the vinegar touch the baking soda, toss the bag down onto an easily cleanable surface."

      "content": "Place warm water and vinegar inside a sealable bag. Another good way of making a bomb bag is to wrap baking soda inside paper towel and place it in a sandwich bag of vinegar. The baking soda gradually mixes with the vinegar, working in a similar way as using two bags, though easier to activate. To begin, place ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of warm water inside a snack sized bag."

To make the small pack of baking soda, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in the middle of a 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 cm) square of paper towel. Then fold the sides of the paper towel in to make a sort of parcel that holds the baking soda. The satchel of baking soda doesn't have to be completely foolproof, but it should be able to sit without the sides folding down and the baking soda pouring out."

      "content": "Add a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda to a sandwich bag. An easy way to make an effective bomb bag is to add detergent to the baking soda in the bomb bag, which acts as a retardant for the chemical reaction so that you have time to seal the bag before the baking soda and vinegar react. Begin making the bomb bag by adding ¼ cup (4.78 ml) of baking soda to a sealable sandwich bag."

Even though the detergent slows down the chemical reaction, it's still essential to zip the bag at once so that the pressure can build inside the bag. Not closing the bag in time can cause a significantly smaller explosion or it can cause the fizzing reaction to happen before the closing of the bag, so that even when you close the bag it won't explode."
