      "content": "They can tell him to stay out of your room for you. It’s always good to have your parent or guardian on your side, so tell them how you’ve been feeling and what your brother has been doing. Say something like, “My brother has been coming into my room when I’m trying to study and it’s distracting.” Or, “I don’t like it when my brother goes into my room when I’m not home.” You could also hold a family meeting to talk to your parents and your brother at the same time."

      "title": "If he’s old enough, he might listen to you.",
      "content": "If he’s old enough, he might listen to you. Sit down with your brother and tell him not to come into your room when you’re not there or when you’re busy. Try to take step a back and focus on understanding that he is following you so he can be like you. By realizing he is just trying to find his way in the world and is looking for a role model, you can cultivate an incredible, lasting friendship and mentorship with your brother. You could try something like, “You wouldn’t like it if I went through your stuff, right? So please don’t do that to me.” Or, “If I ask you to leave me alone, it’s because I have work to do.”"

      "title": "If your brother constantly barges in, try setting boundaries.",
      "content": "If your brother constantly barges in, try setting boundaries. Ask him to knock on the door if it’s closed, then wait for you to tell him to come in. [1] X Research source Younger kids might have some trouble with this, but older kids should be able to do this no problem. You can ask your parents to help you enforce this. Whenever you try to set boundaries, make sure to speak with kindness. Even if he is bothering you and annoying you, remember he is doing this because he wants to follow your lead and be a part of your world! Talk with respect and lead by example."

      "title": "If your door doesn’t lock, ask your parents to help you install one.",
      "content": "If your door doesn’t lock, ask your parents to help you install one. If your parents are okay with it, it’s a great way to keep your brother out of your room whenever you don’t want him there. [2] X Research source This is a good idea if your brother is going into your room when you’re not home. Your parents might not be comfortable with you putting a lock on your door if you don’t have one already. Try to talk to them about how you want to keep your brother out and how a lock would help you do this. If you can’t put a lock on your door, try using a piece of furniture to block the doorway instead. It’s not perfect, but it works!"

      "title": "This will keep him out when you don’t want him there.",
      "content": "This will keep him out when you don’t want him there. If you’re okay with it, you can set aside some time for your brother to come and hang out in your room with you, like after school or on the weekend. [3] X Research source You two could hang out and play video games, do a board game, or read comic books together."

      "title": "Hanging out in your free time can keep him out of your room when you're busy.",
      "content": "Hanging out in your free time can keep him out of your room when you're busy. If he’s bugging you when you’re trying to do schoolwork or interrupting your time with friends, ask him to wait until you’re free. [4] X Research source You could say something like, “Hey, I’m super busy right now. Could we play video games in like an hour instead?” Or, “We can hang out for 20 minutes, but then I’ve got stuff to do.”"

      "content": "Get your brother to leave your room by annoying him or freaking him out. You could try pretending you’re a zombie, dancing around the room, or making your voice super deep and creepy. [5] X Research source Don’t try to hurt or scare your brother—just creep him out a little so he doesn’t want to come in the room as much. Keep in mind, if your brother is little, he might think that you’re playing!"

      "title": "If you can’t keep your brother out, you can keep him out of your stuff.",
      "content": "If you can’t keep your brother out, you can keep him out of your stuff. Put your most precious items, like action figures, money, or collectables, into a drawer or cabinet, then lock it with a key. [6] X Research source This is a good alternative if your parents won’t let you get a lock on your door. If your brother asks about what’s in the cabinet or drawer, you can tell him. Making it sound mysterious will probably only make him more curious."

      "content": "Don’t try to get back at him or get revenge. Instead, respect his boundaries and don’t go into his room when he’s busy or when he’s not there. [7] X Research source If you treat him how you want to be treated, it’s more likely he’ll respect your boundaries."

      "content": "If you make him angry, he might come into your room more often. Talk to him quietly to avoid blowing up your disagreement into a huge argument. [8] X Research source If you’re heading toward a huge fight, try getting your parents involved. They can help you talk it out with your brother instead of fighting. Avoid name calling at all costs. If your brother calls you a name, take a moment, count to ten and take deep breaths. Try not to take it personally and realize he is acting out because he has some unmet need."
