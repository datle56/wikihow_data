      "title": "Make the bottom of your hat box.",
      "content": "Make the bottom of your hat box. Measure the diameter of the hat you plan to store in the hat box. Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to that measurement. If you are not planning to store a hat in your hat box, simply choose an appropriate size. Draw the bottom of your hat box, using your measurement, onto poster board with a pencil. Any symmetrical shape that is somewhat rounded will do (circle, octagon, hexagon, for example). Using a craft knife, score along the drawn line. To do this, trace the line with the blade of the knife, applying light pressure. Continue around a couple times or more, until the bottom of your hat box is cut out."
