      "content": "Make one of the 5 hand signals when you say 3. Right as you each say the number 3, change from a fist into one of the 5 objects–either rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or Spock. Each object wins against 2 others. Determine who the winner is based on the object each player made. [3] X Research source Alternatively, you can both chant “rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock” and reveal your hand signal on “Spock” rather than 3. Make a different object with your hand each time you play so your opponent can't predict your next move. If players make the same object, it's a tie. Play again to determine the winner. If you want to make the game fairer, play the best 2 out 3 rounds."
