      "content": "StockX typically takes 7 to 12 business days to deliver your item. This 7 to 12-day shipping time frame takes into account the time it takes for the Seller to ship the item and the time the item spends in StockX’s Verification Centers. [1] X Research source The amount of time Sellers take to ship your item might vary between 2 to 5 days. [2] X Research source Items purchased on or after the day they’re released may take longer because Sellers are granted additional time to accommodate shipping from the original retailer. If this happens, an estimated delivery window will appear before you confirm your purchase. StockX marketplace deals with high-value and rare products and wants to ensure that the items you purchase on their site meet their internal quality standards."

      "title": "StockX Xpress Ship orders are delivered within 3 business days.",
      "content": "StockX Xpress Ship orders are delivered within 3 business days. If you match a Seller’s Ask price for an Express Ship item (indicated by a rocket icon next to the product listing), your item will be shipped immediately.

[3] X Research source The Xpress Ship option is currently limited to the United States and is currently only available for sneakers.

      "content": "Shippers typically have 2 full business days to ship standard items. Once you purchase an item, the Seller packages the item and drops it off for delivery within 2 days. However, Sellers can request 1 additional day to ship for any order, and StockX can also provide additional business days to ship various new release items at their discretion. [5] X Research source The day you make your purchase doesn’t count as a full business day. New release items sold on or shortly after their release date can have up to 5 total business days to ship: 3 for new release shoes and streetwear and 5 for Supreme items. [6] X Research source The Seller you buy from may be in a different time zone from you, meaning the exact time they have to ship your order depends on their location at the time of the sale. If a Seller doesn’t ship by their deadline, StockX will attempt to link you to a new Seller. If they’re unable to find a new Seller, you will be issued a full and complete refund to your original payment method."

Include the type of issue (Buying), the sub-type (Current Order or Purchase), and as much information as possible about the situation. [8] X Research source If there’s an issue with your item in transit, StockX will launch an investigation with the delivery carrier, which may take up to 10 business days from the start of the investigation. If your tracking information says your package was delivered but you haven’t received it, check with your neighbors or the front desk of your building. If you’re still unable to find your package, contact StockX so they can start an investigation with the carrier."

If you need more time, you can request one 24-hour extension before the deadline. On the StockX website go to Selling > Pending, find the order, and click “Extend” in the “Ship By” column. You’ll receive an automatic “Approved” or “Denied” response. [10] X Research source If you miss your shipping window, StockX will send you alerts.

[12] X Research source Use a shipping box that is no more than 5 cm larger on any side than the box of the item you’re shipping. Place bubble wrap or shipping paper inside around the edges of the item’s box. [13] X Research source If you’re using an old box, make sure you remove any old labels, stickers, and barcodes from the box. [14] X Research source Remove any HAZMAT and warning labels from the outside of the box you use—StockX cannot legally accept any item with these labels still attached. [15] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Seal the box across all the seams on the top and bottom of the box using packing tape (not masking tape, cellophane tape, duct tape, string, or paper).
