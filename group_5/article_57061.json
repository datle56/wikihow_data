For this particular fabric blinds, Hubs had some plastic slats from an old mini blind hanging around, and it worked perfectly! It was flexible and yet wouldn't break - which is something you need to watch for if you use a wooden slat. If it is too thin, it can snap. A 1/4\" thickness would be perfect. The width of the slat should not be greater than 1.25\"."

For this blind, try using a zipper foot and stitch with the machine. This is by far the most challenging step (if done by machine) as you need to make sure you are far enough away from the wall to accommodate the slat sticking out behind you and in front of you, as you stitch.Stitching by hand will alleviate this problem, but it does take longer."
