      "content": "Receiving a Super Like doesn’t mean you’re obligated to swipe right. If you check out the person’s profile and you just aren’t that into them, give them a left swipe and send them on their way. They’ll get a new Super Like to use tomorrow, and they probably won’t even remember your profile in a few hours. People don’t get notified if you left swipe them, even if they’ve Super Liked you."

      "title": "Start a conversation off like you normally would.",
      "content": "Start a conversation off like you normally would. If you want to keep things casual, you can put a little less effort into your message than you usually would. Simply send them a “hi” or “hey, what’s up?” to get the conversation started. Then, they can take the reins and talk about something they liked on your profile. If you don’t just want to say “Hi,” consider sending a funny gif to say it for you."

      "title": "A Super Like is pretty flattering, after all.",
      "content": "A Super Like is pretty flattering, after all. You don’t have to make it a huge deal, but you could send a quick “Hey, thanks for the Super Like!” before continuing your conversation. It shows that you noticed the compliment and that you appreciate it. Be careful not to be overly thankful—messages like “OMG, why did a pretty girl like you Super Like someone like me??” seem a little desperate, and they won’t start you off on the right foot."

      "title": "It’s a sweet and simple opener that can start a conversation.",
      "content": "It’s a sweet and simple opener that can start a conversation. Since they already Super Liked you, they’re probably open to talking about whatever you want. Get the ball rolling with an open ended question so you two can start a casual conversation. [1] X Research source Try something like, “Hey, how’s your day been?” or, “Hi, how’s your day going?”"

    {
      "title": "Glance over their pics and bio to find something to talk about.",
      "content": "Glance over their pics and bio to find something to talk about. Since they Super Liked you, they probably like something about your profile—maybe you two have something in common, like your hobbies or the city you grew up in. Send an opening message like: “Whoa, you grew up in Hawaii too? I lived there until I was 5 years old.” “How long have you been rock climbing?” “Did you enjoy going to school in Florida?”"

    {
      "title": "Pretend like you need their input on a goofy debate.",
      "content": "Pretend like you need their input on a goofy debate. This is a fun way to show off your sense of humor and prove that their Super Like was the right decision. Or, scope out their profile to get their opinion on something real. Try things like: “Quick, I need your opinion! Is a hot dog a sandwich?” “My roommate and I are having a debate, and I need your input: is a PopTart a calzone?” “It’s so cool that you snowboard! I think I already know the answer, but which is better: snowboarding or skiing?”"

      "title": "Pick out something you like from their profile.",
      "content": "Pick out something you like from their profile. It could be their bio, their photos, or something they do in their free time. [2] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. Send them a message complimenting it to start off a fun conversation on the right foot. For example, you might say, “I really like that shot of you at the beach. You look great!” Or, “Your bio made me laugh. Are you this funny IRL too?”"

      "title": "Super Likes are flattering, but they don’t change much.",
      "content": "Super Likes are flattering, but they don’t change much. Getting a Super Like feels great, but you don’t have to bend over backwards for this person or put them on a pedestal. Once you say hi, just keep talking with them like you would anyone else. Let the conversation flow naturally to form a real connection with this person."
