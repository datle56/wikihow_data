      "content": "Listen to the masters. Music is a language, and like learning any language, you need to listen to its native speakers. Start by listening to some of the old masters to get an idea of their rhythms, phrasing, timing, and styles. Here are some good people to start with: Clarence \"Pinetop\" Smith, Cripple Clarence Lofton, Jabo Williams, Montana Taylor, Jimmy Yancey, Hersal Thomas, Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson, Big Maceo Merriweather, Otis Spann, Amos Milburn, Professor Longhair and James Booker. Download their music and listen a little bit to them every day to start getting the true sounds of boogie-woogie in your ears!"

      "content": "Learn at least one left hand bass pattern. The left hand is the most important feature of boogie-woogie piano playing and without a steady bass pattern there is no hope of playing true boogie-woogie. Most left hand patterns are “8-to-the-bar”, meaning there are eight eighth-notes played in every bar. Learn at least one left hand bass pattern and be able to play it automatically and independently of the right hand. Jump to info on learning the right hand if you know how to play a left hand bass pattern."

      "title": "Develop hand independence.",
      "content": "Develop hand independence. This is a great exercise for getting your foot in the door to achieving left hand independence with any new bass pattern you learn. For this example, use your boogie-woogie left hand pattern from Step two. Play the Shuffle pattern (staying on the C chord) in the left hand, and introduce increasingly complicated rhythms in the right hand, using a C6 chord in the first inversion."

      "content": "Practice this technique over the three chords of a 12-bar blues. The most common musical form for boogie-woogie songs is a 12-bar blues [1] X Research source It consists of three chord changes, the I chord, the IV chord, and the V chord. In the key of C, the I chord is C, the IV chord is F, and the V chord is G. It is absolutely essential that you memorize the 12-bar blues form. You can simply transpose the voicing used for C6 to the keys of F and G, or you can try these different voicings: to make an F chord, simply lower the E to an Eb from your C6 chord. This will make an F9 chord. For a G chord, shift your fingers slightly over to f-g-b-d. Practice the hand independence exercise shown above in the new keys of F (starting the left hand pinky finger on F, and playing an F chord in the right hand) and G (starting the left hand pinky finger on G, and playing a G chord in the right hand)."

      "title": "Learn a right hand lick.",
      "content": "Learn a right hand lick. In boogie-woogie piano playing, when the right hand is not playing chords to accompany vocals or another soloist, it usually plays licks. According to Arthur Migliazza’s book “How To Play Boogie Woogie Piano,\" there are only 8 primary licks, from which infinite variations and combinations are possible. Lick #1 is the most basic, and consists of keeping the right hand in the basic position of a C major triad."

Practice in C, F and G separately. [Note: you can transpose these licks to F and G, or just play them in C while the left hand changes! It still works!]"

      "content": "Learn an introduction. Introductions to boogie-woogie songs vary widely. A very common way to start a boogie-woogie is by simply playing the left hand bass pattern for four measure by itself, and then introduce the right hand.Another common way to begin a boogie-woogie is by using the first two chords of a turnaround progression, the I7 and I dim 7. In the key of C this means C7 and C diminished 7. An intro of this sort is usually four measures in duration and consists of going back and forth between these two chords. These four measures count as the first four measures of the 12-bar form and when the left hand comes in with the bass pattern it is on the IV chord."
