      "content": "Craft a shulker box using 2 shulker shells and an empty chest. Open up your crafting table and stick a shulker shell in the middle slots of the top and bottom rows. Then, place a chest in the center slot of the middle row (so it’s directly between the 2 shulker shells). Grab the completed shulker box from the right of the crafting table to your inventory bar. To make a chest , place a wood plank in every slot of a crafting table except for the central one. The completed shulker box will resemble a pink-purple block."

The End portal requires 12 Eyes of Ender to be activated, and typically spawns with just a few Eyes of Ender installed. Finish building the portal to be transported to the End dimension. Eyes of Ender can be made with ender pearls, which are collected by fighting endermen , and blaze powder, which is created from the blaze rods dropped by fighting blazes ."

      "content": "Find shulkers in the end cities along the outskirts of the End. Shulkers are purple, clam-like mobs that spawn in end cities, which are purple- and cream-colored castles that pop up on the islands around the edge of the End. They typically can be spotted on the walls, though they can also be found on end ships. [1] X Research source The shulker might look like a purple box at first, but it’ll eventually open up and reveal itself for a moment."

      "content": "Fight and kill shulkers to collect shulker shells. Attack the shulker with your sword to deal damage—just keep in mind that it’ll take multiple hits to successfully take it down. As you battle the shulker, it will likely teleport away (within a semi-close range), so you’ll have to explore the nearby area to continue attacking it successfully. [2] X Research source Shulkers shoot shulker bullets when attacked, which cause you to float, fall down, and take damage. If you have a shield equipped, you can intercept and block the bullet. Tip: Enchant your sword with Looting III to ensure that the shulker drops shulker shells upon its death. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Place items in a shulker box like you would a chest. Shulker boxes are basically just fancier versions of a chest, so place whatever you’d like inside! Keep in mind that, like chests, shulker boxes are limited to 27 inventory slots, so you’ll need multiple shulker boxes if you’d like to store a lot of different items. Unlike chests, placing 2 shulker boxes next to one another won’t create a larger shulker box with more storage."

The items will stay in the shulker box rather than falling out. You don’t need Silk Touch to break down your shulker box."
