[3] X Research source Observe your surroundings and make a comment about them, or ask a question about the other person. Choose conversation starters that are personal and reflect genuine interest, rather than generic (like commenting on the weather). For example, imagine you're at a party at a friend's place. You see a casual acquaintance there, who you know just took the bar exam. Start by saying something like, \"Hey, how did the bar exam go?\" This is personal and specific, which makes it a great opener. It shows that you’re genuinely interested in talking to them. If you can’t think of a specific question, comment on your surroundings. While this is less personal, it can work in a bind. Talk about the party decor, or mention how impressive it is that so many people could attend."

You can even practice in front of the mirror! [5] X Research source While this may sound a little silly, it can be super helpful to dispel any anxiety you might be feeling. Brainstorm some interesting topics , and make a list of the most promising ones, so that you have them at the ready when the time comes. Your list can include general conversation starters, such as “How is your day going so far?” Or “How do you know the host?” It can also include more specific conversation starters , like, “Have you watched any good movies lately that you’d recommend?” Or, “Are you a dog or cat person?” Compliments also work well. For example, you could say, “I really love your shoes. Where'd you get them from?” Or, “Your jacket looks so warm! Is it new?”"

What did you enjoy most over there? Was the food incredible?” Make a rule that, before you bring up your own experience or interests, you’ll ask at least one question about what the other person said. For example, if you're talking about hockey, ask something like, \"Did you play hockey as a kid?\" before talking about your favorite teams."

Even if you have more to say, avoid dominating the conversation and make sure the other person has a chance to speak. [14] X Research source Pausing also gives the other person a chance to convey interest in what you're saying. They may have something interesting to contribute! Additionally, if the person wants to end the conversation, a brief pause gives them the opportunity to do so smoothly.

What do they do for fun? Keep track of these things in your mind. If you're able to bring them up later, this shows you were listening. For example, if they mentioned that they're in school for filmmaking, you can bring this up again later in the conversation if you’re touching on a similar topic. You could say something like, “I know you mentioned earlier you’re getting your degree in film. I’m so curious to hear your perspective on that new movie everyone's talking about. Did you enjoy it?”"

When you and the other person have exhausted a topic, you may notice natural pauses coming more frequently, and enthusiasm may dwindle slightly. Don’t worry—this is completely natural! All good things must come to an end. When this occurs, gracefully leave the conversation on good terms. If you're at a party or event, say you need to meet up with friends, or that you need to run to the bathroom. If you're conversing at work, say you need to get back to a task. From there, express gratitude for having had the chance to talk. For example, say, \"It was really great talking to you. I’m so glad we got to catch up.\" Then, restate a few things you discussed.

Ask questions about things they’ve mentioned, and comment on what they’ve shared. For example, if someone mentions a recent vacation they took, you might say something like, “That sounds amazing! What sights did you see while you were there?” If you’ve also visited this location, it’s okay to mention it, but keep your focus on their trip.
