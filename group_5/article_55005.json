      "content": "Rub lemon on your nails. Cut a lemon in half and rub the inside of the lemon onto your nails. Focus on rubbing the lemon on each nail for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. [3] X Research source Once all of your nails have been rubbed with lemon, allow your nails to absorb the lemon juice and dry for about 10 minutes. After your nails have soaked in the lemon juice, apply a moisturizer to your hands and nails to prevent them from drying out. The lemon juice can lighten your nails much in the same way it can lighten hair when it is sprayed on and exposed to the sun. You could also squeeze lemon juice into a bowl and use a cotton ball to apply the juice directly to your nails."

      "title": "Apply a base coat.",
      "content": "Apply a base coat. Apply a clear base coat of nail polish to all of your nails before you apply your colored polish. The thin layer of base coat acts as a barrier to the dyes in the colored polish that can stain your nails and turn them yellow. Allow the base coat to dry for about 5 minutes before proceeding to paint them with your colored polish. A base coat also serves as an anchor for the colored polish to hold onto."

      "content": "Avoid dark nail polish. Dark nail polishes (black, purple, blue, red) have pigments that can discolor your nails if the polish has direct contact with your nails. Applying base coat can help prevent this color staining, but in general, try opting for lighter polish colors every once in a while. Using lighter or sheer nail polish colors can give your nails a break from the harsh dyes found in darker polishes. If you do want to use a darker color, be especially sure to use a good-quality base coat to protect your nails. [9] X Expert Source Mia Rubie Nail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020."
