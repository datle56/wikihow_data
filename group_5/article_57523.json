      "content": "Cut the fabric for the head. Draw a circle at the end of the sock, using the curve of the toe as a base. Add ear at the top of the circle to make the outline of a bear's head. This should not take up more than a quarter of the length of the sock. Cut the fabric just above the line of the ears. Once it is cut out, cut off just a sliver of fabric at the very base of the circle to make a hole for the neck."

      "title": "Cut out the fabric for the arms and legs.",
      "content": "Cut out the fabric for the arms and legs. Just above the heel, you'll see the tube of fabric that goes up the leg. Starting right after the curve of the heel ends and going until the hem of the sock, visually divide that length in half. Cut at that middle point on the long part of the sock. The end bit will be divided in two to make the arms. Cut a short split down the middle of the larger piece, until you reach the beginning of the heel. This will form the body and the legs."

You can buy the stuffing used for stuffed animals at craft stores. If you don't want to do that, you can use cotton balls or scrap fabric to stuff your bear."
