From their first meeting, Ariens shine bright with their bold and confident energy, which is super appealing to Cancers. An Aries, on the other hand, absolutely loves how eager and willing the nurturing Cancer is to care for them. According to astrology expert Stina Garbis, Cancer \"is going to need opportunities to be close and to be helpful\", while Aries \"will think about you a lot and go wild with wanting to see you again.\" The bold Aries isn’t great at keeping their romantic feelings under wraps, and will share how they’re feeling right away.
