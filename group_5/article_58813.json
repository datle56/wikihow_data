      "content": "Read to and with your child. Reading helps develop important communication skills, vocabulary, and grammar. In addition, reading helps children learn a lot more about the world. It expands their horizons and can bring them into contact with people and information that they might never experience otherwise. As a result, reading is one of the most important ways to raise and nurture an intelligent child. Try reading with your child every day at least once. It's best to start doing this when your child is a baby. Make reading fun for your child; use different voices and sounds to keep their attention. Encourage your child to read on their own. Encourage your child to discuss what they have read with you. Schedule time for regular trips to the library. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Regulate your child’s television watching. While television is not necessarily a bad thing for children to spend time watching, it presents several problems for parents who want to take a proactive stance raising their children. Perhaps most importantly, television occupies time that could be used on more stimulating activities. In addition, some studies have indicated that watching television can stunt the intellect or limit a child’s intellectual growth. The US Department of Health recommends that children under the age of two do not watch TV or spend time in front of other screens, such as computers or tablets. Children between the ages of two and five should not have more than one hour of screen time each day and kids between the ages of five and 18 should have no more than two hours of screen time each day. [2] X Research source Make sure that your child watches shows appropriate for them. Have your child watch shows that stimulate his or her brain, such as “Discovery Kids.” Treat television as a treat, not a right. Make your child's television experience more active rather than passive; have your child sing along with the characters or talk to your child about what they see or hears. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase your child toys that stimulate the brain. As educators and developmental theorist have known for a long time, toys are an important part of a child’s intellectual growth and development. As a result, you should put thought into the toys you purchase for your child and make sure that your child’s toys are developmentally advantageous. Of course all children are different, and different children use toys differently, so use your best judgement. Toys and games that promote problem solving (like puzzles) are a good choice. Toys and games that allow your child to express creativity (like Legos or Lincoln logs) are beneficial. Toys that allow your child to physically move and touch things are often better choices than video games. Video game time should be limited, and you should vet every video game to make sure it has educational and intellectual value before allowing your child to play."

      "content": "Nurture your child’s interests. An important element of raising an intelligent child is nurturing your child’s interests. Different children will demonstrate different proclivities and different interests. You should nurture this and promote uniqueness. You can do this by: Positively reinforcing your child’s interest. If your child demonstrates an interest in history, take them to a historic site. If your child demonstrates an interest in science, take them to a science museum. Buy them books that they are interested in. Enroll them in programs that cater to their interests. If your child loves environmental science, find a summer environmental program for kids at a local university to enroll them in. If your child isn't enthusiastic about school, help them pursue the things they are interested in outside of school so they still develop a passion for learning and research.

      "content": "Expose your child to new things to challenge their interests. If you only cater to your child's interests, they might miss out on things they have not been exposed to. In order to prevent this, you should go out of your way to introduce your child to different ideas, cultures, and ways of life. Consider: Introduce your children to traditionally feminine and masculine topics such as cooking, childcare, and nurturing, as well as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Tell your children that they can choose to be a cook or a caregiver, and that they can pursue these careers, hobbies, and interests. Introduce your child to different ways of viewing the world in terms of gender relations, culture, and intellectualism. Your child does not have to fit into any sort of traditional mold and can adopt different ideas in order to fashion their own unique identity."

This way, you’ll learn more about your child and about their specific type of intelligence. You might also be able to steer them toward playing styles and activities that are more enriching. But remember: Always let your child express their own creativity. Do not inhibit your child's creativity. Don’t take over their play time. There is no right way to “play.” [5] X Research source"

This way, you’ll learn about your child and you’ll be able to determine how your child is progressing intellectually over time. You can choose to talk about anything with your child, but it’s better to let your child choose the conversation. When your child asks you something, turn it into a conversation rather than just quickly answering them. Ask your child questions, and see how they respond. Remember, though, there is no right answer. Your goal should be just to engage your child. One of the most important parts of talking is listening. Make sure you listen carefully to what your child is saying, rather than lecturing to them. [6] X Research source"

Use their development over time as a way to introduce them to the world. When your child is young, between the ages of 2-4, explain basic and simple things. Gradually introduce more complex topics as your child gets older. Save topics like sex, budgeting, and the complexities of law for children near or over the age of 10. [7] X Research source"

Private schools. Schools with high ratings. Schools with special programs that will benefit your child, like those with well-developed STEM or art programs. [8] X Research source"

Honors classes in middle school and high school. Advanced Placement classes in high school. International Baccalaureate classes in high school. [9] X Research source"

A child who is overcommitted might not be able to realize their potential in any one thing. A child who is overcommitted might lose interest and harbor resentment against an overbearing parent. Overcommitting your child might create undue stress on yourself and on your partner. [11] X Research source"
