      "title": "Cut the Plexiglas",
      "content": "Cut the Plexiglas , if necessary. Prepare the pieces to be joined by cutting them to the proper size and shape. Acrylic glass that is a quarter inch (6.3 mm) or thicker is best cut with a table saw or miter saw. Pieces that are thinner than this can be scored with a utility knife and then snapped cleanly apart, but only along straight lines. [1] X Research source If your cut edges are rough, sand and polish them so you have a clean and smooth edge on which to apply the glue. [2] X Research source Remove the protective film, if applicable, after cutting so as not to scratch the Plexiglas."

      "title": "Clean the Plexiglas.",
      "content": "Clean the Plexiglas. Before attempting to join the acrylic glass, clean the pieces with a mild soap and water, focusing on the edges that will be glued. After cleaning and rinsing the pieces, blot them dry thoroughly with a clean cloth - donâ€™t rub, or you may scratch the surface. You can also clean acrylic glass with isopropyl alcohol."

      "content": "Set the acrylic glass in place for gluing. Once you have cleaned the pieces, fit them together as they will be joined. After ensuring a snug fit, secure the pieces together with either masking tape or clamps. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply the glue to the joint.",
      "content": "Apply the glue to the joint. The glue must be applied with a syringe, because it is water-thin and works by melting the acrylic to bond two pieces together. Using a 25 gauge syringe, apply a small amount of methylene chloride (such as Weld-On #3) to the joint between the two acrylic glass pieces, drawing the syringe toward you rather than pushing it away. [4] X Research source Wear heavy rubber gloves and safety glasses when applying the methylene chloride. Do not attempt to apply the solvent cement to the pieces separately and then press them together. This method will produce a weaker joint and up the risk of drips. These will melt and deform any acrylic glass they touch."

      "title": "Allow the glue to set.",
      "content": "Allow the glue to set. You should let the glue set for 24-48 hours to ensure a secure bond. You can then remove any clamps or tape that were holding the pieces of acrylic glass together. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sand the joint smooth.",
      "content": "Sand the joint smooth. Allow the glue to set completely, then use a fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough patches of adhesive. Clean off the dust when you are finished sanding by washing the acrylic glass with soap and water or isopropyl alcohol."

      "title": "Check the joint to ensure it is watertight.",
      "content": "Check the joint to ensure it is watertight. If the acrylic glass will be used to contain water, you should check your joint for leaks. Run water over the joint or submerge the piece in water, and check for the appearance of leaks. If the glass leaks, allow it to dry thoroughly then apply additional glue to the joint."
