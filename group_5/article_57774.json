      "title": "Pick out fresh corn with the husk still on.",
      "content": "Pick out fresh corn with the husk still on. You will find fresh ears of corn with the husk on in grocery stores during the summer. You can also try a farmer's market or even grow your own. Make sure each ear still has the husk around it and that it is ripe. Here's how you can check for ripeness: Look for corn with tassels, or strings, that are brown and sticky instead of dry and yellow. Brown, sticky tassels means the corn is ripe. Squeeze the ear gently to feel the kernels through the husk. They should feel plump and firm, but not hard as little pebbles. Try to buy only what you can eat within a few days, and keep it refrigerated so that the sugar in the corn kernels does not have time to get starchy and overripe. If you have too much corn on hand after a harvest, you can always freeze it."

      "title": "Trim the corn, if necessary.",
      "content": "Trim the corn, if necessary. Trim the ends to make sure that the corn ears will fit easily in the microwave. Remove any very loose or dry leaves. Snip off excess silk. You may also want to take a damp paper towel and wipe dirt from the leaves although these will be removed later."

    {
      "title": "Place the ears in the microwave.",
      "content": "Place the ears in the microwave. Most microwaves will fit up to three ears at at time. If you have a very large microwave, you might be able to fit a few more. In order to ensure that the corn cooks evenly, each ear should be near the center of the microwave without touching the other ears. To ensure even exposure and heating of each ear, arrange the ears in a triangle for three ears, or a square for four ears. Make sure the ears are not touching each other. Do not pile them up or let them overlap, or you may end up with under-cooked corn."

      "title": "Microwave the corn.",
      "content": "Microwave the corn. Microwave the corn on high for three to five minutes, depending on how many ears you have. If you have just one ear, start with three, and if you have up to four ears, cook them for five minutes. If you are cooking several ears at once, you can stop the cooking halfway through and turn the ears over to make sure they cook evenly. Depending on the size of the corn, you can factor in two to four minutes cooking time per ear."

    {
      "title": "Remove the corn from the microwave and let it rest.",
      "content": "Remove the corn from the microwave and let it rest. Allow the corn to sit in its husk for a minute or so it is cool enough to handle, distribute its heat and continue to cook. The husk itself contains little water, so it will remain relatively cool. However, the water in the corn will be steaming hot and can burn you . Be cautious and use oven mitts or tongs to handle hot corn. Check that it is done by peeling back the husk and feeling or even nibbling a few kernels to test the temperature and the springiness of the kernels. Lay the husk back down and return it to the microwave to cook longer if necessary. If the corn is scorched or mushy, it is overcooked â€“ use less time in the future."

    {
      "title": "Remove the husk and silk.",
      "content": "Remove the husk and silk. The corn ear and its dense, watery stalk will be hot after cooking, staying hot inside the husk. Peel the corn carefully so as to avoid burning yourself. The husk and silk will come right off."

      "title": "Dress your corn.",
      "content": "Dress your corn. Roll it in butter and season it with salt and pepper if you like. Allow it to cool before eating. Alternatively, sprinkle some grated cheddar or cotija cheese across its surface. Sour cream with a sprinkle of red pepper is another tasty topping Microwaved corn is fresh and delicious; it can be eaten with your hands or using special corn cob tools. Alternatively, you can remove the kernels for a side dish or to use in another recipe. Stand the corn on its end and run a knife down the sides to remove the kernels."

      "title": "Shuck the corn",
      "content": "Shuck the corn if necessary. Pull the entire depth of leaves and corn under them off at once, as if peeling a banana rather than an onion. They will stay together for neat disposal. Pick off the individual strands of silk that remain stuck to the corn. Another way to shuck the corn is by cutting the harder end of the corn which makes the husk come away automatically. Do not dispose of the husk and silk in a garbage disposal, since they are so fibrous. Throw them in the trash or compost them. A fun craft for children or the young at heart are creating corn husk dolls. Either Leave the stem on for a handle, or tear it off with the husk."

      "title": "Cover the corn.",
      "content": "Cover the corn. You may cover the corn with a wet paper towel or put it in a dish with a microwave safe lid. You can also use a clean tea or kitchen towel. Add a teaspoon of water to the dish to prevent the corn from drying as it cooks. At this stage you can add flavors or toppings that will cook right into the corn. Try shredded cheese, lemon or lime juice, or any number of spices. You can soak the paper towel with liquid flavorings like lemon or lime juice to gently enhance the flavor of the corn without making a mess."

Microwave the corn on high for up to five minutes, depending on how many ears you're cooking. Each ear requires two to four minutes of cooking time, with more time added if you're microwaving several ears of corn."
