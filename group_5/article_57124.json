    {
      "title": "Whisk the flour and cool water together.",
      "content": "Whisk the flour and cool water together. Take 3 Tbsp (50 mL) flour or starch and gradually add room temperature water while stirring or whisking. Stop when all the flour is wet and the mixture is runny enough to pour."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the runny mixture into the boiling water.",
      "content": "Stir the runny mixture into the boiling water. Once the water is boiled, add the flour mixture while stirring constantly. The mixture will foam as it boils. Stirring or whisking prevents the mixture from boiling over, burning, or forming lumps. To reduce the chance of these mishaps, make a double boiler by placing the pot of wheat paste in a larger pot containing roughly 2 cups (500 mL) boiling water. If it thickens too much to stir, add more water."

      "title": "Remove from heat when thick and smooth.",
      "content": "Remove from heat when thick and smooth. This can take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes. If using starch, the mixture will be translucent when ready."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perfect the batch.",
      "content": "Perfect the batch. In many cases the batch will be ready to use once it cools. However, it's easy to make adjustments while the goop is still hot: If the batch isn't sticky enough, stir in sugar or white glue. Begin with 3 Tbsp (50 mL) sugar or glue and add more if necessary. To preserve the mixture longer and deter bugs from eating it, mix in a small amount of copper sulphate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the mixture cool.",
      "content": "Let the mixture cool. Once at room temperature it should hold together as a gluey gelatinous paste. Each brand of flour and starch is a little different, so the exact consistency will vary. As long as there are no lumps it should work well. To remove lumps from the paste, strain it through a thin sieve or pair of tights. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator. Left at room temperature, the paste will begin to smell after 2 days and grow mold within a week. Even for pastes without copper sulphate, there are easy ways to extend this shelf life: Reheat unused paste in a covered container after each project to sterilize it. [2] X Research source Pour a little water on top of the paste for storage. If the paste is cool the water will sit on top of the paste and prevent mold from reaching it. Pour out the water again before using."

    {
      "title": "Apply paste to a surface.",
      "content": "Apply paste to a surface. Using your preferred tool (such as a paintbrush or your gloved hands), apply a liberal coat of paste to a wall. It will adhere strongly to wood, stone, and most other surfaces. Remove any lumps from the paste to prevent bubbles and lumps from tearing the poster. Attaching posters to other people's property or in public places is illegal in some regions."

      "title": "Stick the poster or art onto the pasted surface.",
      "content": "Stick the poster or art onto the pasted surface. Do this slowly, rolling it up from one side to prevent wrinkles from forming. For very large posters or high surfaces, a push broom may be useful."

      "title": "Apply additional paste over the poster.",
      "content": "Apply additional paste over the poster. A glossy, sticky layer over the whole poster will dry into a strong adherent. [3] X Research source If you used whole wheat flour, the paste may have brown flecks or tinge. Apply such paste lightly to avoid obscuring the poster. If you don't have enough time or paste to cover the entire poster, prioritize the corners or furthest edges."
