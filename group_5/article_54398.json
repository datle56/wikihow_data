The Pythagorean theorem is A 2 + B 2 = C 2 . “A” and “B” are the horizontal and vertical components of the triangle while “C” is the hypotenuse. Since the vector is the hypotenuse you want to solve for “C”. [4] X Research source x 2 + y 2 = v 2 v = √(x 2 + y 2 ))"

[5] X Research source For example, v = √((3 2 +(-5) 2 )) v =√(9 + 25) = √34 = 5.831 Don't worry if your answer is not a whole number. Vector magnitudes can be decimals."

Every vector can be numerically represented in the Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) component. [6] X Research source It is written as an ordered pair v =< x , y > {\\displaystyle v=<x,y>} . If you are given a vector that is placed away from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, you must define the components of both points of the vector. For example, the vector AB has an ordered pair for point A and point B. Point A has a horizontal component of 5 and a vertical component of 1, so the ordered pair is <5, 1>. Point B has a horizontal component of 1 and a vertical component of 2, so the ordered pair is <1, 2>."
