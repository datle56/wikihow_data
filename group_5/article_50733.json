First, recognize that a vector equation like the one above has the same solution set as a linear system with its corresponding augmented matrix. This is a fundamental idea in linear algebra. Second, when the augments are all 0, row-reduction does not change the augments. Therefore, we need not write them at all – row-reducing the coefficient matrix is all that is necessary. Note that moving everything to the left side causes the elements on the right side to negate.
