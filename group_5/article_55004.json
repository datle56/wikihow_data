      "content": "This works to get rid of woodpeckers when you see them. Clap your hands, yell, whoop, or make any other kind of loud noise when an unwanted woodpecker is nearby. You can also try playing a loud audio clip of a predator’s sounds, such as the call of a hawk. [1] X Research source For example, if a woodpecker wakes you up in the morning by banging away at your chimney, go outside with a metal pan and spoon and make a ruckus yourself to scare it away!"

      "content": "Plastic replicas of birds of prey can ward off woodpeckers. Get a fake owl or hawk and set it up in your yard or on top of your home. You can also try putting a fake fox in your yard or garden. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that some woodpeckers might realize a decoy predator poses no real threat and come back after a while."

      "title": "The noise from wind chimes can scare woodpeckers off.",
      "content": "The noise from wind chimes can scare woodpeckers off. Hang up wind chimes near wherever woodpeckers tend to go on your property to deter them. The motion of the chimes also helps deter woodpeckers. [3] X Research source For instance, if a woodpecker comes and hammers on your home near your back door every morning, put wind chimes up on the eaves nearby. Or, if a woodpecker is pecking against your windows, hang wind chimes up nearby whatever windows they are targeting."

      "title": "Shiny things can startle woodpeckers and scare them away.",
      "content": "Shiny things can startle woodpeckers and scare them away. String up some shiny streamers, balloons, or aluminum foil near where woodpeckers are hanging out on your property. Anything that reflects light works, such as old CDs, for example. [4] X Research source For example, hang shiny streamers at regular intervals from the gutters of your home’s roof to keep woodpeckers away from your home’s siding. Or, hang up old CDs from the branches of a tree that you want to discourage woodpeckers from pecking away at."

      "content": "The motion of a pinwheel can repel woodpeckers. Stick a garden pinwheel in the ground near where a woodpecker is going on your property. Set several up in different areas to make woodpeckers think twice about choosing your yard to hang out in. [5] X Research source You can get garden pinwheels at garden shops or online. There are all kinds of fun shapes and colors to choose from, so you can find one that complements your lawn or garden!"

      "content": "This removes an attractive food source for woodpeckers. Call a pest control company to come to your property and inspect it for insects. Have them exterminate any populations of ants, termites, or other insects that woodpeckers may be feeding on. [6] X Research source Even if you don’t see insects around, check your siding for insect damage. There might be insects inside the wood that woodpeckers are after. Bees are another insect that woodpeckers feed on, so keep an eye out for any hives. [7] X Expert Source Elmer Bensinger Pest Control Specialist Expert Interview. 5 February 2021. If you want to try to get rid of insects yourself, buy commercial poison bait or traps and place them around your property wherever you see the insects gathering."

      "title": "This attracts woodpeckers away from areas you don’t want them in.",
      "content": "This attracts woodpeckers away from areas you don’t want them in. Put up a cage-style bird feeder near where woodpeckers are attracted to on your property. Place a block of suet bird feed inside the cage to give the woodpeckers something to eat. [8] X Research source Don't do this unless you deal with any insect problems first. Otherwise, you'll just be attracting more woodpeckers to the feast! Woodpeckers also eat berries and fruits, so you can try planting some berry bushes or fruit trees on your property to provide an alternate food source for woodpeckers as well."

      "content": "Rotten wood is especially attractive to woodpeckers. Check the siding and other wooden parts of your home for rot. Have a contractor come and replace it with new materials to get rid of woodpeckers that are attracted to the rotten wood. [9] X Research source Woodpeckers like to make nests and look for insects in rotting wood."

      "content": "Mesh bird netting prevents woodpeckers from perching on things. Install netting at least 3 in (7.6 cm) from whatever surface you want to keep woodpeckers off of, such as the side of your home or the trunk of a tree in your yard. Make sure you don’t leave any openings that woodpeckers could find their way into.

      "content": "This discourages further pecking. Inspect wood on your property for holes caused by woodpeckers. Fill them up with wood putty to encourage woodpeckers to go elsewhere.
