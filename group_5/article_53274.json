      "title": "Look for a runny nose.",
      "content": "Look for a runny nose. Cats with this virus basically develop an upper respiratory infection. Part of that infection includes your cat having a runny nose. [2] X Research source You may also notice congested breathing, which you can identify by a wheezy sound when your cat is breathing through the nose. [3] X Research source Your cat may also sneeze, but that isn't quite as common as a runny nose with this particular virus."

      "title": "Notice eye problems.",
      "content": "Notice eye problems. Cats with this virus often develop conjunctivitis , which is an inflammation of the inner membrane of the eye. You may notice discharge, more blinking, squinting, or red or swollen eyelids. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Watch for mouth ulcers.",
      "content": "Watch for mouth ulcers. While not every cat develops this issue, some cats will develop mouth ulcers. One sign that your cat has a mouth ulcer is it is drooling more than normal. Mouth ulcers can also cause severe gingivitis, inflaming the gums. [5] X Research source Mouth ulcers usually look like small white or yellow patches. They will have red around the edges. [6] X Research source You may notice your cat is less hungry because of this problem. If your cat is drooling or pawing at their mouth, it may be a sign they have mouth ulcers."

      "title": "Look for limping and muscle pain.",
      "content": "Look for limping and muscle pain. This virus can produce muscle and joint pain in your cat, which you may notice if your cat is limping or reacts aggressively to being touched. However, not every cat will develop this symptom. [7] X Research source Also, look for ulcers on the paw pads, which can be crusty or red."

      "title": "Pay attention to other signs your cat is sick.",
      "content": "Pay attention to other signs your cat is sick. Some symptoms are not specific to this disease, but they show you your cat is sick. For instance, low energy, fever, and not eating can all be signs your cat is sick. You might also notice enlarged lymph nodes. [8] X Research source With swollen lymph nodes, you may notice swelling under the chin, near the shoulder, or even in the leg. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Prepare to give information on the cat.",
      "content": "Prepare to give information on the cat. While at the vet, you'll need to tell them things like when the symptoms started and what symptoms in particular you've noticed. It would also be helpful to know if the cat came in contact with another cat who had the virus (such as the cat went outside). [10] X Research source The first thing you should tell your vet about is your cat's vaccination history."

    {
      "title": "Expect a physical examination.",
      "content": "Expect a physical examination. Your vet will spend some time examining your cat's eyes, nose, and face. The vet will also likely explore the cat's body, looking for things like ulcers in their mouth or on their paws, and pain in their muscles. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Watch for sample tests.",
      "content": "Watch for sample tests. If your vet suspects FCV, they'll likely take samples from the cat's eyes, nose, and mouth. The vet may also take samples from the lungs. These samples will then be tested for certain diseases to narrow down what is wrong with the cat.

      "content": "Use topical ointments. The cat will often need ointments to help treat problems like conjunctivitis and mouth ulcers. You'll need to apply these medications to the areas according to your vet's instructions to help alleviate these symptoms. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Administer eye drops.",
      "content": "Administer eye drops. In some cases, you may receive eye drops from the vet for your cat. The eye drops help with the conjunctivitis and can help prevent secondary infections. Apply according to the vet's instructions for dosage. [16] X Research source Come at the eye from the back of the head, as your cat will want to move if you come at it from the front. In fact, you can rest the bottle on the back of the head to drip it into the eye. Wipe off any solution that gets on your cat's face."

      "content": "Ask about anti-inflammatories. If your cat is having a great deal of muscle or joint pain, an anti-inflammatory may help them feel better.

      "title": "Run a humidifier.",
      "content": "Run a humidifier. A humidifier can help with your cat's congestion by keeping discharge more liquid. Run a humidifier in the room where your cat is mostly staying to keep it comfortable, as the humid air will help it breathe more easily. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Encourage eating.",
      "content": "Encourage eating. Many cats will be disinclined to eat because they can't smell well. Offer canned food if possible, as the increased smell may encourage your cat to eat. [21] X Research source Sometimes, baby food (just chicken with nothing else in it) can also encourage your cat to eat. Try putting a bit on a spoon and holding it near your cat's nose. Warming up the food in the microwave might make it more appetizing to your cat. Just make sure you test the temperature to make sure it's not too hot. You can also try drizzling some tuna juice over your cat's food. If it becomes a problem, your cat may need a stimulant, or it may need to be hospitalized."
