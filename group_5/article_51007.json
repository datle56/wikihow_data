      "content": "Use BFFR to acknowledge how ridiculous, suspicious, or unbelievable something is. Maybe you saw something blatantly foolish or untrue on TikTok, or you witnessed/are witnessing something totally nonsensical. BFFR is a succinct but effective way to reprimand a person or situation, particularly in a digital space (people don’t usually spell out “BFFR” in a verbal conversation).

      "content": "BFFR originally came from African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Also known as Ebonics, AAVE is a dialect with its own unique history, grammatical structure, and vocabulary that’s commonly used within the Black community.

It’s typically frowned upon for people to adopt AAVE vocab words if they aren’t part of the Black community and AAVE cultural community.

      "content": "BFFR became famous in 2022, but was used before that point. BFFR achieved widespread fame and usage in 2022 after a clip of rapper Slump6s saying the phrase out loud was used as TikTok audio on a number of videos. The phrase was also frequently used in TikTok comments (particularly by user @Khyahnextdoor). It’s important to note, though, that people had been using BFFR long before 2022, with some iterations of the phrase being seen as early as 2013. [6] X Research source There’s even a tweet all the way from 2009 that uses the wording “be f*cking for real”."
