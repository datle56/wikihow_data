Let your jewelry sit in the lemon juice solution for about 10 minutes before taking it out and scrubbing it with a toothbrush. Rinse the jewelry in clean water before drying it.

      "content": "Line a glass bowl with aluminum foil. Choose a glass bowl that's deep enough to hold all of your jewelry inside. Rip off a piece of aluminum foil large enough to fit in your bowl, and line the interior of the bowl with it. Wrap the foil around the top rim of the bowl so it stays in place.
