      "content": "A simple change in your mindset can make a big difference. The truth is, you can’t make new friends unless you put in the work to make it happen. Start by focusing your mind and making it a goal to try harder to meet new people as often as you can. The more new people you can meet, the more intelligent friends you can make. [1] X Research source For instance, you could tell yourself something like, “I will talk to new people as often as I can” or “I’ll plan to do a group activity at least once a week to meet new people.” It’s completely normal to feel a little nervous about putting yourself out there. If you commit to you intention, it can make it much easier."

      "content": "There are a ton of connections you could be missing around you. This is a simple strategy, but you might be surprised at how effective it can be. Instead of whipping out your phone to text or scroll while you’re waiting in places like a library, restaurant, or even a grocery store, resist the urge and try striking up a conversation with someone around you if you feel comfortable. You never know what conversations can lead to more intelligent people in your life. [2] X Research source For instance, while you’re standing in the checkout line at your local grocery store, try chatting with people around you. You could say something like, “Hey, how’s it going? Looks like you’re cooking a nice dinner!” Keep in mind that not every conversation will turn into a friendship. That’s okay!"
