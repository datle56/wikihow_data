      "content": "Lots of women like skinny guys‚Äîbut they value personality over looks. Pete Davidson, the Warren Beatty of our era and alleged inspiration behind the term ‚ÄúBig Dick Energy,‚Äù is pretty much the opposite of buff. So is it his personality that reels in the ladies, or his bod? Studies suggest it could be both! When it comes to long-term relationships, women aren‚Äôt as interested in big, muscular guys as we think, and many women actually prefer a thinner fellow. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source But what they‚Äôre most interested in is how kind, intelligent, and confident their partner is, with kindness being the most important element. In fact, studies suggest that women prefer a thinner, less buff man than most guys assume, while most guys want a heavier girl than most women assume! [2] X Research source Anecdotal evidence lines up with the science. Post the question ‚ÄúDo girls like skinny guys?‚Äù to any wide-reaching forum like Reddit or Quora and you‚Äôll see an outpouring of answers that basically all amount to ‚ÄúYes!!!! üòç‚Äù"

      "content": "Some girls just find skinny dudes hot! We can talk about kindness and confidence 'til the cows come home, but the fact is it's not just a good personality that makes a guy attractive: a huge number of women are turned on by thin guys with defined features. Whether you're slender but built or straight-up skin and bones, a lot of women prefer a slim partner. A lot of us have been conditioned to think of the \"ideal man\" as having a strong jaw and buff facial features, but studies indicate most women are attracted to men with thin, more defined faces.

      "content": "Skinny guys tend to live longer than bigger guys. Obesity tends to increase the risk of contracting various health issues, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. So while you may get tired of being called ‚Äúskinny,‚Äù being naturally thin likely makes it easier for you to keep off extra weight that could negatively affect your health. [4] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source The fact that skinny guys may live longer than heavier guys may be especially attractive to women looking for a long-term partner, since women tend to live 5 years longer than men as it is.

      "content": "And because they live longer, their offspring may live longer, too. Another thing skinny dudes have going for them is that they‚Äôre likely to pass their skinny dude genes on to the next generation. In other words, the longer life a skinny bod might afford you is likely to be passed on to your kids. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In the same way a woman may be drawn to a long-term partner she believes will be around for the long haul, if she‚Äôs interested in having a family, she may be attracted to a guy whom she believes will make a good father, both personality-wise and genetically speaking."

      "content": "Skinny guys may also be perceived as more confident. There‚Äôs not really evidence to suggest skinny guys are more confident than jacked dudes, but there‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest that body dysmorphia may lead men to obsessively bulk up. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This may suggest a correlation between thin men and confidence‚Äîwhich is one reason some women might prefer skinny guys. Many of us have been conditioned to think muscles = testosterone = manliness, but in fact, studies show extra muscles don‚Äôt automatically lead to higher testosterone levels. [8] X Research source So in the end, it‚Äôs really being confident (not cocky or arrogant, mind you) that'll attract the ladies, whether you look like a pre-spider bite Peter Parker, post-spider bite Peter Parker, or, like, the Incredible Hulk."

Being well-groomed doesn‚Äôt mean shelling out money for a new wardrobe or getting a makeover to match what you think women want you to look like. It just means showering regularly, combing your hair, and putting a little thought into your wardrobe now and then.

If you think you‚Äôve got to be a stoic, scowling manly man in order to be attractive, think again: across the board, people of all genders and orientations find a great smile totally swoon-worthy. Like personal grooming, general pleasantness‚Äîincluding a nice, easy smile and a friendly attitude‚Äîcan affect how attractive you come off to others. [10] X Research source In fact, despite stereotypes about masculinity being linked to large genitalia, studies show a nice smile is more important to women than genitalia (and speaking of genitalia, most women aren‚Äôt actually on the hunt for a large package).

Some people‚Äîregardless of gender‚Äîdefinitely have a ‚Äútype,‚Äù but there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all look you need to adopt to get the girl.

This doesn‚Äôt mean looks don‚Äôt matter or don‚Äôt contribute to attraction‚Äîbut being yourself and being able to make a girl feel good about her self is way more attractive than physical appearance, whether you‚Äôre a Pete Davidson or a Ryan Gosling or a Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson."
