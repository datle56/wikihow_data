      "content": "Temu is a lot like other online shopping platforms. Temu falls in a similar camp as sites like Amazon and eBay, especially from a user experience standpoint. You simply type in the item you’re looking for, add it to your cart, provide the necessary payment and shipping information, and check out. Lots of items on Temu are shipped from international sellers, many of which are based in China (which makes sense, given that Temu is a Chinese-owned company). Users can shop on Temu’s website and app, though it’s easy to get overwhelmed with promotional pop-ups on the app. If you’re hoping to support local businesses and buy domestic products, Temu may not be an ideal platform for you to shop on."

      "title": "Temu uses a tax loophole to have extremely low prices.",
      "content": "Temu uses a tax loophole to have extremely low prices. Temu takes advantage of the “de minimis value” of the USA’s Tariff Act of 1930, which absolves tariffs and taxes from international shipments that are valued at less than $800 (this was raised from $200 in 2015). [4] X Research source Because of this loophole, Temu can offer plenty of perks like low price points and free shipping with orders. Because of the “de minimis” loophole, Temu packages don’t have to go through extra inspections at customs, which allows Temu to send them directly to the buyer from manufacturers.

      "content": "Not especially—customers can expect potentially low-quality items. As of early 2024, Temu currently has a C+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and has over 1,900 complaints filed since the company was first established in 2022. Some of these complaints discuss low-quality or dysfunctional items, which is important to keep in mind if you’re considering buying from Temu. [6] X Trustworthy Source Better Business Bureau Nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting marketplace trustworthiness by educating consumers and reviewing businesses Go to source Tech products like headphones and keyboards are popular on Temu, but customers have had mixed results with the quality. Some products have been reported as knock-offs or fakes of brand names that don't work as well. With Temu, it helps to adopt a “you get what you pay for” attitude with your purchases. With this in mind, some consumers advise against buying more expensive products from Temu."

Temu offers “Temu Purchase Protection” for items that weren’t delivered, were delivered late, were damaged, or were different from what you ordered. TPP gives buyers a full refund for items upon their return. [7] X Research source Temu has a support page and a chat bot service on their website, but they frequently respond to customers who file complaints with the BBB as well. Bear in mind that not all customers have had success with getting refunds, but, on paper, their policy should keep you and your purchases protected."

Because of this, the US government is concerned that some Temu products could be the product of forced Uyghur labor. [9] X Research source The Uyghur people are a minority group in China. Over 1 million Uyghurs are believed to be apprehended by the Chinese government for no discernible reason, and at least 10% of this population are believed to be victims of forced labor (in the northwest Xinjiang region of China).

[11] X Research source In early 2023, Google uncovered malware concerns with the Pinduoduo app. [12] X Research source While there haven’t been any reported cases of malware with the Temu app, Pinduoduo’s history of malware leaves some users uneasy. Pinduoduo also has a history of mistreating and overworking their employees to the point where several employees passed away.

[14] X Research source Laws related to user data protection don’t exist on a federal level, though, so this issue isn’t unique to just Temu.
