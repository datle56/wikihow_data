      "title": "Swallow the saliva in your mouth to clear phlegm from your throat.",
      "content": "Swallow the saliva in your mouth to clear phlegm from your throat. To perform a dry swallow, close your lips and swallow the saliva in your mouth. Dry swallowing moves the vocal cords around and helps dislodge the mucus causing the problem. [1] X Research source The more you clear your throat, the more you feel like you need to clear it again. That’s a cycle you don’t want to get stuck in! This strategy is quick enough to perform shortly before singing. If dry swallowing doesn’t work for you, try lightly panting, then closing your mouth and swallowing to get the same result."

      "title": "Sip water throughout the day, especially before you sing.",
      "content": "Sip water throughout the day, especially before you sing. Water helps lubricate your throat, and the motion of drinking helps remove mucus from your larynx (or voice box). Drinking water also keeps you hydrated to help prevent mucus from accumulating on your vocal cords in the first place. [2] X Research source Drink room temperature water for 2 hours before you sing. This lubricates your vocal cords and prevents irritation to keep your voice performance-ready. The more you clear your throat, the more you feel like you need to clear it again. That’s a cycle you don’t want to get stuck in! Drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated also helps thin mucus and keep your sinus cavities clear. Clogged sinuses affect the quality of your voice. [3] X Research source Avoid drinking very cold water, which tightens your vocal cords. Additionally, if water is too hot, it may cause extra mucus build-up. Hall recommends, “The best way to clear mucus before singing is to drink some water at a body temperature of about 100 degrees.”"

      "content": "Always do vocal warmups and cooldowns. Warming up your singing voice protects your vocal cords. Hall says, “The best way to clear your throat is by doing a gentle warm-up.” Humming, lip trills, and singing scales are all great ways to warm up before you start to sing. After you practice or perform, take 2-3 minutes to cool down again with humming or quiet singing. Give your voice a rest if you’ve been talking or singing for an extended period. [4] X Research source Use good posture as you rehearse and perform. Don’t try to talk over loud ambient noise. Avoid shouting or screaming."

      "title": "Hum to loosen phlegm when you have the urge to clear your throat.",
      "content": "Hum to loosen phlegm when you have the urge to clear your throat. In a pinch, it helps to gently vibrate your vocal cords whenever you have the urge to clear your throat. Try humming lightly or even quietly laughing to distract yourself, and gently use your vocal cords. It may help vibrate away mucus and remove the desire to clear your throat, which is distracting when you start to sing. Using your voice gently also helps warm it up to sing. If the need to clear your throat continues for a long period of time or worsens, have it evaluated by a doctor. If you have an underlying cause, the problem may become chronic and damage your voice permanently.

      "title": "Use a gentle, breathy cough to clear your throat.",
      "content": "Use a gentle, breathy cough to clear your throat. Instead of making a harsh sound when you feel mucus on your vocal cords, take in a deep breath. Hold it for a count of 5, then release it with a sharp but silent exhale. The movement of air through your vocal cords shakes the mucus off naturally. The urge to clear your throat usually goes away within a few minutes. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Take a shower or breathe in steam to moisten your throat.",
      "content": "Take a shower or breathe in steam to moisten your throat. Inhaling steam soothes irritated vocal folds. It also helps moisturize your throat and vocal cords. Breathe in steam through your nose for 3-5 minutes 2-3 times a day, especially when your voice feels scratchy. The easiest way to breathe steam is in the shower, but running hot water into a sink also works. [7] X Research source Try boiling water on the stove and pouring it into the sink. Don’t breathe in steam standing over a hot stove, though. Run a washcloth under hot water. Wring the washcloth out and then hold it over your mouth and nose and breathe deeply until the washcloth cools."

      "content": "Use a humidifier to prevent dry air and an air filter to reduce allergens. If you’re a singer, pay attention to the air quality in your home. Low humidity – especially in the colder months – dries out your vocal folds and makes your throat feel hoarse. Use a humidifier to keep the humidity in your home between 30% and 50%. [8] X Research source Allergens also cause mucus to build in your sinuses and throat. Use an air purifier with a HEPA filter or regularly change the filter on your HVAC system. [9] X Trustworthy Source American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology National professional organization of allergists, asthma specialists and immunologists that focuses on supporting and publishing research Go to source There’s no consensus about what type of humidifier is the best to use.

      "content": "Manage any acid reflux or silent reflux to protect your voice. Everyone has acid reflux from time to time from bending over or lying down too soon after eating. Chapman recommends taking an antacid to help reduce occasional acid reflux. When it happens more than occasionally, it may cause further damage that affects the quality of your voice. [10] X Research source Talk to your doctor if you experience acid reflux for longer than 2 weeks. If you are feeling hoarse or feel like you have frequent heartburn, see a doctor so they can diagnose and treat acid reflux and minimize damage to your vocal cords. Acid reflux is when acid from the stomach flows into the esophagus and sometimes spills onto your larynx, causing hoarseness and possible damage.

      "content": "Gargle to soothe throat irritation. Many believe that gargling removes mucus from your vocal cords. While the vibration may help knock some mucus loose, gargling is most helpful for soothing irritation at the top of your throat. Stir ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt or baking soda into 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of warm water. Take a mouthful of the solution and tilt your head back. Exhale through your throat to produce “bubbles” in the salt water to gargle for about 30 seconds. [12] X Research source Adding honey helps mask the taste and soothe irritation. Don’t gargle with mouthwash. The alcohol in commercial mouthwashes damages your mucus membranes, which allows bacteria to cause infection. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages before you sing. Caffeine dehydrates your body, which leads to unnecessary friction and irritation of the throat and vocal cords. If you do drink a caffeinated beverage, make sure to drink at least as much water to help your body stay hydrated and keep your voice clear. [14] X Research source Some voice clinicians recommend avoiding caffeine entirely. However, research shows that there’s not enough evidence to back giving up your morning cup of coffee entirely.

      "content": "Limit your consumption of alcohol to avoid dryness. Alcohol irritates and dries out your larynx and vocal cords. Because alcohol causes irritation, drinking causes excess mucus production, which makes clearing your voice more difficult.

      "content": "Avoid spicy foods and dairy that produce phlegm and irritate vocal folds. Eating a diet high in processed sugar, fried food, and fats increases and thickens mucus in your throat. Spicy foods and dairy products cause excess acid in the stomach, which may lead to acid reflux. [17] X Research source Eating spicy food in moderation as part of a healthy diet is fine. Just make sure to avoid it for a few hours before singing. [18] X Research source Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt also increase mucus production which makes you clear your throat more. Try to avoid singing after a big meal. The food in your stomach presses down on your diaphragm, making it more difficult to get the breath support to maintain your tone. [19] X Research source Beware of eating on an empty stomach, which causes weakness or mental fog. Small meals spaced throughout the day will help keep you fueled without affecting your voice."

      "content": "What causes mucus on the vocal cords? Common causes of excess mucus (or catarrh) on your vocal cords are infection, allergies, dehydration, and post-nasal drip. However, acid reflux, nasal polyps, or thyroid issues also damage your vocal cords, which causes a buildup of mucus. [21] X Research source Treating any underlying conditions often helps decrease mucus production."

      "title": "How are a singer’s vocal cords different?",
      "content": "How are a singer’s vocal cords different? While the basic anatomy of a singer’s vocal cords and larynx are the same as anyone else, differences develop over time due to how a singer uses their anatomy. In a trained singer, the structures above the vocal folds are often retracted to the sides, while a normal person’s structures may squeeze together when they strain to sing. [23] X Research source There are some general color variations in singers’ vocal folds. High sopranos might have thin, white, almost bluish vocal folds. The vocal folds of lower voices may be white and more opaque. In the lowest male voices, the folds may be slightly pink. Small blood vessels are often visible on the vocal folds of a long-term professional singer because they require a better blood supply than the average person."

      "title": "Why can’t I stop clearing my throat?",
      "content": "Why can’t I stop clearing my throat? Clearing your throat doesn’t remove the mucus; it simply moves it to the side. So, a few minutes later, it feels like there’s more mucus. Hall says, “You should never do the ‘aha, aha.’ The clearing your throat action slams your vocal cords together. And by slamming your vocal cords together, you create trauma. When you create trauma, the body is going to send more mucus there to relieve the trauma.” If you stay well-hydrated, your mucus thins and lubricates your vocal cords without you even noticing."
