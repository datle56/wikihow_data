      "content": "“Red thoughts” refer to your romantic desires or sexual fantasies. On TikTok, red thought videos describe a romantic or sexual experience you want to share with someone. They usually look like a block of text on a solid red background, and many users forward these videos to their crush or partner to express interest. Red thoughts can include spooning or holding hands with someone you like, but most TikTok videos feature more explicit ideas. Some red thoughts videos convey secret messages via abbreviation. For example, the text “I.J.W.Y.T.M.O.W.M.U.I.L.M.B.” is another way of saying “I just want you to make out with me until I lose my breath.” Red thought videos can also include photos of couples in different positions, followed by a photo of how you want to recreate the image. For instance, there could be a collage of couples holding hands, followed by a photo of two people in bed."

      "content": "Kissing, cuddling, or hugging your crush Red thoughts can be cute, romantic, or spicy, but all of them involve some degree of physical touch. From making out to holding someone in their sleep, think about certain moments from your favorite romantic books, movies, or TV shows that make you feel all tingly inside. Then, use them as inspiration to come up with your own red thoughts (or create your own red thoughts video). “I want to give you hickeys.” “I want to put my hand on your thigh.” “I want to sleep in the same bed as you.”"

      "content": "Test the waters before you send something super explicit. Before you DM a spicy red thoughts video, make sure the other person is comfortable with it. Start by sending them a few cute or romantic red thoughts, then see how they respond to your messages. If they reply in a flirty way or send you a different red thoughts video, you can up the ante and share your freakier fantasies and desires. If the other person doesn’t respond or tells you they’re not interested, apologize and stop sending them these kinds of videos. Respect their boundaries to remain on good terms. To create a red thoughts video, tap the (+) icon at the bottom-center screen, and upload a photo of a red background. Click the “Text” button in the upper right corner, then type in your red thought. Select the “Add sound” button at the top of the screen, and add a song to turn your TikTok into a video. Then, hit the next button and click “Post” to upload your TikTok."
