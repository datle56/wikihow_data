      "content": "Cover nearby items with a drop cloth. You’ll be drilling into the mortar (the sealant in between the bricks) which can produce dust. Covering nearby items will keep them clean. If your items are easily movable, just scoot them out of the way! Also keep your window open, to prevent dust from lingering in the air. [1] X Research source"

You can rub away the extra chalk when you’re done. [2] X Research source Mortar holes can be filled in, but holes in brick can't. Always drill into the mortar, not the brick itself.

      "content": "Position the frame over your mark and have a friend look from across the room. From a distance, your friend can tell you if it looks like a good spot to hang the picture . If it doesn’t look good, readjust. It’s much easier to readjust at this stage than when you’ve already drilled a hole! Most people opt for hanging their pictures at eye-level on open walls, and higher if the picture is going over a fireplace. The average eye level is 57 inches, or 145 cm, above the floor. [4] X Research source If you need to hang a group of pictures, place the largest picture in the middle, and have the center of the group be at 57 inches (145 cm). [5] X Research source If you can't get your picture in the right spot on the wall because of where the mortar falls, you can adjust the hardware on the back of it.

      "content": "Attach a masonry bit to your drill. The masonry bit is to make sure your drill is equipped for the heavy-duty task of drilling through mortar. You can change your drill bit by loosening the chuck (the part that holds the bit), either with your hands or with a chunk key if it has a keyhole. Remove the regular bit and insert the masonry bit so that the smooth part of the bit is facing the chunk. Tighten the chunk, and you’re ready to drill!"

      "content": "Drill a hole into the spot on the mortar you’ve marked with your chalk. To drill , place the tip of the bit against the spot you want to drill, making sure the drill is perpendicular to the wall. Hold the drill steady with both hands and squeeze the trigger gradually until the bit picks up speed. Drill deep enough that a wall anchor will fit in. [8] X Research source It may help to mark the length of your wall anchor on your drill bit with some masking tape, so that you know how deep to drill."

If your picture is under 10 pounds (4.5kg), then a plastic wall anchor will be strong enough to hold it up. If your picture is somehow over 10 pounds (maybe you have an incredibly ornate frame), then opt for a self-drilling anchor."

Use a screwdriver and twist clockwise until the hook is in place. Some wall anchors already have a stud in them for hanging pictures, in which case you can skip this step!"

To make extra sure your picture is hanging evenly, you can place a level on top of the frame, and adjust the position of the picture until it is even."

Instead, use adhesive picture hanging hooks. These have the advantage of coming off without leaving a mark, which is especially desirable in a dorm room or if you have a picky landlord. But adhesive hooks can’t bear as much weight as an anchored hook drilled into the mortar, so make sure your picture is light enough. [11] X Research source"
