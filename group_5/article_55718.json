      "title": "Yes, dolphins sleep with half of their brain active at all times.",
      "content": "Yes, dolphins sleep with half of their brain active at all times. In order to stay close to the surface so they can breathe, dolphins must stay partially awake while they sleep. How do they do this? Simple—one half of their brain sleeps at a time! This is called unihemispheric sleep and lets a dolphin sleep with “one eye open.” [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dolphins alternate which side of their brain is asleep and awake every 2 hours. This way, each side gets an equal amount of rest. [2] X Research source Not only is keeping one eye open important for breathing, but it also helps dolphins stay alert for danger."

      "title": "Dolphins need to surface for air even when they’re sleeping.",
      "content": "Dolphins need to surface for air even when they’re sleeping. Dolphins may live in the water, but they’re mammals, not fish. This means they need to surface every so often to breathe air in and out of their blowhole. [3] X Research source Unlike humans, dolphins don’t have a breathing reflex, so they can’t breathe without thinking about breathing. With one side of their brain being awake at all times, a dolphin is able to surface for air while sleeping. Normally, a dolphin needs to surface for air every 15 to 17 minutes; however, they’ll surface less often when asleep because only one side of their body is awake. [4] X Research source Dolphins have to be partially conscious at all times, even when they're sleeping; otherwise, they may drown. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Dolphins sleep in pods while hovering in the water.",
      "content": "Dolphins sleep in pods while hovering in the water. These beautiful animals are social creatures, so it’s very rare to see them alone. Not only is sleeping in a pod or group of dolphins fun, but it also provides a layer of protection. If one dolphin spots danger when sleeping, they can wake up the rest of their family and quickly swim away or plan an attack. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dolphins are strategic about what side of their brain sleeps first. A dolphin must be looking inside and outside of the pod at all times, so the pod will communicate with each other to see who’s “on the lookout” for their first shift of rest. Then, they'll switch positions."

      "title": "A dolphin needs about 8 hours of sleep a night.",
      "content": "A dolphin needs about 8 hours of sleep a night. However, unlike humans, each side or hemisphere of their brain will sleep in “shifts” so they can stay alert and partly conscious throughout the night. Think of it like a 50/50 split—one side of the brain needs 4 hours of sleep, and then the other side needs 4 hours. [7] X Research source These marine mammals can stay awake for at least 15 days if they have to—how amazing is that?
