      "content": "Make it a habit to wait before you say something. This is hard and it can take a lot of practice, but when you're having a conversation with someone, try to wait a beat or two before you say something. That will give you time to think about what you're going to say, rather than just blurting something out. [1] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. When you do that, you'll often find that you're able to come up with more thoughtful responses to others, and you'll put your foot in your mouth less often.

      "content": "Try not to ramble while you're talking. Have a specific point in mind and stick to it. That way, you'll be more likely to say exactly what you want to, and people will clearly understand what you mean. If you tend to veer off-topic, there's a good chance your message won't get lost in a lot of insignificant details. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Give other people plenty of time to talk. If you're only focused on what you're going to say next, it's impossible to really hear what the other person is saying. [5] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. Instead, when someone else is talking, look them in the eyes and give them your full attention. Once they've shared what they have to say, take a moment to think before you respond. [6] X Research source This will make you seem a lot more thoughtful, and it will also make it easier for you to understand the other person's point of view. When you can put yourself in their shoes, you may be less likely to say something that you'll wish you hadn't. [7] X Research source Also, avoid interrupting people. Not only can it be frustrating for them, but it's impossible to understand their perspective if you keep talking over them. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Encourage others to build on what they're saying. If there's anything you don't understand in a conversation, or if there's something you'd like to hear a little more about, ask the other person follow-up questions to learn more. Avoid questions that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\"—give the person space to elaborate on what they're saying. Not only will that show them that you're interested in what they're saying, but it will help clear up any misunderstandings. [9] X Research source When you have a better understanding of what someone else is saying, it will help you craft a more thoughtful response."

      "title": "Try not to take an argumentative stance.",
      "content": "Try not to take an argumentative stance. If you go into a conversation thinking that you have to \"win\" every time you disagree with someone, you'll tend to come across as combative. [10] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. That can actually lead you to get into more arguments, and you'll be more likely to blurt out something that's hurtful or insensitive. Instead, try to see disagreements as an opportunity to share different points of view and learn from each other. [11] X Research source For instance, if you and a coworker have differing ideas about how to handle an issue at work, don't go into a meeting expecting to butt heads with them. Instead, have an open mind about how the two of you can collaborate and work together to solve the problem. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Use this acronym to check what you're about to say.",
      "content": "Use this acronym to check what you're about to say. If you're about to say something that could possibly hurt someone's feelings, stop and ask yourself: Is it True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary, and Kind? If the answer to any of those questions is no, take a few minutes to figure out if you need to say it at all. If you still think it's important, try to rephrase it in your mind so it does fit all of those categories. [13] X Research source For instance, if you notice that a coworker is struggling to find something in a stack of papers, you might be tempted to say something like, \"You wouldn't have that trouble if you were more organized.\" That might be true, and you might think it's helpful. However, it's questionable whether it's really necessary to point out, and it's unlikely it would come across as inspiring or kind. Instead, you might say something like, \"You know, I read a trick online recently for keeping papers sorted, and I tried it and it's been really working for me. If you want, you can stop by my desk later and I'll show you.\""

      "content": "Think long-term instead of getting wrapped up in the moment. Sometimes it's tempting to just say whatever pops into our minds, especially when we're in a heated conversation. However, that can cause you to lose sight of the things that are really important to you. Even if a perfectly clever insult pops into your mind, take a second to check it against those goals—if it doesn't fit, be the bigger person and let it go. [14] X Research source For example, if you're married, chances are that one of your long-term goals is to be happy with your spouse. In that case, putting them down or pointing out their flaws probably doesn't align with that goal. On the other hand, you might need to have a cool, reasoned conversation about something that bothers you."

      "title": "Don't just talk for the sake of talking.",
      "content": "Don't just talk for the sake of talking. If you want to be seen as someone who speaks carefully, don't join a conversation unless you have something really worthwhile to say. When a thought occurs to you, take a few moments to evaluate whether it adds something of value to the conversation. [15] X Expert Source Sandra Possing Life Coach Expert Interview. 15 July 2020. If it doesn't, let it go and wait until you think of something more substantial to contribute. [16] X Research source For example, if someone mentions a news story, don't just chime in because you read the same article. Instead, reflect on the story for a moment—you'll seem a lot more thoughtful if you can think of something that relates to the bigger picture, like the fact that crime rates have been rising since the new mayor took office."

      "title": "Allow other people to fill gaps in the conversation.",
      "content": "Allow other people to fill gaps in the conversation. If you're uncomfortable with silence, it's tempting to blurt out the first thing you think of when the conversation stalls. However, this can lead you to accidentally say something thoughtless or silly. Instead, just relax and think about what you were just talking about. If you have something valuable to add, jump back in, but if not, see if the other person has something to say, instead. If you come up with a new conversation topic, it's fine to restart the conversation—it doesn't always have to be the other person who talks first. Just keep in mind that it's fine to have a quiet moment of reflection when you're talking to someone. [17] X Research source Silence is also a good option when you're just not sure what to say—it's often better not to say anything than to say the wrong thing. [18] X Research source"

Even if you hear something bad about someone else, don't share it with others. Gossiping is an easy way to hurt people's feelings, but it actually can hurt your reputation, too. People will be less likely to trust you if they think you're going to talk bad about them, too.

      "content": "Be thoughtful of underlying insults and assumptions. Microaggressions are seemingly insignificant comments that, over time, create a hostile environment for people who are typically marginalized, like people of color, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. They include things like backhanded compliments, subtle assumptions, or phrases that are rooted in bias. [21] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Microaggressions include pointing out that a person of color is articulate (which implies there's something unique about that), telling a transgender person that you can't tell they're trans (which sends the message that their worth is based on how well they pass), or asking the only female member of your team to get coffee for everyone. If someone points out that you've done something offensive, listen to them with an open mind and apologize with humility. Also, if you don't understand why it was offensive, don't make that person feel like they're responsible for educating you—read up on it on your own time or ask someone else you trust to explain it to you."
