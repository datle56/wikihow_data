      "title": "Drive to Vinewood Hills.",
      "content": "Drive to Vinewood Hills. This event occurs at 2135 Mo Milton Drive, which is northeast of a tennis court. When you arrive, you will find three members of The Lost MC abducting a young woman and putting her in the back of a van. To protect from damage later on, you should drive a car, truck or van instead of a motorcycle. The random event will be incomplete if you shoot at the Lost members before they drive away."

      "title": "Pursue and kill the Lost members.",
      "content": "Pursue and kill the Lost members. When they take off in their van, chase them and shoot out their tires. If you’re having trouble aiming for the tires, shooting at the back of the van will eventually cause them to stop and exit the vehicle. When they do, shoot and kill them, then collect the ammo they dropped. [1] X Research source An SMG is the best weapon to attack them with, as it fast and powerful at a distance, and can be fired from within a vehicle. Its features are very helpful during the pursuit, if you’re finding it difficult to catch up to them. Don’t shoot at the gas tank. If the van catches fire and explodes, the random event will be considered incomplete. When they exit the van, they will shoot at you with pistols and small machine guns. If you want to avoid damage, exit your vehicle and take cover behind it."

      "title": "Kill or flee from the reinforcements.",
      "content": "Kill or flee from the reinforcements. Once she is safe, the girl will ask you to take her to Ineseno Drive in Chumash. Four more members of The Lost MC will show up on motorcycles and will shoot at you with sawed-off shotguns. Shoot to kill them, shoot at their motorcycles to stop them, or flee from them. If you are in a fast vehicle, such as a sports car, super car or muscle car, fleeing from them is the best option. This is because they can kill the girl by shooting through your vehicle’s windows, which would cause the random event to be incomplete."

      "title": "Drive her home.",
      "content": "Drive her home. The navigation on your radar will lead you to the location of her house. Once you arrive, she will give you her thanks, but no reward. Although you wouldn’t be saving her, if you are playing as Trevor you can take her to the Altruists Cultists. They will pay you $1,000 for taking her to them. Doing so would contribute to the total number people Trevor has taken to the Altruist Cult. After taking four people from random events, a new random event will unlock for Trevor, which leads to a large monetary gain."
