While the oven is preheating, measure out and pour 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of baking soda into a bowl filled with 1 US quart (0.95 L) of warm water. Stir the mixture until the baking soda is completely dissolved. [1] X Research source While you can bake some of the grease and grime off your tin muffin pan with just water, adding the baking soda will help loosen and remove more of the stubborn mess."

Fill each hole until it’s about 2/3 of the way full. Don’t worry if some of the grease and grime is on top of the pan – the steam from the solution combined with the heat from the oven will help you clean the top of the pan as well."

      "content": "Bake the muffin pan for 8 to 20 minutes. If your muffin pan has a lot of old caked-on grease, you’ll likely need to bake the pan for 20 minutes. If you’re just trying to get it clean after a single use, you may only need to bake it for 8 minutes. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove the pan from the oven.",
      "content": "Remove the pan from the oven. Once the muffin pan and solution have baked, remove it from the oven and dump the baking soda solution in the sink. Then, place the pan on a heat-safe surface and let it cool enough that you can handle it but not so long that it’s completely cooled. [4] X Research source Make sure that you use oven mitts to protect your hands when you handle the hot pan."

      "content": "Scrub the muffin pan with warm water and dish soap. Squirt a dime-sized amount of dish soap on a sponge or nylon bristle brush and scrub the pan to remove any remaining grease and grime. While the baking the pan with the baking soda solution will loosen and remove some of the mess, there may still be some that needs to be scrubbed off. [5] X Research source If you use a bristle brush, make sure that you choose a nylon brush so that it will scrub your pan clean without scratching the tin. You could also a microfiber cloth or the soft side of a sponge. [6] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. Once you’ve scrubbed the pan, rinse it with water to remove any soap residue so it’s ready to use."

Then, carefully place the silicone muffin pan under the running water. [7] X Research source If your sink water gets really hot, you’ll likely need to wear rubber gloves to protect your skin. Letting the pan rinse under the hot water first will help some of the grease or baked-on food start to loosen, making it easier for you to scrub off."

If there’s still some grease and grime stuck on your muffin pan after you scrub it with dish soap and water, use a baking soda paste to help loosen it and remove it. [10] X Expert Source James Sears House Cleaning Professional Expert Interview. 28 August 2019. To make the paste, pour about 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of baking soda into a bowl with a small splash of water. Use a spoon to mix the baking soda and water together, adding more baking soda or water as needed to create a thick paste similar in texture to toothpaste. [11] X Research source Instead of making the paste in a bowl, you can also pour baking soda directly onto the pan as soon as you’ve rinsed it while it’s still wet. Then, use your fingers or a spoon to mix the baking soda with the water remaining from the rinse to create the paste. [12] X Research source"

If there is any remaining mess after you let the pan soak, however, you can use a spatula to scrap off caked-on food, and use a sponge to wipe away any grease. After wiping off any remaining grime, you may want to rinse your muffin pan one last time with dish soap and warm water to remove any chemical residue from the dryer sheets."
