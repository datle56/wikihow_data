      "title": "Learn the basic equation.",
      "content": "Learn the basic equation. If a mixed number is a b/c then the equation used to convert it to an improper fraction is (ac+b)/c . [2] X Research source In this equation: A is the whole number. B is the numerator (the top portion of the fraction). C is the denominator (the bottom portion of the fraction)."

    {
      "title": "Remember the order of operations.",
      "content": "Remember the order of operations. BEDMAS or PEMDAS dictates that you must first address the numbers in parentheses. [3] X Research source Since multiplication and division come first, you will first multiply ac . You will then add b , since that figure is also within parentheses. Finally, you will divide by c , or use c as the new denominator. P/BEDMAS stands for parentheses/brackets, exponents, multiply or divide, and add or subtract."

      "title": "Multiply the whole number and the denominator.",
      "content": "Multiply the whole number and the denominator. Take the mixed number 1 ⅔ for example: a = 1 , b = 2 , and c = 3 . Multiply ac, which in this example is 3 x 1 = 3. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the numerator to the product.",
      "content": "Add the numerator to the product. You now know the product of ac = 3 , so now it's time to add b = 2 : 3 + 2 = 5. [5] X Research source This sum, 5, is the new numerator of your improper fraction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rewrite the improper fraction with the new numerator.",
      "content": "Rewrite the improper fraction with the new numerator. Remember that the denominator ( c = 3 ) remains the same from the original fraction, and the new numerator is 5. The improper fraction converted from the original mixed number, therefore, is 5/3 ."

    {
      "title": "Reduce the fraction to its simplest form if necessary.",
      "content": "Reduce the fraction to its simplest form if necessary. The simplest form is the smallest and easiest way to represent a fraction. To reduce a fraction to its simplest form, determine if the numerator and denominator have common factors. If they do, select the highest one and divide the numerator and denominator by that number. [6] X Research source For instance, in the fraction 9/42 , the greatest common factor is 3. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor to get the fraction's simplest form: 9 ÷ 3 / 42 ÷ 3 = 3/14 If you'd like to write the fraction as a decimal, simply divide the numerator by the denominator."

    {
      "title": "Remember the mixed number formula.",
      "content": "Remember the mixed number formula. Just as you can convert a mixed number into an improper fraction, so too can you convert going the other way. Like before, use the formula a b/c for your mixed number. The denominator from your improper fraction will be the same denominator in your mixed number. [7] X Research source For instance, when converting the improper fraction 7/5 into a mixed number, c = 5 ."

    {
      "title": "Divide the improper fraction’s numerator by its denominator.",
      "content": "Divide the improper fraction’s numerator by its denominator. Use long division or a simple calculation to determine how many times the denominator will fully go into the numerator (don't worry about any decimals). That number will be the mixed number’s whole number (the a value). Dividing 7/5 gives you 1.4, where a = 1 ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Determine the remainder.",
      "content": "Determine the remainder. The remainder is your new numerator. When you divide 7/5 you get 1 with a remainder of 2, where b = 2 . You now have all the components of your mixed number: the improper fraction 7/5 gives you the mixed number 1 ⅖ . [8] X Research source"
