While any equation with an x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} term in it qualifies as quadratic, the standard form sets everything to 0. Remember that a , b , c {\\displaystyle a,b,c} are coefficients that can be any real number, so don't substitute any numbers in for them - we want to work with the general form. [1] X Research source a x 2 + b x + c = 0 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c=0} The only condition is that a ≠ 0 , {\\displaystyle a\\neq 0,} because otherwise, the equation reduces to a linear equation. See if you can find general solutions for the special cases where b = 0 {\\displaystyle b=0} and where c = 0. {\\displaystyle c=0.}"

Remember that dividing a polynomial by something means that you divide each of the individual terms. Doing so makes it easier for us to complete the square. x 2 + b a x = − c a {\\displaystyle x^{2}+{\\frac {b}{a}}x={\\frac {-c}{a}}}"

      "content": "Complete the square . Recall that the goal is to rewrite an expression x 2 + 2 ◻ x + ◻ 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+2\\Box x+\\Box ^{2}} as ( x + ◻ ) 2 , {\\displaystyle (x+\\Box )^{2},} where ◻ {\\displaystyle \\Box } is any coefficient. It may not immediately be obvious to you that we can do this. To see it more clearly, rewrite b a x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {b}{a}}x} as 2 b 2 a x {\\displaystyle 2{\\frac {b}{2a}}x} by multiplying the term by 2 2 . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {2}{2}}.} We can do this because multiplying by 1 does not change anything. Now we can clearly see that in our case, ◻ = b 2 a , {\\displaystyle \\Box ={\\frac {b}{2a}},} so we are only missing the ◻ 2 {\\displaystyle \\Box ^{2}} term. Therefore, in order to complete the square, we add that to both sides - namely, ( b 2 a ) 2 = b 2 4 a 2 . {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {b}{2a}}\\right)^{2}={\\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}.} Then, of course, we factor . [4] X Research source x 2 + 2 b 2 a x + b 2 4 a 2 = b 2 4 a 2 − c a ( x + b 2 a ) 2 = b 2 4 a 2 − c a {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}x^{2}+2{\\frac {b}{2a}}x+{\\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}&={\\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}-{\\frac {c}{a}}\\\\\\left(x+{\\frac {b}{2a}}\\right)^{2}&={\\frac {b^{2}}{4a^{2}}}-{\\frac {c}{a}}\\end{aligned}}} Here, it is clear why a ≠ 0 , {\\displaystyle a\\neq 0,} since a {\\displaystyle a} is in the denominator, and you cannot divide by 0. If you need to, you can expand the left side to confirm that completing the square works."

When you take the square root of d 2 , {\\displaystyle d^{2},} you do not get d . {\\displaystyle d.} You actually get its absolute value, | d | . {\\displaystyle |d|.} This absolute value is critical in getting both roots - simply putting square roots over both sides will only get you one of the roots.

We can do this because the absolute value does not distinguish between positive and negative, so they are both valid. This tidbit is why the quadratic equation allows us to get two roots. x + b 2 a = ± b 2 − 4 a c 4 a 2 {\\displaystyle x+{\\frac {b}{2a}}=\\pm {\\sqrt {\\frac {b^{2}-4ac}{4a^{2}}}}} Let's simplify this expression a bit further. Since the square root of a quotient is the quotient of the square roots, we can write the right side as ± b 2 − 4 a c 4 a 2 . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{\\sqrt {4a^{2}}}}.} Then we can take the square root of the denominator. x + b 2 a = ± b 2 − 4 a c 2 a {\\displaystyle x+{\\frac {b}{2a}}={\\frac {\\pm {\\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}}"
