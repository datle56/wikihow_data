I definitely lost track of time this past week, and I’m sorry that I forgot to give you a call.” In the past, many narcissists were berated when they showed any sign of weakness—because of this, they’re may not willing to take the blame for anything.

I’m stepping back until you’re ready to have an actual conversation.” “You’re speaking to me in a disrespectful tone, and that’s not okay with me.
