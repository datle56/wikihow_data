When these ingredients are combined at the right temperature, they harden into soap in a process called saponification.

      "content": "Set up your soap-making workspace. It's easiest to clear a space in the kitchen since you'll need to heat the ingredients over the stove. You'll be working with lye, a dangerous chemical, so make sure children and pets are not underfoot while you work. [2] X Research source Spread newspaper over a table and assemble the following equipment, which can be sourced online or from your local craft store: Safety goggles and rubber gloves, to protect you from the lye. A scale to weigh the ingredients. A large stainless steel or enamel kettle. Do not use aluminum, and do not use a pot lined with a non-stick surface. A glass or plastic wide-mouth pitcher, to hold the water and lye. A two-cup plastic or glass measuring cup. Plastic or wooden spoons. A stick blender, also called an immersion blender. This isn't absolutely necessary, but it reduces stirring time by about an hour. Two glass thermometers that register between 80-100 degrees F. Candy thermometers work well for this purpose. Plastic molds that are suitable for cold process soapmaking, or shoebox, or a wooden mold. If you use a shoebox or wooden mold, line it with parchment paper. Multiple towels for cleanup."

Keep the following in mind as you handle lye or raw soap before it has been cured: [3] X Research source Lye should never touch your skin, as it will burn you. Wear safety goggles and glove at all times while handling lye and raw soap. Work with lye outside or in a well-ventilated area to avoid breathing in fumes."

      "content": "Add the lye to the water. Place the container of water under your stove's running exhaust fan, or make sure the windows are open and the room is well-ventilated. Add the lye to the water slowly, stirring gently with a spoon until the lye is completely dissolved. It is very important to add the lye to the water and not the other way around; if you add the water to the lye, the reaction between the two substances is too quick, and may be dangerous. As you add the lye to the water, it will heat the water and release fumes. Keep your face turned away to avoid inhaling the fumes. Set the mixture aside. Allow it to cool and let the fumes dissipate."

[4] X Research source Stir with a wooden or heat-resistant spoon; do not use metal. You may instead use a stick blender to stir the lye and oils. Continue to mix for about 10-15 minutes until \"tracing\" occurs; you'll see your spoon leave a visible trace behind it, like one you'd see when making pudding. If you're using a stick blender, this should occur within about 5 minutes. If you don't see tracing within 15 minutes, let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes before continuing to mix again."

[5] X Research source Use an old plastic spatula to scrape out the last bits of soap from the pot to the mold. Be sure you are still wearing gloves and safety goggles during this step since raw soap is caustic and can burn skin. Carefully hold the mold an inch or two above the table and drop it. Do this a few times to work out any air bubbles inside the raw soap."

If you're using a soap mold, tape a piece of cardboard over the top before adding towels. [6] X Research source The towels help insulate the soap to allow saponification to occur. Leave the soap covered, undisturbed, and out of air drafts (including the air-conditioner) for 24 hours."

[7] X Research source If you measured accurately and followed the directions, the soap may have a light layer of a white ash-like substance on the top. This is basically harmless and can be scraped away with the edge of an old ruler or metal spatula. If the soap has a deep oily film on top, it cannot be used, because it has separated. This will occur if your measurements were not accurate, you did not stir long enough, or if there is a drastic difference in the temperatures of the lye and oils when they are mixed. If the soap did not set at all, or has white or clear pockets in it, this means it is caustic and cannot be used. This is caused by under-stirring during the soap-making process."
