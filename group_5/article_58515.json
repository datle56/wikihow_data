To post a video to Facebook and have it play on Facebook rather than redirect to YouTube, you'll have to download the video in question and upload it to Facebook . Facebook videos must meet the following criteria: Facebook only allows videos of up to 10 gigabytes and no longer than 240 minutes. Videos should have a resolution of 1080p or less. Use this method only if you or your organization created and owns the copyright to the original video or if you have permission from the copyright owner. Simply adding video credit by adding their name to the Facebook post is unlikely to be good enough."
