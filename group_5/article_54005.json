Then, check around the door for signs of smoke or heat. If you see glowing embers or black smoke through the door, you also should not open it. [3] X Research source Use an alternate escape method to leave the building, but don’t use an elevator—these are unreliable and can malfunction during a fire, leaving you trapped."

      "content": "Make sure your door remains closed but unlocked upon exit. This will help reduce the spread of fire to your room if the fire manages to reach there, as well as ensure that any fire that might be in your room does not escape and create a dangerous situation for evacuees. Doors do an effective job at stopping fire, which is why the NFPA and numerous fire departments recommend closing your bedroom door before you go to sleep.

Seal the doors and any window vents with wet towels or sheets if you’re unable to evacuate or are ordered to stay in place. Then, focus on getting the attention of firefighters by opening a window and waving something colorful or bright. [7] X Research source This might be the best option if you’re on the higher floor of a building. Climb from a window, patio, or balcony only if it is safe to do so."

(A firebreak is an area that has comparatively less material for the fire to consume, like a rocky area or field of boulders, road, body of water, or patch of large trees that might retain more moisture than other nearby foliage.)

If you find such an enclosure, try to quickly dig it out to create a space deep enough for you to fit your body. Crawl in, preferably with your feet facing the direction of the fire, and cover yourself with dirt. Make sure you can breathe as you take cover. [11] X Research source If a wildfire is within close range, surrounding you, or otherwise blocking all means of downhill and upwind escape (and if no safe locations are available), you might have to resort to running through the fire’s leading edge into an area that’s already burned."

Prevent getting stuck in a wildfire before hiking or camping by assessing risks like weather conditions, extreme drought, any buildup of dry materials in your hiking or camping area, and the wind’s direction. Check with local park rangers if there is any threat of wildfire in your area. [13] X Research source Don’t build a campfire in dry conditions, especially if your park ranger lets you know there’s a local burn ban. If it’s safe to build a campfire, keep it small, contained, and away from trees or shrubs. Never leave it unattended. Make sure your campfire is completely extinguished before you leave by pouring a lot of water over it, stirring the ashes, pouring more water, making sure there’s no hissing sound, and making sure it’s cool to the touch."
