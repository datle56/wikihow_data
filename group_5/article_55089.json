Then, let the baking soda sit for 1 hour to give it time to soak up the odor. After that, vacuum up the baking soda. Once you're done, your couch should be smelling fresh and clean once again.

      "content": "Opt for this method if the stench is particularly strong. This option is safe for fabric couches with an S or SW tag (this means that the couch can be cleaned with a solvent). [2] X Research source Mix 2 cups (470 mL) hydrogen peroxide, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) baking soda, and 2 drops of liquid dish soap together. Then, pour the solution into a spray bottle. Spray the solution on the smelly parts of your couch and let it air dry. This method should have your couch smelling good as new in no time. [3] X Research source The S or SW tag is usually found on the bottom of your detachable seat cushions. [4] X Research source If you don't have a spray bottle on hand, try temporarily emptying out a spray bottle with a different cleaning solution, cleaning it, and filling it up with your homemade solution. After spraying the area with the cleaning solution, your couch should be dry within 24 hours."

      "content": "Spray an odor-eliminating product where the vomit was. To really get rid of the smell (and not just cover it up), opt for an unscented odor-eliminating product. Purchase the product online or at a home improvement store in your area. Before you spray the product, make sure your couch has an S or SW tag. Then, spray it on your couch over the affected area according to the product instructions. Wait for it to dry and your couch will likely be smelling a whole lot better. [7] X Research source Alternatively, use a pet odor eliminator spray to get the job done. Products like Nature's Miracle can work wonders to remove the smell of vomit. You might also try Febreze Fabric Pet Odor Eliminator or Angry Orange Pet Odor Eliminator. To use, spray the product on the affected area and let it dry."

This can help you freshen up the whole space after an accident. [8] X Research source Use a segment of pantyhose if you don't have a cheesecloth. Pour the coffee grounds into the pantyhose and tie it closed on both sides to secure the grounds inside. Alternatively, try setting a cup of coffee beans on a table in the room. This can help mask the smell of vomit in the air as you wait for it to dissipate. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Use this along with another cleaning method. Once you've applied baking soda, white vinegar, or any other previously listed method to your couch, spray air freshener throughout the room to ensure that the smell is totally gone. If you're not sure what to use, try Febreze. As an alternative, go for Lysol. Avoid simply spraying the air freshener without pairing it with another method. These sprays are usually not strong enough to completely eliminate the vomit smell on their own."

Pour 1-2 cap fulls of fabric softener into a bowl of water. Then, place it on a table in the same room as the couch and let it sit overnight. The next morning, the room should smell much better!

      "content": "This works for solvent and water-safe couches. If at-home methods don't work, rent a upholstery steam cleaner. First, check your couch's label for the letters \"SW\" (this means it's solvent and water safe). Then, search online for a steam cleaning service in your area and rent a steam cleaner. To use the machine, fill it up with water according to the instructions. Then, clean the pillows and cushions first. Once you're done, clean the couch's frame in segments. If you see an \"X\" on the couch label, that means it's not safe to steam clean. Make sure you use a device meant for upholstery steam cleaning, not carpet. To ensure that you're using the device correctly, follow the instructions (your device should come with a manual). Steam clean your couch's frame in segments to give time for the water to dry. Cleaning the whole frame at once will drench your couch in water, which ups the risk of water damage."

Search online for a professional steam cleaning or upholstery cleaning service in your area. If you have a leather or suede couch, ask if they have services to clean these types of materials. Usually, cleaning companies offer special services to safely clean leather and suede. [13] X Expert Source Haim Shemesh Carpet & Rug Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 12 May 2020."
