      "content": "Even though it seems a little bit early, a time of about 9:30 pm (or earlier) is good for teenagers, or who will be the next day! Being tired may ruin your day and you might suffer from tiredness, lack of concentration and headaches. Avoid it by getting the sleep you need. Use a comfy pillow and duvet, take a shower,and do some reading before you switch out the light, as this could help you to sleep better."

      "content": "Once you get to the school gate, people will almost certainly say \"Happy Birthday!\" and give you hugs. If this happens, say something friendly, like \"Thanks!\" or \"Can't wait till tonight!\" If you receive presents, say thank you. Of course, it is entirely your choice whether you open them there in front of your friends. You could just pop them in your bag to save for later. However, do look at the parcel, be careful with presents, say thank you and be appreciative."

      "content": "Of course, there may be some silly people who are nasty to people, whether it's their birthday or not. This can be upsetting, even if it's just a stupid comment that people say. A good way to deal with this is to spend time with your friends, ones who are really nice, caring and talkative, not your so called \"mates\" who make you feel miserable. If someone is mean enough to be spiteful you could say \"It's my birthday today so I'm going to do things that I enjoy, and not waste my time talking to you\" or, if they call you a name, something like \"That's not true. Now if you wouldn't mind, I have a birthday to enjoy, so bye!\" and you could walk away. Names can really hurt, so try not to let people ruin your day. Just think of the presents and cards you'll get later and you will probably cheer up. However, do confide in a close friend if someone is upsetting you a lot. They can support you and be a friend."
