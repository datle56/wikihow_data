      "content": "Clean the wall and ceiling. Remove old backing paper or wallpaper from the wall and ceiling where you will install the coving. Use a sponge and water to wipe down the wall and ceiling. Ensure that the sponge is damp, but not dripping water. Scrub the surfaces to remove all dust or leftover wallpaper paste."

      "content": "Measure the coving. [1] X Research source Use a tape measure to determine the width of the coving you will be using. Measure from the bend in the coving to the outside edge of the coving on both the ceiling and wall sides. Measure the length of coving you will need to cover the space on your wall and ceiling. Divide the length to be covered by the length of coving strips that you have. If you require a total of 60 feet (18.3 m) of coving and have coving in 3-foot (.9-m) strips, then you will need at least 20 strips of coving. Ensure that you have a few extra strips of coving."

The ceiling edge of the coving should touch the bottom base of the miter block. Situate the coving so the display side faces you."
