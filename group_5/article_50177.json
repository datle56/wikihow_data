      "title": "Avoid touching the celebrity.",
      "content": "Avoid touching the celebrity. Though you may be tempted to grab or touch the celebrity in your excitement to meet them, avoid doing this. Do not grab the celebrity’s hand or touch them in any way unless they seem open to touching. Approach the celebrity as someone you have just met and respect their personal space. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be respectful of the celebrity's personal space.",
      "content": "Be respectful of the celebrity's personal space. Avoid standing too close to the celebrity or placing your body in their personal space. If the celebrity is behind a table, stay on your side of the table. [2] X Research source If there is no table between you and the celebrity, stand at a respectable distance from the celebrity. This will show them that you are engaged in the meet and greet and are able to respect their personal space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shake hands with the celebrity only if they offer it.",
      "content": "Shake hands with the celebrity only if they offer it. Most celebrities at meet and greets will offer to shake hands with you. Let the celebrity offer first and then shake their hand firmly and briefly. Waiting for the celebrity to initiate the handshake will show them you are able to respect their boundaries. [3] X Research source Some celebrities may offer different forms of greeting, like a hi-five or a wave. Respond in kind by hi-fiving them back or waving back. Let the celebrity dictate the terms of the interaction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have an open and friendly demeanor.",
      "content": "Have an open and friendly demeanor. The meet and greet should still feel warm and friendly, especially if you are meeting a celebrity you really admire. You should focus on maintaining open body language, where you maintain eye contact with the celebrity and position your body so it faces the celebrity. [4] X Research source You should also let your excitement come through on your face by smiling at the celebrity. Show off your smile and let your happiness light up your face. This will signal to the celebrity that you are thrilled to meet them in a respectful and appropriate way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Plan out your questions or thoughts in advance.",
      "content": "Plan out your questions or thoughts in advance. To avoid getting overwhelmed by your meeting with the celebrity, you may want to sit down and plan out a few questions for them. Try to choose one main question you would like to ask the celebrity and/or one thought you would like to share with them. This will allow you to gather your thoughts and be prepared for the meet and greet. [5] X Research source You may ask a simple question, like, “What inspired you to make this film/create this album/write this book?” Or, you may ask a more specific question that may be obscure to show the celebrity that you are a true fan. For example, you may ask, “Why do you always end your songs with two claps?” or “How did it feel to work with Mia Farrow in Deadweight?” Often, more obscure questions will impress the celebrity and help you stand out from the crowd of fans."

    {
      "title": "Speak calmly and clearly to the celebrity.",
      "content": "Speak calmly and clearly to the celebrity. Take a deep breath once it is your turn to speak to the celebrity. Greet them with a “hello” or “hi”, as well as a handshake or a wave, if they initiate it. Smile and speak calmly to them, maintaining eye contact. Try to speak slowly and clearly, just like you would speak to a friend or someone you admire."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compliment the celebrity’s work.",
      "content": "Compliment the celebrity’s work. Most meet and greets allow for only a few minutes with the celebrity. Once you greet the celebrity, you may transition quickly into a compliment about the celebrity’s work. You may also ask your one question at this point, initiating conversation with the celebrity. Try to stick to one to two questions or compliments, as you do not want to take up too much of the celebrity’s time. This is especially important if you are in front of a long line of fans and do not want to hog time with the celebrity. If the celebrity responds to your questions, be respectful and listen to their answers without interruption. Make sure you say “please” and “thank you” when appropriate, as this will show the celebrity you are treating them like a fellow human being who happens to be famous. Plus, it is just polite and good manners."

      "title": "Request an autograph, if allowed.",
      "content": "Request an autograph, if allowed. You should bring an item you would like to be autographed, such as a picture of the celebrity or a copy of their work. Only ask for an autograph if it is permitted at the meet and greet. If there is a sign that clearly states no autographs, do not request one as this could seem rude or presumptuous. Consider asking for the celebrity's autograph at the end of the meeting as a way to close out your meet and greet with them. Make sure you bring a pen with you and have the item ready so you can easily hand it to the celebrity to sign."

    {
      "title": "Do not take pictures of the celebrity if it is not allowed.",
      "content": "Do not take pictures of the celebrity if it is not allowed. If there is a sign that clearly states no photography is allowed at the meet and greet, do not ask for a picture anyway or try to sneak a photograph with the celebrity. This could be seen as rude by the celebrity and annoy them. You may want to check with the meet and greet event to see if photography is allowed so you are aware of the policy in advanced. Some celebrities are more comfortable with having a one on one conversation with fans, rather than taking pictures."

    {
      "title": "Ask if you can take a photo with the celebrity.",
      "content": "Ask if you can take a photo with the celebrity. If there is no sign that says “no photographs allowed”, you should ask for a photograph with the celebrity before you take it. Some celebrities will have a photographer at the event who will take pictures for you. Other meet and greets allow you to take pictures with the celebrity on your own camera by asking a friend to take it for you. You may want to read more on how to pose in a photograph . Make sure you have a big smile and maintain eye contact with the camera as you take the photograph with the celebrity. Try to appear happy but relaxed in the photograph. You can then treasure the photograph with the celebrity for years to come."

      "title": "Bring gifts for the celebrity, if allowed.",
      "content": "Bring gifts for the celebrity, if allowed. You may decide to bring personalized gifts for the celebrity to give to them. Most meet and greets will specify if it is okay for you to bring gifts for the celebrity. If it is allowed, you may give the celebrity the gift at the end of your interaction with them as a parting gift. Many celebrities appreciate fan made gifts and will perceive the gift as your way of saying “thank you” and “I love you” at the end of the meet and greet. You may want to create a custom gift for the celebrity, where you use their image to create a t-shirt, an original painting, or another craft project. You could then sign your work and give it to the celebrity as a gift. You may also choose a gift that will show the celebrity what a big fan you are, such as an item that references their role in a movie or a commemorative item that relates to their verse in a rap song. Get creative and present a gift that is memorable to the celebrity."
