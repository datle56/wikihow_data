      "title": "The Gamine is one of the 13 original Kibbe body types.",
      "content": "The Gamine is one of the 13 original Kibbe body types. David Kibbe originally identified a total of 13 body types that fall along a yin/yang spectrum in his book Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle As Only You Can . [1] X Research source On this spectrum, yin represents a more romantic, feminine figure, while yang is associated with a dramatic, masculine figure. [2] X Research source Kibbe believes that knowing your unique yin/yang balance can help you choose clothing, hair, and makeup that looks natural on you. The other 12 Kibbe body types are Dramatic, Soft Dramatic, Flamboyant Natural, Natural, Soft Natural, Dramatic Classic, Classic, Soft Classic, Flamboyant Gamine, Soft Gamine, Theatrical Romantic, and Romantic. Kibbe has removed the pure Gamine, Classic, and Natural body types from his system because he believes no one falls perfectly into these types. However, many still find these categories useful for determining personal style."

      "title": "Pure Gamines are a balanced combination of yin and yang.",
      "content": "Pure Gamines are a balanced combination of yin and yang. The Gamine falls in the middle of this spectrum with a combination of contrasting feminine and masculine characteristics. The pure Gamine body type tends to have the delicate physique and narrow hands and feet that are associated with yin. On the other hand, gamines have the square shoulders and long arms and legs associated with yang. When a Gamine gains weight, it tends to accumulate in the hips and waist, giving them a square or stocky shape. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The Gamine spectrum also includes the Soft and Flamboyant Gamines.",
      "content": "The Gamine spectrum also includes the Soft and Flamboyant Gamines. All three Gamines have small features with angular bone structures. However, there are a few characteristics that differentiate them from one another. [4] X Research source Soft Gamine is slightly taller with shorter arms and legs. She has a delicate hourglass shape with slightly rounded hips. The Soft Gamine is slightly softer and curvier than the pure Gamine. Her facial features are also softer than the more angular pure Gamine. The Soft Gamine can have shorter arms and legs. [5] X Research source Flamboyant Gamine is short but often appears taller than she is because her arms and legs are long in relation to her torso. Her waist is straight or very slightly defined. The Flamboyant Gamine looks slightly stronger and more square than the pure Gamine. Their angularity is slightly broader than that of other Gamines but still not broad. They also tend to look a little younger than the pure Gamines. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Gamine Physical Characteristics",
      "content": "Gamine Physical Characteristics Gamines are often very petite with a figure that is straight, lithe, and lean. The Gamine tends to be sinewy with a flat bustline, and their legs are often described as “coltish.” If you have most of the following characteristics, your body type is most likely a Kibbe Gamine: [7] X Research source 5’5” inches & under Square body shape Angular or delicate bone structure Square or tapered shoulders Long arms & legs Slightly short-waisted Small, narrow hands & feet Medium to small bustline Slightly defined or straight waist Narrow, boyish hips Slender forearms"

      "title": "Gamine Facial Characteristics",
      "content": "Gamine Facial Characteristics Gamines have sharp facial features with large eyes. They often have a blend of masculine and feminine features, like a strong jawline combined with fuller lips. [8] X Research source This combination gives them a cute and boyish appearance that is still delicately feminine. Here is a list of facial features associated with the Kibbe Gamine: Sharp, delicate facial features Large eyes Straight lips that are slightly fuller Taut cheeks with slightly sharper cheekbones Tapered jawline Medium to small nose with a hint of sharpness"

      "content": "Non-Gamine Characteristics If you’re still questioning whether you fit into the Gamine category, there are characteristics that are never seen in this body type. A Gamine body type will never: [9] X Research source Be over 5’5” tall Have an extremely large bone structure Have prominent or exotic features (except for large eyes) Have large hands & feet Have an hourglass figure with a wasp waist Have a full bust & hips Have a symmetrical body or facial features"

      "title": "Wear crisply tailored clothing with severe lines.",
      "content": "Wear crisply tailored clothing with severe lines. When dressing your Gamine body type, think of fitted garments with precise tailoring to match your yin energy combined with crisp fabrics and sharp detailing for your yang energy. Use straight lines to create a severe silhouette for the most flattering look. [10] X Research source An abundance of detailing adds interest to the precisely fitted pieces. Professional stylist Christina Santelli advises clients to remember that “style is being comfortable in your clothing. I always think people that have good style also have good fitting clothes.”"

      "title": "Choose well-tailored tops with sharp details.",
      "content": "Choose well-tailored tops with sharp details. Shirts and blouses that are very tailored or form-fitting in stiff fabrics like crisp cotton or oriental silk are the best choices. Look for sharp cuffs, collars, and pleating. Wear cropped shirts or tuck shirts in to maintain a boyish look with a square silhouette. [11] X Research source Avoid anything oversized or unstructured that can swallow your petite frame. Stay away from frills and flimsy, sheer materials that can throw off your natural yin/yang balance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try cropped pants with pleating or a skin-tight fit.",
      "content": "Try cropped pants with pleating or a skin-tight fit. Crisp detailing like cuffs and pleats on pants with sharp waistlines compliment your straight figure. Skin-tight, stretchy pants in cropped lengths from the calf to the top of the ankle are excellent choices that bring your long legs into balance. [12] X Research source Avoid baggy, unstructured styles with tapered legs that can overwhelm your petite frame. Give plain-front pants and drapey styles a pass because they clash with your square silhouette."

    {
      "title": "Opt for short skirts with straight cuts and narrow hemlines.",
      "content": "Opt for short skirts with straight cuts and narrow hemlines. Always go with short skirts that have very fitted waistlines. Crisp gathers can work, but only if they’re small and shallow. Keep hemlines above the kneecap and, as Image Consultant Kalee Hewlett recommends, “go for something that has a little bit of stretch because it's really challenging to walk when it’s that tight and the fabric doesn't breathe.” If the skirt is very slightly flared, it can graze the top of your calf. If you’d like to wear a longer skirt, try a pencil skirt with a high slit. [13] X Research source Avoid full, flouncy skirts that can make you look extremely young and clash with your boyish yang energy. Oversized or strong A-lines can look dowdy on you because your petite frame can get lost in all that fabric."

      "title": "Go for very tailored dresses with lots of crisp detailing.",
      "content": "Go for very tailored dresses with lots of crisp detailing. A trim dress in a fabric that keeps its shape is ideal for Gamines. A dropped waist or asymmetrical hemline that calls back to the flapper styles of the 1920s is a fun way to showcase your long legs. Slim mini dresses like those worn in the 1960s are another great choice. [14] X Research source Avoid flowy, flouncy dresses since they can seem too feminine for your yang energy. Ornate styles with lots of shirring or plain unstructured styles are too much for your petite stature."

    {
      "title": "Wear sweaters with skinny knits or ribbed styles with fitted waists.",
      "content": "Wear sweaters with skinny knits or ribbed styles with fitted waists. Short, cropped cardigans with ribbing at the wrist are extremely flattering. Ribbed collars and waistlines are also good choices. Thick knits can work for you as long as they are fitted at the waistline. Avoid oversized sweaters, heavy textures, and fluffy knits that are too bulky for your delicate bone structure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose very fitted jackets in cropped lengths.",
      "content": "Choose very fitted jackets in cropped lengths. A men's-style bomber jacket can work for you as long as it’s got a short, cropped length. Try a precisely fitted, structured blazer with a sharp lapel and piping or other trim to accentuate the crisp lines. [15] X Research source Avoid long jackets or anything too unstructured or oversized because they can make you look like you’re borrowing a larger person’s clothes. Stay away from ruffles, droopy lace trim, and ruffles."

    {
      "title": "Try angular shoe styles with unusual shapes in the toe and heel.",
      "content": "Try angular shoe styles with unusual shapes in the toe and heel. Choose lightweight materials in fun and funky styles that use trimming or patent leather . Asymmetrical detailing, wedges, and sharp points are all good choices for the pure Gamine body type. All types of flats work for you, as do bold colors and printed fabrics, like plaids and stripes. [16] X Research source Avoid overly delicate or strappy styles that can accentuate your narrow feet and make them seem overly delicate. Plain pumps don’t match your fun sense of style, so give them a pass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Always opt for crisp fabrics with flat or very light textures.",
      "content": "Always opt for crisp fabrics with flat or very light textures. Mid-weight fabrics capable of holding defined shapes and precise tailoring are best. A matte finish is the most flattering choice, but the occasional metallic can add a little extra pizzazz to your eveningwear. [17] X Research source Avoid rough textures or oversized floppy fabrics because they can seem heavy on your delicate frame. Sheer, flowing fabrics that drape can’t hold up to the precise tailoring that looks best on your body type."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for sharp, colorful prints with a contemporary feel.",
      "content": "Go for sharp, colorful prints with a contemporary feel. Geometric and angular prints that make you think of Picasso’s paintings are a perfect choice. Gamines can also get away with larger prints that are almost cartoonish as long as they aren’t oversized. [18] X Research source Avoid watercolor prints that are too ornate or symmetrical for your already-balanced square frame. Intricate or realistic prints are not as flattering because they can come off as a little too serious for the Gamine’s boyish style."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose small accessories with sharp contrast in color and detail.",
      "content": "Choose small accessories with sharp contrast in color and detail. Carry clutches or bags that are small and boxy. Wear belts that are either stiff leather or elastic fabric in bright colors with geometric buckles. Try small hats like berets or cloches that have crisp lines and tailoring. [19] X Research source Avoid anything oversized, whether it’s a big, floppy hat or a giant hobo bag. Ornate or heavy styles are also a no-go for this petite body type. Accessories are crucial, Hewlett advises, because “working with belts, scarves, shoes, jewelry really help to transform basics. They can add pops of color, pops of print, and they can add a whole new dimension to the look.”"

      "title": "Short or cropped hairstyles with a tousled finish look amazing on Gamines.",
      "content": "Short or cropped hairstyles with a tousled finish look amazing on Gamines. Bobbed hair is always a go-to, especially if worn with an angled or asymmetrical cut. [20] X Research source If you choose a bob, ask for layering around the face to soften a more geometric cut. Alternatively, a side part can bring more asymmetry into your look, no matter what hairstyle you choose. However, the signature hairstyle for all 3 of the Kibbe Gamine body types is the Pixie cut, which fits their balanced masculine and feminine energy. [21] X Research source Avoid long hair and heavy bangs that can hide or overwhelm your delicate facial bone structure. Overly smooth or blunt cuts can look too severe with your sharp features."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep makeup fresh-faced with an emphasis on your eyes.",
      "content": "Keep makeup fresh-faced with an emphasis on your eyes. Glowy or slightly dewy foundation looks great on you. Light contouring with subtle highlighter can emphasize your natural “lit-from-within” complexion. Play up your big “doe-eyes” with smokey eye colors and heavy mascara. Choose deeper shades for your cheeks and lips. Dial up the glitz for your evening look with a liberal application of sheer sparkle on your cheekbones, temples, collarbones…basically, any spot you want to showcase. [22] X Research source Avoid soft watercolors or frosty makeup sheens and neutral looks without the more dramatic eye and lip makeup. “No-makeup” makeup looks are too plain and can tip the balance toward the masculine side of the scale, making you look a little too boyish."

Kibbe identified several celebrity Gamines in his book, but there’s some disagreement over who fits the category since he removed this body type from his official system.
