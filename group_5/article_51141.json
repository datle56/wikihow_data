Bring them back to an enclosed location on your farm that has a pool of water. Similar to frogs, axolotls can’t be “tamed” like wolves and cats . To automatically get the lush cave biome, create a new world with seeds like: 4726055113674905895 -6281032827949366960 8982479184696970002 You can also attach a lead to an axolotl and guide it around. Just keep it close to the water, as axolotls die if they spend more than 5 minutes continuously on land. [1] X Research source"

Hearts will appear over both axolotls’ heads, and a few seconds later, a baby axolotl will be born. To get a bucket of tropical fish: Scoop up a tropical fish in a bucket. These fish are found in oceans, lush caves (like axolotls), and mangrove swamps. [2] X Research source"
