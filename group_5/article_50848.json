Your siblings will probably look to you to see how they should treat your parents, so try to set a good example by being appreciative and kind whenever you can. For instance, try not to complain when your parents ask you to do chores, help them with tasks like putting away groceries, and say \"Thank you\" when they take you and your siblings out to dinner.

In addition to showing your siblings how they should act, this will likely help you have a closer relationship with your parents!

If you're disrespectful to your parents when your siblings aren't around, they still might pick up on your attitude or hear your parents talking about it later. If you disagree with your parents, don't shout, roll your eyes, or call them names. Instead, wait until you've calmed down, then ask your parents if you can talk about whatever you're upset about."

      "content": "Model polite behavior in front of your siblings. Although it's always important to be courteous, when your siblings are around, try to be extra conscious of being polite. For instance, try to remember to say things like, \"Please,\" \"Thank you,\" and \"Excuse me\" whenever it's appropriate. Often, your siblings will pick up on this without even realizing it, just because you do it.

      "content": "Help out around your home. One great way to be a responsible older sister is to show your younger siblings the importance of being a good helper in your home. That might mean helping your parents do laundry, tidying up your room, getting your siblings ready for school, or setting the table before dinner, for instance. Whatever you do to help, try to do it with a cheerful attitude to inspire your younger siblings to do the same. [4] X Research source Try to do these things just for the sake of being helpful, not because you expect any kind of reward for doing it. If you're not sure what you can do to help, try asking one of your parents for ideas. For instance, you might say, \"Hey Mom, I know you're really busy. Is there anything I could do to help you with dinner?\""

      "content": "Apologize if you make a mistake. Everyone messes up sometimes, so don't worry about being a perfect big sister. If you do something wrong, own up to it. Say you're sorry, and accept any consequences for your actions. That way, your younger siblings will know that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as you try to fix them and do better next time.

If they see you prioritizing your schoolwork, they may be more inclined to study hard as well, since they'll feel like they need to live up to your example.

Even if you don't feel like there's anything you can do to help, something as small as being kind to someone can help shape how your younger siblings see the world.

      "content": "Avoid risky behaviors that your siblings might copy. While it's natural that you're going to want to live your own life, try to avoid things could get you into trouble. When you're faced with a temptation, take a moment to think about what your siblings would think if they saw you. Even if they're not around when you do it, the consequences could still affect them, and they may be more likely to follow down the same path. For instance, don't start smoking, or quit if you already do. If you're a smoker, your younger siblings may be more likely to smoke as well."

That will help you have a closer relationship now, as well as in the future when you're all living your own lives. In addition, avoid comparing yourself to your siblings.

However, they're usually just doing this to get a reaction out of you, and the attention that follows. When they're doing that, take a deep breath to stay calm, then try to redirect them to something positive. For instance, if your brother is copying everything you say, instead of getting really annoyed, try saying something like, \"Are you bored? Let's write a song together!\""

      "content": "Be mature during conflicts with your siblings. Even if you try your best to be patient, it's almost inevitable that you'll fight with your siblings at some point. However, it's easy to say and do hurtful things when you're mad, so it's best to walk away if you can. Once you feel yourself starting to heat up, take a few deep breaths, then ask if you can have some time alone. When you feel more calm, you can try to talk to your sibling about what happened, if you'd like. For instance, if your brother was horseplaying and accidentally tore your sweater, you might want to yell at him or even hit him. However, it's important to calm yourself down, then later, explain that he really upset you by being careless. Sometimes, your younger siblings might not respect your need for privacy or space. If that happens, ask an adult to intervene, put on a pair of headphones, or shut yourself in the bathroom for a few minutes."

Asking for help when you need it actually makes you seem more responsible, so it's an important part of being a good big sister. If your sibling tells you that they're having a problem that an adult needs to fix, for instance, you should go to your parents or someone else you trust. It's also a good idea to find an adult if your sibling threatens or hits you, or if an argument gets out of hand and you need help resolving it. [12] X Research source Immediately go to an adult if your sibling or someone else is in danger. For example, you should tell an adult if your sibling is being bullied, threatens self-harm, or tells you that one of their friends is being abused. Your sibling might be mad at you if you go to an adult, but hopefully, they'll appreciate it as they get older and reflect on the experience."
