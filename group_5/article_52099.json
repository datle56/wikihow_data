      "title": "Does gold tarnish?",
      "content": "Does gold tarnish? Pure gold does not tarnish, but most gold jewelry is not made of 100% pure gold. Gold is a pretty soft and malleable metal, so it’s often combined with other metals (called alloys) to increase its durability. [33] X Research source These other metal alloys can tarnish, which is why gold jewelry sometimes appears tarnished over time. The ratio of gold to other metal alloys is measured in karats. Each individual karat represents 1/24 of the whole unit of gold. For example, if the gold used to make a piece of jewelry is 14 parts pure gold and 10 parts other metal alloys, it is 14-karat gold. [34] X Research source The higher the karat of your gold, the less likely it will be to tarnish. A piece of 24-karat gold jewelry (entirely pure gold) will not tarnish since there are no other metal alloys in it."

    {
      "title": "Does 14-karat gold tarnish?",
      "content": "Does 14-karat gold tarnish? Yes, 14-karat gold can appear tarnished because it is a blend of pure gold and other metal alloys, which are susceptible to tarnishing. For example, gold is often alloyed with copper and silver, which can undergo subtle color changes as a result of oxidation. [35] X Research source"

Pure gold will not tarnish, but most pieces of gold jewelry are made of a combination of gold and other metal alloys to increase toughness and durability. Your gold item may be tarnished due to the presence of these other alloys, not because the gold itself is fake. [36] X Research source"
