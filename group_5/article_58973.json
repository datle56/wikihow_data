      "content": "Let the person down easy. You don't need to violently reject a person who just wants to kiss you. Try to put yourself in his/her shoes. Imagine the amount of courage that it takes to ask a person for a kiss! Look for a way to respectfully and tactfully decline. Try saying, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not romantically interested in you.\" Say, \"I love our friendship, but I'm not ready to take it to the next level.\" Say, \"Thank you, but no thank you,\" or \"I'm flattered, but I'm not interested.\""

      "title": "Shake your head \"no.\"",
      "content": "Shake your head \"no.\" If you are out with your boyfriend or girlfriend and he/she makes a move to kiss you, don't pull away and scare them. Just shake your head. If you pull away, they may feel rejected. It may also be effective to just casually look the other direction or divert your attention from your partner for a few seconds. Smile after you say no so they don't feel rejected. If you don't smile, then they will probably assume that you don't like them. If you do like them, but you don't want to kiss them, then you need to explain why."

      "title": "Watch your signals.",
      "content": "Watch your signals. Try not to flirt in a suggestive way. If you don't want someone to try to kiss you, then be very careful about how you interact with them. In general, a person will be more likely to try to kiss you if he/she thinks that you want to be kissed. Perhaps you like this person, but you aren't ready for a kiss. You will need to be clear about your expectations. If the person goes for a kiss, let him/her down gently and explain exactly why you don't want the kiss."

      "title": "Avoid being alone together.",
      "content": "Avoid being alone together. A person is much more likely to try to kiss you if you are alone together and having an intimate moment. Invite mutual friends to hang out with you, or make sure that a friend is with you at all times. Spend time with the kisser in public places where he/she will be unlikely to try for a smooch.

    {
      "title": "Divert the person's attention.",
      "content": "Divert the person's attention. Talk about something unrelated to kissing – something that will make it very hard for him/her to segue back to the subject of kisses. Suggest an activity that doesn't have much chance of leading to a kiss. If you are refusing a kiss from a partner, hold his/her hand or rest your head on his/her shoulder. Show your partner that you can enjoy physical contact without kissing. Constantly suck a lollipop when you're with them. It will be in your mouth, so they can't kiss you."

      "title": "Give your date \"the cheek.\"",
      "content": "Give your date \"the cheek.\" If someone goes in for a kiss, divert them from your lips by tilting your head slightly to the side. Make it clear that you are offering up your cheek instead of your lips. The kisser should get the hint."

      "title": "Make an excuse.",
      "content": "Make an excuse. Say that you have a cold or that you're recovering from a virus. Tell the person that you have a cold sore on your mouth, and that you don't want to kiss anyone in case you transmit the herpes simplex virus. Claim that you have a severe case of halitosis. The problem with this approach is that it is just a delaying tactic. If you don't want to kiss this person at all, or not for a long time coming, then you'll need to say so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain why you are refusing the kiss.",
      "content": "Explain why you are refusing the kiss. You don't need to prove anything – but it might get the person off of your back. Be honest and straightforward. If you aren't in the mood, then just say that you aren't in the mood. If you aren't romantically interested in the person, then be truthful about that. [3] X Research source It is perfectly valid to not want a kiss. Don't let the person convince you to kiss him/her even if you aren't sure. Don't over-explain. Just say exactly what you need to say to get the point across."

      "title": "Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend that you're not ready to kiss yet.",
      "content": "Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend that you're not ready to kiss yet. If he or she truly cares about you, he or she should respect your wishes and wait until you are ready. Do not let anybody pressure you into a kiss. It will be so much better if you're ready for it."

    {
      "title": "Tell your date beforehand that you don't like kissing.",
      "content": "Tell your date beforehand that you don't like kissing. This way, he or she won't try to kiss you. If the date still tries to kiss you, then consider whether this is really someone that you want to be with."

      "title": "Leave or change the subject.",
      "content": "Leave or change the subject. Sometimes, a person will keep asking you for a kiss even after you've made it clear that you aren't interested. Try to talk about something else. If that doesn't work, then find an excuse to leave as soon as possible. Do not wait around if someone's making you feel uncomfortable! It can be that the only way to end these situations is to leave them."
