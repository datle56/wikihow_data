[1] X Research source When it’s used as a question, “FRL?” is another way of saying “seriously?” or “really?” When it’s used as a statement, it means “I’m serious” or “I agree.” The abbreviation can be written in all uppercase (“FRL”) or all lowercase (“frl”).

Both “for real” and “for real like” have the same meaning."
