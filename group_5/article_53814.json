      "content": "Weigh your jeans to find out how much dye to use. The amount of fabric dye you need depends on how much your jeans weigh, so place them on a scale and note the weight. Each dye is different, so read the instructions on the package to find out how much you’ll need based on your jeans’ weight. In most cases, use 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) or half a bottle of dye for every 1 pound (500 g) of dry fabric. [1] X Research source Generally, 1/2 to 1 bottle of fabric dye should be enough to dye 1 pair of jeans. If your jeans are more than 1 pound (500 g), however, get another bottle of dye to be safe."

      "title": "Pre-wash your jeans in warm, soapy water.",
      "content": "Pre-wash your jeans in warm, soapy water. Washing your jeans and removing visible stains beforehand helps ensure they have a uniform color after dyeing. Scrub them in warm, soapy water by hand or run them through the washing machine per their care instructions. Do not use fabric softener, however you choose to wash them. When your jeans are clean, squeeze out the excess water but don’t dry them; wet fabric absorbs dye more evenly than dry fabric. [2] X Research source Wash your jeans regardless of if they are old or new. Jeans fresh off the rack often contain a chemical coating that makes them look nice in-store but prevents dye from adhering properly. Used jeans may contain dirt and oils that will prevent the dye from sticking, as well. Wash the jeans according to the instructions on their tag. Most can be washed in the washer, but some need to be hand-washed. Pay attention to the water temperature. Most jeans will require cold water, but some can withstand warm water."

Next, pull on an apron or change into clothes that you don’t mind ruining. Don a pair of rubber gloves to protect your skin from stains and hot water. Dye can be pungent, so open a window or turn on a fan to ventilate the area. [3] X Research source If you have nothing to cover your work surface with, plan to work carefully. Have some bleach, rubbing alcohol, or acetone on hand to wipe off stains."

Next, shake up your bottle of dye and pour your desired amount into the water. Give the water a good stir with a wooden stick or spoon; make sure that you won't use the utensil for cooking again. [4] X Research source If you are using powdered dye , mix it with 1 cup (240 mL) of hot water first. Use twice as much dye for darker colors. For example, instead of using 1/2 a bottle of black dye, use a full bottle. If tap water doesn’t get hot enough, heat the water on the stove until it reaches the correct temperature. There should be enough water in your container for the jeans to move freely. To test the color of the dye, dip a paper towel into it. If the color is too light, add more dye. If it’s too dark, add more water."

Double-check the instructions that came with your dye; most dyes require salt and dish soap, but some don’t. Mix both the salt and the soap into the dye bath until they dissolve. [5] X Research source If your jeans weigh more than 1 pound (500 g), double the amount of salt and dish soap."

For the first 10 minutes, stir slowly and continuously to make sure the dye adheres evenly. After that, stir at regular intervals (every 5-10 minutes or so) and let the jeans soak for up to an hour. [6] X Research source It typically takes at least 30 minutes to ensure the color takes fully, but the exact time varies depending on the fabric blend of the jeans. Guerrero says the longer the jeans soak, the darker the color will be: “Let the jeans sit in the dye for longer in order for the fibers to have more time to bond and create more vibrant colors.”"

When you achieve your desired color, remove them from the bucket or sink and squeeze out the excess dye. Remember, jeans look darker when wet, so they will appear lighter after they dry. [7] X Research source If the color still isn’t dark enough, put the jeans back into the dye bath and let them soak for another 30 minutes or so, stirring every 10 minutes."

A dye fixative , or a mordant, is a chemical that helps dye adhere to fabric to enhance the color and prevent bleeding and fading. Fill another clean bucket or sink with 3 gallons (11 L) of hot water and pour in 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of dye fixative per pound (500 g) of fabric. Submerge the jeans in the water and stir slowly and continuously, letting the jeans soak for 20 minutes. [8] X Research source Continue to the following step whether you used a dye fixative or not."

However, it’s also possible to rinse them in a bucket. Dunk the jeans into the bucket, take them out, and squeeze them. Change the water each time you dunk them until the water remains clear.

      "content": "Prepare your jeans and your workspace. Dyeing jeans on the stove is very similar to dyeing them in a bucket or sink. Weigh your jeans dry to determine how much dye to use, then wash them and wring out excess water so they absorb the dye more easily. Cover your workspace with newspaper or a plastic tablecloth, and protect your clothes and skin with an apron and rubber gloves. [13] X Research source In general, dyeing jeans in a bucket or sink works well for dyeing natural fabrics like jeans that are 100% cotton. If your jeans contain synthetic materials, like polyester, the only way to achieve the desired effect is by dyeing them with the stovetop method. You can also dye natural fabrics using the stovetop method. In fact, it often gives the fabric a darker or bolder color than using the bucket/sink method."

If your jeans are 100% polyester or are at least 35% synthetic material, use 2 bottles of fabric dye (or 4 packages of powdered dye), as synthetic materials don’t absorb color well. Mix everything together until the dye and salt are dissolved and evenly distributed. [15] X Research source If your jeans are made of natural materials and you’re just looking for a dark or bold color, use 1 bottle of dye (or 2 packages of powdered dye), or double whatever amount is recommended by your dye’s instructions based on the weight of your jeans. To test the color of the dye, dip a paper towel into the mixture. If it’s too dark, add more water, and if it’s too light, add more dye."

When you achieve the desired color, remove the jeans from the dye bath and squeeze out the excess dye. [17] X Research source The longer you leave the jeans to soak, the darker and/or bolder the color will be. Be careful when handling the jeans, as they’ll be very hot.

      "content": "Can I tie-dye jeans? If your jeans are made entirely of natural materials, like 100% cotton, it’s possible to tie-dye them. Tie-dyeing works best with white or light-colored jeans. Dampen your jeans, scrunch them into a crumpled mound, then secure them with rubber bands. Then, follow your dye’s instructions to color, rinse, and dry the jeans. [30] X Research source Guerrero recommends the following steps as a general guide for tie-dyeing jeans: “Crunch or bunch, twist, and secure the jeans [to] affect the pattern and design you will end up with. After your jeans are prepped, you will soak them in water following the instructions of your dye. In order to adhere the dye colors to the jeans, [wait] the proper amount of time, then rinse your jeans. Undo your rubber bands or string that you've prepped it with in order to reveal your design, following all manufacturer directions.”"

      "content": "What color dye should I use? Dye is translucent, so the original color of the jeans will show through. White jeans can be dyed any color, but it’s more difficult to dye blue or dark jeans. For these, it’s best to choose a dark dye, like indigo or black. [31] X Research source For example, let’s say you want pink jeans. White jeans can easily be dyed this color, but if you try to dye blue jeans pink, you’ll end up with purple instead."

However, it may be possible if you bleach them first or use a color remover if they’re made of natural fabrics. If the jeans are more than 35% synthetic fabric, it isn’t possible to use a color remover. [32] X Research source While you’re welcome to try bleaching and dyeing your black jeans, it may be easier to buy a new pair of jeans in your desired color or dye a white pair instead."
