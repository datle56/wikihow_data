To avoid any contact with the poop and to prevent exposure to bacteria, place your gloved hands in a plastic bag. Pick up all bio-waste, including diarrhea, and throw it in a garbage bag. Tie up the garbage bag and toss it in an outdoor garbage can. Memory foam mattresses aren’t waterproof, so it’s important to remove poop and diarrhea right away before the memory foam absorbs it.

      "content": "Break down the molecules in poop stains with enzyme cleaner. Use an enzyme cleaner that’s specially formulated to tackle stains and odors from bio-waste—an enzyme laundry detergent like OxiClean will work, as well as an enzyme cleaner designed for stains from pets. Spray or sprinkle it on to coat the stains. [5] X Research source An enzyme cleaner destroys molecules from poop stains on the surface of your memory foam mattress. If your memory foam mattress absorbs any poop, an enzyme cleaner will also break down those molecules. [6] X Research source Enzyme cleaner is usually in spray bottles as well as jars or boxes of powder. Make your own enzyme cleaner with sugar, yeast, water, and fresh citrus peel. Products like OxiClean dilute stains and can even dye a white mattress so it looks new again."

Make sure to start from the outside of the stain and blot down toward the center—that way, you won’t spread the stain. [9] X Research source Cloth rags and microfiber cloths are eco-friendly alternatives to paper towels. Keep a color-coded collection to avoid cross-contamination—for example, use green cloths to clean up bio-waste. Launder reusable rags as separate, color-coded loads in your washing machine. You can also hand-wash them. Kill bacteria and germs by using hot water and detergent. [10] X Research source"

To neutralize and get rid of them, dampen a clean cloth with white vinegar. Use it to blot the affected areas that previously had stains. [12] X Research source If you’d like to use a spray bottle instead, mix 1/4 cup (59 mL) of vinegar with 3/4 cup (177 mL) of water and spritz the solution onto the affected areas. To not only deodorize your mattress but also add a pleasant scent, add a couple drops of essential oil to your white vinegar solution. White vinegar removes harsh scents because it binds with odor compounds and traps them so they don’t travel in the air. [13] X Research source"

Wash your mattress cover regularly to treat stains, remove irritants like pollen and dust, and keep your bed looking fresh."
