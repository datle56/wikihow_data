      "title": "Make a 2-dimensional floor plan of your room and furniture.",
      "content": "Make a 2-dimensional floor plan of your room and furniture. Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of your room (length and width). On a piece of graphing paper, draw a scale image of room where 3 grid squares = 4 inches (10.2 cm) or 1/3rd of a foot. Include in your floor plan the location and size of doors, windows, closets, fireplaces, etc. Make scale drawings of furniture on a separate piece of paper. Measure the length and width of any large pieces of furniture (e.g. bed, dresser, couch). Cut these out and rearrange them in your drawing to see how much space you have to work with. Carry this plan and furniture cut-outs with you if go shopping or \"dumpster diving\", so you know if you have enough space for something before bringing it home."

Arrange storage bins on a shelf or the bottom shelf of a bookcase for easy access. If the bin is in a visible location, use a decorative canvas bin or wicker basket."

      "content": "Make your own throw pillows. Throw pillows make a great accent piece and can add color. However, store bought pillows are often expensive. While having sewing skills or access to a sewing machine are helpful, they are not necessary. Make a 'no sew pillow' by using two pieces of felt that are the same. [11] X Research source Place the felt pieces together and use scissors to cut 2 inch (5.1 cm) wide by 5 inch long strips along the edges. Leave a square at each corner. Tie the strips together around an insert pillow or cotton batting. Use two t-shirts that hold sentimental value, but don't fit anymore to make a pillow. Cut-out a square or rectangular piece (depending on what shape and size you want your pillow) from each shirt. Place the two pieces together and sew together three of the four sides. Stuff with cotton batting or even other t-shirts before sewing the final edge. You can also stuff a pillow with fabric scraps or use an old pillow as an insert pillow."
