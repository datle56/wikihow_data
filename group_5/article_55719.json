      "content": "Yes, horses spend 85% of their sleep cycle standing up. This seems impossible, right? Well, maybe for humans, but not for horses! Horses have a special grouping of tendons and ligaments called a stay apparatus. This unique autonomic function helps them stay standing while they sleep. It’s also an amazing defense mechanism because if danger comes too close to a horse at night, they can wake up and immediately run away. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Horses spend the other 15% of their sleep cycle lying down. Despite popular belief, horses can sleep on their stomach or sides. This 15% is spent in the REM stage of the sleep cycle. At this stage, the horse has to lay down because their muscles fully relax and their autonomic nervous system slows down. [2] X Research source Just like you, the REM stage of sleep helps a horse recharge for the next day. But where humans need about 90 minutes of sleep a night, horses only need around 30.

      "content": "Horses can sleep almost anywhere, but they prefer secure environments. They may look majestic, but horses are on their guard 24/7. Having a place to go that’s completely safe and fit for their needs is ideal for making sure they get a good night’s (and day’s) sleep. If a horse is in a stall or stable, they should soft bedding, like hay, to lie on and enough space to lay down without being cramped. [7] X Research source In the wild, horses will find sleep in groups to protect themselves and will lie down in open pastures."

Go to source Notice if your horse is misbehaving more than usual or acting out. This could be because they’re not getting enough sleep. Check the area they sleep in. Are there any alarming or odd noises, smells, or lights that could be stressing them out? If so, remove them and see if your horse wakes happier in the morning."

      "content": "Horses can experience sleep deprivation, narcolepsy, and hypersomnia. Like us, sleep is extremely important for a horse’s overall health. Not sleeping enough or sleeping too much can result in various health and behavioral problems. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Association of Equine Practitioners National organization with a mission of improving the health and welfare of horses and providing resources to people who work with them. Go to source Sleep deprivation occurs when a horse doesn’t get enough sleep. The horse may appear sluggish, stressed, or even collapse. This disorder can be caused from an unstable or unsafe environment or lingering injury. Hypersomnia is when a horse is extra drowsy. A horse may have a regular sleep schedule, but can’t naturally fall into REM sleep. This causes a decrease in performance, and can stem from neurological diseases. Narcolepsy happens when a horse sleeps too much. The horse may start to sleep during the day suddenly and randomly, unable to control their sleep cycle. This disorder can cause cataplexy (a loss of muscle), hallucinations, and sleep paralysis."
