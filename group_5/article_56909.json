      "content": "Buy or recycle an empty bottle with a dispenser pump. Plastic and glass bottles can be acquired cheaply in most supermarket and online. If you want to make a good gesture for the environment or save money, you can clean and recycle an old bottle with dispenser instead of buying a new one. Choose a sturdy and aesthetically pleasing bottle. Remember that you want to use it for a long period of time. If possible, test a few bottles. Make sure that the pump works well and look for a sturdy bottle which can survive a fall on the floor."

      "content": "Mix the ingredients. Pour tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Shake well to mix the gel and the water until they form a liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle. Add the water first. If you don't, the water will make the soap foam up. Do not fill the bottle beyond two thirds of the way. If you do, the bottle will overflow when you screw the cap back on. If the dispenser pump is not springing back to the up position, rub a bit of petroleum jelly on the dispenser stem to get it freely moving again. The mixture must be diluted enough to flow through the pump. If the dispenser is clogged, clean it and add more water to the mixture."

      "title": "Buy the right ingredients.",
      "content": "Buy the right ingredients. In addition to an empty bottle with a dispenser pump, you will need liquid scent-free soap and perfumed essential oils. Essential oils will determine the color and the scent of your foaming hand soap and are believed to have various health properties. Make sure to use a scent-free soap. Otherwise, the soap will overpower the subtle smell of the essential oils. Essential oils can be found in most supermarkets and health shops. There is a large range of colors and scent, such as orange, rosemary, violet, and many more. Aromatherapy claims that essential oils have many health benefits. While some are true, many others are largely exaggerated."

      "content": "Prepare the room in which you will make your soap. Cover the surface on which you will work with a plastic tablecloth and be sure to have a tap in the room. Wear an apron to avoid staining your clothes and use gloves if you have sensitive hands. Keep a kitchen roll handy in case water spills on the table or on the floor. Be particularly careful with essential oils. They stain easily and are very hard to remove."

Pour the tap water into your empty hand soap bottle until it is one third of the way full and then add the gel soap refill until another third of the space is filled. Add a teaspoon of essential oil and mix until the ingredients form a homogeneous liquid. Tighten the pump back onto the hand soap bottle. [3] X Research source If the scent is not strong enough, add another teaspoon of essential oils. Don't add too much at once as essential oils are both powerful and expensive. You can also modify the color by adding food coloring. Always use natural coloring to avoid chemicals."
