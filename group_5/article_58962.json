These leading entries are called pivots, and an analysis of the relation between the pivots and their locations in a matrix can tell much about the matrix itself. An example of a matrix in row-echelon form is below. [1] X Research source ( 1 1 2 0 1 3 0 0 5 ) {\\displaystyle {\\begin{pmatrix}1&1&2\\\\0&1&3\\\\0&0&5\\end{pmatrix}}}"

When reducing a matrix to row-echelon form, the entries below the pivots of the matrix are all 0. [4] X Research source For our matrix, the first pivot is simply the top left entry. In general, this will be the case, unless the top left entry is 0. If this is the case, swap rows until the top left entry is non-zero. By their nature, there can only be one pivot per column and per row. When we selected the top left entry as our first pivot, none of the other entries in the pivot's column or row can become pivots."
