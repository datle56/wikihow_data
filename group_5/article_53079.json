      "content": "Make a list of all your skills and strengths. Take some time to really think through the things you are good at. Consider things like physical skills, practical tasks, and creative work. Perhaps you are a great artist, a whiz with numbers, an excellent salesperson, or an all-star soccer player. Alternatively, you might have a thorough knowledge of historical events, manage your time efficiently, have strong spacial reasoning skills, be a great public speaker, or have a natural knack for technology. List every skill and strength you can think of. If you’re struggling to determine your skills or strengths, ask your friends, family, and colleagues for their input."

      "content": "Figure out what you’d like to be known for when you retire. Look ahead to the future and think about what you’d like your life’s work to be. It’s okay if you don’t know right away; spend some time thinking it over. Perhaps you want to build an empire, make a difference in children’s lives, create a new piece of technology, develop sustainable living practices, or bring joy to the elderly. Determining what you want to be known for will help you determine what career path to take. [2] X Research source Think about how the job will affect you as you age.

      "content": "Focus on your own aspirations, rather than societal expectations. It’s common to feel pressure from your family members, friends, teachers, and society to follow a certain path. And while doing so might make them happy, it probably won’t make you happy. Let go of other people’s expectations of you and think about what you truly want to do. Choosing a career path should be a personal decision based on a thorough knowledge of your own strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values. [3] X Research source For instance, if your father expects you to take over the family litigation firm, but you’d rather be a high school teacher than a lawyer, follow your heart. Though he may be upset at first, seeing you do something you love will help him see that a career in litigation wasn’t the right choice for you."

Once you have an idea of what field you want to work in, consider all the options within that field. For instance, if you want to work in healthcare, you could be a nurse or a doctor, of course, but you could also schedule appointments for patients, work in medical billing, or manage a physician’s office. Or, if you study law, you may want to be a lawyer for a large law firm or a non-profit organization, or even write corporate compliance manuals. If you study computer science, you could consider working in retail tech support or becoming a CTO."

[5] X Expert Source Lauren Krasny Career Coach Expert Interview. 27 March 2020. Think about whether you enjoy interacting with other people and if you work better alone or in a group setting. Also, consider if you are a great leader or take direction well, and whether you enjoy planning things or like to go with the flow. You should also think how well you manage time, if you are detail-oriented or focus on the big picture, and if you enjoy coming up with new ideas. For instance, if you want to work with technology but don’t enjoy being around other people or interacting with strangers, you could choose to work in development rather than marketing."

      "content": "Consider non-conventional or cross-field work. Many skillsets translate to multiple fields or opportunities. Consider whether your education or experience will allow you to work in a related field. For instance, many teachers have a thorough understanding of the English language, and therefore make excellent editors and publishers. Alternatively, if you’re super athletic and love sports, perhaps you would do well as a coach, a manager, or an announcer."

Although you’ll want to have a financially secure future, the expected income shouldn’t be the only determining factor in your decision. Feel free to research potential incomes for a variety of jobs, but aim to choose one that you feel is the best fit for you, rather than simply picking the one where you’ll make the most money.
