      "content": "Gather information on your chosen or assigned topic. As you read and collect information, begin making notes about possible events to include. You will need to provide a well-rounded history of your topic, so make sure you use several sources of information. [1] X Research source Conduct Internet research, check out books from the library, or visit a museum or a historical site that relates in some way to your topic. Try to use multiple websites, books, articles, and maybe even a documentary. Aim to have at least 3 different sources."

      "title": "Make a list of events to include.",
      "content": "Make a list of events to include. You will want to include the important events for your topic, but also add in relevant, interesting events. While your timeline should maintain topic focus, you want it to be fun for the viewer/audience, and to show that you understand the topic. Aim for no more than 20 events in a timeline, and no less than five events within your timeline. [2] X Research source Include events like: Personal details such as births, deaths, and other important dates should be added Historical events that impacted the topic of the timeline should also be incorporated into your timeline Important events that shaped the topic should be included as well"

      "title": "Use the timeline to tell a story.",
      "content": "Use the timeline to tell a story. Though in a different format, a timeline, like a story, should flow smoothly and be engaging and interesting to read. The reader should be eager to learn about the next event, just like they would be when reading a great page-turner book!"

      "content": "Check out example timelines. To get an idea of what timelines typically look like, do an Internet search for “timeline.” [3] X Research source Look over several of the results so you have a good idea of how to proceed with the project. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw your timeline. Sketch out the line using a pencil, then trace over it with a dark pen or marker. Label the timeline with the project title and the boundary years. [5] X Research source Use a ruler if you are making your timeline by hand. If you are creating a digital timeline, choose a template."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a start and end point.",
      "content": "Choose a start and end point. You need to set boundaries for your timeline. Your boundaries need to allow you to explore your topic, so start and end your timeline with enough space to cover all of the events. [6] X Research source You don’t have to start with someone’s birth or end with the person’s death. A timeline is just a series of related events, not necessarily a biography. Consider your topic and narrow it to select the right starting point and ending point."

    {
      "title": "Decide how you will present your events.",
      "content": "Decide how you will present your events. There are many ways to display your events, depending on your preferences. You will need to create an entry for each event, and they will all need to fit on the timeline. [7] X Research source If you’re doing this by hand, write out all the events on a separate sheet of paper before adding them to the timeline so you can figure out how much space each entry will take. Alternatively, you could type up each event, then print it, cut it out, and paste it to the timeline. If you’re using a digital method, create a slide for each event. Include drawings or images to add visual interest to the timeline."

      "title": "Select your time increments.",
      "content": "Select your time increments. Depending on the span of time you're working with, you might choose increments in decades, years, months, or even days. Figure out what makes sense for your subject and the number of events you're including. Make the appropriate number of evenly-spaced lines perpendicular to the main timeline between your start and end dates. [8] X Research source These time increments are not the years of your events. They are evenly spaced increments, such as 5 years, 10 years, or 20 years. For example, you might mark 1920, 1930, 1940, and 1950, even though your events take place in 1923, 1928, 1938, and 1943."

      "content": "Put the most important dates on the timeline. Go along the line and mark the spots where the events will go. Draw a line that is perpendicular to your main timeline to show the years in which the events occurred, and write down a short description of each one. [9] X Research source Organize the dates sequentially. The events need to be on the timeline in chronological order, not in order of importance or interest. For example, events listed throughout a year should start in January and end in December."

      "title": "Give your project a title.",
      "content": "Give your project a title. Choose an engaging title that tells the viewer what your timeline is about. Make sure that your title encompasses all that you’ve included in your project, rather than just the topic. For example, don’t title your project “NASA;” instead, choose a title like “NASA: The Quest for the Moon.” Example titles include: The Life and Times of Nelson Mandela Beverly Hills, 90210: A Recent History JD Salinger's Storied Career California's Ancient Redwoods A Day in the Life of a Praying Mantis"
