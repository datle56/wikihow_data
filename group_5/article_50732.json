      "content": "Educate yourself about the Baker Act. The Baker Act, also known as the Florida Mental Health Act (Florida Statute Chapter 394, Part I) is a law that was passed to ensure and regulate emergency mental health treatment services for those suffering from a mental illness. This law is meant to protect all people with serious mental illnesses in the State of Florida. The Baker Act provides procedures to guide both voluntary admissions and involuntary examinations of people suffering from a mental illness. The Act also provides procedures for the involuntary inpatient placement (civil commitment) for someone suffering a mental health crisis. The Act also provides for involuntary outpatient placement for individuals ordered by a Florida court to receive mental health treatment services as an outpatient. The Act sets forth a patient’s bill of rights, mandates attorney representation for those undergoing involuntary placement proceedings, and prohibits discriminatory admission and retention of individuals without just cause."

For instance, if someone has attempted suicide or is threatening suicide, self-harm, or harm to another individual, you should call the police instead of resorting to another method."
