Lagers typically have a clear appearance that ranges in colors like pale yellow, amber-red, and deep brown. Pilsners are a light variety of lagers. They are always crystal-clear and golden.

      "content": "Pilsners tend to have a hoppier, more bitter taste than lagers. Lagers are well known for their crisp, clean, and light taste. These beers usually go down easy and taste especially refreshing on hot, summer days. While pilsners also share these qualities, they usually have a spicier, slightly bitter flavor. This makes pilsners great on days when you want a beer with some punch. [2] X Research source The crisp, subtle taste of lagers makes them great beginner beers if you want to learn to enjoy the taste of beer ."

      "content": "Lagers use a variety of hops, while pilsners are made with Saaz hops. Hops are one of the key ingredients in beers, which give them their unique flavor. Pilsners are made with a special type of hop called the Saaz hop. These hops give pilsners their distinctive floral taste and spicy, earthy zip. Lagers use all sorts of different hops, resulting in beers that are citrusy and bitter, rich and deep, or mild and understated. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "A lager is a type of beer that is bottom-fermented.",
      "content": "A lager is a type of beer that is bottom-fermented. The 2 main types of beers are lagers and ales. Unlike ales, lagers are made with yeasts that ferment in cool temperatures. These yeasts sit at the bottom of the barrel and often take several weeks to months to ferment. This is where lager gets its name, stemming from the German verb lagern which means “to store.” [4] X Research source Lagers were first brewed in Germany in the 1500s. Before then, most beers were ales. Miller Lite, Michelob Ultra, and Corona are some of the most popular lagers. [5] X Research source Ales are fermented with yeasts that like warm temperatures. These yeasts rest at the top of the barrel and usually take a shorter time to ferment than lager yeasts. Compared to lagers, ales tend to have a more fruity and yeasty, or bready, taste."

      "title": "Lagers are split into pale and dark beers.",
      "content": "Lagers are split into pale and dark beers. For the most part, lagers are either a pale, straw yellow, like pilsners, or a deep brown. Dark lagers tend to have a higher alcohol content, or alcohol by volume (ABV), than pale lagers. Some of the most popular lagers are: [6] X Research source Dunkle : this dark lager, which is named after the German word for dark, has a rich, chocolatey, and malty taste. Bock : this dark lager is a deep amber color. It tends to have a sweet and malty flavor. The Doppelbock, or double bock, tends to be slightly sweeter and has a caramel taste. Helles : this pale lager is crisp and understated. It is usually less hoppy than a pilsner. Märzen : This amber lager is an Oktoberfest favorite. It tends to be dry with a bready, floral, and slightly spicy flavor. Vienna : This lager is a light amber color. It’s similar to the Märzen but tends to be more hoppy than malty."

      "content": "Pilsner is a lager that was first made in the Czech Republic city of Plzeň. As the story goes, the Czech Republic hired the brewer Josef Groll to develop a beer that tasted great and could be stored for a long time. He famously used Plzeň’s soft, mineral-free water and Saaz hops to create the pilsner (the anglicized version of Plzeň) in 1842. Everyone loved the crisp, spicy flavor, which quickly gained popularity throughout the world. [7] X Research source The original pilsner, called Pilsner Urquell, is still brewed in Plzeň today! Popular beers like Heineken, Budweiser, and Stella Artois are pilsners. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pilsners are divided into sub-types depending on where they’re brewed. These days, pilsners aren’t just made in the Czech Republic. As pilsners gained popularity, different breweries put their own spin on this pale, hoppy beer. Some of these popular varieties are: [9] X Research source German pilsner : this pilsner is made with different hops than the original Czech pilsner. This gives it a lighter, crisper taste that’s known for its drinkability. American pilsner : this pilsner is typically brewed with corn and hops only found in North America. They tend to have a more subdued, malty flavor. Belgian pilsner : this beer is very similar to the original Czech pilsner. It has a smooth, subtle taste."
