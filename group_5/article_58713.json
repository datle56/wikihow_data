      "content": "Cut off the lower leaves with shears if you want to remove the \"skirt.\" The dangling bottom leaves are called the yucca’s “skirt.” Start at the bottom of the plant and cut off the leaves using pruning shears, a knife, or scissors. Just make your cuts as close as possible to the yucca's trunk. [1] X Research source Stop removing leaves about halfway up the tree, or when you like the way the yucca looks. Prune your yucca in the early spring. This gives it enough time to recover by winter. [2] X Research source Tip : Cut the bottom leaves in half before snipping them off at the trunk. This gives you better access to the leaves and protects you from scratches. The yucca’s skirt often turns brown and unsightly, so cutting the leaves makes it look tidier. It can also help plants that are struggling or unhealthy."

      "content": "Leave the yucca’s leaves in place if you prefer a \"skirted\" tree look. Let the lower leaves dangle, brown, and naturally fall off rather than pruning them. Keeping the lower leaves intact doesn’t harm the plant. Plus, you may like the more natural, overgrown look better than a trimmed yucca plant. [3] X Research source Yucca plants don’t need to be pruned. Pruning them is mostly based on personal preference. It can still be helpful to cut away damaged or dying leaves, as this helps maintain the plant's health."

      "content": "Cut the flower stalk down to the ground after it blooms. In late summer, yuccas grow a tall stalk out of the center of the plant that produces beautiful white flowers. After the flower blooms and dies, grasp the stalk and carefully move the leaves out of the way. Then, use pruning shears, a sharp knife, or scissors to cut the stalk as close to the ground as possible. [4] X Research source If you leave the stalk in place, it starts to turn brown and woody, which can have an unsightly appearance. You can prune the stalk before the plant blooms if you don’t want the plant to flower. However, most people choose to prune after it flowers."

      "content": "Decide to cut back yuccas if they get too tall or outgrow their pot. If your yucca plant is getting too big in your yard or its pot indoors, simply cut off the top or cut it in half. Yuccas sprout and grow new leaves where they’re cut while the severed top can grow roots if you plant it in soil! [6] X Research source Trim leggy branches or branches that are leaning, too. You’ll know your yucca plant has outgrown its pot when the roots start growing out of the bottom or they’re not far from the outer edge of the pot. Transplant the yucca into a larger pot if you don't want to cut it. Yuccas typically need to be repotted every 2 years. You essentially get an additional plant for free if you cut it!"

It is best to prune them in the early spring, right before they flower, so they can recover from the trauma. [7] X Research source Pruning yuccas helps to promote and control their growth."

      "content": "Remove the yucca plant from its container, if it's in one. Taking your yucca plant out of its pot makes it easier to cut, and is helpful if you’re going to repot both pieces. Simply grasp the tree’s trunk firmly and pull it out of the container. [8] X Research source If the plant doesn’t come out easily, smack the sides of the pot to help loosen the soil and tip the container sideways."

      "content": "Locate the halfway mark on the tree and remove the bottom leaves. Identify your plant’s midway point from the base of the trunk to the top of the leaves. To make it easier to cut the trunk, rip off the leaves with your hands or cut them off with pruning shears or a sharp knife. [9] X Research source You don’t have to cut your yucca plant exactly in half. Simply trim the top of the tree wherever you want new leaves to grow. The halfway mark can be a rough estimate rather than an exact measurement. Warning : Wear gloves, safety glasses, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when cutting yuccas. The leaves are sharp and can potentially hurt you."

      "content": "Cut the trunk at the halfway mark using a hand saw or sharp blade. Use a pruning saw, hand saw, or loppers to cut through large trunks that are 10 in (25 cm) or larger in diameter. For smaller trunks that are 1–7 in (2.5–17.8 cm) in diameter, use a sharp knife or scissors. Simply push your tool into the yucca’s trunk with consistent, steady pressure. [10] X Research source It typically takes a moderate amount of force to slice the trunk in half."

      "content": "Leave the top of the yucca trunk in the sun for 1-3 hours before planting. Place the top half of the yucca trunk in a sunny, airy spot outside. Letting it air out for a few hours helps it take better to the soil and grow strong, healthy roots. [11] X Research source If you’re repotting the bottom half of the trunk , leave it in the sun, too. Set the trunk on the sidewalk, in the grass, or on a table."

      "content": "Plant your yucca cuttings in a sunny spot inside or outdoors. Yuccas grow best under full sun , so find a place that gets around 6 to 8 hours of direct light. For instance, set the cuttings in front of a sunny window or plant them in a bright spot in your garden. [12] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source Yucca plants can survive in partial to full shade, though they might not grow as well. [13] X Research source Yuccas are native to warm, dry areas. However, they’re hardy plants that can adapt well to urban environments and cold climates. Warning : Keep yuccas away from sidewalks and high-traffic areas so they don't cut anyone. If you have children or pets, pick a location away from their play area. If yuccas don’t get enough sun, the leaves start to stretch and look wilted."

Then, make a hole in the center of the soil and stick the top half of the yucca trunk inside. [14] X Research source For instance, use a cactus or palm potting soil , as these are typically well-draining. Or, amend the soil with sand or perlite . Choose a pot that’s large enough to hold the cutting so it doesn’t tip over when you insert the trunk. Yucca plants are drought tolerant, so they do not like sitting in wet, soggy soil."

If you removed your yucca plant from its pot to trim it, either replant the bottom half in a bigger pot or plant it outside. [15] X Research source In a new pot : Fill a pot that has drainage holes halfway full with well-draining soil . Then, insert the trunk. Cover the roots with soil and fill the rest of the pot. In the ground : Dig a hole 2 times as deep and wide as the roots. Pour gravel into the hole and sprinkle soil on top. Then, place the trunk inside, fill the hole with dirt, and press down the soil. Center and straighten the yucca plant in its new pot. Make sure you choose a large enough pot so the plant doesn’t tip over. Make sure you plant your yucca plant in a spot outside that’s well-draining and doesn’t gather water."

      "content": "Water the cuttings lightly for about 10 seconds. Watering the plants helps them acclimate to the soil, encouraging them to root and grow new leaves. Yucca plants don’t need a lot of water, so lightly saturate the soil for a few seconds. [16] X Research source It typically takes around 1 month for the top half of the trunk to grow roots. Feel free to keep it in its pot, or plant it in the soil when the roots are established. The bottom half of the cutting usually starts growing new leaves after about 1 month."

      "title": "Give your plants more water when the soil feels dry.",
      "content": "Give your plants more water when the soil feels dry. Yucca plants grow best when they’re watered sparingly, as they’re more likely to be harmed from overwatering. Just stick your finger about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep into the soil every few weeks. If the soil feels dry, give the plants a light drink of water. [17] X Research source Generally, water your plants about every 10 days to 2 weeks. Yucca plants start to droop and shrivel when they’re thirsty. If you overwater your plant, the leaves die or become discolored and the trunk might start to rot."
