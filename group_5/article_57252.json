    {
      "title": "Draw a semicircle based on the doubled measurement.",
      "content": "Draw a semicircle based on the doubled measurement. Use the doubled measurement for the length of the semicircle (or diameter of the half circle). For example, for a 12 in (30 cm) cone, make the length of the semicircle 24 inches (61 cm) for a cone height of 12 inches (30 cm). [1] X Research source Draw the semicircle with a compass or a pencil attached to a piece of string. A plate or lid of the right size can also be used. Align the straight edge of the semicircle with the paper edge to reduce the amount of cutting or drawing. Paper, cardstock, felt, cardboard, foam, or even thin plastic sheeting can also be used."

      "title": "Cut out the semicircle with scissors.",
      "content": "Cut out the semicircle with scissors. With the semicircle aligned on the straight edge of the paper, only the curved part needs to be cut. This will form the bottom edge of the cone, so make cuts as neat as possible. Hint: turn the material not the scissors when cutting. [2] X Research source There is no need to add a seam allowance or tabs as the straight edges are overlapped to create the cone."

      "title": "Overlap the straight edges to get the cone size wanted.",
      "content": "Overlap the straight edges to get the cone size wanted. Find the middle of the semicircle's straight edge. Take the straight edges on either side of that point and overlap them. Slide them past each other until it is the size you want. [3] X Research source The greater the overlap, the narrower the cone will be. With less overlap, the cone will be wider."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the cone along the seam.",
      "content": "Secure the cone along the seam. Gluing the cone will give the nicest finish, or a piece of tape or staples can be used. If taping the cone, place the tape on the inside and outside of the cone to keep the flaps down. [4] X Research source A glue stick will work for this, but liquid glue will hold better. Secure the seam temporarily with masking tape until the glue dries, then peel it off."

      "content": "Cut parchment paper into a7 in × 15 in (18 cm × 38 cm) rectangle. This will make a standard sized piping cone for cake decorating. For a different sized piping cone make the length of the rectangle twice the height, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm). For example: 6 by 13 inches (15 cm × 33 cm). [5] X Research source Instead of parchment paper, you can use wax paper. This method can be used to create craft cones out of printer paper or construction paper."

Cut along the edge of the ruler with a craft blade. Alternatively, draw a line with a pen using the ruler as a guide, then cut the line with scissors.

The top of the cone is formed on the long edge of the triangle. [7] X Research source When the short edge is closer to the bottom, the wider the cone will be. When the short edge is further from the bottom, the narrower the cone will be."

These tips will be tucked into the cone to hold it together. Adjust tip of the cone to be a point. For use as a piping cone, trim the tip off later."

If you do this, the cone needs to be taped, glued, or stapled back together. A piping cone does not need to taped, glued, or stapled. Instead, fold the opening down a few times to the level of the filling to close off the cone. Test your piping cone. If the icing or chocolate does not come out of the tip, trim it with scissors."

Put more simply: it is half the diameter . [8] X Research source For example, for a 6 in (15 cm) tall cone, the circle's radius will be 6 inches (15 cm)."

Alternatively, choose a plate, bowl, or lid with the right diameter, then trace around it with a pen or pencil. For example, for a 6 in (15 cm) tall cone, use a 12 in (30 cm) plate to draw it. The circle can be drawn on any stiff material, such as paper, cardstock, craft foam, felt, plastic sheeting, or thin metal sheeting."

Open the circle and mark the crease in the middle with a pen or pencil. If the material does not hold creases well, draw an X at the middle of the circle, then make a small mark in the middle of that X."

      "content": "Cut a wedge out of the circle, stopping at the mark. This is like cutting a slice of cake or pie. The bigger the wedge, the narrower the cone will be. For most cones, about a quarter of the circle will be enough; overlapping the edges will get the exact size you want. If you have a mathematical mind, determine the circumference of the cone's base. This is the remaining circumference of the circle after the wedge is cut out. If using the cone's circumference for reference, add about 1 ⁄ 2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) to the total measurement for an overlap that can be glued."

      "content": "Overlap the straight edges for the size you want. Take the 2 straight edges created by the wedge cutout. Bring them together until they touch. Next, overlap them until the cone reaches the desired width. The greater the overlap, the narrower the cone will be, and vice versa. Make sure any pen or pencil marks made are on the inside of the cone."

      "title": "Tape or glue the edges down.",
      "content": "Tape or glue the edges down. For something quick and simple, tear off a strip of tape, and place it over the seam created by the overlapping edges. For a nicer finish, lift the top edge, coat the underside with glue, then press it back down again. Either a glue stick or liquid glue will work; tape the cone as it dries, then remove the tape. If making a felt, foam, plastic, or metal cone, use hot glue instead. Fabric glue may work for foam cones as well. If you know how to weld, weld a metal cone shut instead."

One of the pieces will form the lining while the other will be the outer fabric. The fabrics can be matched, or they can be coordinated. [9] X Research source For example, use a patterned cotton for 1 piece, and solid-colored cotton for the other. For a narrower cone, cut two 1/4 circle shapes instead. If you plan on laundering the cone, wash, dry, and iron the fabric first."

Only 1 piece of foam stabilizer is needed. [10] X Research source To help reduce bulk, cut it 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) smaller than the fabric shapes. Foam stabilizer looks like craft felt, except that it is stiffer. It can be labeled as \"fusible foam.” If you can not find foam stabilizer, cut 2 pieces of fusible interfacing instead."

Make it as centered as possible. [11] X Research source If using fusible interfacing, iron each piece to the back (wrong side) of each 1/3 circle instead. Both fusible foam and fusible interfacing have a rough side and a smooth side. The rough side is the side is the glue that goes against the fabric. Read the instructions that came with the foam or interfacing. Each brand will have slightly different requirements."

Sew along the curved edge using a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. [12] X Research source Be careful not to sew across the stabilizer or interfacing. If you do, carefully trim or tear away the excess sticking outside the stitching. Use pins to hold the fabric in place for sewing, but be sure to take them out as you sew."

Place it under the foot of the sewing machine , then sew towards the point of the shape using a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. [14] X Research source Backstitch at the start and end of sewing. This is simply where you reverse the sewing machine for a few stitches.

Place it under the sewing machine's foot, and sew along the lining's straight edge. Use a straight stitch and a 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) seam allowance. Half-way along the edge, leave a 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) gap for turning. [15] X Research source Backstitch on either side of the gap so that the seam does not split when the fabric is turned right-side-out.
