      "content": "Yes, “axel” and “axle” are often confused because they’re heterographs . This means the words have the same sound but different spellings and meanings. If you’re texting someone and they type “axel,” but the context suggests the meaning of “axle” (or vice versa), chances are they just misspelled the word. Heterographs are words pronounced similarly but have different spellings and meanings. For instance, “to,” “too,” and “two” are heterographs. [5] X Research source"
