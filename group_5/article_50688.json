[17] X Research source You may want to compare yourself to your enemy or think there is something wrong with you because your crush didn’t choose to date you. Don’t think that way. There is nothing wrong with you, even if your crush can’t see how great you are. For example, you may want to write down a list of your good traits. You can keep this list around when you feel jealous. You may write down that you have nice hair, nice eyes, or dress well. You may be a good musician, artist, or athlete. Maybe you’re funny, caring, or good at math. Whatever you think is good about yourself, write it down."
