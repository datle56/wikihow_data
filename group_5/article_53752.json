      "content": "Pour a glass of water or juice between meals. Fill a medium-sized glass or cup with the beverage of your choice. Since you're taking activated charcoal powder as a treatment, opt for clear liquids like fruit juice or water. Get your drink ready several hours after your last meal, so your stomach is empty. [2] X Research source If you drink activated charcoal powder with food, you might end up feeling constipated later on. Since activated charcoal powder works as a bonding agent, it can bond and neutralize the nutrients in your food if you take it with a meal. Mix at least 10 millilitres (0.34 fl oz) of water or juice to dissolve your dose of activated charcoal powder.
