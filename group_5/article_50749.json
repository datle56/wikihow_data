      "content": "The Battle Master archetype is a fighter subclass available at level 3. Every class comes with several subclasses (or specializations) in 5e, and Battle Masters are the clever tacticians of the fighter class. They’re able to study a battlefield and employ special techniques to turn a fight in their favor, and even master other tools (and crafts) beyond their weapons, like smithing or mapmaking. [1] X Research source Fighter subclasses are typically called archetypes. All fighters can choose an archetype at the 3rd level. Fighters can only choose one archetype. Other archetypes include Champion, Arcane Archer, Cavalier, Eldritch Knight, Rune Knight, and Samurai."

      "title": "Combat Superiority",
      "content": "Combat Superiority At the 3rd level, Battle Masters can use special moves called maneuvers. You can only use one maneuver per attack, but you master 3 maneuvers right away and 2 additional maneuvers at levels 7, 10, and 15. Using maneuvers costs superiority dice; you get 4 of them (d8s) initially, plus an additional die at levels 7 and 15. [2] X Research source Superiority dice . Using a superiority die expends it, but you’ll regain all expended superiority dice after a short or long rest. Maneuver saving throws . Some maneuvers force a target to make a saving throw against you; the DC (difficulty class) for this saving throw is calculated by adding 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. You can choose whether your saving throw DC uses your character’s Strength or Dexterity. It’s best to choose the modifier (and ability score) that’s highest!"

You can choose which tools your fighter masters—and there isn’t a specific set of tools it’s better for your character to have. You probably won’t use them in battle, so it really comes down to flavor and what skills you’d like your fighter to have! Artisan’s tools include: [3] X Research source Alchemist’s supplies Brewer’s supplies Calligrapher’s supplies Carpenter’s tools Cartographer’s tools Cobbler’s tools Cook’s tools Glassblower’s tools Jeweller’s tools Leatherworker’s tools Mason’s tools Painter’s supplies Potter’s tools Smith’s tools Tinker’s tools Weaver’s tools Woodcarver’s tools"

      "title": "Know Your Enemy",
      "content": "Know Your Enemy At level 7, Battle Masters learn how to analyze other creature’s strengths and weaknesses. If your fighter spends at least 1 minute observing another creature outside of combat, they learn about its capabilities compared to theirs. The DM will tell you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regards to two characteristics of your choice, such as: [4] X Research source Strength score Dexterity score Constitution score Armor class Current hit points Total class levels (if any) Fighter class levels (if any) For example, if your fighter’s Strength score is 18 and the other creature’s is 16, the DM would say they’re inferior to you in that regard."

      "title": "Improved Combat Superiority",
      "content": "Improved Combat Superiority Not only do you gain more superiority dice at higher levels, but the dice themselves turn into d10s (rather than d8s) at the 10th level. Then, at level 18, they’ll become d12s (meaning you’ll roll a d10 or d12 instead of a d8 when using a superiority die). [5] X Research source For example, if you use the Ambush maneuver (which lets you add a superiority die to your initiative roll), you’d roll a d10 at level 10 and add that roll to your initiative."

      "content": "Relentless At level 15, it’s a little easier for Battle Masters to replenish superiority dice. When you roll initiative for combat and don’t have any superiority dice left, you’ll automatically regain 1 superiority die. You can still regain the rest of them by taking a short or long rest.

    {
      "title": "Best maneuvers",
      "content": "Best maneuvers Maneuvers are unique moves that enhance an attack—and though every maneuver has a use, some are generally considered the strongest and most all-around useful maneuvers for Battle Masters. Keep in mind that every maneuver expends a superiority die, but you can then add the spent die to the maneuver in some way. The best maneuvers include: [7] X Research source Ambush . You can add a superiority die to a Stealth check or initiative roll as long as you aren’t incapacitated. Brace . You can use a reaction to make an attack against a creature that moves within reach of your melee weapon and add a superiority die to the damage roll. Commanding Presence . You can add a superiority die to an Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion check. Distracting Strike . You can distract a creature after hitting it with a weapon attack, adding a superiority die to the damage roll. The next attack against your target by a different attacker before the start of your next turn has advantage. Feinting Attack . You use a bonus action to feint, choosing a creature within 5 feet as your target and gaining advantage on your next attack against that creature. If your attack hits, add a superiority die to the damage roll. Goading Attack . Hit a creature with a weapon attack and goad it into attacking you. Add a superiority die to your damage roll, while the target must make a Wisdom save. If it fails, it has disadvantage on all attacks against targets other than you until the end of your next turn. Grappling Strike . After hitting a creature with a melee attack, attempt to grapple it as a bonus action and add a superiority die to the Athletics check. Menacing Attack . Attempt to frighten a creature after hitting it with a weapon attack, adding a superiority die to the damage roll and forcing the target to make a Wisdom save. If it fails, it’s frightened until the end of your next turn. Parry . When you get hit with a melee attack, use a reaction to reduce the damage by a superiority die + your Dexterity modifier. Precision Attack . When you make a weapon attack roll, add a superiority die to the roll. You can use this before or after making the roll, but before applying any effects of the attack. Rally . Use a bonus action to give an ally temporary hit points equal to a superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier. Riposte . When a creature misses its melee attack against you, use a reaction to make a melee attack against it in return, adding a superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. Trip Attack . When you hit a creature with an attack, add a superiority die to the damage roll and force the target to make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, the target is knocked prone."

      "title": "Other maneuvers",
      "content": "Other maneuvers Don’t be afraid to pick the maneuver that sounds good to you, even if it’s not considered “the best” or most popular. And, if you decide you don’t want a particular maneuver anymore, you can swap it out with a different one the next time you level up and get to pick additional maneuvers. The rest of the available maneuvers include: [8] X Research source Bait and Switch . Spend at least 5 feet of movement and switch places with a creature within 5 feet of you, without provoking opportunity attacks. You or the creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the roll of a superiority die. Commander’s Strike . When you take the attack action, forgo on attack and use a bonus action to order an ally to strike. That ally can use a reaction to make a weapon attack, adding a superiority die to their damage roll. Disarming Attack . After hitting a creature with a weapon attack, attempt to disarm them by adding a superiority die to the attack’s damage roll and forcing the creature to make a Strength save. If it fails, it drops the object it’s holding. Evasive Footwork . When you move, roll a superiority die and add the result to your armor class (AC) until you stop moving. Lunging Attack . When making a melee weapon attack, increase your reach by 5 feet and add a superiority die to the damage roll. Maneuvering Attack . Hit a creature with a weapon attack and add a superiority die to the damage roll. Then, direct an ally to move; they can then use a reaction to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature you hit. Pushing Attack . Hit a creature with an attack and force it back, adding a superiority die to the damage roll and prompting the creature to make a Strength save (if it’s size Large or smaller). If it fails, you push it up to 15 feet away. Quick Toss . Use a bonus action to make a ranged attack with a weapon that can be thrown. If you hit, add a superiority die to the damage roll. Sweeping Attack . When hitting a creature with a melee attack, choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target. That second creature takes damage equal to the number you roll on a superiority die. Tactical Assessment . Expend a superiority die and add the resulting roll to an Investigation, History, or Insight check."

Choose whichever stat you want to use to make attacks; the one you don’t choose can be a dump stat. The second most important ability score is Constitution (CON).

Additionally, races with natural or enhanced armor can also be great for this subclass. If you’re trying to choose a race for your Battle Master, consider the following options: [10] X Research source Custom Lineage . Choosing to customize your character's lineage grants an extra feat at level 1, which is extremely useful and allows you to give your Battle Master more power right from the start. Dwarf . Dwarves get innate proficiency with battleaxes, hand axes, light hammers, and warhammers. They can also move in heavy armor without having their speed reduced. Feral Tiefling . If you choose this subrace, you can opt to give your tiefling wings, which grant a flying speed and can help you move around battlefields more easily. Goliath . They have Athletics proficiency and a feature called Stone's Endurance which makes goliaths ideal for a Strength build. Shadar-Kai . Fey Ancestry can protect your fighter from charm effects, and free proficiency in Perception is always useful. Thri-Kreen . Having secondary arms means your character can wear a shield and hold a hand crossbow in addition to holding melee weapons and having natural armor. Variant Human . Variant humans also get a bonus feat at the 1st level."

Feats can increase ability scores, add new spells or attacks to your repertoire, or offer some other buff or ability for your character. If you’re playing a Battle Master character, the following feats may be especially useful: [11] X Research source Alert . This feat adds a bonus to your initiative and prevents you from being surprised, making you extra reactive at the start of any battle. Crossbow Expert . You can fire a crossbow and attack as a bonus action when you use an action to attack with a one-handed weapon with this feat. Fighting Initiate . You can add an extra fighting style with this feat. Great Weapon Master . This feat lets you deal extra damage on attacks (while taking a penalty to attack rolls). Martial Adept . Want a couple of extra maneuvers in addition to the ones you already have? Grab Martial Adept to be the ultimate Battle Master. Mobile . This feat grants extra movement per round, enabling your Battle Master to cross a battlefield and maneuver more easily. Piercer . This feat lets you deal extra piercing damage with attacks, and increase your STR or DEX by +1. Tough . This feat simply expands your hit point (HP) pool, giving you more health (and thus making you more hardy in combat)."

While every available fighting style has its uses, a few may be especially helpful depending on how you want your Battle Master to function in combat. Consider choosing one of the following fighting styles: [12] X Research source Great Weapon Fighting . If you want to focus purely on dealing as much damage as possible, Great Weapon Fighting is the way to go. Defense . If you plan to be the party tank (meaning your character will take the brunt of enemy attacks), consider taking the Defense fighting style. Protection . If there are other, weaker party members your Battle Master needs to shield from enemies, consider the Protection fighting style. Archery . Take this fighting style if you're interested in making a Battle Master that can attack at long range in addition to melee."

[14] X Research source Courtier . This adds proficiency in Persuasion, which you can boost with the Commanding Presence maneuver. Criminal/Spy . Get Deception, Stealth, and proficiency with Thieves' tools if you want to make a Dexterity-based Battle Master. Marine or Pirate/Sailor . You can get proficiency in Athletics and Survival or Perception with either of these backgrounds."

      "content": "Battle Master is an excellent, versatile subclass for fighters. With all the different maneuvers and superiority dice to keep track of, it’s also more complex than other fighter subclasses (like Champion, which is very straightforward). However, the fact that this subclass is so customizable makes up for that; Battle Masters are extremely adept at controlling the battlefield and empowering allies (or enfeebling foes). Battle Master is an ideal class for D&D players who are interested in being a fighter but want to do more on their turns besides roll attack after attack. With maneuvers—including some that can be used for roleplaying outside of combat—players have the opportunity to strategize and try different attacks or moves on each turn."
