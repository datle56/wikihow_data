      "content": "Sand the mirror frame if the old paint is chipping away. It's best to begin with a smooth, sanded surface so that the new paint can properly adhere to the frame. Use a piece of sandpaper and smooth down any bumps or uneven parts of the old paint to make the surface feel flat. It doesn't matter if you remove some of the old paint in the process, as you will be painting over this anyway. All that matters is that the surface is smooth and that the frame is clean."

      "content": "Remove the mirror from the frame if it's possible. The easiest way to paint a mirror frame is to take the mirror out before you begin painting.

[1] X Research source Only some mirrors have a removable frame. If you cannot see any screws or an obvious way to remove the frame, don't try to force it as you could end up damaging the mirror. There are ways to work around painting the frame if the mirror cannot be removed. If you really want the mirror to be removed but you cannot see how to do so yourself, take the mirror to a glass shop. It can be professionally removed and refitted once you have completed painting."
