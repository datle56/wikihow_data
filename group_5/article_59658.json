      "content": "Think of something funny or unusual that happened recently. Talking a little about something that’s happening in your life can be a great way to break the ice. Jump right into the story just like you would while talking to a friend or family member. This is a better way to get the conversation flowing naturally than starting with small-talk, and it’ll also show off your fun, spontaneous side. [1] X Expert Source Joshua Pompey Relationship Expert Expert Interview. 27 November 2019. Starting off with an interesting opening line might be enough to get things moving again. Try leaving it at that and see if they respond before you say more. For instance, you could start with something like, “Oh man, work was crazy today. The expresso machine literally blew up!” or, “You’re never gonna guess who walked into my office this morning.”"

[2] X Research source Stick to questions that require a little thought or an answer that’s more than just 1 word. [3] X Research source When you’re just starting out, keep it light and avoid sensitive topics, like politics or religion. To show you’ve been paying attention, try asking about something they mentioned earlier in the conversation. For instance, “Hey, how was that movie you were watching the other day?” or “What happened with that job interview?” If they answer, keep the conversation going with follow-up questions. For example, “Awesome, I’ve been meaning to check that movie out. How do you think it compares to the original version from the ‘70s?” You can ask questions about a wide variety of topics, like their interests and hobbies, their background, or their sense of humor. Or, try some deeper conversation starters, like “What’s a skill you’ve always wanted to learn?” or “What’s your favorite place in the world, and why?” [4] X Research source"

Whatever it is, use it as a jumping-off point for more conversation. [5] X Research source For instance, try something like, “It’s so cool that you’re into photography, too! How long have you been doing that?” You might be able to get a good sense of things you have in common by looking at their profile or reading back over your previous conversation. You can also try asking questions to get a better idea of what they’re into, like “What TV shows are you watching lately?” or, “Who are your favorite authors?”"

[7] X Research source If you have pets, share a picture or a funny story, or ask your prospective bae to do the same. There’s even science to back this one up—studies show that having a pet is one of the best ways to bond with other people and make new friends!

Don’t be afraid to ask them to send pics, too—just don’t get pushy or ask them to share something they don’t seem comfortable with. [10] X Research source For example, you might send a picture of the delicious meal you just cooked or an interesting landscape you discovered while out walking. You can also say things like, “Your cat sounds adorbs, I’d love to see a pic!” Don’t send (or ask for) nudes or pictures of your junk unless they’ve told you they’re interested. That’s a good way to make things turn awkward, fast—or scare someone off completely."

Well, I checked it out, and it was incredible!” If you haven’t heard from them in a couple of days, don’t assume they’ve lost interest—it could just mean they’ve been busy.

Would you be up for hanging out in person this weekend?” or “I’d love to chat with you face to face! Do you have any free time in the next few days?” Some people are just more comfortable talking in person, so don’t assume they aren’t interested just because they’re not super chatty over text."
