      "title": "You can run about 8 outlets to a 15-amp circuit.",
      "content": "You can run about 8 outlets to a 15-amp circuit. You can theoretically run any number of outlets to a 15-amp circuit, but there are practical limitations here. On a traditional 15-amp circuit, each outlet can draw 1.5 amps—that’s 10 outlets. The 80% rule (used by electricians) says you should only use 80% of a circuit’s total allowance, so that takes us to 8 outlets. When you picture a normal, typical outlet, you’re imagining a 15-amp outlet that’s wired to a 15-amp circuit at your electrical panel. If your outlet's top left prong has a \"t\" shape rather than a slit, then it's not a 15-amp. The problem isn’t the number of outlets—it’s the total amperage being used. Having 20 outlets on a single circuit increases the odds you’ll accidentally plug too many things in. If you overload a circuit, you’ll blow the fuse and lose power. It’s not dangerous if your home is wired correctly, but it’ll sure be annoying if you have to keep going down to the basement to flip the fuse."

      "content": "You can run roughly 10 outlets to a 20-amp circuit. Unlike 15-amp circuits, 20-amp circuits are typically reserved for heavy appliances and outlets where you need access to a massive electrical current . [1] X Research source Since there’s room for more amperage on the circuit, you can run roughly 10 outlets to one of these circuits. 20-amp outlets look identical to your 15-volt outlets with one exception. The top-left prong will have a T-shape, not a narrow slot."

      "content": "Refer to your city’s building codes to see if there are local limits. Most cities have their own regulations when it comes to building inspections and whatnot. While some cities don’t specifically address how many outlets you can run to a single circuit, many of them do. The most common maximums are 8 outlets on a 15-amp circuit, or 10 outlets on a 20-amp circuit. Most electricians will abide by the 8 and 10 rules as a default unless you ask for specific allowances."

      "content": "There is nothing in the National Electric Code on outlet numbers. The NEC does provide minimums on the number of outlets required for kitchen countertops, but there’s nothing on the maximum number of outlets allowed per circuit. That doesn’t mean you can put an unlimited number of outlets on a circuit, though—you probably have local codes."

      "content": "Look on the fuse box switches or electrical panel for 15A or 20A. Go to your electrical panel (it’s usually in the basement or a closet). Pop the cover open and look at the individual switches. On top of each switch, there should be a 15A for 15-amp or 20A for 20-amp. If the switches themselves aren’t labelled, look on the fuse itself or the inside of the door for labels. [2] X Research source If you see a 60A that’s a 60-amp circuit. It’s your fuse box’s main supply and provides overload protection for your home. You may also have a 60-amp circuit for your furnace, too."

There is a dangerous amount of amperage running through your circuits, and you could seriously injure yourself if you make a mistake.

Divide the rooms where you plan on using the most electricity over multiple circuits, and combine rooms where you’re almost never going to use close to a full load. Use as many slots on the fuse box as you can to ensure your home’s electrical system is never under unnecessary stress. [4] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Products Safety Commission Independent U.S. government agency responsible for protecting consumers by developing safety standards and conducting product research Go to source Unless you accidentally run a hair dryer, radio, and a bunch of chargers on the same circuit, you should never actually trip a fuse.
