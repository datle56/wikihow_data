      "title": "Place 3-6 eggs in a pot and cover them with cold water.",
      "content": "Place 3-6 eggs in a pot and cover them with cold water. Lay the eggs gently in a single layer at the bottom of the pot, then add cold water until the water level is about 1 in (2.5 cm) above the eggs. This ensures that the water boils efficiently, the eggs cook evenly, and that you can get the timing just right—not too long, not too short. [1] X Research source To make the eggs easier to peel later, add 2 tsp (9.9 mL) of white vinegar or a pinch of salt to the water. Also, use eggs that are at least 6-7 days old, which, compared to fresh eggs tend to peel without getting any craters."

      "content": "Bring the pot to boil, then turn off the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes. Crank the heat to medium-high until the water comes to a rolling boil. As soon as it does, cut the heat and put the lid on. For the perfect hard-boiled egg that has a firm white but a creamy yolk, let the eggs sit in the covered pot for exactly 10 minutes . [2] X Research source For runny whites and loose yolks , let the eggs sit for 3 minutes . For slightly runny whites and loose yolks , let the eggs sit for 4 minutes . For a perfect soft-boiled egg with silky whites and custardy yolks, let the eggs sir for 6 minutes . For firm whites and solid yolks , let the eggs sit for 15 minutes."

      "title": "Remove the eggs from the pot and run them under cool water.",
      "content": "Remove the eggs from the pot and run them under cool water. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove all the eggs from the hot water, then immediately run them under a cold faucet for about 10-20 seconds each. This stops the eggs from cooking any further, and the quick temperature change creates a layer of steam between the egg and the shell, which makes peeling a cinch. [3] X Research source Or, immediately plunge the eggs into an ice bath for 1-2 minutes to stop them from cooking."

      "content": "Tap the egg on the counter until it cracks. Hold the egg securely between your curled forefinger and thumb. Gently but firmly tap it against a countertop or any other hard surface 3-4 times, until you see the telltale spider webbed crack across its surface. [4] X Research source To more easily crack the egg, tap it against the corner of your countertop, letting the slightly sharper surface do the work. If you’re peeling a soft egg, tap the large end with the blunt edge of a butter knife to form the initial crack."

      "title": "Roll the egg between your palm and the countertop.",
      "content": "Roll the egg between your palm and the countertop. Hold your hand flat and palm-side down over the egg, pressing the egg to the counter gently. Then, roll the egg back and forth for 5-10 seconds. This spreads the cracks and loosens the shell, making the egg easier to peel. [5] X Research source If you’re peeling softer eggs (or any egg cooked for less than 10 minutes) skip this step, since the egg inside will be much more fragile."

      "title": "Peel the egg with your fingers, starting at the large end.",
      "content": "Peel the egg with your fingers, starting at the large end. Now that the egg is cracked all over and the shell is loosened, use your fingertips to flake away the shell. Start peeling the egg at the large end, where there’s usually an air pocket that makes it easier to get things started. [6] X Research source Peel the egg until the entire shell is removed. When peeling a soft egg, place the egg in a cup, then peel away only the shell on the large end. Then, dig in with a spoon and enjoy! If the shell is stubborn, peel the egg under a faucet with cold, running water, which will encourage the shell to slip away. Dispose of the shell in the garbage, or toss it into your compost bin—eggshells contain beneficial nutrients that do wonders for your garden!"

While still in their shell, boiled eggs will last up to 7 days if refrigerated properly.

If you do want to peel them, just to get it out of the way (or for any other reason), store the eggs in the fridge in a sturdy, sealed, airtight container. Or, submerge the peeled eggs in a bowl of water, then place the bowl in the fridge for up to 7 days. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Spin eggs on a countertop to check if they're raw or cooked. If you’re like us, you’ve always got hard-boiled eggs in the fridge, but sometimes, telling them apart from raw eggs is tricky. To check, place an egg horizontally on the counter and spin it gently. If it stays in place, the contents are solid and cooked. Raw eggs, though, will wobble and become off-balance, since the loose yolk inside shifts the egg’s weight as it spins.

Let the mixture cool for 1 hour. Sterilize a large glass jar and fill it with the mixture, then place 6 peeled hard-boiled into the jar. Leave it in a dark place, like a cabinet, for 2 weeks to 3 months to let the eggs pickle. [12] X Research source Once the eggs are pickled, eat them plain as a quick and flavorful snack, or use them in an egg salad to give it a tangy flavor boost. Pickled (or even just plain hard-boiled eggs) make great additions to ramen."

To make peeling a cinch, place the eggs into a container with 1 in (2.5 cm) of water, then jostle it for a minute to loosen the shells.

Then, plunge them under cold running water and peel them as usual.

[16] X Research source A pressure cooker isn’t the most precise or delicate way to cook eggs, and because of the extreme pressure and temperature, you can’t make soft or runny eggs. Still, it’s a great solution if you don’t have any other tools."
