A remnant is fine since you will only need about 7 in (18 cm). Measure and trace the squares onto the wrong (back) side of a piece of cotton fabric. Then, cut along the lines using a pair of sharp fabric scissors. [1] X Research source If desired, cut out circles, triangles, or hexagons instead. [2] X Research source"

Place the fabric squares so that the right sides are facing each other and the wrong sides are facing outwards. Line up the edges of the 2 fabric pieces on all sides. Then, insert 2 pins through the center of the squares to keep them in place.

Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting and place the edge of the fabric square under the presser foot. Apply gentle pressure to begin sewing along the edge of the square. Sew until you are about 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the beginning of your stitches, and then stop sewing. [4] X Research source Make sure to avoid the pins as you sew! Do not sew over them or you may damage your machine or the pins."

Then, grab a handful of stuffing and begin pushing it in through the opening you left in the square. Keep stuffing the square until it is nice and plump. The cushion should be firm with no air bubbles, but it should not be bursting at the seams. [5] X Research source The type of stuffing you use can change the way the pincushion works. If you use polyester stuffing, the pincushion will be very light and soft, but if you use something like straw, it will be firmer. Steel wool can even sharpen your pins! Use the back of the pencil eraser to push in as much stuffing as possible. Just be careful not to put too much stress on the seams as you do this."
