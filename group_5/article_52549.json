      "title": "Clean the broccoli.",
      "content": "Clean the broccoli. If you bought your broccoli at a commercial grocery store, a thorough rinse is fine. If you grew your own broccoli or bought it at a farm stand, soak the broccoli in salted water for 10 minutes, then rinse it thoroughly. Garden-fresh broccoli is prone to cabbage loopers, a common garden pest. In their larval stage, cabbage loopers are green, approximately 1-inch-long worms. Though they're harmless, they can be a real appetite killer. The worms die in the salt water. The cabbage loopers will float to the top of the surface of the water where you can skim them off and dispose of them."

      "content": "Cut the florets. Cut the trunks of each floret, or little bunch of broccoli, until you break the florets into several smaller pieces that are easy to work with. If you're not a fan of the stalks, cut just below the crown. If you want to get more mileage from your broccoli, cut farther down the stalk closer to the main stem of the broccoli bunch."

Broccoli should be cooked al dente. If it is still partially frozen, cook it for more time in 30-second increments until it's done, and then remove it from the microwave.
