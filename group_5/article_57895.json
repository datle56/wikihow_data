      "content": "The silent treatment is when someone stops communicating to manipulate you. It’s common for someone who shows narcissistic behavior to start giving you the silent treatment after a tough conversation or argument, or it may seem like a switch flipped and they went quiet for no apparent reason. They may ignore you, avoid speaking to you unless they want something, or interrupt you when you try to discuss an important topic. Because they’re not listening to what you have to say, they may be using the silent treatment or “stonewalling” as a form of abuse or manipulation so they can get what they want. [1] X Research source Some people may also get physically distant when they’re giving you the silent treatment. People who are passive-aggressive or conflict-avoidant may also give the silent treatment. However, this behavior is displayed by those who exhibit narcissistic tendencies, and they may consistently use it as a way to punish or control another person. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The silent treatment can last days or weeks. Someone who is using silent treatment as a tool may only stay quiet for a couple of hours to just prove a point. If they really want to feel like they’re in control and make you feel unimportant, then they may continue ignoring you for multiple days or weeks. Whenever the person feels like they don’t have that control over you anymore, then they may start talking again.

      "content": "To avoid responsibility If you’re trying to hold someone accountable for something that went wrong, they may go silent rather than take the blame. They’re worried that you’ll focus on their flaws and shortcomings, so they’ll stay quiet to avoid the problem rather than embracing an uncomfortable truth. [4] X Research source Example: If you catch a partner lying about what they did the other night, they’d rather go silent and pretend nothing happened instead of telling you."

      "content": "To punish you If you make a comment that rubs someone the wrong way, they may use the silent treatment on you. They may not even tell you what made them upset in the first place and leave you to guess what happened. One of the main signs of narcissistic personalities is a fragile ego—they don't want to feel like they’re in the wrong. Instead, they may make you feel like you’re the one that caused an issue so you feel bad. [5] X Research source Example: If this person feels like you embarrassed them by making a joke, they may ignore you until you apologize. Remember that it’s not your fault for how someone responds to something you’ve said. When anyone gives you the silent treatment, it highlights their insecurities rather than yours."

      "content": "To lower your self-esteem When a self-important person ignores you and doesn’t respond, they’re forcing you to sit with your emotions so you feel like you’re less important or less interesting than you. They know that their silence will make you feel anxious or depressed, especially if there’s an underlying conflict that still needs to be resolved. [6] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source If you’re feeling anxious or stressed by a friend or family member giving you the silent treatment, take a deep breath, hold it for a few seconds, and slowly exhale to calm down.

      "content": "To feel in control Someone who struggles with traits of narcissism wants to feel like they’re in control of everything in their lives, so they may give you the silent treatment if they feel like you’re pulling away. They’ll play mind games and stay quiet in hopes that you’ll get anxious and give them the exact reaction that they wanted. [7] X Research source Example: If this individual feels like they’re losing a heated argument, they’ll go quiet and avoid listening to you so you don’t have any agency in the discussion. Rather than giving in to the silent treatment, avoid giving them the attention they crave and focus on doing things for yourself."

      "content": "To make you lash out People with narcissistic qualities know that the silent treatment makes you upset, so they may keep their lips sealed. They might keep manipulating you until you have an angry outburst so they can play the victim and say you’re the one who’s acting poorly while they were level-headed. [8] X Research source Avoid trying to reason someone who’s giving you the silent treatment since they could twist your words against you. It’s best just to let them go about their day and ignore them."

      "content": "To make you codependent A common sign of narcissistic behavior is someone going through a cycle of love bombing where they shower you with compliments or affection before letting their true colors start to show. If they feel like you’re pulling away, they may give you the silent treatment to make you miss all the nice things that they said or done at the start of the relationship and come back to them. [9] X Research source Example: If you start opening up and asking a person with narcissistic traits to do the same, they may go silent and ghost you the next time you try reaching out. This may happen if you’re dealing with narcissistic hoovering, which is when someone tries to suck you back into a toxic relationship."

Rather than trying to communicate and being met with silence, ignoring someone who’s acting in a narcissistic way will give them a taste of their own medicine.

      "content": "Set boundaries for how you want to communicate. As you establish your boundaries , really take a moment to consider what behavior you’ll tolerate and what you will not stand for, like being given the silent treatment. Communicate your boundaries clearly and let the other person know about the consequences they might face for breaking them. Example: If someone stonewalls you, you could say, “I don’t deserve to be given the silent treatment, and I won’t be around you until you’re ready to have a conversation.” Make sure you continue to enforce your boundaries all the time. If a person who tends toward narcissistic thinking sees that you’ll break a boundary once, they may try to keep doing it to wear you down."

Rather than isolating yourself while someone is giving you the silent treatment, reach out to your loved ones and let them know what you’re going through. Spend time with them and continue building the connections that matter to you so you don’t feel alone. Your friends and family may even have helpful advice for you if they’ve gone through a similar situation in the past. If you’re really struggling, reach out to a therapist or narcissistic abuse support group in your area so they can help you recognize the issues you’re dealing with and ways to manage them. Remember that anyone can demonstrate narcissistic patterns of behavior, regardless of whether they’ve been diagnosed with NPD or not. Whatever manipulative or demeaning behaviors you’re experiencing, a counselor or therapist can help."

If you’re repeatedly trying to handle getting the silent treatment from someone in your life, then you may not be able to change their way of thinking. Think about if the person is really meeting your needs and expectations, and end the relationship to prioritize yourself over the other person. You deserve someone who will respect you and have open communication when issues arise, so don’t be afraid to end things with a person focused only on themselves."
