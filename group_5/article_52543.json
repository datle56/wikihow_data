      "content": "Choose bean sprouts with a pale color and a crisp, firm texture. Avoid ones that look brown, limp, wilted, or slimy. You should also avoid ones that have musty smell. [4] X Research source Make sure that your bean sprouts are refrigerated; otherwise, they are susceptible to bacteria. They can be pre-packaged, or they can be sold loose/by weight."

      "title": "Store the sprouts in the fridge, separate from raw meat and seafood.",
      "content": "Store the sprouts in the fridge, separate from raw meat and seafood. As soon as you get home from the store, transfer the bean sprouts into the refrigerator. Keep them in the veggie drawer, separate from raw meat, including seafood. You will be washing and cooking the bean sprouts eventually, but you still want to avoid cross-contamination with raw meat and seafood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy the bean sprouts just before you want to cook them.",
      "content": "Buy the bean sprouts just before you want to cook them. Some foods can last a while in the fridge, but the sooner you use bean sprouts, the better. For example, if you buy loose bean sprouts by weight, you will need to use them within 2 days. It would be best to buy them the same day or the day before. If you buy pre-packaged ones, you need to use them before the \"best-buy\" date. The longer you let bean sprouts sit unused in the fridge, the more prone they'll be to growing bacteria."

      "title": "Rinse the beans with cool, filtered water before you cook them.",
      "content": "Rinse the beans with cool, filtered water before you cook them. Wash your hands with soap and water first, then place the beans into a strainer or colander. Rinse the beans with filtered water, then gently shake them to remove any excess moisture. You can pinch off this wispy, brown thread at the end of the root if you want to, but this is not absolutely necessary. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring 4 cups (1 L) of water to a boil over medium to high heat. This will be enough for 9 ounces (255 g) of bean sprouts. You can prepare more bean sprouts if you want to, but you'll need to add more water. If you are cooking more bean sprouts, use enough water to cover them."

      "title": "Add the bean sprouts and cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Add the bean sprouts and cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The water will die down when you add the bean sprouts, so let it return to a boil first. Once it is boiling again, set the timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Be sure to rinse the bean sprouts with filtered water first. You can also remove the brown threads from the roots, but you don't have to."

      "title": "Drain the bean sprouts in a colander.",
      "content": "Drain the bean sprouts in a colander. Jiggle the colander to drain the excess water, then set the bean sprouts aside for 5 minutes so that they can finish draining. If the colander doesn't have little feet to stand on, set it over an empty pot instead. This is important; otherwise, the extra moisture will dilute any sauces, oils, or dressings that you add."

You can add them to a side dish, or you can turn them into a popular Japanese salad. If you want to turn them into a popular Japanese salad, keep reading!"

      "content": "Combine the onion, scallion, sesame seeds, and garlic. Chop the scallion into small pieces first--the thinner, the better--then add it to a small bowl. Next, grind the toasted sesame seeds using a mortar and pestle, and add them to the bowl as well. Add in 1 grated garlic clove, then stir everything together. If you can't buy toasted sesame seeds, you'll need to toast them yourself in a dry frying pan for a few seconds. Peel the garlic clove before you grate it. If you don't have anything to grate the garlic with, use a garlic press instead."

Stir everything with a fork until the ingredients come together. This step completes the dressing for the salad. You can use a different type of oil, if you want to, but the flavor may not be the same."

Place the salad into the refrigerator and wait 30 minutes. Serve the salad immediately afterwards. You can save the salad for later, but eat it within 24 hours."

      "content": "Heat 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of vegetable oil in a skillet. Tilt the skillet around so that the oil coats it evenly first, then set the skillet down on the burner. Turn the heat up to high, and let the oil heat up; it's ready when it starts to bubble. You can use another type of oil if you want something more flavorful, such as peanut oil. Vegetable oil is recommended because it won’t impart a strong flavor to the bean sprouts."

      "content": "Add 1 small chopped onion and fry it for 2 minutes. If you have not already, prepare 1 small onion by peeling the papery outer layer first, then cutting off both ends. Chop the onion into small pieces, then toss them into the skillet. Fry it for 2 minutes, stirring it often with a wooden spatula. You can omit this step if you don’t like onion, or replace it with 1 clove of garlic instead."
