[10] X Research source [11] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source When you think something self-critical (such as “I’m so stupid”), ask yourself questions like: “Is it true? Would I say it to/about someone else? Do I gain anything by thinking this? What would I gain if I stopped thinking this way?” Focus on subtly rephrasing thoughts so that they put more emphasis on how to view a situation positively. For instance, instead of thinking “I won’t let myself be so distracted at school any more,” try saying to yourself “I am going to develop my work ethic.” Try this simple exercise. Fold a piece of paper in half. On one side, write any negative thoughts you may have about yourself. On the other side, write a corresponding positive thought to replace each negative one."
