Check the registry of a kennel club or the Cane Corso Association of America (CCAA) to see if there is anyone interested in mating their dog with yours.

Go to source If you have a female dog (or dam), you may need to pay for a male stud. If the stud has a strong pedigree or awards, their fees may be higher. Female dogs should be at least eighteen months old before they breed. If you have a male dog, keep in mind that generally the owner of the dam keeps the puppies. If you want a few of the puppies, you can make an arrangement in which you hire your stud for free in exchange for puppies."

      "content": "Do genetic testing on both parents. Cane corsos are generally healthy dogs. Like all dogs, they are susceptible to hip and elbow problems. A DNA test may indicate how likely your puppies are to develop problems. If the probability is high, do not breed the dogs. Some common problems in cane corso include: Hip and elbow dysplasia Epilepsy Ectropion (eyelid folded out) and entropion (eyelid folded inward) Skin allergies"

      "title": "Find potential adopters.",
      "content": "Find potential adopters. Even before your dog is pregnant, try to find at least a few potential adopters for the puppies. Advertise that you are going to have a litter of puppies, and create a list of interested people. Tell your friends, vet, and social media networks about your plans to breed the dog. Ask them to refer you to anyone interested in adopting one. You can also contact a kennel or the CCAA. People who are searching for cane corso puppies will often start there to look for breeders."

      "content": "Wait until the female is in heat. In general, cane corso go into heat every six months. When your dam is in heat, it may start urinating more often. You may notice a slight pinkish twinge to the urine. Nervous behavior is also normal. The dam may lift up its rear end to male dogs and hold its tail off to the side. This is a sign that it is ready to mate."

      "title": "Take the dam to the stud to mate.",
      "content": "Take the dam to the stud to mate. Leave the dogs alone so that they can mate. The stud will mount the dam, and they will stay attached for about ten to thirty minutes. Do not separate the dogs, as you might accidentally injure them. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source For the best results, try mating the dogs two or three times. Let them mate once every two days. You will typically take the dam to wherever the stud is. This is because male dogs tend to get more nervous in strange places than female dogs do."

      "content": "Try artificial insemination if other options haven't worked. Artificial insemination is useful if you cannot find a nearby stud or if the dam is having problems conceiving naturally. While it is an expensive process, many veterinary clinics now offer it. The vet will monitor the dam's progesterone levels so that semen is injected at the most fertile time. You can get frozen donor sperm from a stud if you can't find a stud in your area. If you have a stud, its sperm will be collected by introducing it to a female in heat. The vet will collect the dog's sperm from an artificial vagina when the male dog tries to mount the female."

They also do abdominal palpitation and x-ray tests to determine the litter size. For abdominal palpitation, your vet will feel your cane corso's abdominal area for sacs. Each sac carries a puppy. This can be done at day 28 of the pregnancy. X-rays will show how many fetal skeletons are in your dog's uterus. These can be done on day 45 of pregnancy."

A few days before your dog is ready to give birth, take its temperature with a rectal thermometer. When the temperature drops to 100 °F (38 °C), you can expect the puppies to be born within 24 hours.
