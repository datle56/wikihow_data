Some Temu users believe the company spies on them through the in-app browser and that the spyware tracks their offsite behavior and records sensitive data like banking information, Social Security numbers, and mailing addresses. Some have even reported fraudulent charges on their bank account after using Temu.

Some listings on Temu are direct copies from the original product’s Amazon storefront, typically made without the store owners’ knowledge or approval.

Many promotions promise free mobile games or money to those who sign up for the site and input their personal information, which Temu can then use to advertise and promote their services. Essentially, Temu pays users to use their personal data however they see fit, which makes many people feel uneasy. [8] X Research source One of Temu’s policies for a $50 cash reward states, “Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, participation in the Program and/or receipt or use of Rewards constitutes a Member’s consent for Sponsor to use and publish such Member’s photo, name likeness, voice, opinions, statements, biographical information, and/or hometown and state for promotional or advertising purposes in any media worldwide, now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity without further review, notification, payment, or consideration.” [9] X Research source Scammers also often create fake ads of celebrities and influencers “promoting” Temu to get new users to sign up with a referral code. The scammers then get the money from the referral and sometimes send fake “leaked” photos of the celebrities to those who used the code. While this may not be Temu’s fault, its users’ safety is still threatened."
