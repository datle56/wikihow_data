      "content": "Decide which type of pastels you would like to use. Pastels come in several forms, oil pastels, hard pastels, soft pastels, and pastel pencils, and each has distinctive properties. Oil pastels are pastels with wax and inert oil as added ingredients."

      "content": "Learn about the types of paper you use for pastel painting. Pastel paper comes in a variety of different textures and weights but is usually rougher than the paper used for acrylic or watercolor painting. This is because pastel does not like to stick to a completely smooth surface. Pastel paper also comes in different colors, as pastels are great for working on colored paper because of the density and saturation of their color. Pastel paper is sometimes manufactured with a \"laid\" effect, meaning the grain on one side is made of closely spaced lines and the opposite side has a slightly mottled surface. Yet another type of pastel painting paper is very close to a carborundum (wet 'n dry) or a coarse sandpaper. These can be fun types of paper to experiment with. If you're using oil pastels, choose a paper that's okay for oil paint. You could also use cardboard prepared with a clear matte gel, or you could apply some acrylic gesso to your paper."

If you are unsure which type you would like to use, try purchasing a few pieces of each type of pastel and paper, then figure out what you like, and don't like, about each through experimentation. While not used interchangeably, soft pastels, hard pastels, and pastel pencils can be used in combination with each other in the same painting. Oil pastels, on the other hand, can be difficult to blend with the other types of pastels. Keep this in mind when purchasing your pastels. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay down the main areas of color. Look at your sketch and choose the main color, which is going to be the largest area of your painting. Paint with a light touch as you block in shapes and forms preliminarily. Once you are sure that the image is laid out correctly, use harder and more definite lines. To keep an area lighter, apply white pastel over that spot before applying the color. If it is still too dark, scrape it down with a scraper and repaint."

      "content": "Finish blending colors by using your fingers, dampened color shapers, or sharpened blenders. This can add the final, polished details that will really make your painting look great. Add fine color detail by picking up small amounts of pastel on the tip of a blender. Using a finer tool allows you to add in tiny details, like the light in an eye, more easily than by using even a pastel pencil. Create softer edges by using a rounded, white eraser to blend. Simply drag the color out in gentle curves, making the lines fade over the paper. You can also blend by using discarded packing peanuts. Packing peanuts allow you to save your fingertips while giving you the ability to lightly blend your colors. Using a packing pellet to blend pastel colors also prevents you from scraping your fingers on a rough-surfaced paper."

      "content": "Fix the image you have created with fixative. Unlike traditional liquid paints, pastels will always be subject to damage and blending if the surface is touched. To stop this, fixative can be purchased at your local art supply store. Alternatively, you can put your pastel painting under glass in a frame. This will keep your image safe from accidental disruption."

      "content": "Study the qualities of each of your materials. Oil pastels, hard pastels, soft pastels, and pastel pencils all have different properties that you should explore through experimentation. Run each type of pastel across a piece of paper. Notice how the lines they make are distinctive. Pick up a pastel pencil and notice that not only does it resemble a traditional graphite pencil, the stroke it creates is detailed like a traditional pencil. Handle a soft pastel pencil and feel its softer consistency. When pulling it across a piece of paper notice how much of it's pigments are transferred depending on the pressure you apply to it. Apply a hard pastel to a piece of paper. Play with how you draw it across the paper. Use it on its end and then on its side. Notice how the lines created differ. Press firmly then softly and see how these lines differ as well."

      "title": "Experiment with the paper you have acquired.",
      "content": "Experiment with the paper you have acquired. If you are using loose pieces of paper, it can be helpful to tape it down with masking tape, so that you are not constantly having to hold it in place. Study the \"tooth\" of pastel paper. \"Tooth\" indicates how much pastel pigment the paper is able to hold. Paper with more tooth allows more pastel to adhere to the paper. Paper that is too smooth is difficult to use if you plan to paint several layers on it. Learn about how the paper's color affects the mood of your painting. Dark red paper adds a warmer glow, while paler paper colors give a softer, more subdued effect."
