      "content": "Get to know her first. While many girls like fast-moving relationships, others will reject your advances if you try too much too soon. If you want to kiss her but you barely know one another, there’s a large chance that she’ll decline the kiss, leaving you both feeling awkward. Make sure that you’ve had ample time to get to know one another and that the kiss won’t catch her off guard. Respect is the most important part of any relationship with a girl, whether it's physical or purely friendly. The more you get to know and respect her, the easier it will be to accept rejection: you'll already be on the way to being good friends even if a romantic relationship doesn't work out.

      "content": "Choose the setting. A girl can reject a kiss for many reasons, and some of them have to do with the time and place of the kiss. Knowing her personality will help a lot with this step, because all girls have different preferences when it comes to dating. [2] X Research source For example, it’s likely that she won’t like to be kissed with a large group of people nearby, as she may become embarrassed. Try picking a secluded place like a park or quiet room when no one else is around. If she has a romantic personality, pick a scenic place for your kiss, like a beautiful nature preserve or a quiet art museum. Romantic places come in many varieties, so you’ll have to know her personality to choose the best one. Make sure that it’s a very memorable spot. Kiss her by her door. If choosing a place for a first kiss is too difficult, go with an old standby. Walk or drive her home, and then go for the kiss at her front door. This works best at the end of a good date."

      "content": "Make sure your hygiene is on order. Good grooming habits are important in general, but become even more important when going in for a kiss. Because you’ll be so close to her, she’ll be more likely to notice any flaws in your hygiene. Make sure your breath is fresh. Gum or mints are a great way to make sure that your breath smells good before going in for a kiss. If you go out for dinner on your date, try to avoid anything too pungent with strong garlic or onions. If your breath is noticeably bad, she may turn down the kiss. Even worse, she may go through with it and have a bad experience that she won’t be able to forget. Keep your facial hair neat. Some girls like guys with facial hair, and others don’t. It may be too soon in your relationship to know what her preferences are, but you can still extend her some common courtesy. Beards and mustaches can scratch or abrade her face, making the experience unpleasant. Also, unkempt or uneven facial hair is unattractive in general. Trim your facial hair, and use an oil or balm to soften coarse beards and mustaches. [3] X Research source Shower and use deodorant.
