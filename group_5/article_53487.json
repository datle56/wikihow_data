      "title": "Start the first dance steps when the song’s hook comes in.",
      "content": "Start the first dance steps when the song’s hook comes in. When you hear Cupid start singing “Down, down, do your dance…,” that’s your cue to start your dance. Step your right foot out to the side, and then bring your left foot to meet it on the next beat. Take 4 steps total to move across the dance floor. [1] X Research source If the dance floor is pretty crowded, you may only be able to take baby steps. If you have lots of space, feel free to take large steps. The lyrics of the Cupid Shuffle song explain the instructions for the line dance, so some people may wait until this part of the song to start the steps. If no one else has started the steps, wait until you hear the words, “To the right, to the right…” in the song."

      "content": "Switch directions right when you finish stepping to the right. Repeat what you did in the previous step but in the opposite direction! Put your left foot out to the side, plant it, and bring your right foot to meet it. Repeat this three times to get right back to where you started originally. [2] X Research source Feel free to add a little pep to your step while you’re moving. Add a little hop or bounce, do a smooth slide with your feet, or sway your hips to the music."

      "title": "Kick your feet in front of you along to the beat.",
      "content": "Kick your feet in front of you along to the beat. Start by extending your right leg and bringing your foot down so your heel taps the floor in front of you. Then, bring your right foot back to center and tap your left heel out. Do another kick with each foot so you do it a total of 4 times. [3] X Research source Keep your knees loose and slightly bent so you look more relaxed and comfortable throughout the dance. Be mindful of how crowded the dance floor is when you kick out your feet. Stick to little kicks if you don’t have a lot of space, or kick your foot out more if you have some space."

      "content": "Swiveling your feet is also called “walking it out.” Put your weight on the balls of your feet and lift your heels off the ground. Turn your feet to the right first and keep your knees bent. Then swivel to the left side. Keep alternating back and forth for the next 8 counts of the sound. As you swivel, try to get lower and lower to the floor to have more fun with the dance move."

      "title": "Turn your whole body to the left to finish out the steps.",
      "content": "Turn your whole body to the left to finish out the steps. Keep your knees bent while you’re turning to face the next direction. Make sure to finish your turn within the 8 counts while you’re walking it out so you aren’t late with the next steps. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Start from the beginning to keep your dance going. As soon as you’re done swiveling and facing a different wall, start over with 4 steps to the right again. Keep going through all the steps until you’re tired and want to leave the dance floor, or until the song is over."

      "content": "Make the Cupid Shuffle your own with some simple on-beat arm motions. There isn’t any choreography for your arms, so you play around a little to find what feels right. Bring some individuality to your dance by snapping your fingers, shimmying your shoulders, or placing your hands on your hips. [5] X Research source When you kick your feet out, move the opposite arm. Try popping your arm forward like you’re doing a swimming stroke, punching straight in front of you, or rolling your wrists along to the music if you’re short on space. Avoid locking your arms close to your side because it can make you look uncomfortable and robotic."
