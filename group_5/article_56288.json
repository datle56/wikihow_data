      "content": "Place the wood (or brick) on two stable chopping blocks, with the wood grain running in the same direction as the way your hand is facing to chop. Chopping with the grain makes the wood easier to break. [1] X Research source Choose thin, smooth board for chopping, such as slim pine boards. Don't try to chop anything that is too thick or hard (3\" maximum is suggested to start). A cinder block may be possible if you have been training for a few weeks and yell very loudly when making contact."

      "content": "Prepare for the strike by staying calm . Freaking out will not help since the key to successful striking is the mind, you want to stay as calm as possible before you strike. Imagine your hand going through the wood or brick. If you can't see it happening, chances are it won't happen. This could be bad if it doesn't. Remain positive. Be one with the chopping motion."

      "content": "If you don't chop it, check on how you feel. If you feel very little pain, try to improve your speed. A little extra strength is also helpful for successful karate chopping. [5] X Research source The edge and heel of the hand can take quite a lot of force provided they are the parts of your hand that contact with the wood. However, as a learner, it is best to have someone mentor you or, if that is not possible, to bring down your hand gently and with repeated practice, increase the force. If you feel great pain, stop for the day. If any serious damage to your body has occurred, see a doctor immediately."
