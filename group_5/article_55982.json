      "title": "Stimulate your breasts towards the end of your pregnancy.",
      "content": "Stimulate your breasts towards the end of your pregnancy. Starting about 2 months before the baby is due, start to pump your breasts with an electric pump. This can stimulate prolactin production. Start by pumping for 5 minutes, three times daily. Gradually increase this to pumping for 10 minutes every four hours, and then to 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Keep doing this until the baby is born. The goal is not to actually produce milk, but to stimulate your nipples and breasts to produce more prolactin."

      "title": "Pump after you breastfeed.",
      "content": "Pump after you breastfeed. The more your breasts are stimulated, the more prolactin your body produces. Breastfeed on a regular schedule as often as you can, and use a mechanical pump daily, even after feedings. When you start to transition your baby to bottles, formulas, or soft foods, pump your breasts every time you feed your baby. [3] X Research source Pumping after you feed can drain your breast of the milk your baby left behind, stimulating further prolactin production. Aim to use your pump for 30 minutes on each breast daily. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "title": "Try taking fenugreek.",
      "content": "Try taking fenugreek. Some mothers find that the herb fenugreek may increase milk supply, likely by increasing prolactin. Get capsules at your drug store or health food store, or by ordering them online in 610mg capsules. Try taking 2 capsules 3 times daily with food. If you have no side effects, you can gradually increase the dose to 4 capsules 3 times daily. A normal side effect is that your urine and sweat may start to smell like maple syrup. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Diarrhea may occur, but resolves when you stop taking the herb. Do not take fenugreek if you are pregnant, or have a peanut or chickpea allergy. Take it with your doctor’s supervision if you’re diabetic or have asthma – asthma symptoms may be worsened, and fenugreek can cause low blood sugar. [6] X Research source It may also affect your thyroid function."

If you need to increase your prolactin but you can’t or don’t want to get pregnant, you may be able to work closely with your doctor to “trick” your body into thinking you’re pregnant. This involves taking estrogen and progesterone in certain amounts and at certain times, possibly for over 6 months. [13] X Research source"
