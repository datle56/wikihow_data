      "title": "He’s interested in you.",
      "content": "He’s interested in you. When was the last time you picked up the phone and called someone you didn’t really care for, just casually? Can’t remember? Exactly. A phone call requires time and energy, and we don’t give that time and energy to just anyone. If he’s ringing you up, it’s probably because you’ve caught his eye, and now he wants to make a move—even if it’s a small one."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s putting effort into communicating with you.",
      "content": "He’s putting effort into communicating with you. Texting is almost too easy. The stakes are low, everything’s planned, and there’s very little chance to mess things up. That’s why most people stick to it. [1] X Research source But a guy who picks up the phone to call you is taking a bit of a risk to show you that he cares enough to put in the effort, and that you’re worth that risk."

    {
      "title": "He’s trying to spark more chemistry.",
      "content": "He’s trying to spark more chemistry. There’s only so much rapport you can build over texting, and often, a real conversation, even over the phone, helps someone to flirt and gauge the other person’s interest more organically. [2] X Research source He might be calling you to have a more impromptu, organic conversation that brings you closer together."
    },
    {
      "title": "He wants to make your relationship more serious.",
      "content": "He wants to make your relationship more serious. Studies show that people feel much more connected and even intimate when they make a phone call than they would if they were just texting. [3] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source If he calls you, he might have decided that it’s time ditch the small talk and get a little more serious, and is calling you to deepen that bond."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might just need a little help with something.",
      "content": "He might just need a little help with something. Context is important. A guy who calls you to ask about the chemistry homework might also be using it as an excuse to talk, or he might just genuinely need the chem homework and yours was the first number that came to mind. How can you tell the difference? Ask yourself: Do the two of you interact, chat, or even flirt otherwise? If he shows other signs of being into you, then calling to ask a favor could be another way to get closer. If you barely talk to each other outside that phone call, he might have just needed the favor. That doesn’t mean it’s a dead end, though. Return his call a few days later with your own question and see where things go!"

    {
      "title": "He could be a little clingy.",
      "content": "He could be a little clingy. Now, we don’t know the full details of the situation, but if he’s calling you constantly, multiple times a day, to the point where you’re getting a little annoyed, he might be something of a clinger. Maybe he got a little too attached too quickly and just can’t help himself. It’s still a sign he’s into you, but it could also be a little bit of a red flag. More concerning, if he always calls you to ask what you’re doing or where you are, and gets fussy about it, he could be worse than clingy—he could be controlling, and that’s definitely a red flag."
    },
    {
      "title": "He makes a lot of eye contact.",
      "content": "He makes a lot of eye contact. Relationship consultant Joshua Pompey says that making frequent eye contact is a “tremendous sign of interest.” It shows that a guy literally can’t keep his eyes off you—he wants to keep his attention on you to see if you’re enjoying yourself, and hopes that you notice him, as well. On the other hand, straight-up staring could also be a sign of attraction, but is a little weirder and a bit more of a red flag. Moderation in everything!"

    {
      "title": "He always smiles around you.",
      "content": "He always smiles around you. Relationship expert Joshua Pompey says that “when someone is looking at you and they’re smiling a lot,” that’s a common sign they’re into you. He enjoys being in your company, but more importantly, he wants you to know that he enjoys it. He might also be hoping that by smiling a lot, he’s lifting the mood and making things comfortable for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He gives you respectful little touches.",
      "content": "He gives you respectful little touches. Dating coach Candice Mostisser shares some flirty forms of touch: “touching a hand over another hand, putting a hand on a leg temporarily, coming around a table if you're sitting across from somebody to come sit next to them.” It’s those small opportunities he uses to get physically closer that are huge green flags. Of course, consent is key. If you feel like he’s getting a little too close or is too comfortable touching you unprompted, that’s a red flag."
    },
    {
      "title": "He asks you meaningful questions about yourself.",
      "content": "He asks you meaningful questions about yourself. Dating consultant Joshua Pompey says that “just because someone asked a personal question doesn't mean they're interested.” Rather, it’s the “personal questions that show genuine interest” that matter. Some examples of those are: Questions about your own interests and how you spend your time. Questions about your relationship status, or what you want from a relationship. Questions about what you want from the future."

    {
      "title": "He fixes his appearance when you’re near.",
      "content": "He fixes his appearance when you’re near. A guy who’s into you really wants to impress you, and often that means looking his best. If you notice him excuse himself, then come back looking a little sharper—his hair is nicer, his shirt is smoothed, he put on some cologne—he’s almost definitely trying to put his best foot forward and catch your eye."
    },
    {
      "title": "He talks about spending more time with you.",
      "content": "He talks about spending more time with you. Dating coach Candice Mostisser says that more concrete plans based on your mutual interests are the golden ticket: “I'm talking about if you find mutual interests: you both love cooking, coming up with a theoretical plan of, ‘Oh, it would be so fun to go together to the farmer's market, get some fresh veggies, and cook something together one day.’” She adds: “Those are really the ways that somebody is able to cement a vision of how they picture a life with you could start.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "He makes you a priority.",
      "content": "He makes you a priority. Dating coach siblings Jan & Jillian Yuhas emphasize that “if someone really likes you they will make quality time for the relationship.” A guy who likes you will set aside time for you, and he’ll drop everything and lend an ear when you need help. After all, being closer to you is one of his top goals, and he’ll take every opportunity he can get to let you know that he’s the right one for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He introduces you to his social circle.",
      "content": "He introduces you to his social circle. A guy’s friend group isn’t open to just anyone. If he introduces you to his friend circle he’s telling both you and his friends that he expects you to be around for a while, as part of his regular social life. It’s his way of saying, “Hey guys, be cool around her. She’s a keeper and you’ll be seeing a lot of her.” It’s an especially good sign if he introduces you to his parents or his family—he could be hinting at serious commitment."
    },
    {
      "title": "He uses “we” to talk about the two of you.",
      "content": "He uses “we” to talk about the two of you. At some point in the talking stage, “you and I” or “she and I” becomes “we.” It’s not, “Yeah, I’ll ask her if she wants to come,” but, “Of course we’ll be there.” It’s a sign that he thinks the two of you have gotten closer, and that he sees you as a unit, rather than two separate people."
    },
    {
      "title": "He deletes his dating apps.",
      "content": "He deletes his dating apps. If he was on the apps looking for the one, but he deleted the apps after he met you, there’s really only one thing that could mean. He’s not looking, because he’s found what he’s been searching for, and he’s willing to go all-in on you and your relationship. Similarly, he might follow you on social media and interact with your posts. It’s a small, digital sign that you’ve got his attention."
    },
    {
      "title": "He shows you his vulnerable side.",
      "content": "He shows you his vulnerable side. Many men are notoriously stoic, and avoid being vulnerable. [4] X Research source There’s a lot of complex social psychology stuff happening there, and we’re not here to solve all that, but it’s no secret that if a guy opens up to you, it means he feels safe and comfortable enough to trust you, which is huge for your relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "He acts a little awkward around you.",
      "content": "He acts a little awkward around you. Even the most confident and suave guys can fumble a bit when they see someone they like. Maybe his voice cracks, his hands tremble, or the conversation is a little stop-and-go. It’s not always comfortable, but it could be a sign that he wants so badly to impress you that he’s actually just psyching himself out. Other signs that a guy might be nervous about his feelings include talking too fast, trouble making eye contact, or stumbling over his words."
    },
    {
      "title": "He offers small and thoughtful gestures.",
      "content": "He offers small and thoughtful gestures. It could be sending you a bouquet of flowers, or it could be something less obvious, like bringing you your coffee order or reminding you of that important meeting. These small things are actually huge acts of affection that show he cares about you and wants the best for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "His body language is open around you.",
      "content": "His body language is open around you. Dating consultant Joshua Pompey says that “body language is key.” Read his body language : Does he face you when he’s talking to you? Does he lean in to listen? Are his shoulders back and arms uncrossed? These are all signs of open and attentive body language, and are a green light for a budding relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "He remembers the little things you say.",
      "content": "He remembers the little things you say. You don’t even remember mentioning how you love ramen, but here he is suggesting you get dinner at that new ramen place in town. A guy who’s interested hears and remembers what you say, no matter how small. After all, he’s invested, and he wants to get to know everything about you."
