      "title": "Using makeup all the time isn't good for you skin.",
      "content": "Using makeup all the time isn't good for you skin. Use a little mascara on the upper lashes and a clear or pink lip gloss and maybe a little blush to highlight you face or liquid liner starting from the middle of your upper lash line and outwards. This defines your eyes and gives you the 'cat eyes' look. If you don't feel like wearing any at all, put some lip balm on. It helps protect your lips from drying out and gets you closer to achieving those soft, pink lips."

      "content": "Get rid of spots, acne, zits, and pimples for clean, pure skin. If you can't, then get concealer, foundation, or put on natural looking makeup. Be sure that the concealer or foundation is the same color as your natural skin tone. Remember to use the makeup remover to get off all that makeup muck. Take a shower or bath every day, but don't get you hair wet unless you're going to properly shampoo and condition it. Always condition your hair after you shampoo so you can get the silky, glossy and good smelling hair you wanted. Use lotion if you have dry skin, and use sun screen if you want creamy white skin. Brush your teeth. If you have problems having a good smelling breath, mouthwash, and a good smelling toothpaste will do the trick. If pearly whites is the problem, use a good whitening toothpaste and good toothbrush. Brush about 1-3 minutes every time. If you want to smell good, then try to layer fragrances. Start with a scented shower gel or bath oil. Move on to body lotion and finish with a light splash of perfume or body spray. Your skin reveals a lot about your health and habits, so it is vital to take care of your bodyâ€™s largest organ. Exfoliate your skin, including your face and body, up to three times per week.

      "content": "Not only will you feel great, but it give your body a chance to freshens itself and you will look better than the day before. Sweet treats, heavy meals, and sugary drinks before bed will keep you awake, so avoid this. If your tummy's rumbling, then have a cup of warm chamomile tea to help you relax. Try to relax before bed by listening to some gentle music. Make sure you have done your homework earlier, doing right before bed will keep you awake. Put a glass of water next to your bed just in case you wake up thirsty. Pull on some comfy pajamas, wash your face, brush your teeth, and hop on to bed. Read for a while until you are nice and sleepy, then turn out the lights."

      "content": "For some occasions, such as when you go to church, wear dressy stuff, like a dress with dressy but comfortable shoes, like wedges or ballet flats. For everyday wear, go for skinny (but not so skinny that you can't breathe) blue jeans and a cute t-shirt and cool and comfortable shoes, and every now and then, wear a skirt. Invest in quality classic pieces. Don't just follow current trends. Focus on buying the best quality and classic clothes you can, as these pieces are timeless and you last years.

      "content": "Necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, hair clips, the choice is endless! Maybe a necklace and earrings are fine for everyday wear. Oh, a hair clip or headband is fine, too. Remember to make the accessories match the second main color of your clothes. For an example, If you are wearing matching purple skirt and shirt with orange lining and details, then use orange accessories that are a little brighter than the clothes. Remember to keep it to a minimum, though, too much is more than enough!"

      "content": "Regularly shampoo and condition your hair for silky, shiny, luscious locks, but remember to rinse it thoroughly, or it will leave your hair dull and drab, and sometimes, left over shampoo or conditioner will cause an itch to your scalp! Also, different hairstyles will show off what beautiful hair you have. Wearing your hair in a ponytail is one of the prettiest (and simplest) hairstyle you can make. Other essentials are braids, pigtails, buns, side ponytails, and simply let your hair down. Consider changing your hairstyle yearly to add a freshness to your overall appearance. The change doesn't have to be drastic. Sometimes, a simple switch on the way you part your hair can make a huge impact. [3] X Expert Source Sheila A.
