      "content": "Knock opponents’ marbles back to their base by landing on them. Any time one of your marbles lands on an opponent’s, their marble gets knocked back to their base and has to start its trip around the board again. This is called “aggravating” your opponent, and you can guess why! [3] X Research source On the other hand, you can’t land on or jump over your own marbles. Move another marble instead, or wait for another turn to start a new marble out of your base. You can jump over other players’ marbles, though."

      "content": "Use shortcut spaces to move quickly around the board. When you roll a number that lets your marble land exactly on a “star hole,” or the spaces in the center circle of the board, you may move your marble along the other star holes on your next turn, instead of moving it along the normal spaces. [4] X Research source You need an exact roll to enter the star hole shortcut, but not to exit it. Similarly, move into the center hole by rolling the exact number of spaces to get your marble there. But the only way out is to roll a 1 on a future turn. If you do, move your marble to any star hole. Other players can still aggravate you and knock your pieces back to base, even on the shortcut spaces!"

If they roll a 1 or a 6, they may move a marble out of their base and onto their labeled “start” space, but not any further. [5] X Research source After the first player rolls, they pass the dice clockwise to the next player, who takes their turn."

Now, you can move any one of your marbles that are out of the base exactly that number of spaces, clockwise around the board. [6] X Research source If you roll a 1 or a 6, you may choose instead to move another marble out of your base, as long as you don’t already have a marble on your “start” space. Also, after you’ve started a marble, you take another bonus turn if you roll a 6."

[8] X Research source Players can’t use half or only a part of the amount they rolled. Marbles must always be moved the full die count."

You only have a 1 in 6 chance of getting a marble out of the center hole, so only use it when you have other marbles on the board that you may move if you don’t roll a 1."

Once you get all 4 of your marbles home, you still roll the dice on your turn. Now, your partner uses your rolls to move their own marbles, as well.
