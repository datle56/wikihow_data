      "content": "No, but you can select the level of compression. Tech Specialist Luigi Oppido explains, that most file compression programs \"will give you the file sizes. So, one might compress it into a smaller file size than another.\" Most file compression programs allow you to select the level of compression when creating a compressed file. This can make the compressed file larger or smaller. However, you cannot always compress a file to the exact size you want, and there is a limit to how much a file can be compressed. Furthermore, not all file types can be easily compressed. [1] X Research source Many file formats, such as JPEG, MP3, MP4, Docx, and other media files are already compressed files. Compressing these files with a file compression program like WinZIP probably won't do much to reduce the file size. However, you can render smaller file sizes using video and audio editing software or an online converter tool, but doing so may greatly reduce the quality of the file. Most file compression programs, such as WInZIP allow you to select the level of compression. Also, zip files can usually be opened by any SO, so it's the best format for maximum compatibility. If maximum compression isn't enough to reduce a file to the size you want, you can try using an alternative compression method such as WinRAR, or 7-Zip."

      "content": "Yes, you can use WinRAR or 7-Zip. ZIP is one of the oldest and most popular compression methods. Newer operating systems have the ability to create zip files built-in without the need to download additional software. Tech Specialist Luigi Oppido explains, \"the RAR files [sometimes] require a third-party software, but it makes it a little bit smaller and more compressible. The ZIP files are openable by anything.\" He recommends using WinRAR : \"it's great for PC, great for Mac. It's free. You can buy it if you want. You don't have to. And then you [...] just drop the file into WinRAR, hit compress into the file format that you want [...] and compress it.\" 7-Zip is another newer compression program. It also has a higher compression rate than ZIP files and allows you to select the rate of compression."

Then share this link to others via WhatsApp, Snapchat, email, message, etc. This is usually a better way to share large files than splitting. Tech Specialist Luigi Oppido explains, \"you can [split your files], but you're just asking for problems if you're doing that. [...] Splitting is one of the very last, last resorts. [...] I would not ever recommend that [as a first resort] for a large file.\""

      "content": "It depends on the file type and level of compression. Compressing a ZIP, RAR, or 7Z file will not make the file smaller. In some cases, it may make the file bigger. Media files such as JPEG, MP3, MP4, PDF, and Docx are already compressed. However, there are online tools that can reduce the size of these files. However, this will also reduce the quality of the files."
