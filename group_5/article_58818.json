      "content": "The term “ratio” describes a post that generates criticism or disagreement. When someone “gets ratioed,” it means their post has more negative feedback than positive engagement. The number of comments or replies outweighs the number of likes or retweets, indicating the content is controversial. Think of it as the internet’s way of “downvoting” your opinion, or saying you have a bad take on something. [1] X Research source “I feel bad because this kid got ratioed on Twitter.” “You got 23 likes and his reply got 242 likes? He totally ratioed you, dude!”"

      "content": "“W” and “L” ratios indicate whose opinion is more popular online. When the number of likes on a “ratio” comment surpasses the number of likes on the original post, users drop a “W” in the replies to indicate they’ve “won” the debate. If there are more comments that disagree with the original post (compared to likes or retweets), users comment “L” or “ratio L” to show that the original poster has “lost” or been “ratioed.” [2] X Research source “W” and “L” ratios come from the slang phrases “taking a W” or “taking an L,” which refers to winning or losing."

      "content": "“L + Ratio” is a meme template used to tease or insult someone. When someone comments “ L + Ratio ,” they’re saying that the content creator is a complete failure and has been (or will be) humiliated by the feedback on their post. People can use “L + Ratio” on its own or add other insults and silly phrases—often related to popular slang words or memes. [3] X Research source “L + Ratio + go touch grass” “L + Ratio + you fell off after high school” “L + Ratio + Shrek is love + get outta my swamp”"

      "content": "If you “get ratioed,” it means your opinion is less popular than others. Compare the number of likes (or retweets) on your original post against the number of likes on an opposing “ratio” comment. If your post has fewer likes than comments (or fewer likes than a “ratio” comment), it means that the general public disagrees with your opinion or perspective. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "A TikTok ratio request is a way to increase engagement on a post.",
      "content": "A TikTok ratio request is a way to increase engagement on a post. When users comment “ratio 1:1” or “ratio me 1:1,” they want the number of likes on their comment or reply to match the number of likes on the post. For example, if a TikTok has 2,000 likes, the user’s comment needs to have 2,000 likes to achieve a 1:1 ratio. This request can come from a random user or the person who posted the original video. [5] X Research source Why do people ask for a 1:1 ratio? It increases the likes on comments, which may help boost visibility and overall views on the video."

      "title": "The term “ratioed” first appeared on Twitter in early 2017.",
      "content": "The term “ratioed” first appeared on Twitter in early 2017. During this time, the app did not allow users to dislike posts, so people would compare the number of replies to likes and retweets. If the number of replies greatly outnumbered the number of likes and retweets, it meant the tweet was “bad” or poorly received. [6] X Research source On March 7, 2017, Twitter user @85mf posted a screenshot of a tweet by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz. The tweet had 701 replies but only 23 retweets and 108 likes, so they commented, “nothing on this site makes me happier than reply-to-RT ratios like this.”"

      "content": "Generally, users consider “getting ratioed” as a sign of embarrassment. While there’s nothing wrong with disagreeing with someone, “getting ratioed” isn’t exactly a compliment. Likes indicate that other people have the same opinion as you, and studies show that we prefer people who are similar to us. [7] X Research source With that being said, “ratios” don’t define the quality of a post, and the reaction you receive depends on various factors, like the demographic of your following, the topic being mentioned, or the specific platform you share your post. “Ratios” can become toxic if people use them to put others down or spread misinformation. When interacting with others online, be mindful of the comments you post and like, and follow the digital etiquette rules to be respectful."

      "content": "“Drag” This popular slang term is commonly used to criticize someone, but it can also refer to someone getting embarrassed in public. Depending on the context of the conversation, the term can be taken as a joke, especially if the other person is acting weird or wearing something unfashionable. [8] X Research source “Bobby, you’re just asking to be dragged with those shorts on.” “I felt so bad for Josh. Coach was dragging him in front of the entire team.” “She doesn’t deserve to be in control of the aux after playing that song. Guys, drag her!”"

      "content": "“Roast” When you “roast” someone, it means you’re dissing them—your insult is so strong that the other person feels like they’re being roasted over a fire. People usually roast their friends in a playful way, but they can do it to bully others too. Some good examples of roasts include: [9] X Research source “If I throw a stick, will you leave?” “You’re as interesting as a piece of paper.” “Your face looks like a bowl of mashed potatoes.”"

      "content": "“Served” Originating from the 2000s, this iconic slang expression is used after someone proves that they’re better than another person, or if someone has been embarrassed badly. People often say \"you got served\" after a witty comeback or diss. [10] X Research source Them: “I can’t believe she said that about my outfit.” You: “You got served!” Them: “That comment about his mom was out of pocket…” You: “He got SERVED!”"
