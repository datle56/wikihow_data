      "title": "Combine extra virgin olive oil with balsamic vinegar.",
      "content": "Combine extra virgin olive oil with balsamic vinegar. It’s easiest to pour 0.75 cups (180 ml) of olive oil and 0.25 cups (59 ml) of balsamic vinegar directly into a jar with a sealable lid. If you don’t have a sealable jar, pour the olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a small bowl. [1] X Research source The jar or similar container will be shaken, making it important that the seal is tight and secure. If you’re using a bowl, you’ll be whisking the ingredients together instead of shaking them."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle 0.25 tsp (1.2 ml) each of salt and pepper into the liquid.",
      "content": "Sprinkle 0.25 tsp (1.2 ml) each of salt and pepper into the liquid. If you’d rather not measure out the seasoning exactly, just add a pinch of salt and a couple grinds of black pepper. It’s best to add smaller amounts of salt and pepper at a time, as you can always add more if desired. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add extra flavor to the dressing by adding optional ingredients.",
      "content": "Add extra flavor to the dressing by adding optional ingredients. Some people like adding 1 tsp (4.9 ml) of whole grain mustard to the dressing, while others also like adding fresh minced garlic or shallots. If you like the taste of any of these ingredients, add a small amount at a time before tasting the dressing. [3] X Research source Adding mustard helps the vinegar and oil combine more easily. Other ingredients you might want to use include Dijon mustard, sugar, honey, strawberries for a strawberry balsamic vinaigrette, or egg yolk to thicken the consistency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Attach the lid securely and shake the jar to combine the ingredients.",
      "content": "Attach the lid securely and shake the jar to combine the ingredients. Screw the lid onto the jar so that liquid won’t leak through. Shake the jar for 10-15 seconds, helping the ingredients mix together thoroughly. Once the dressing is shaken, it’s ready to be tasted. [4] X Research source If you poured the ingredients into a bowl, use a whisk to stir everything together thoroughly."

    {
      "title": "Play around with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar proportions.",
      "content": "Play around with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar proportions. The most common ratio is 3 parts olive oil to 1 part balsamic vinegar. However, some people like more vinegar in their dressing, while others might want less vinegar. Test the balsamic vinaigrette once it’s been shaken to decide whether you’d like to add any additional ingredients to create the best flavor. [5] X Research source Consider dipping a piece of lettuce in the dressing to taste it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the dressing in the fridge for several weeks.",
      "content": "Keep the dressing in the fridge for several weeks. If you made the vinaigrette with just olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper, it’s not necessary to keep it in the fridge. However, once you add fresh ingredients it’s best to keep the dressing in the refrigerator to be able to use it for several weeks. [6] X Research source Keep the jar sealed when it’s stored on the counter or in the fridge. If you created the vinaigrette in a bowl, transfer it to a sealable container or place a cloth, foil, or plastic wrap over the bowl."

      "title": "Squeeze fresh grapes to use the juice.",
      "content": "Squeeze fresh grapes to use the juice. Lambrusco or Trebbiano grapes are typically the best type for making balsamic vinegar. Crush the grapes using whatever method you’d like, such as placing them in a bowl and mashing them with a kitchen utensil. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that this is usually done with many pounds of grapes using a machine that crushes the grapes and eliminates the pulpy parts when balsamic vinegar is made from companies. The grape juice resulting from the grapes being crushed is called “must.” Wear an apron to prevent grape juice from getting on your clothing. A grape press can help with this process."

    {
      "title": "Strain the crushed grapes to reveal pure juice.",
      "content": "Strain the crushed grapes to reveal pure juice. Place the squeezed grapes and liquid in a strainer to remove any seeds, pulp, or skin with a bowl under the strainer to catch the liquid. You may need to press down on the crushed grapes to remove any lingering juice, ensuring you remove all the fresh juice that you can. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Simmer the grape juice for 2-3 days in a large pot.",
      "content": "Simmer the grape juice for 2-3 days in a large pot. Cook the grape juice until the liquid is reduced by a third or a half, causing it to thicken. Cook the juice slowly, bringing it just under a boil. When it’s done, it will have a nice caramel color and a thick consistency. [9] X Research source Cooking the grapes is important because it kills off bacteria. Avoid exceeding 195 °F (91 °C) while it’s boiling. Use something such as a large kettle or pot to cook the juice."

    {
      "title": "Pour the grape juice into a wooden barrel.",
      "content": "Pour the grape juice into a wooden barrel. You may need to use multiple barrels if you squeezed a lot of grapes. Place a cloth on top of the hole in the barrel to help with evaporation. [10] X Research source These wooden barrels are called “batteria.” Small oak casks are especially helpful for making balsamic vinegar."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the grape juice in wooden barrels for at least 12 years.",
      "content": "Store the grape juice in wooden barrels for at least 12 years. While many balsamic vinegar producers let their vinegar age for 25-50 years, the minimum is 12 years. Storing the juice in barrels helps the juice turn into acetic acid. [11] X Research source The barrels don’t need to stay in an area with a regulated temperature—an attic or similar room is ideal as the temperature fluctuations actually help the vinegar progress."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transfer the juice to a smaller barrel once a year.",
      "content": "Transfer the juice to a smaller barrel once a year. Each year that the juice sits in the barrel, it will lose roughly 10% of its volume. It’s important to move the liquid into smaller barrels each time this happens. Having barrels made of different types of wood, such as cherry, oak, and juniper, gives the liquid added taste each time it’s transferred. [12] X Research source For example, you might have 6 barrels of varying sizes, with each one made of a different wood, such as cherry, ash, acacia, chestnut, juniper, and oak. Moving the liquid to a new barrel each time 10% of it evaporates is what gives it a unique flavor, so if you don't have multiple barrels, your balsamic vinegar may not have the best taste possible. The size barrels you use will depend on how much liquid (grape juice) you have to begin with."

      "title": "Continue transferring the liquid until you’re satisfied with its taste.",
      "content": "Continue transferring the liquid until you’re satisfied with its taste. Once the balsamic vinegar has reached the 12 year mark, it’s up to you as to when you decide it’s ready to be used. Taste the balsamic vinegar to see if the consistency, density, and flavor is ideal, and if it isn't ready, transfer it to a smaller barrel so it can continue aging. [13] X Research source Mass producers of balsamic vinegar must have their vinegar tested by professionals once they believe it’s done before it can be bottled and sold."
