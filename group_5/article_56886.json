The fastest way to make electricity in Little Alchemy 2 is to create “sun,” then “solar cell,” and merge the two. Make sun first (since you’ll need it to make a solar cell). Then, drag one over the other to combine them. And voilà—you’ve got electricity! [1] X Research source To make sun : Earth + Earth = Land Land + Land = Continent Continent + Continent = Planet Planet + Fire = Sun To make a solar cell : Fire + Fire = Energy Sun + Energy = Solar Cell Just getting started?

Although the sun + solar cell method is the fastest if you’re starting from scratch, there are many other ways to make electricity in Little Alchemy 2 . Since lightning is the movement of electrical charges, for example, lightning can also make electricity in the game! Create Metal and merge it with lightning to get electricity. [2] X Research source To make lightning : Fire + Fire = Energy Earth + Earth = Land Land + Land = Continent Continent + Continent = Planet Air + Planet = Atmosphere Atmosphere + Water = Cloud Energy + Cloud = Lightning To make metal : Air + Air = Pressure Earth + Pressure = Stone Stone + Fire = Metal"

      "content": "Merge lightning with steel, alternatively. Steel isn’t technically a metal; it’s actually an alloy. Thus, it’s considered a separate element in Little Alchemy 2 —but making steel in the game and combining it with lightning will still result in electricity! [3] X Research source To make steel : Water + Water = Puddle Puddle + Puddle = Pond Pond + Pond = Lake Lake + Lake = Sea Earth + Sea = Primordial Soup Primordial Soup + Time = Life Life + Time = Death Life + Death = Organic Matter Pressure + Organic Matter = Coal Metal + Coal = Steel Remember that there’s no recipe for time in Little Alchemy 2 . It unlocks automatically after collecting 100 other elements—so just keep merging to get it!"

      "content": "Merge a wind turbine with wind. Since wind turbines are designed to produce electricity, naturally, Little Alchemy 2 lets you make electricity by merging a wind turbine with wind. Make wind first (since you’ll need it to make the turbine). Creating a wind turbine in the game also requires electricity as an ingredient—so you’ll need to create it another way before using this method. [4] X Research source To make wind : Air + Air = Pressure Air + Pressure = Wind To make a wind turbine : Earth + Earth = Land Land + Land = Continent Continent + Continent = Planet Fire + Fire = Energy Sun + Energy = Solar Cell Solar Cell + Sun = Electricity Wind + Electricity = Wind Turbine"

There are 4 different “recipes” to create electricity with wind turbines in Little Alchemy 2 ; instead of combining a turbine with wind, you can use a storm! Simply create a wind turbine (using the combinations above, if you aren’t sure how), make a storm, and merge the two to get electricity. [5] X Research source To make a storm : Earth + Earth = Land Land + Land = Continent Continent + Continent = Planet Air + Planet = Atmosphere Atmosphere + Water = Cloud Cloud + Cloud = Storm"

Once you make the turbine, create the sandstorm, and then merge the two; it doesn’t matter which order you make them in! [6] X Research source To make a sandstorm : Air + Air = Pressure Earth + Pressure = Stone Stone + Air = Sand Air + Pressure = Wind Wind + Wind = Tornado Sand + Tornado = Sandstorm"

Once you create a wind turbine and “motion,” merge the two to get electricity as needed.

Although the “sun + solar cell” method is the easiest and fastest way to create electricity in Little Alchemy 2 , there are other “recipes” involving solar cells that you can use! Instead of combining a solar cell with a sun, merge it with a star to create electricity in the game.

However, this is another recipe that requires electricity to complete, so you’ll need to use the first method in this guide (solar cells + sun) before taking this route. [9] X Research source To make light : Air + Air = Pressure Earth + Pressure = Stone Stone + Air = Sand Sand + Fire = Glass Glass + Electricity = Lightbulb Electricity + Lightbulb = Light"

      "content": "Combine science with a storm. This recipe is a little more obscure than the others, but it’ll work all the same! First, make a storm (using the instructions above if needed). Then, make “science” and merge it with a storm to get electricity. Just remember that making science also requires you to make Life (which involves Time, something that can only be unlocked after discovering 100 elements). [10] X Research source To make science : Earth + Sea = Primordial Soup Primordial Soup + Time = Life Clay + Life = Human Sand + Fire = Glass Glass + Planet = Telescope Human + Telescope = Science It’s easy enough to make electricity in Little Alchemy 2 —and in time, you’ll even be able to make things like Godzilla!"
