      "content": "Stand on a ruler and measure the length of the longest part of your foot. Place a ruler flat on the ground and put 1 foot on top of it, with your heel at the start of the ruler. Look at the number where the tip of your longest toe rests to find the length of your foot in inches or centimeters, depending on what system you use where you live. [1] X Research source If you live in the United States, measure in inches. If you live in Canada, the UK or Australia, measure in centimeters. For example, if your longest toe is the toe right next to your big toe, read the number right in front of that toe to find your precise foot length. You can also get your feet measured at a shoe store or in the shoe department of a department store."
