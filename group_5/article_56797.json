      "content": "Buy a thickening gel designed for acrylic paint. The best way to thicken acrylics without a risk of ruining your paint is with specialized thickening gel . Gels like these are designed to use with acrylic paint and shouldn’t affect the finish or color of your paint. [1] X Research source Find acrylic thickening gel at a hardware or arts and crafts store. There are thickening gels designed for other types of paint, make sure your gel is compatible with acrylic paint. This information should be printed on the label. Art expert Jeanine Hattas Wilson says acrylic gel will help paint “hold its structure” on the canvas, and make it “look impasto.” [2] X Expert Source Jeanine Hattas Wilson Professional Painter Expert Interview. 7 July 2021. Impasto is a painting technique in which paint is thickly added to a canvas with visible brush or knife strokes."

      "content": "Or, choose a textured gel to give your paint a rough, textured finish. A textured gel is a type of paste with sand, powder, or other similar ingredients mixed in to give the finished product a rough, coarse look. These gels can also make acrylic paint thicker, so choose this option if you’d like your painting to have a textured finish. [3] X Research source Some examples of textured gels are stucco , modeling paste , and resin gel . If you don’t know which type is best for your needs, ask an employee at the arts or hardware store."

      "content": "Spread out the paint on a palette or dish. Take the paint tube and squeeze out the amount of paint you plan on using. Then, spread it out with a palette knife so the gel will mix more easily. If you’re mixing colors , do this before adding any thickeners. [4] X Research source Add more paint later if you didn’t squeeze out enough."

      "title": "Mix the gel into the paint in a 1:4 ratio.",
      "content": "Mix the gel into the paint in a 1:4 ratio. Use your palette knife and scoop out some thickening or textured gel. Use no more than 1 part gel for every 4 parts of paint. Any more could make the paint unstable. Then, stir the mixture until it reaches a uniform consistency. You’re now ready to paint! [5] X Research source Add less gel if you want thinner paint. Just don’t exceed a 1:4 ratio. If you’ve never done this before, start with a small amount. Mix it into the paint and see if you like the consistency. Add more until the paint reaches the thickness you want. Use your paintbrush or a palette knife to mix water-based thickening gel in. If you’re using a textured gel, use a palette knife to mix it in. Remember that thickening gel usually makes paint dry faster, so start painting right away after adding it."

As the water starts boiling, the mixture should thicken. Stir more often at this point. When the mixture becomes a thick paste, it’s finished.

Mix it into the paint and see how it changes the consistency. To make the paint thicker, add more paste. Start painting when the paint reaches the consistency you want. [9] X Research source If you’ve never done this before, consider experimenting first to find the right consistency. Use a small amount of paint and add some paste. Then spread the paint on a canvas and see how it looks when it dries. Repeat this process until you find the mixture you like best."

Spread out your acrylic paint on a palette or dish and slowly mix in a bit of baking soda at a time until you reach your desired consistency. The more baking soda you add, the chalkier the paint will become. [10] X Research source Since baking soda adds texture to acrylic paint, this method will not work for any projects that require a smooth, glossy finish."

Simply pour out your paint and use your palette knife to mix in the sand a little bit at a time until you like the consistency. This will give the paint a grainy texture while still being easy to spread. [11] X Research source The type of sand you use will affect the final texture. Try different types of sand to see which you prefer."

If you mix too many grounds into the paint, it may become too coarse and hard to spread. Add a few at a time to find the right consistency and give your painting a fun, unique texture.
