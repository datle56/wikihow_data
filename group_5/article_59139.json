      "content": "Spray the tile with a targeted tile cleaner. A commercial bathroom or tile cleaner is often the easiest way to get rid of soap scum because it is formulated specifically to get rid of the stubborn residue. Apply a generous coat of the cleaner to the dirty tile according to the bottle’s instructions. [1] X Research source Tile or bathroom cleanser typically comes in two formulas: a liquid or foam spray. A liquid spray is effective on horizontal tile surfaces where you don’t have to worry about it dripping.The foam is often easier to use on tile walls because it stays in place without dripping off. Always read the instructions on a commercial tile or bathroom cleaner before using it on any tile. Before applying the cleaner all over the tile, test it in a small, inconspicuous area to ensure that it won’t damage the tile."

      "title": "Allow the cleaner to sit on the tile for several minutes.",
      "content": "Allow the cleaner to sit on the tile for several minutes. Once you apply the tile cleaner to your tiled surfaces, you must allow it to sit for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. That gives the cleaner time to cut through the soap scum and residue so you can easily remove it. [2] X Research source Some cleaners may need to be left on longer than 5 minutes. Consult the bottle’s instructions to determine the proper amount of time."

      "title": "Wet a sponge and wipe down the tile.",
      "content": "Wet a sponge and wipe down the tile. After the cleaner has sat on the tile for several minutes, run a sponge under warm water. Use it to carefully wipe down the tile and remove the soap scum and cleaner residue. [3] X Research source Make sure to use a non-abrasive sponge or you may scratch the tile. You can substitute a damp cloth for the sponge if you prefer. If there are areas of the tile where the soap scum is particularly stubborn, you may need to use a soft scrub brush to remove the residue. Be careful not to scrub too hard, though, or you may scratch the tile."

Spray the tile with the water to rinse the surface until it’s clean. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can wet a cloth with warm water and use it to rinse the tile."

      "content": "Measure equal parts of vinegar and dish soap. To make homemade soap scum cleaner, you’ll need equal parts of white vinegar and dish soap. You can make as little or as much of the cleaner as you’d like, so adjust the amounts accordingly to have 1 part of each. [6] X Research source If you want to make enough of the cleaner to use repeatedly, it’s best to measure between 1 and 2 cups (237 to 473 ml) of both the vinegar and dish detergent."

Heat it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until it is hot but not boiling. [7] X Research source Heating the vinegar makes it easier to blend it with the thick dish soap."

Add an equal amount of the dish soap, and secure the lid on the bottle. Shake it well to mix the two. [8] X Research source Test the spray after you’ve mixed it. If it’s too thick to spray, you can mix in a little bit of warm, distilled water to thin it out."

Allow the spray to sit on the tile for at least 30 minutes so it has time to cut through the soap scum.
