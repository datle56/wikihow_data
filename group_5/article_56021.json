      "title": "The first 50 views on your story are listed chronologically.",
      "content": "The first 50 views on your story are listed chronologically. Although Instagram does not confirm any detail about story viewer order, most users report that the first 50 views on their stories are listed chronologically. Those listed first viewed your story most recently, and so on and so forth. Although the chronology rumor seems to be true, some users report small differences in how their story viewers are ordered when checking views on different devices."
    },
    {
      "title": "After 50 views on your Instagram story, the algorithm takes over.",
      "content": "After 50 views on your Instagram story, the algorithm takes over. Instagram's algorithms are shrouded in mystery, so there is no definitive way to determine how your story viewers are ordered from this point forward. We can, however, make some educated guesses."
    },
    {
      "title": "You interact the most with the accounts listed first.",
      "content": "You interact the most with the accounts listed first. One possible explanation is that you engage with those users very often. Engagement could refer to liking, commenting, or reposting someone else's content. It could also include communicating with someone via direct message . If you see a name that you know you do not interact with often, there may be another explanation for being high on your list."
    },
    {
      "title": "The accounts listed first interact with you most often.",
      "content": "The accounts listed first interact with you most often. This is similar to the previous possibility, but can instead refer to users who are consistently liking and commenting on your content."
    },
    {
      "title": "The accounts listed first may also be your friends on Facebook.",
      "content": "The accounts listed first may also be your friends on Facebook. Because Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, many users have both accounts connected. If you have a friend on Facebook who also follows you on Instagram, they may be placed higher on your list of story viewers."
    },
    {
      "title": "People who like your story will automatically be placed at the top.",
      "content": "People who like your story will automatically be placed at the top. Anyone who likes your Instagram story will automatically shoot to the top of the list. Their placement here is independent of any of the aforementioned explanations. Instagram simply does this so you can quickly and conveniently see everyone who has liked your story."
    },
    {
      "title": "Accounts listed first are NOT your stalkers.",
      "content": "Accounts listed first are NOT your stalkers. There is a long-held rumor that the people placed first on your list of story viewers are your Instagram stalkers (i.e., people that often visit your account without interacting). While users can interact with an account often and then appear high on the viewer list, stalking an account will not land a user high on the list. This wikiHow article offers some alternative methods for finding your Instagram stalkers. There is another common rumor which contends that viewing a story several times will land a user high on the list of story viewers. The algorithm does not order viewers according to how many times they have interacted with a single story, but rather their overall engagement with an account over a longer period of time."

      "title": "Accounts you do not follow back appear at the bottom of your story viewers.",
      "content": "Accounts you do not follow back appear at the bottom of your story viewers. Even as the Instagram algorithm remains a mystery, the overall theme is that Instagram wants to prioritize people you are likely to engage with on the platform. Therefore, people you don't follow are last on the list. If a user frequently engages with your content despite you not following them back, they may slowly move up the algorithm's list of story viewers. If you see a name on your story viewer list and are unsure if they follow you or not, this wikiHow article can help you find out!"
