      "title": "Decide on the dimensions of your trap.",
      "content": "Decide on the dimensions of your trap. The size of the trap will vary depending on the fish you hope to catch and the waters you plan to trap them in. Minnows or pan fish for bait can be caught in a trap 12 inches (30.5 cm) by 24 inches (61.0 cm), while large catfish, carp and suckers require a much larger trap. You also want to be sure your trap is not taller than the depth of the water if you plan to use it in shallow areas."

      "title": "Choose a shape for your trap.",
      "content": "Choose a shape for your trap. Many are rectangular, with a 1:2:4 height, width, and length ratio, but cylindrical traps work well if there is not any current in the water to cause them to roll and become fouled."

      "title": "Select the material you will use to build the trap.",
      "content": "Select the material you will use to build the trap. In Alabama, where trapping catfish is a long-standing tradition, craftsmen build the finest traps using white oak strips, woven together with galvanized steel or copper wire. Because such traps require considerable skill and time, it’s easier to build a trap with a wire mesh fabric or poultry netting. The choice then, is the mesh size, determined by the size of fish you are trapping. For bait minnows, a hardware cloth in 1 ⁄ 4 or 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.6 or 1.3 cm) mesh is fine. For suckers or carp, poultry netting (chicken wire) is less expensive."

      "content": "Cut 12 pieces of lumber to build a box frame. You will need 4 pieces the length of your intended box, 4 pieces of your intended height and 4 of your intended width. For example, a trap that is 12 inches (30.5 cm) tall, 24 inches (61.0 cm) wide, and 48 inches (121.9 cm) long would require four 12 inches (30 cm) pieces of lumber, four 24 inch (61 cm) pieces and four 48 inch (120 cm) pieces. Larger or smaller traps would require the same amount of longer or shorter lumber pieces, respectively."

The larger funnel opening should be large enough to attach it to the slats of your box, tapering down to leave an opening facing the inside of the box that is just large enough for your target fish to swim into the trap, but not escape. [5] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source In this example, the larger side of the funnel could be a 12 by 24 inch (30 by 61 cm) oval, and the smaller end might have a diameter of only 5 inches (13 cm), varying based on the size of fish you hope to trap."

Anchor rope, available from outdoor sporting stores, will withstand its time underwater and is strong enough to withhold the weight of the trap and any fish inside. You will use the rope to pull your trap out of the water when you are ready to check it, so it should be at least 15 feet (4.6 m) long. [8] X Research source You could use twine rope in place of the anchor rope, but it isn’t as strong or durable."

      "content": "Check the trap periodically. Pull the trap in slowly when you decide to check it, keeping in mind you never know what will be inside it. At the least, check the trap daily to make sure no turtles, otters or other predators have discovered it and either damaged it or gotten trapped inside. If you’re using a crab ring, pull the trap in as quickly as possible so the crab aren’t able to escape. Situate yourself downstream of the current to make the trap easier to pull out of the water."
