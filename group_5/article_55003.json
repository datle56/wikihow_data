[1] X Research source Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet plays a huge role in the health of your hair, so making sure your body is getting all the hair-friendly vitamins and nutrients it needs can help to prevent white hairs. [2] X Research source Make sure you are eating plenty of lean protein (hair is made from protein), fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Drink plenty of water for hydration. More specifically, make sure you are getting enough of the vitamin B12 and the mineral zinc. If you don't feel you are getting enough in your diet naturally. Also make sure you are getting adequate amounts of vitamins A, C and E and of minerals like copper, iron and folic acid. Biotin (sometimes called vitamin H) is another important vitamin for healthy, naturally-colored hair. It is found in foods like cucumbers, oats and almonds. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid poor quality hair products. Poor quality hair products are full of chemicals such as sulfates, phosphates, chlorine and ammonia which dry out the hair and weaken the roots, making you more prone to white hairs. Therefore, you should stick to hair products with as many natural ingredients as possible. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Quit smoking . According to one study, smokers are four times as likely to have white or grey hairs as their non-smoking counterparts. Smoking also causes hair to look dull and brittle and make it more prone to falling out.

      "title": "Take Melancor.",
      "content": "Take Melancor. Melancor is a tablet-based product which rejuvenates natural hair color by stimulating the production of melanin in the hair follicles. It can help restore color to grey hair, and also prevent new grey hairs from forming. It needs to be taken once a day and has no common side effects. It can be purchased online. Note that there is no scientific evidence that Melancor works. You can try this supplement, but be aware of any side effects you may experience and understand that you may not get the results you hope for."

      "title": "Go for an all-over color.",
      "content": "Go for an all-over color. An all-over hair color will completely fill in any white hairs, making it a good option if your hair is more than 40% grey. You can opt for semi-permanent colors which last for a couple of weeks, or go for permanent colors which will stay until the hair grows out. If you're trying to match the hair dye to your natural color, it's probably a good idea to get your hair done professionally, as it's difficult to predict how home coloring kits will react with your hair. However, many people use the necessity of dyeing their hair as an opportunity to experiment with a new color. If you decide to dye your hair at home , avoid home coloring kits that contain ammonia, which can damage and dry out the hair. Be aware that going don this route will require a lot of maintenance, as you will need to reapply the color (or at least touch-up the roots) every time the hair grows out."

      "title": "Get highlights.",
      "content": "Get highlights. Highlights are another option for covering up white hairs. Rather than coloring the whole head of hair, select strands are bleached or dyed in order to add texture and life to the hair. Highlights can be very fine, adding subtle color and shine to to the hair, or they can be big and bold, adding variety and contrast. Highlights will need to done by a professional hair stylist and can be quite pricey. However, they tend to last a little longer than all-over hair dyes."

      "title": "Try henna.",
      "content": "Try henna. Henna is a form of natural hair dye. It contains no chemicals and will actually condition the hair, leaving it shiny and moisturized. Henna will produce a rich red color in your hair. The lighter your hair (or the more white hairs you have) the brighter the red color will be. Henna can be very messy - it comes in the form of a brick which needs to be melted down, or in a powder which needs to be mixed with lemon juice or tea or coffee. It has a mud-like texture and needs to sit in the hair for several hours while the color develops. One thing to be aware of is that chemical hair dyes cannot be applied to henna-treated hair, so make the decision to use henna on your hair with care, as you will be stuck with it for a while!"

      "title": "Experiment with more temporary solutions.",
      "content": "Experiment with more temporary solutions. If you're not ready to commit to dyeing your hair just yet, there are other, more temporary solutions to covering up your white hairs. Use hair mascara. This is exactly what it sounds like - mascara for your hair! It's great for covering up individual grey strands around the temples and hairline. It will last until the next time you shampoo your hair. Use coffee to temporarily conceal white and grey hair. If you have light brown to medium hair, you can get a 1 shade darker depending on how dark of the coffee you use. Use beetroot to naturally color or stain your hair temporarily. The best way is to juice whole beets in a juicer or blender. Use a root concealer. A root concealer works like a dry shampoo - it comes in aerosol form and can be spritzed on any grey hairs near the roots, where it will adjust to your natural hair color. It will rinse out with your next shampoo. Use color depositing shampoos and conditioners. Color-depositing shampoos and conditioners help to blend away white hairs by imparting them with a color similar to your natural shade. After one wash with the color-depositing shampoo and conditioner, the color should last through the next three washes. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use natural hair rinses.",
      "content": "Use natural hair rinses. There are many home remedies out there which involve rinsing the hair with a blend of different liquids, which can potentially add color. Whether any of these methods actually work or not is up for debate, but they're worth a try! Rosemary and Sage: Boil half a cup of rosemary and half a cup of sage in a large pot of water for about 30 minutes. Strain the herbs out, then leave the water to cool. Once cool, pour the water over your hair and scalp and leave your hair to dry naturally, then wash out using natural shampoo. Repeat once a week. [7] X Research source Gooseberries: Boil a number of Indian gooseberries (known as amla) in some coconut oil until they turn black. Allow the mixture to cool slightly then apply to the hair and scalp, massaging in with the fingers. Leave for 30 minutes, then rinse out. Black walnut: Crack open some black walnuts and add the fruit to a pot of water. Boil for 15 minutes, then allow to cool. Remove the walnuts from the water, then rinse your hair with it and allow hair to dry naturally before shampooing. Repeat twice a week."

      "content": "Embrace the grey. Instead of trying to cover up or get rid of your white hairs, consider embracing them! As long as you take good care of it, white hair can look rather chic. It will also save you a lot of time and money. [8] X Research source Maintain a modern cut. Many women (and men) associate white hair with looking old, but this is often because their haircuts are old-fashioned. Try getting a fresh, modern cut from a professional stylist -- something like a sharp bob or blunt bangs. This will help to keep your hair looking young. [9] X Research source Keep hair looking sleek. White and grey hair tends to get dried out and frizzy-looking, which can age you. Keep your hair looking sleek and hydrated by using moisturizing shampoos and conditioners, using oil-based hair treatments (such as argan or coconut oil) and by using a flat iron to smooth down any flyaway hairs."

      "content": "Know that white hairs are mainly due to genetics. Although most people typically associate white hair with getting older, there is no specific age at which people are \"supposed\" to go grey. [10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Some people spot their first white hairs in their teens, while others don't go grey until middle age. As the presence of white hair is mainly down to genetics, if your parents went grey at an early age, you probably will too. Race also plays a role. Most white people will start to see white hairs by the age of 35, Asians by the age of 40 and black people by their mid-forties."

      "content": "Understand that there is no proven link between stress and white hair. It's a common belief that white hairs are caused by stress, but there is no clear scientific proof for this theory. It's possible that stress can contribute to the production of free radicals that result in gray hair, or that it may prevent melanocytes (stem cells involved in creating new hair) from delivering pigment to your hair. While there is some limited evidence backing these possibilities, and while many doctors believe stress can hasten graying, this has not been proven conclusively. [11] X Research source Hair turns white when the color-producing cells in the hair root stop producing pigment, such as Melanin (which is what gives hair its color). Genetics may outline when and how this process happens in each person. It has also been suggested that a build up of hydrogen peroxide around the hair follicles can bleach color from the hair as a result of oxidative stress. However, stress has many other negative effects on your health (including possible hair loss) so reducing stress is still a good idea."

      "title": "Check for any potential underlying conditions.",
      "content": "Check for any potential underlying conditions. Sometimes when a person's hair turns white prematurely, it's the result of an underlying autoimmune or genetic condition. Some specific conditions that are sometimes linked with hair turning white include vitiligo (a thyroid disorder) and anemia. Problems with the pituitary gland can also be a factor. Therefore, if you're hair is turning white prematurely and you experience other symptoms attached to any of these conditions, you should see your doctor."
