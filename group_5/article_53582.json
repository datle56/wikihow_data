The water will start flowing. You've just created a siphon! [5] X Research source Water \"seeks its own level\", which is how this system works. The water pressure in the hot tub essentially pushes the water out the hose, because the open end of the hose is lower than the level of the water in the hot tub. Yes, the water has to go up and over the edge of the tub, but here's the neat part––because the hose was full of water, the water inside the hose creates suction at the end inside the tub, which pulls the water over the edge, and flows down the line."
