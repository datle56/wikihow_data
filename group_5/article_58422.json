      "content": "Set boundaries and a safe zone in the play area. As a group, decide the size of the play area, such as a gym, soccer field, basketball court, or playground, so players don’t spread out too far apart. Then, pick a safe zone where players can go to prevent themselves from being tagged. It could be a tree, a slide, a light post, or any other spot you all can agree on. Avoid playing anywhere that’s slippery or that could hurt you if you fall down. Decide on a time limit that a player can stay in the safe zone. You may choose that players can stay there for up to 10 seconds before they have to start running again."

      "title": "Start the game with a countdown.",
      "content": "Start the game with a countdown. Have all the players start in the same spot in the play area. The person who’s “it” stands still and counts down from 10 while the runners try to get away. When the countdown reaches 0, the game begins and the person who’s “it” can start moving. If you’re “it,” watch where all the other players are running so you can easily find and chase them when you finish counting. If you’re a runner, try to get as far away as possible from the person who’s “it.” If you’re able to, find a hiding spot behind a tree, bush, or piece of playground equipment so you’re harder to find."

      "title": "Chase and try to tag other players if you’re “it.”",
      "content": "Chase and try to tag other players if you’re “it.” While a player is “it,” it’s their goal to catch up to another person and touch them. Try to tag someone with a light touch on their shoulder, upper arm, or upper back. Save your energy by walking or jogging closer to the runners. When they start moving away, break into a sprint to chase them down. Try to play mind games with the other players by faking a sudden movement in one direction. When the runner tries to run in the opposite direction, quickly follow them and try to catch up. If you’re “it,” you cannot pretend to be a runner. If a player asks if you’re “it,” you have to tell them the truth."

      "content": "Avoid the person who’s “it” if you’re a runner. It’s the runner’s job to stay away from the person who’s “it” as best as they can. They may run away, climb playground equipment, or hide somewhere to stay safe. If you know the person who’s “it” is faster than you, try to put obstacles in between you. That way, they can’t chase you down as easily. Try pushing off of objects to get an extra boost of speed while you’re running away."

      "content": "Become “it” if you’re tagged. If a player gets tagged, they immediately become “it” and start chasing the others. The person who was originally “it” then becomes a runner and tries to avoid getting tagged. At the start of the game, you may make a rule so players can’t tag the person who tagged them. That way, a player doesn’t get stuck being “it” for the entire game."

For a quicker game of tag, leave the play area after you tag someone. The game ends when there’s only 1 person left in the play area. Alternatively, set a timer for 3–5 minutes and play until it goes off. In this version, the player who’s “it” loses the game."

The second time you’re touched, put your other hand on the new spot. Try to avoid getting touched a third time, or else you have to go out of bounds and do an activity you picked at the start of the game to go back in.

When a player is tagged, they freeze in place and stand still, but other unfrozen players can unfreeze them just by touching them.

The Lava Monster has to stay on the ground, but the other players can try to avoid them by climbing on a jungle gym or playground equipment. If the Lava Monster tags someone or if a player steps on the ground, they join the monster on the ground. The last person left on the jungle gym wins! [3] X Research source"

The other players are “Minnows” and line up on one end of the play area. When the Shark tells the Minnows to cross the ocean, the other players must run to the other end of the play area without getting tagged. If a player gets tagged, they become a Shark and try to tag players too. Alternatively, try Octopus Tag. The game plays exactly the same, except when a player is tagged, they have to freeze in place. They can still tag other players that get too close to them. [6] X Research source"

After a few seconds, the player who’s it turns on their flashlight and looks for the other players. If a player gets the flashlight shone on them, then they’ve been tagged and are out for the round. For even more fun, choose a place for tagged players to stand. Other players who haven’t been tagged yet can sneak up and touch the tagged player to free them again."

The person who’s “it” tries to tag the runner, but the runner has to link arms with any other person within 5 seconds. Once they do, the player on the other end of the link has to let go and becomes the new runner. When the person who’s “it” tags the runner, then they become the new runner. [8] X Research source Elbow tag requires about 20–30 people, so it’s best with a large group."
