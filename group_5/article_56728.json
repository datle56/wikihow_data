Complex carbs, including starches can help you lose weight because they make you feel fuller on fewer calories.

You might hear black-and-white advice to “cut carbs” in order to shed a few pounds, but the truth is that dedicating about 30% of your daily food intake to complex carbs can really help you stay trim—especially when those carbs are fiber, which is great for your digestion and cholesterol.

      "content": "Avoid white bread, cake, and cookies. We know, we know—what’s life without cake? Well, you can still have cake, but try to save it for special occasions. While complex carbs are great for your system, simple carbs can really bog down your metabolism, making it harder to lose weight. Plus, your body processes sugary simple carbs, like white bread and sweets, super fast. So that cookie might give you a helpful burst of energy, but it’s only temporary—and the calorie count usually isn’t worth it. Consider a paleo diet to make sure you’re prioritizing fats and proteins over simple carbs. You can still eat fruit, legumes, and tubers on the paleo diet, which ensures you’re getting plenty of complex carbs."

It’s easy to down a soda, sweet tea, or sugary fruit juice, forgetting that they’re high in simple carbs and calories. To stay healthy and slim down, opt for unsweetened tea, coffee, 100% fruit juice, diet soda, or bubbly water. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that while a can or 2 of diet soda a day is probably fine, some studies suggest diet soda may cause you to eat more sugar, possibly because imbibing a sweet (though sugarless) beverage may cause your brain to crave more sweets.

      "content": "Cut your calories by about 500. As an endomorph, you might have to work a little harder than ectomorphs and mesomorphs to control your caloric intake. Most people require about 2000 calories a day to maintain their weight, but if you want to lose weight, shoot for about 500 fewer calories a day—or around 1500. Any more than 500 calories a day isn’t really sustainable. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re a man, make sure you’re getting a minimum of 1500 calories a day, and if you’re a woman, get at least 1200. You don’t have to count every last calorie to lose weight; just try to cut back on certain high-calorie foods and eat your meals in smaller portions. However, keeping track of your calories can be useful in helping you lose weight. Try recording your daily caloric intake with a food tracker app like My Fitness Pal or Lifesum ."

Also, your may struggle with insulin sensitivity, which causes simple carbs to be converted to sugar more readily; this, plus you slower metabolism, may make it difficult to lose weight. The 3 different body types (or somatotypes ) were identified by psychologist William Sheldon in the 1940s, who discovered that genetics may affect whether we have a body type that is leaner, heavier, or somewhere in between. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The other 2 body types are ectomorphs and mesomorphs. Ectomorphs have a higher metabolism, meaning they can eat more without gaining much weight. Ectomorphs tend to have smaller body frames and joints. Mesomorphs have a medium-sized body frame—larger than an ectomorph but smaller than an endomorph. They usually have no problem gaining or losing weight."
