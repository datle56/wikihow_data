      "title": "Rest with your hips propped up on pillows.",
      "content": "Rest with your hips propped up on pillows. Elevating your groin will help to reduce swelling and promote blood flow, which may speed up your healing. Lie on your back in bed or on a sofa and place 1 to 2 pillows under your hips so that they are above the level of your heart. Stay in this position while you’re resting. [1] X Research source Getting plenty of rest when you’re experiencing groin pain is important. Avoid doing anything strenuous and take a day off from work or school if possible."

      "content": "Apply an ice pack to your groin for 10-20 minutes every 1 to 2 hours. Wrap the ice pack in a thin cloth or paper towel to provide a barrier between your skin and the ice pack. Then, place the pack on your groin. Hold it there for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Allow your skin to return to its normal temperature before applying the ice pack again, which takes about 1 to 2 hours. [2] X Research source Do this for the first 3 days of your recovery after an injury or until your swelling goes down. If you don’t have an ice pack, make your own by filling a resealable plastic bag with ice cubes or use a bag of frozen vegetables, such as peas or corn."

[6] X Research source Don’t use a heating pad while your injury is still fresh or swollen as this may cause swelling or make the swelling worse. Never use a heating pad while you’re asleep.
