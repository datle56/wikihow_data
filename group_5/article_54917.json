They will also not spawn when Darkbeard is summoned. Red Flower: Kingdom of Rose (next to the red building in the first area), Don Swan's Mansion (in a bush on the left), Green Zone (behind the Marine Lieutenant, behind a rock near Fajita), Factory (on the plateau nearest the bridge) The Red Flower spawns both day and night. If you are on a new or private server, however, the Red Flower won't spawn until the morning of the second day. Yellow Flower: Unlike the other flowers, the Yellow Flower is a potential drop when killing any enemy in the Second Sea. Swan Pirates are recommended because they group close together (which works great if you have the Buddha Fruit ) and are easy to defeat."
