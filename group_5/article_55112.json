This usually means a birth certificate, social security card, passport or other recognized form of photo ID, although many different ID forms are accepted. Providing identification proves that you are who you say you are and confirms that you meet the minimum age requirement to test for your permit. [5] X Research source In most states in the US, you have to be at least 15 years old to get a driving permit. Only a handful of states, including Alaska, Arkansas and North and South Dakota, issues permits to prospective drivers as young as 14.

You will also need 2 pieces of mail verifying your correct address."

The exact nature of the exam will vary, but you might be instructed to read letters of different sizes off a chart or identify gradually smaller shapes and details from a distance. The eye exam will let the DMV officials know that your eyesight is good enough for you to learn to operate a vehicle. [7] X Research source If you don't perform satisfactorily on your eye exam, you might have to get corrective eyewear like glasses or contact lenses. A note will be made on your permit that you have to be wearing this eyewear while driving."

If possible, spend some time with a parent or other licensed driver going over the different parts of the car inside and out. They'll be able to explain how the car works and what each component does, including important features that you'll be tested on, like the headlights, turn signals, parking brake, and windshield wipers. Studying the workings of a vehicle yourself will give you some practical, firsthand knowledge that will be useful when it comes time to take your test.

[11] X Research source You will get an opportunity to practice hands-on skills like handling and parking in driver's ed. In some cases, passing a comprehensive exam at the end of a driver's ed course can stand in for the theory test given at the DMV.

Stay relaxed and don't let yourself get too nervous. Remember everything you learned and give it your best shot. Try to answer each question correctly. For the most part, testing is done on computers these days, but it might still be wise to bring a number 2 pencil and/or black ink pen. Get plenty of sleep the night before and eat a hearty breakfast the morning of the test. You'll feel more alert and ready to go. [14] X Research source"

You can retake the driving permit test as many times as you need. [15] X Research source You may not be able to retake your test on the same day. Try to schedule a new date within the week so you don't forget what you've learned in the meantime. Do your best to pass the test the first time.

In addition to passing a written exam, some states require new drivers to record the number of hours they've spent driving under the supervision of another licensed driver. If this is a requirement in your state, you can get started right away after your permit arrives. Try to drive a few hours a week at least to gain experience. In most places, you'll have to keep your permit for six months to a year before you can test for your driver's license, so you'll have plenty of time to practice. [17] X Research source Beginner drivers are often expected to meet a minimum number of road hours that must be completed before they can test for their driver's license. A certain amount of driving hours may have to be logged at night. The number of mandatory driving hours varies from state to state. Kansas, for example, only requires you to log 25 hours behind the wheel after receiving your permit, whereas in Delaware it is a minimum of 50 hours. [18] X Research source [19] X Research source"

[20] X Research source In some states, like New York, driving permits are valid for up to 5 years, while in other states they may expire after as little as 1 year. You will usually have to hold your permit for 6 months or longer before you're eligible to receive a driver's license."

Additionally, the laws in your state may limit some privileges, like driving at night or with unlicensed individuals in the vehicle.
