      "content": "You’re going in the wrong direction. If you experience ringing in your left ear, it could be a nudge from your guardian angels or from the universe that you’re not moving along the right trajectory, or that you’re out of control of your life. Practice listening to your intuition to see which path you should take. [1] X Research source While the right ear is usually a sign of positive tidings or encouragement, ringing in the left ear usually signifies something is spiritually amiss and needs your attention. Your angels may be encouraging you to pause, meditate more often , and carefully consider the life you’ve chosen: is it really what you want? You might experience ear ringing if you’ve recently been met with a major decision, like a job offer. The universe could be trying to warn you to think carefully before making your choice. Ear ringing can be compared to knocking on the door, telling you to be mindful and aware, because your guides might have a message coming for you."

      "title": "Your spiritual energy is out of balance.",
      "content": "Your spiritual energy is out of balance. A ringing in the left ear may mean negative energy is nearby. This imbalance may be caused by the energies of the people around you, or the energies of particular objects or environments. The lower the energy, the more serious the situation, but don’t worry: the universe is warning you because it cares about you and wants to help you raise your vibration. [2] X Research source Consider the people and environments you devote your time to and how you might change your situation to make your energy more positive. This might mean a change of jobs, evaluating your current friendships to see if they're as healthy as they should be, or even simply decluttering your home to revitalize your domestic energy. Sometimes ear ringing just signifies being in a highly energetic place. If you are sensitive to energies, you can experience it when you are surrounded with a lot of energy coming from people or even devices."

      "content": "Someone is talking about you behind your back. While ringing in your right ear may signify someone is thinking or talking positively about you, ringing in your left ear may mean someone is talking negatively about you. This may be a sign from your guardian angels that you put too much stock in what others say about you, or that you need to be a little more careful with what you share with others. [3] X Research source Consider the people you open yourself up to. Vulnerability is a strength, but it’s wise to be cautious about who you share your secrets with as they may not be trustworthy. Ear ringing may be a sign to let go of the pressure to be perceived a certain way . Negative or positive, other people will think what they’re going to think. All you can control is yourself."

      "title": "You’re about to experience a spiritual awakening.",
      "content": "You’re about to experience a spiritual awakening. If your ear rings while meditating , it could mean your chakras are opening —especially if the ringing is high-pitched. High-pitched ringing in the left ear may indicate that a time of spiritual turmoil is coming to an end, and you just need to be patient. [4] X Research source You may experience your third eye opening wider in conjunction with your ear ringing. Your third eye provides access to a higher state of consciousness: the further along your spiritual journey you move, the wider your third eye will open."

      "content": "Buzzing indicates spiritual awareness. If the \"ringing\" in your ear is really more of a white noise sound, it's a sign that the pathways between you and the universe are opening. While you might notice the noise at first, it'll gradually fade to peaceful background noise the more you develop your intuition. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "A high-pitched ring indicates spiritual growth. As your third eye opens and your vibration level rises, the ringing you experience in your ear may be high-pitched. This is a sign you're experiencing powerful metaphysical growth and that good fortune is headed your way. [7] X Research source The sound may be one high pitch, or it may increase in pitch as you hear it. It'll sound joyful, like a celebration."

      "content": "Low-pitched ringing indicates spiritual stress. If you experience a low-pitched sound in your ear, this could be a sign your spiritual health is waning. Don't worry if this is the case: just take steps to try to raise your vibration level. [8] X Research source You can raise your vibration level by meditating and by simply being intentional about the energies you surround yourself with: what serves you? What depletes or damages your energy?"

      "content": "The ear is a symbol of growth and eternity. In many cultures, the sacred spiral is a symbol of evolution and time. That spiral is represented in the body in the inner ear, or cochlear spiral, which looks similar to a nautilus shell. For this reason, the ear is regarded in many spiritual circles as a symbol of spiritual knowledge and growth. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "“Clairaudience\" is the ability to pick up spiritual messages via the ear. While most people experience tinnitus at some point in their lives, it is considered rare to be able to channel spiritual messages through ear ringing. People who receive omens or messages from the universe or from guardian angels via ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking, or humming in the ear may be particularly spiritually gifted. [10] X Research source You may have heard the term “clairvoyance,” which refers to the psychic ability to see spirits. “Clairaudience” is the same thing—except that instead of seeing spirits, you hear their messages."

Don’t be alarmed if your left ear is ringing: just take it as a friendly warning to be spiritually cautious in the coming days, or as a reminder to get in touch with your spiritual side more often.

      "content": "The medical term for ear-ringing is called tinnitus. Tinnitus may be caused by a number of different conditions, including hearing loss, an ear injury or a problem with the circulatory system, or simply a buildup of earwax or a foreign object lodged in your ear. The sound may persist for a while or come and go, and it’s not caused by an external sound, meaning nobody else will be able to hear it. Many people aren’t bothered by tinnitus, and tinnitus in itself isn’t cause for concern unless it disrupts your daily life. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might experience tinnitus as a high-pitched ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking, or humming in one or both ears. Tinnitus affects 15% to 20% of the population and is common in older adults. [13] X Research source Rarely, tinnitus could be a sign of an ear tumor. Most ear tumors are benign, but if you experience any neurological issues in conjunction with tinnitus, see a doctor immediately.
