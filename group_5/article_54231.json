      "title": "You’re interested in having a romantic relationship.",
      "content": "You’re interested in having a romantic relationship. The most common meaning of the phrase “I have feelings for you” is to express your romantic interest in someone . Phrased another way, you could say, “I like you and would like to date” or “I’m interested in being more than friends.” [1] X Research source Sometimes, you may say this to someone with whom you’ve previously had a “friends with benefits” relationship. While your relationship may have solely revolved around sex previously, you may have grown a romantic attachment to them that you want to explore through dating."

    {
      "title": "Your friendship has blossomed into love.",
      "content": "Your friendship has blossomed into love. You may have had a platonic friendship with someone and have now realized that your feelings are stronger. The words “I have feelings for you” indicate a growing emotional attachment to someone that may include sexual or romantic feelings versus your previous friendly feelings. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "You have strong platonic feelings for someone.",
      "content": "You have strong platonic feelings for someone. Sometimes, friendships and other platonic relationships may feel so tender and fulfilling, even in the absence of romantic love. You wouldn’t tell this person that you’re in love with them or turned on by them. [3] X Research source However, you may use the phrase “I have feelings for you” to express your deep liking and connection to this person. Be wary of this usage of the phrase, as most people will interpret “I have feelings for you” as a romantic confession."

    {
      "title": "You have to get your feelings off your chest.",
      "content": "You have to get your feelings off your chest. You may be completely convinced that your feelings won’t be returned, but you feel like you have to confess them anyway. Having an intense level of romantic feelings for someone and keeping them secret can feel like an emotional weight. [4] X Research source So, you may decide to tell the object of your desires that you have feelings for them, even if you know that the relationship is a nonstarter. For example, maybe this person is happily married to your best friend, lives in another country, or isn’t in the same age group as you. You may be hoping that expressing your feelings will help you get closure , and hopefully, it will!"

    {
      "title": "You’re not ready to say “I love you.”",
      "content": "You’re not ready to say “I love you.” Sometimes, “I have feelings for you” is used as a stepping stone to “I love you.” You may use this phrase when you’re first feeling the sensation of falling in love with someone but you’re not ready to say “I love you” yet. [5] X Research source Or, you may know that you are in love with someone but are scared that they won’t say it back. Often, male-identifying individuals are socialized to be more guarded with their emotions. They may be more likely to express their love for someone at the start of a relationship with “I have feelings for you” rather than “I love you.”"

    {
      "title": "You’re trying to let someone down gently.",
      "content": "You’re trying to let someone down gently. Perhaps someone has expressed their romantic feelings for you, either by telling you they have feelings for you or expressing a direct “I love you.” But…you don’t feel the same way. You may try to ease this person’s sense of rejection by saying, “I have feelings for you, too,” or “I care for you, too,” followed by a “but” and an explanation of why you can’t return their affection at this time. Alternatively, you may use this phrase to kindly break up with your committed partner (well, as kindly as possible). If you’re ending a relationship with someone you still love , you may say something like, “I still have feelings for you, but I feel like our communication has broken down and we can’t fix it.” Or, “I still have feelings for you, but it’s a dealbreaker for me that you don’t want to have children. I respect your decision, but having a family is really important to me.”"

    {
      "title": "You’re trying to scare someone off.",
      "content": "You’re trying to scare someone off. If someone is interested in you on a physical level but you know they don’t want more, you might tell them that you have feelings for them. If this person has commitment issues or an avoidant attachment style, this faux admittance may make them run in the opposite direction. [6] X Research source Whenever possible, it’s always better to directly communicate with someone that you’re romantically or sexually involved with. Rather than trying to scare them off, express that you feel ready for a more committed relationship or that your feelings for them have lessened and you want to break things off."
    },
    {
      "title": "You’re trying to manipulate the other person.",
      "content": "You’re trying to manipulate the other person. Sometimes, the phrase “I have feelings for you” can be used in a manipulative way, whether intentional or not. For example, maybe you’re in a situationship with someone and aren’t ready to commit, but you also don’t want to lose this person. You may tell that person you have feelings for them, even if you don’t. [7] X Research source While relationships and emotions are a complicated thing, avoid knowingly manipulating someone or leading them on when you know you don’t have deeper feelings for them. Other people may use the phrase “I have feelings for you” as a way to get someone to have sex with them. Whether purposeful or not, the line between love and lust can get blurred. Someone may claim to have feelings for a person when they’re really just trying to flatter that person into a sexual relationship."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I have feelings for you, too!”",
      "content": "“I have feelings for you, too!” In an ideal world, you’ll reciprocate the feelings of someone who’s interested in you. If that’s the case, yay! Let that person know that you feel the same way, and they’ll likely feel a huge sense of relief and joy. Then, you can talk about the next steps for dating and building a relationship together!"
    },
    {
      "title": "“Thank you! It’s nice to hear that.”",
      "content": "“Thank you! It’s nice to hear that.” This simple acknowledgment is often the best way to respond to someone’s initial statement of attraction. You’re both acknowledging this person’s feelings and expressing appreciation that they decided to share them with you. [8] X Research source This phrase is especially useful when you need a moment to work through your thoughts before responding."

    {
      "title": "“I like you too, but I need some time to think about this.”",
      "content": "“I like you too, but I need some time to think about this.” If someone says they have feelings for you and you’re unsure how you feel, it’s okay to communicate that directly and honestly. You can ask them for an hour, day, or even a week to assess your feelings and get back to them. [9] X Research source Alternatively, if you don’t want to tell this person that you like them, you can say, “I’m not sure how to respond right now. Can we talk more later?”"

    {
      "title": "“I’m flattered, but I don’t feel the same way.”",
      "content": "“I’m flattered, but I don’t feel the same way.” This response lets the person know that you appreciate them expressing their feelings. However, you’re also being clear and direct in your feelings (or lack thereof), which is the kindest way to let someone down. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I think you’re great, but I don’t want to risk our friendship.”",
      "content": "“I think you’re great, but I don’t want to risk our friendship.” If a friend has expressed their feelings for you, that can be a really tricky situation. If you don’t want to lose their friendship but you also know you don’t feel the same way, the best option is to acknowledge their feelings while also being clear about your own. [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "“I appreciate you telling me, but I’m not ready for a relationship.”",
      "content": "“I appreciate you telling me, but I’m not ready for a relationship.” While you don’t need to offer a concrete reason that you’re not interested in someone, it may help if your reason will alleviate their feelings of rejection. [12] X Research source For example, if you’re just not interested in a relationship at the moment, it may make the rejection feel less personal. Similarly, if you’re letting someone down because you’re already in a relationship, you could say, “I’m sorry, but I’m already seeing someone.”"

      "title": "To “feel for (someone)” means to have sympathy for that person.",
      "content": "To “feel for (someone)” means to have sympathy for that person. You may use this sentence to express sadness for a person who is suffering. For example: [13] X Research source “I know what it’s like to be lonely, so I feel for her .” “He was crying on the phone all morning. I really feel for him .” “You have to feel for the innocent people who had to live through it all.”"

      "title": "Saying “I feel you” means “I understand” or “I agree with you.”",
      "content": "Saying “I feel you” means “I understand” or “I agree with you.” This phrase is typically used to indicate that you agree with a feeling or thought that someone else has just expressed. “I feel you” is typically used as a slang expression, as seen in the below examples: Speaker A: “I hate Mondays.” Speaker B: “I feel you.” ‘He was nodding his head as if to say ‘I feel you.’”"

      "title": "To “have a feel for (__)” means having a natural understanding or ability.",
      "content": "To “have a feel for (__)” means having a natural understanding or ability. You might use this “feel” idiom to express that you have a knack for something. You may also use it to express a desire to get to know something better or improve on a certain skill. For example: [14] X Research source “I tried to learn the banjo, but I never had much of a feel for it.” “She went out for a walk to have a better feel for the neighborhood. “My kids have a real feel for languages, and I'm not sure why because my husband and I sure don't.”"
