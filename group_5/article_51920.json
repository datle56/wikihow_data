      "content": "AI detection tools evaluate how predictable the text is. ChatGPT, Bard, and similar chatbots \"write\" content by predicting the next word or sentence based on its training data. Similarly, AI detection tools also work by detecting how predictable the words, sentences, and format are based on similar training data. The detection tool compares a piece of writing to similar content, decides how predictable the text is, and labels the text as either human or AI-generated. These tools also look for other indicators, or \"signatures\" that are associated with AI-generated text, such as word choice and patterns. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "AI detectors often make mistakes. ChatGPT detection tools can be helpful, but they aren't infallible. AI detectors often produce false positive results, meaning that they tend to flag human-written text as AI-generated if it follows certain patterns. [3] X Research source It's also quite easy for students and other writers to modify content written by ChatGPT to make it virtually undetectable by AI detectors, meaning that AI-generated writing could fly under the radar of the detector. If an AI detection tool reports that a piece of writing was mostly AI-generated, don't rely on that report alone. It's best to only use AI detection tools if you've already found other signs that the writing was written by ChatGPT. [4] X Research source Running a piece of writing through multiple AI detection tools can help you get an idea of how different tools work. It can also help you narrow down false-negatives and false-positives."

[9] X Research source While students and job applicants can also include inaccuracies in their writing, AI bots make false information seem extremely believable. ChatGPT also has limited knowledge of events that occurred after 2021, which means it usually can't produce factual information about current events. [10] X Research source If the writing seems very well-written but contains false information, it could be AI generated. If you're evaluating a piece of writing for potential AI use, try searching the web for a few facts from the text. Try to search for facts that are easy to verify—e.g., dates and specific events."

      "content": "Some sentences look right, but don't actually make sense. ChatGPT can create grammatically perfect sentences that don't make sense, even though they look great on the surface. This is because ChatGPT doesn't know whether something is true or false—it only knows how to use the right kind of word in the right place. If you find yourself rereading something that looks like it should make sense, but you can't grasp what the sentence is trying to say, there's a good chance you're looking at AI-generated writing."

      "content": "Ask ChatGPT to produce a similar piece of writing when in doubt. If you think ChatGPT wrote an essay, letter, or other bit of text, log in to ChatGPT and ask the chatbot to create similar content using the writing's main points. If ChatGPT's response contains the same structure as the piece of content you're evaluating, it's possible the writer used ChatGPT. For example, if you're evaluating a cover letter for AI use, you might tell ChatGPT, \"Write me a cover letter for a junior developer position at Company X. Explain that I graduated from Rutgers with a Computer Science degree, love JavaScript and Ruby, and have been working as a barista for the past year.\" Because ChatGPT is conversational, you can continue providing more context. For example, \"add something to the cover letter about not jumping right into the industry after college because of the pandemic.\""
